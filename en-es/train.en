Thank you so much, Chris. 
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. 
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. 
And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. 
(Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. 
(Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. 
(Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane! 
(Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. 
(Laughter) It's a true story -- every bit of this is true. 
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. 
Driving ourselves. 
(Laughter) I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. 
There was no motorcade back there. 
(Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain? 
(Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. 
(Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. 
We were on I-40. 
We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. 
We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. 
Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. 
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. 
(Laughter) She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. 
And she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper." 
And the man said, "He's come down a long way, hasn't he?" 
(Laughter) (Applause) There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. 
(Laughter) The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. 
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. 
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. 
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. 
I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. 
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. 
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, "Call Washington! Call Washington!" 
And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? 
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. 
(Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. 
It was printed in Monterey, I checked. 
(Laughter) And the story began, "Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" -- (Laughter) "'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!" 
(Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, "Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!" 
(Laughter) We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. 
(Laughter) I was going to talk about information ecology. 
But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: It's a deal! 
(Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? 
I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. 
Now, the slide show. 
I update the slide show every time I give it. 
I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. 
It's like beach-combing, you know? 
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. 
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. 
This is just for the United States of America. 
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. 
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. 
But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. 
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. 
First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. 
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. 
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit. 
The sign is wrong. 
It's not negative; it's positive. 
These are investments that pay for themselves. 
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. 
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. 
It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. 
Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. 
And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. 
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. 
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. 
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. 
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. 
Not quite there yet. 
OK. Now, what can you do? 
Reduce emissions in your home. 
Most of these expenditures are also profitable. 
Insulation, better design. 
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. 
Use light rail. 
Figure out some of the other options that are much better. 
It's important. 
Be a green consumer. 
You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. 
Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. 
Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. 
It is easier than you think. 
It really is. 
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. 
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. 
And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. 
There is a carbon calculator. 
Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. 
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. 
And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets. 
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. 
Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. 
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. 
Invest sustainably. 
Majora mentioned this. 
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. 
Over time, people do what you pay them to do. 
And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. 
A lot more to be said about that. 
Become a catalyst of change. 
Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. 
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. 
And it comes out in May. 
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. 
Consider sending somebody to Nashville. 
Pick well. 
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. 
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. 
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. 
(Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? 
We need Republicans as well. 
This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. 
Become politically active. 
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. 
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it. 
Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. 
Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? 
Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. 
The market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. 
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. 
We have to change the minds of the American people. 
Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. 
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. 
It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. 
We have to buy a lot of those ads. 
Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. 
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse," but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. 
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. 
(Laughter) That's really true. 
Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan. 
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. 
This is an opportunity. 
Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. 
We are one. 
Thank you very much, I appreciate it. 
(Applause) 

With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. 
And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us. And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. 
So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people, and practice preventive medicine on a global scale. 
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country, but also worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. 
It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans. 
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. 
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year. 
Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable. 
Now these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're kind of devolving. (Laughter) Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. 
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. 
So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business. 
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. 
And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you. 

I have a doppelganger. 
(Laughter) Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga." 
If you look very carefully, you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light. 
That's exactly what I do -- optical mind control. 
(Laughter) But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination, my motives are not sinister. 
I control the brain in order to understand how it works. 
Now wait a minute, you may say, how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first? 
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse? 
Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis. 
They say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons, we would understand the brain." 
But think for a moment what that means. 
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times, we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns, and that's so difficult, chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. 
Take a look at what brain activity might look like. 
In this simulation, each black dot is one nerve cell. 
The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. 
There's 10,000 neurons here. 
So you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. 
Your brains are about 100 million times more complicated. 
Somewhere, in a pattern like this, is you, your perceptions, your emotions, your memories, your plans for the future. 
But we don't know where, since we don't know how to read the pattern. 
We don't understand the code used by the brain. 
To make progress, we need to break the code. 
But how? 
An experienced code-breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean, it's essential to be able to play with them, to rearrange them at will. 
So in this situation too, to decode the information contained in patterns like this, watching alone won't do. 
We need to rearrange the pattern. 
In other words, instead of recording the activity of neurons, we need to control it. 
It's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some. 
The more targeted our interventions, the better. 
And I'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision. 
And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose, I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries. 
But we'll certainly learn a lot. 
Now, I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. 
The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. 
It dates back at least 200 years, to Galvani's famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond. 
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. 
This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental, nugget of the neural code: that information is written in the form of electrical impulses. 
Galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today, despite a number of drawbacks. 
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. 
It's hard to do in animals that run around, and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously. 
So around the turn of the last century, I started to think, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down?" 
So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain, re-engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. 
Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light, overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. 
First, it's clearly a non-invasive, wireless form of communication. 
And second, just as in a radio broadcast, you can communicate with many receivers at once. 
You don't need to know where these receivers are, and it doesn't matter if these receivers move -- just think of the stereo in your car. 
It gets even better, for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in DNA. 
So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function. 
I hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept. 
There's no high-tech gizmos here, just biology revealed through biology. 
Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close. 
As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons, we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores. 
Pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system. 
But these pores here are special. 
They are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes. 
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor, the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on, and the neuron fires electrical impulses. 
Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA, we can achieve incredible precision. 
This is because, although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes, different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells. 
You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don't. 
So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore. 
The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. 
In this example, each electrical impulse, each deflection on the trace, is caused by a brief pulse of light. 
And the approach, of course, also works in moving, behaving animals. 
This is the first ever such experiment, sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's. 
It was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student, Susana Lima. 
Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain expressed the light-activated pore. 
You're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly. 
They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position. 
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect. 
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them, but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates. 
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see, Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. 
She cut the heads off of her flies. 
These headless bodies can live for about a day, but they don't do much. 
They just stand around and groom excessively. 
So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity. 
(Laughter) Anyway, as you'll see in a moment, Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away. 
They didn't get very far, obviously. 
Since we took these first steps, the field of optogenetics has exploded. 
And there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches. 
And we've come a long way since Galvani's and Susana's first successes in making animals twitch or jump. 
We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways, as I'll show you in my last example, which is directed at a familiar question. 
Life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next. 
We cope with this pressure by having brains, and within our brains, decision-making centers that I've called here the "Actor." 
The Actor implements a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we operate. 
Our actions change the environment, or context, and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop. 
Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model, we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject, fruit flies. 
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly. 
The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors, and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them. 
Here's some such CCTV footage. 
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet, it has to make a decision. 
It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor, or whether to cross the midline and try something new. 
These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor's policy. 
Now for an intelligent being like our fly, this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience. 
We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly's brain contains not only an Actor, but a different group of cells, a "Critic," that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices. 
You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church, if you're an Austrian like me, or the super-ego, if you're Freudian, or your mother, if you're Jewish. 
(Laughter) Now obviously, the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent. 
So we set out to identify the cells in the fly's brain that played the role of the Critic. 
And the logic of our experiment was simple. 
We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic, we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor into changing its policy. 
In other words, the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but, in reality, it had not made. 
So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable. 
And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices. 
And whenever they made one of the two choices, chose one odor, in this case the blue one over the orange one, we switched on the lights. 
If the Critic was among the optically activated cells, the result of this intervention should be a change in policy. 
The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. 
Here's what happened in two instances: We're comparing two strains of flies, each of them having about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains, shown here in green on the left and on the right. 
What's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. 
But the identities of the individual dopamine-producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right. 
Optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences. 
If you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right, you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet, it marches straight through, as it did before. 
Its behavior is completely unchanged. 
But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different. 
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint, it pauses, it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment, and then it turns around. 
This means that the policy that the Actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber. 
This means that the Critic must have spoken in that animal, and that the Critic must be contained among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left, but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right. 
Through many such experiments, we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just 12 cells. 
These 12 cells, as shown here in green, send the output to a brain structure called the "mushroom body," which is shown here in gray. 
We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. 
So this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice. 
Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies, this makes perfect sense. 
In fact, it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly. 
In this electronic toy circuit, the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue LEDs in the center of the board. 
These LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. 
Each odor activates a different combination of sensors, which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body. 
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly, the Actor, can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. 
What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy, which is stored in the strengths of the connection, between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions. 
If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course. 
If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn. 
Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off, the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped. 
In a situation like this, we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy. 
We have created such a situation, artificially, by turning on the critic with a flash of light. 
That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. 
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again, the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver. 
I don't know about you, but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind, even if it's the mind of the fly. 
This is one piece of good news. 
The other piece of good news, for a scientist at least, is that much remains to be discovered. 
In the experiments I told you about, we have lifted the identity of the Critic, but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job. 
Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong without a teacher, or your mother, telling you, is a very hard problem. 
There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done, but we still haven't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter. 
I think we'll get there in the not too distant future. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Well, there's lots to talk about, but I think I'm just going to play to start off. 
(Music) ♫ When I wake up ♫ ♫ in the morning ♫ ♫ I pour the coffee ♫ ♫ I read the paper ♫ ♫ And then I slowly ♫ ♫ and so softly ♫ ♫ do the dishes ♫ ♫ So feed the fishes ♫ ♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫ ♫ Like it's gonna be ♫ ♫ your last day ♫ ♫ here on Earth ♫ (Applause) All right. 
So, I wanted to do something special today. 
I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. 
And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half-finished. 
(Laughter) I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it. 
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. 
And so this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here. 
They're feedback loops. 
And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. 
And I'm going to demonstrate for you. 
(Laughter) I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry. 
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a -- (Feedback) All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate -- (Laughter) -- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction. 
And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms, from, say, the ecological, okay. 
There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly. 
So like, you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease, and inbreeding and incest and, let's see, what's the other one? 
Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host, or the person. 
And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song -- kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. 
Because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. 
And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. 
So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. 
And so, I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. 
And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. 
That's what it feels like to me. 
It's not pleasant. 
I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. 
(Laughter) It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves, but they seem to be trying. 
So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. 
Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it's just impossible. 
That's the thing. 
So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible. 
And that's what the song is asking. 
All right. 
It doesn't have a name yet. 
(Music) ♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫ ♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫ ♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫ ♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫ ♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫ ♫ You've done the impossible now ♫ ♫ Took yourself apart ♫ ♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫ ♫ No one can break your heart ♫ ♫ So you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you wring it out ♫ ♫ And you wear it out ♫ ♫ And you break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫ ♫ Breaking your own ♫ (Applause) Thanks. 
(Applause) All right. 
It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder. 
You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. 
But, you know, I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now, just a little bit. 
(Applause) I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called "Weather Systems." 
(Music) ♫ Quiet ♫ ♫ Quiet down, she said ♫ ♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫ ♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫ ♫ I can see your ♫ ♫ cells grow ♫ ♫ Hold still awhile ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ ♫ Some things you say ♫ ♫ are not for sale ♫ ♫ I would hold it where ♫ ♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫ ♫ scared ♫ ♫ Hold still a while ♫ ♫ Don't spill the wine ♫ ♫ I can see it all from here ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ oh, I ♫ ♫ I can see ♫ ♫ weather systems of the world ♫ ♫ Weather systems ♫ ♫ of the world ♫ Thanks. 
(Applause) 

So this is a story of a place that I now call home. 
It's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both. 
So this is Bertie County, North Carolina, USA. 
To give you an idea of the "where:" So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in, Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state. 
It's about two hours east driving-time from Raleigh. 
And it's very flat. It's very swampy. 
It's mostly farmland. 
The entire county is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed. 
So there's only 27 people per square mile, which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer. 
Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America. 
We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders. 
We know the symptoms. 
It's the hollowing out of small towns. 
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns. 
The brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back. 
It's the dependence on farm subsidies and under-performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban. 
And Bertie County is no exception to this. 
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with, like many communities similar to it, is that there's no shared, collective investment in the future of rural communities. 
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now benefits rural communities, and yet 20 percent of our population lives there. 
So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor. 
It is the poorest county in the state. 
It has one in three of its children living in poverty, and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto." 
The economy is mostly agricultural. 
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco, and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut. 
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. 
The county seat is Windsor. 
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now. 
It's home to only 2,000 people, and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years. 
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use. 
You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand -- Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite. 
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop, there's no Internet cafe, there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore. 
There isn't even a Walmart. 
Racially, the county is about 60 percent African-American, but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy. 
So the public school students are about 86 percent African-American. 
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class, and you can see the difference is pretty stark. 
So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement. 
There's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from, and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher. 
So there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education. 
In fact, two years ago, only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders were passing the state standard in both English and math. 
So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place, but I promise there is good news. 
The biggest asset, in my opinion, one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man: This is Dr. Chip Zullinger, fondly known as Dr. Z. 
He was brought in in October 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system. 
And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston, South Carolina and then in Denver, Colorado. 
He started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '80s in the U.S. 
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary, and he is the reason that I now live and work there. 
So in February of 2009, Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design -- which is a non-profit design firm that I founded -- to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district. 
And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital. 
Specifically, we use these six design directives, probably the most important being number two: we design with, not for -- in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design, it's not about designing for clients anymore. 
It's about designing with people, and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within. 
So at the time of being invited down there, we were based in San Francisco, and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of 2009, spending about half our time in Bertie County. 
And when I say we, I mean Project H, but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller, who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder. 
So fast-forward to today, and we now live there. 
I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo, because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits. 
But this is our front porch. We live there. 
We now call this place home. 
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth, we realized we had fallen in love with the place. 
We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County, that, as designers and builders, you can't do everywhere. 
There's space to experiment and to weld and to test things. 
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger. 
There's a nobility of real, hands-on, dirt-under-your-fingernails work. 
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there, there is a huge need. 
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County. 
There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county. 
And so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool, something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have, and to be sort of the -- to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit. 
The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger -- that was why we were there. 
But beyond that, we recognized that Bertie County, as a community, was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking. 
So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education, but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development. 
So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education. 
And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County, but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond. 
So the first of the three is design for education. 
This is the most kind of direct, obvious intersection of the two things. 
It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students. 
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days. 
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways. 
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs. 
So traditionally, the computer labs, particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County, where they have to benchmark test every other week, the computer lab is a kill-and-drill testing facility. 
You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave. 
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology, to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging, more accessible, and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction. 
So this is the lab at the high school, and the principal there is in love with this room. 
Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them. 
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape. 
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid. 
So this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me. 
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. 
And then she'll call out a math problem -- so let's say four times four -- and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it. 
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. 
And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing. 
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores, a greater comfort level with the material, especially with the boys, that in going outside and playing, they aren't afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem -- and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material. 
So with design for education, I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers, so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them. 
So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent. 
He came out for one of our teacher-training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself. 
(Laughter) So the second approach is redesigning education itself. 
This is the most complex. 
It's a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom. 
So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change, which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside-the-box education systems in rural communities. 
So for us, this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie. 
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county. 
And this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system. 
Right now I should say, there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home Internet connection. 
And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint, which I find myself squatting outside of a lot. 
Aside from, you know, getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place, it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community. 
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development. 
So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer, and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day. 
And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about, which is where we are now, is: design as education. 
So "design as education" means that we could actually teach design within public schools, and not design-based learning -- not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket," but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose. 
It also means that designers are no longer consultants, but we're teachers, and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation. 
And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by. 
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face, it requires an active engagement, and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways. 
So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular -- historically, has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college. 
It's a vocational training path. 
It's working-class; it's blue-collar. 
The projects are things like, let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. 
And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely. 
So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class, but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed, and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process. 
So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class. 
And so this starts in four weeks, at the end of the summer, and my partner and I, Matthew and I, just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it. 
And this is what it looks like. 
So over the course of two semesters, the Fall and the Spring, the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4,500 square foot studio/shop space. 
And during that time, they're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding, coming back into the studio, doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work, and then moving into the shop and actually testing them, building them, prototyping them, figuring out if they are going to work and refining that. 
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job. 
They're paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community. 
So the first project, which will be built next summer, is an open-air farmers' market downtown, followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. 
So these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say, "I built that, and I'm proud of it." 
So I want you to meet three of our students. 
This is Ryan. 
She is 15 years old. 
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher. 
She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County, because that's where her family is from, where she calls home, and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in. 
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way. 
This is Eric. He plays for the football team. 
He is really into dirtbike racing, and he wants to be an architect. 
So for him, Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect, everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client. 
And then this is Anthony. 
He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands, and so for him, Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement. 
He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure, so if he ends up not going to college, he will have developed some industry-relevant skills. 
What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom. 
So this building downtown, which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market, is now the classroom. 
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment. 
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public -- that's the final exam. 
And for the community, what design and building offers is real, visible, built progress. 
It's one project per year, and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future. 
So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year, is a small story -- 13 students, it's two teachers, it's one project in one place. 
But we feel like this could work in other places. 
And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story, because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale. 
Because, when you zoom out that far, you lose the ability to view people as humans. 
Ultimately, design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers. 
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves. 
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter, we need to work outside of our comfort zones more, and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard. 
So while this is a very small story, we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war. 
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics, nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. 
Yet, not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago, but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict. 
Three things stand out: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. 
What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter, how they matter, and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways, that is, how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. 
But let's start at the beginning. 
Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now, and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat. 
For nearly two decades now, the news has been bad and the images have been haunting. 
In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008. 
This quickly escalated into a five-day war between Russia and Georgia, leaving Georgia ever more divided. 
In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people. 
In Sri Lanka, a decades-long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009, after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983. 
In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks, unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. 
Hundreds have been killed, and more than 100,000 displaced, including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan. 
In the Middle East, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated, and it becomes ever more difficult to see how, just how a possible, sustainable solution can be achieved. 
Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines, but the killing and displacement there continues as well, and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. 
And in Iraq, finally, violence is on the rise again, and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections. 
But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news. 
So are these now the images of the past? 
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East, Darfur, Iraq, elsewhere, there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news. 
Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War, there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars. 
Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today. 
The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. 
But this trend is less unambiguous. 
The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001, with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels killed every year. 
The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003, with just 20,000 killed. 
Despite the up and down since then, the overall trend -- and this is the important bit -- clearly points downward for the past two decades. 
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. 
From over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998, a decade later, this figure stands at 4,000. 
This is a decrease by two-thirds. 
This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. 
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. 
This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. 
What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. 
They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war, from hunger or disease, for example. 
And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally. 
Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective, if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war. 
To put it differently, for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war, there is no good war and there is no bad peace. 
Thus, even though every civilian killed, maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many, the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago, is good news. 
So, we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed. 
And the big question, of course, is why? 
In some cases, there is a military victory of one side. 
This is a solution of sorts, but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. 
The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this, but we have seen similar so-called military solutions in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus and across most of Africa. 
At times, they are complimented by negotiated settlements, or at least cease-fire agreements, and peacekeepers are deployed. 
But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success -- Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. 
But for many parts of Africa, a colleague of mine once put it this way, "The cease-fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning." 
But let's look at the good news again. 
If there's no solution on the battlefield, three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war, or for sustainable peace afterwards: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design. 
Take the example of Northern Ireland. 
Despite centuries of animosity, decades of violence and thousands of people killed, 1998 saw the conclusion of an historic agreement. 
Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. 
Crucially, for the long-term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland, he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations. 
Central among them, a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. 
Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments, who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. 
The core institutions that were put in place in 1998 and their modifications in 2006 and 2008 were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. 
The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross-border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict. 
And significantly, there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. 
The provisions in the agreement may be complex, but so is the underlying conflict. 
Perhaps most importantly, local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise, not always fast and not always enthusiastically, but rise in the end they did. 
Who ever could have imagined Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness jointly governing Northern Ireland as First and Deputy First Minister? 
But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example, or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries? 
By no means. 
The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war in 2003 illustrates the importance of leadership, diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full-scale civil war in Macedonia in 2001, or the successful ending of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005. 
In all three cases, local leaders were willing and able to make peace, the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement, and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed. 
Focusing on leadership, diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace, or to make it last. 
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. 
Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements. 
Rather, local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. 
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity, local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in 2005 turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged, and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full-scale return to war between north and south. 
Changes and shortcomings in leadership, more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure. 
Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues, the ongoing conflict in Darfur, escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country. 
A final example: Kosovo. 
The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence, tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many, many different factors. 
Central among them are three. 
First, the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. 
Second, an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence. 
And third, a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. 
By the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- the very fact that there is a high-level, well-resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint, explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008. 
So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal, local leaders and international leaders have a choice, and they can make a difference for the better. 
A cold war is not as good as a cold peace, but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. 
Good news is also about learning the right lesson. 
So what then distinguishes the Israeli/Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland, or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia? 
Both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue. 
First, leadership. 
In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man-made disasters, their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. 
Leadership needs to be capable, determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. 
Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers, and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future. 
Second, diplomacy. 
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced, sustained, and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. 
It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise, and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local, regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement. 
Third, institutional design. 
Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues, innovative thinking and flexible and well-funded implementation. 
Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. 
And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them. 
Conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls. 
For me personally, the most critical lesson of all is this: Local commitment to peace is all-important, but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. 
Yet, no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. 
Therefore, we must invest in developing leaders, leaders that have the skills, vision and determination to make peace. 
Leaders, in other words, that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices. 
A final thought: Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers, frustrations and setbacks. 
It often takes a generation to accomplish, but it also requires us, today's generation, to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership, diplomacy and institutional design, so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota. 
Many of you may have heard of the Lakota, or at least the larger group of tribes, called the Sioux. 
The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner-of-war camps, now called reservations. 
The Pine Ridge Reservation, the subject of today's slide show, is located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota. 
It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334, and it is where the Lakota now live. 
Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM, the American Indian Movement, or of Russell Means, or Leonard Peltier, or of the standoff at Oglala, then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US. 
So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota, and that's a very difficult one for me, because, if you haven't noticed from my skin color, I'm white, and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation. 
You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today. 
I've become very close with them, and they've welcomed me like family. 
They've called me "brother" and "uncle," and invited me again and again over five years. 
But on Pine Ridge, I will always be what is called "wasichu." 
"Wasichu" is a Lakota word that means "non-Indian," but another version of this word means "the one who takes the best meat for himself." 
And that's what I want to focus on -- the one who takes the best part of the meat. 
It means "greedy." 
So take a look around this auditorium today. 
We are at a private school in the American West, sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets. 
And if we look at our lives, we have indeed taken the best part of the meat. 
So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain, and know that when you see these people's faces, that these are not just images of the Lakota; they stand for all indigenous people. 
On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family. 
The following is a time line of treaties made, treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles. 
I'll begin in 1824. 
What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department, setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans. 
1851: The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made, clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. 
According to the treaty, those lands are a sovereign nation. 
If the boundaries of this treaty had held -- and there is a legal basis that they should -- then this is what the US would look like today. 
Ten years later. 
The Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln, unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands. 
1863: An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men, the largest mass execution in US history. 
The execution was ordered by President Lincoln, only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
1866: The beginning of the Transcontinental Railroad -- a new era. 
We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation. 
The treaties were out the window. 
In response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the US army, many times over. 
I want to repeat that part: The Lakota defeat the US army. 
1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills. 
The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states. 
We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites. 
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux. 
In fact, this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy. 
1869: The Transcontinental Railroad was completed. 
It began carrying, among other things, large numbers of hunters, who began the wholesale killing of buffalo, eliminating a source of food, clothing and shelter for the Sioux. 
1871: The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government. 
In addition, the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations. 
All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war. 
Also in 1871, we ended the time of treaty-making. 
The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations, and we can't have that. 
We had plans. 
1874: General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory, specifically the Black Hills. 
The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation. 
Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible. 
1875: The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty. 
1876: On July 26th, on its way to attack a Lakota village, Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn. 
1877: The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson. 
He was later killed while in custody. 
1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. 
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men, under a campaign known as "Sell or Starve" -- sign the paper, or no food for your tribe. 
Only 10 percent of the adult male population signed. 
The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land. 
That clause was obviously ignored. 
1887: The Dawes Act. 
Communal ownership of reservation lands ends. 
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections, and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. 
Tribes lost millions of acres. 
The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left. 
The move destroyed the reservations, making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation. 
Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers. 
Once again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu. 
1890: A date I believe to be the most important in this slide show. 
This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. 
On December 29, US troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek, and massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war, using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells, called a Hotchkiss gun. 
For this so-called "battle," 20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Cavalry. 
To this day, this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle. 
More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan. 
The Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars. 
Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee, I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux, but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. 
The holy man Black Elk, said, "I did not know then how much was ended. 
When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch, as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. 
And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard. 
A people's dream died there. 
And it was a beautiful dream." 
With this event, a new era in Native American history began. 
Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after, because it was in this moment, with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns, that the US government openly declared its position on Native rights. 
They were tired of treaties. 
They were tired of ghost dances. 
And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. 
So they brought out their cannons. 
"You want to be an Indian now?" they said, finger on the trigger. 
1900: the US Indian population reached its low point -- less than 250,000, compared to an estimated eight million in 1492. 
Fast-forward. 
1980: The longest-running court case in US history, the Sioux Nation versus the United States, was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court. 
The court determined that when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders, the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated. 
The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken, and that the initial offering price, plus interest, should be paid to the Sioux Nation. 
As payment for the Black Hills, the court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation. 
The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry, "The Black Hills are not for sale." 
2010: Statistics about Native population today, more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee, reveal the legacy of colonization, forced migration and treaty violations. 
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent. 
The housing office is unable to build new structures, and existing structures are falling apart. 
Many are homeless, and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families. 
Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. 
At least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold. 
More than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line. 
The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the US national average. 
The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent, and is about three times higher than the US national average. 
Cervical cancer is five times higher than the US national average. 
The school dropout rate is up to 70 percent. 
Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the US national average. 
Frequently, grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents, due to alcoholism, domestic violence and general apathy, cannot raise them. 
Fifty percent of the population over the age of 40 suffers from diabetes. 
The life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old -- roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia. 
The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say, "My god -- what are these people doing to themselves? 
They're killing each other. 
They're killing themselves while we watch them die." 
This is how we came to own these United States. 
This is the legacy of Manifest Destiny. 
Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps, long after the guards are gone. 
These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. 
A long time ago, a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me, by wasichu, eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills. 
Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end. 
As removed as we, the dominant society, may feel from a massacre in 1890, or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago, I still have to ask you the question: How should you feel about the statistics of today? 
What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you? 
And how much of this history do you need to own, even? 
Is any of this your responsibility today? 
I have been told that there must be something we can do. 
There must be some call to action. 
Because for so long, I've been standing on the sidelines, content to be a witness, just taking photographs. 
Because the solutions seem so far in the past, I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them. 
The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix. 
It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti, or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine. 
The "fix," as it's called, may be much more difficult for the dominant society than, say, a $50 check or a church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses, or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. 
So where does that leave us? 
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark? 
The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota. 
The call to action I offer today -- my TED wish -- is this: Honor the treaties. 
Give back the Black Hills. 
It's not your business what they do with them. 
(Applause) 

This cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the Eastern Congo. 
It's mined by armed gangs using slaves, child slaves, what the U.N. Security Council calls "blood minerals," then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in Shinjin in China. 
That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year. 
One man died after working a 36-hour shift. 
We all love chocolate. 
We buy it for our kids. 
Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children. 
Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves. 
Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations. 
Heparin -- a blood thinner, a pharmaceutical product -- starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China, because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines. 
Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond." 
This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now. 
Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth. 
Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest, the government shuts down the schools, puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton. 
It's forced child labor on an institutional scale. 
And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila. 
These places, these origins, represent governance gaps. 
That's the politest description I have for them. 
These are the dark pools where global supply chains begin -- the global supply chains, which bring us our favorite brand name products. 
Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states. 
Some of them are not states anymore at all. 
They're failed states. 
Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment, promote trade. 
Either way, they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma. 
I know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse in a global supply chain. 
But right now, most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future, nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product. 
Now, I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain. 
We need a reality check. 
We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have. 
This is an independent republic, probably a failed state. 
It's definitely not a democratic state. 
And right now, that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us, that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption. 
Now, that's not a new story. 
You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world, even in developed countries. 
You want to see the classic sweatshop, meet me at Madison Square Garden, I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop. 
But take the example of heparin. 
It's a pharmaceutical product. 
You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital, probably squeaky clean. 
The problem is that the active ingredient in there -- as I mentioned earlier -- comes from pigs. 
The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs. 
And their factory in China -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingredients from backyard abattoirs, where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient. 
So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world, because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain. 
Worse, some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in tests. 
This substitute cost nine dollars a pound, whereas real heparin, the real ingredient, cost 900 dollars a pound. 
A no-brainer. 
The problem was that it killed more people. 
And so you're asking yourself, "How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed this to happen? 
How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen?" 
And the answer is quite simple: the Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities, so they don't audit them. 
And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem. 
This is offshore. 
They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas -- about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year. 
There are 500 of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone. 
In fact, about 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore, particularly China and India, and we don't have a governance system. 
We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe. 
We don't have a system to ensure that human rights, basic dignity, are ensured. 
So at a national level -- and we work in about 60 different countries -- at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil. 
And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational. 
So governments who are failing, who are dropping the ball at a national level, have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level. 
And you can just look at the headlines. 
Take Copenhagen last year -- complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge. 
Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago -- stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago. 
You can take any one of the major global challenges we've discussed this week and ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments to step up and come up with solutions, responses, to those international problems? 
And the simple answer is they can't. They're national. 
Their voters are local. 
They have parochial interests. 
They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good. 
So, if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level -- in this case, in the global supply chain -- we have to come up with a different mechanism. 
We need a different machine. 
Fortunately, we have some examples. 
In the 1990s, there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. -- child labor, forced labor, serious health and safety abuses. 
And eventually President Clinton, in 1996, convened a meeting at the White House, invited industry, human rights NGOs, trade unions, the Department of Labor, got them all in a room and said, "Look, I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom. 
I don't know how to prevent that, but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response." 
So they formed a White House task force, and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain. 
Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility. 
They don't own those facilities. 
They don't employ those workers. 
They're not legally liable. 
Everybody else at the table said, "Folks, that doesn't cut it. 
You have a custodial duty, a duty of care, to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it, without fear of our safety, or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product." 
So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards, code of conduct. 
We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control. 
We'll make it part of the contract." 
And that was a stroke of absolute genius, because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract, private power, to deliver public goods. 
And let's face it, the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local labor law, the local environmental regulations, the local human rights standards. 
Those factories will probably never see an inspector. 
If the inspector did come along, it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe. 
Even if they did their jobs, and they cited those facilities for their violations, the fine would be derisory. 
But you lose that contract for a major brand name, that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt. 
That makes a difference. 
So what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain, that of the multinational company, and get them to do the right thing, get them to use that power for good, to deliver the key public goods. 
Now of course, this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies. 
They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money. 
But they are extremely efficient organizations. 
They have resources, and if we can add the will, the commitment, they know how to deliver that product. 
Now, getting there is not easy. 
Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier, they're not there. 
You need a safe space. 
You need a place where people can come together, sit down without fear of judgment, without recrimination, to actually face the problem, agree on the problem and come up with solutions. 
We can do it. The technical solutions are there. 
The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence, the lack of partnership between NGOs, campaign groups, civil society organizations and multinational companies. 
If we can put those two together in a safe space, get them to work together, we can deliver public goods right now, or in extremely short supply. 
This is a radical proposition, and it's crazy to think that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in Dhaka -- 22, 23, 24 dollars a month -- your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract. 
It's crazy. 
Multinationals are protecting human rights. 
I know there's going to be disbelief. 
You'll say, "How can we trust them?" 
Well, we don't. 
It's the old arms control phrase: "Trust, but verify." 
So we audit. 
We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names, we do a random sample, we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities, and then we publish the results. 
Transparency is absolutely critical to this. 
You can call yourself responsible, but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work. 
So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals, we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good -- respect for human rights -- and we're checking. 
You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me. 
Go to the website. Look at the audit results. 
Ask yourself, is this company behaving in a socially responsible way? 
Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics? 
That's the way the system works. 
I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world. 
I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs. 
I've been at this for 30 years, and in that time I've seen the ability, the commitment, the will of government to do this decline, and I don't see them making a comeback right now. 
So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure. 
We're now thinking that, in fact, this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges. 
Call it network governance. Call it what you will. 
The private actors, companies and NGOs, are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face. 
Just look at pandemics -- swine flu, bird flu, H1N1. 
Look at the health systems in so many countries. 
Do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic? 
No. 
Could the private sector and NGOs get together and marshal a response? 
Absolutely. 
What they lack is that safe space to come together, agree and move to action. 
That's what we're trying to provide. 
I know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume. 
"You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain. 
There are thousands of suppliers in there." 
It seems too daunting, too dangerous, for any company to take on. 
But there are companies. 
We have 4,000 companies who are members. 
Some of them are very, very large companies. 
The sporting goods industry, in particular, stepped up to the plate and have done it. 
The example, the role model, is there. 
And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address -- child labor in cottonseed farms in India -- this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India. 
It seems overwhelming. 
The numbers just make you want to zone out. 
But we break it down to some basic realities. 
And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition: can I give this person their dignity back? 
Poor people, people whose human rights have been violated -- the crux of that is the loss of dignity, the lack of dignity. 
It starts with just giving people back their dignity. 
I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon just next to Delhi, one of the flashiest, brightest new cities popping up in India right now, and I was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road, and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands. 
They didn't say money. 
They said, "The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human, like we don't exist. 
Please ask them to treat us like human beings." 
That's my simple understanding of human rights. 
That's my simple proposition to you, my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room, everybody out there. 
We can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped. 
If we don't do it, we're abandoning hope, we're abandoning our essential humanity, and I know that's not a place we want to be, and we don't have to be there. 
So I appeal to you. 
Join us, come into that safe space, and let's start to make this happen. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem? 
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes. 
So, I hope to convince you that complex doesn't always equal complicated. 
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven, is complex, but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated. 
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity. 
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species. 
So here's a food web, or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. 
And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before. 
All the grayed-out species disappear. 
Some are actually on the brink of extinction. 
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them. 
These effects were all unanticipated, and yet we're discovering they're predictable. 
So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems. 
First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. 
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem, or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. 
The next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another, if you focus only on that link, and then you black box the rest, it's actually less predictable than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links -- and from that place, hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most. 
And we're discovering, with our research, that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees. 
So the more you step back, embrace complexity, the better chance you have of finding simple answers, and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with. 
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. 
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. 
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. 
Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated. 
And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. 
Clearly a complex problem, but is it complicated? 
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times, I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to. 
I can sink my teeth into this." 
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever, a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. 
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence -- popular support for the government. 
And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees, three degrees away from that node and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence. 
Within that sphere, most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain, and a very small minority are actual military actions. 
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories: active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair, transparent economic development and provisioning of services. 
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram in 24 seconds. 
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid. 
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved. 
Because simple answers may emerge. 
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity. 
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity, the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

We've got a real problem with math education right now. 
Basically, no one's very happy. 
Those learning it think it's disconnected, uninteresting and hard. 
Those trying to employ them think they don't know enough. 
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies, but don't know how to fix it. 
And teachers are also frustrated. 
Yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history. 
So at one end we've got falling interest in education in math, and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world, a more quantitative world than we ever have had. 
So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up, and what can we do to fix it? 
Well actually, I think the answer is staring us right in the face: Use computers. 
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work. 
So to explain that, let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education. 
See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians. 
It's done by geologists, engineers, biologists, all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation. 
It's actually very popular. 
But in education it looks very different -- dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating, mostly by hand. 
Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world, except if you're learning it. 
And another thing about math: math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn't -- like "Am I drunk?" 
And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world. 
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back. 
But now you can find out all about -- unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but -- all about what happens. 
So let's zoom out a bit and ask, why are we teaching people math? 
What's the point of teaching people math? 
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general? 
Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject? 
Well, I think there are about three reasons: technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies, what I call "everyday living" -- to function in the world today, you've got to be pretty quantitative, much more so than a few years ago: figure out your mortgages, being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things -- and thirdly, what I would call something like logical mind training, logical thinking. 
Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society. 
It's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that. 
So let's ask another question. 
What is math? 
What do we mean when we say we're doing math, or educating people to do math? 
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking, starting with posing the right question. 
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here? 
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world, beyond virtually any other part of doing math. 
People ask the wrong question, and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer, for that reason, if not for others. 
So the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem. 
That's stage two. 
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step. 
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form. 
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that. 
And then finally, turn it back to the real world. 
Did it answer the question? 
And also verify it -- crucial step. 
Now here's the crazy thing right now. 
In math education, we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand. 
Yet, that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice. 
Instead, we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one, two and four -- conceptualizing problems, applying them, getting the teacher to run them through how to do that. 
See, crucial point here: math is not equal to calculating. 
Math is a much broader subject than calculating. 
Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years. 
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand. 
But in the last few decades that has totally changed. 
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers. 
Calculating was typically the limiting step, and now often it isn't. 
So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating. 
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet. 
See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math. 
It's the chore. 
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do. 
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself, and automation allows us to have that machinery. 
Computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means. 
I estimated that, just today, across the world, we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand. 
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor. 
So we better be damn sure -- and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose. 
I think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that. 
And I think there are some cases. 
For example: mental arithmetic. 
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating. 
People say, "Is such and such true?" 
And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly. 
It's still quicker to do that and more practical. 
So I think practicality is one case where it's worth teaching people by hand. 
And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating, but I think they're relatively small in number. 
One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates. 
See, the thing we're doing right now is we're forcing people to learn mathematics. 
It's a major subject. 
I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre -- they should do that. 
That's absolutely the right thing, for people to follow their self-interest. 
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek, but I don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek. 
I don't think it's warranted. 
So I have this distinction between what we're making people do and the subject that's sort of mainstream and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that. 
So what are the issues people bring up with this? 
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first. 
You shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject. 
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?" 
Basics of what? 
Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it, or design it for that matter? 
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill? 
I don't think so. 
I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation. 
A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things. 
But automation in cars allowed that to separate, so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak, from engineering of the car or learning how to service it. 
So automation allows this separation and also allows -- in the case of driving, and I believe also in the future case of maths -- a democratized way of doing that. 
It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that. 
So there's another thing that comes up with basics. 
People confuse, in my view, the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching. 
So just because paper was invented before computers, it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics. 
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this. 
She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops." 
(Laughter) So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age, I didn't make these. 
Why do you think that was?" 
And after a second or two, carefully reflecting, she said, "No paper?" 
(Laughter) If you were born after computers and paper, it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in, you just want to have the best tool. 
So another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down." 
That somehow, if you use a computer, it's all mindless button-pushing, but if you do it by hand, it's all intellectual. 
This one kind of annoys me, I must say. 
Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get? 
I don't think so. 
And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore. 
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore. 
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer. 
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual. 
Now, of course, like any great tool, they can be used completely mindlessly, like turning everything into a multimedia show, like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand, where the computer was the teacher -- show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand. 
This is just nuts. 
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway? 
All backwards. 
Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. 
See, normally in school, you do things like solve quadratic equations. 
But you see, when you're using a computer, you can just substitute. 
You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise. 
Same principles applied -- calculations, harder. 
And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this. 
They've got hair all over them. 
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math. 
And think of the outside world. 
Do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers? 
I don't think so -- quite the opposite. 
So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down, but that we have dumbed-down problems right now. 
Well, another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding. 
So if you go through lots of examples, you can get the answer, you can understand how the basics of the system work better. 
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here, which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important. 
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world. 
It's called programming. 
Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days, and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand. 
If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it. 
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that. 
So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual, simultaneously. 
I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible. 
It's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual. 
But I think we can do both at the same time here. 
And we open up so many more possibilities. 
You can do so many more problems. 
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before. 
And experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math, interact with it, feel it. 
We want people who can feel the math instinctively. 
That's what computers allow us to do. 
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum. 
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate, but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts, however hard the calculating. 
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late. 
Why is this? 
Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem. 
But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group. 
This was an example I built for my daughter. 
And very, very simple. 
We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number. 
And of course, it turns into a circle. 
And by the way, she was also very insistent on being able to change the color, an important feature for this demonstration. 
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides. 
Very simple example. 
That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this. 
And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world. 
So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams. 
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams, it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters. 
And one of the reasons it's so important -- so it's very important to get computers in exams. 
And then we can ask questions, real questions, questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? -- real questions that people have in their everyday lives. 
And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here. 
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens. 
How many years of protection do I need? 
What does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth? 
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams, but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding. 
So I believe [there is] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math. 
We have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward, and also our societies, based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics. 
This isn't some optional extra. 
And the country that does this first will, in my view, leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even, an improved economy, an improved outlook. 
In fact, I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the "knowledge economy" to what we might call a "computational knowledge economy," where high-level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is. 
We can engage so many more students with this, and they can have a better time doing it. 
And let's understand: this is not an incremental sort of change. 
We're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real-world math. 
And you know if you walk across a chasm, you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all -- bigger disaster. 
No, what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off, we should increase our velocity so it's high, and we should leap off one side and go the other -- of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully. 
(Laughter) So I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built from the ground up, based on computers being there, computers that are now ubiquitous almost. 
Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years. 
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future. 
Let's go for it, and while we're about it, let's have a bit of fun, for us, for the students and for TED here. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart, which is beauty. 
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics, actually, for a living. 
I try to figure out intellectually, philosophically, psychologically, what the experience of beauty is, what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it. 
Now this is an extremely complicated subject, in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different. 
I mean just think of the sheer variety -- a baby's face, Berlioz's "Harold in Italy," movies like "The Wizard of Oz" or the plays of Chekhov, a central California landscape, a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji, "Der Rosenkavalier," a stunning match-winning goal in a World Cup soccer match, Van Gogh's "Starry Night," a Jane Austen novel, Fred Astaire dancing across the screen. 
This brief list includes human beings, natural landforms, works of art and skilled human actions. 
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy. 
I can, however, give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have. 
And we get it not from a philosopher of art, not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic. 
No, this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding, and you know who I mean: Charles Darwin. 
Of course, a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question, "What is beauty?" 
It's in the eye of the beholder. 
It's whatever moves you personally. 
Or, as some people, especially academics prefer, beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder. 
People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste. 
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease. 
Beethoven is adored in Japan. 
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints. 
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums, while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth. 
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere. 
There are many differences among the arts, but there are also universal, cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values. 
How can we explain this universality? 
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes. 
We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric, largely pleistocene environments, where we became fully human, but also by the social situations in which we evolved. 
This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory. 
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth. 
And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries. 
Now, I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty, with its emotional intensity and pleasure, belongs to our evolved human psychology. 
The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations. 
Beauty is an adaptive effect, which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment. 
As many of you will know, evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms. 
The first of these is natural selection -- that's random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails. 
Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions, such as the horrid smell of rotting meat, or fears, such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff. 
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure, our liking for sweet, fat and proteins, which in turn explains a lot of popular foods, from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs. 
The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection, and it operates very differently. 
The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this. 
It did not evolve for natural survival. 
In fact, it goes against natural survival. 
No, the peacock's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens. 
It's quite a familiar story. 
It's women who actually push history forward. 
Darwin himself, by the way, had no doubts that the peacock's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen. 
He actually used that word. 
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind, we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination, even obsession, in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction. 
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance, so to speak. 
I mean, you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape. 
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover. 
So evolution's trick is to make them beautiful, to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them. 
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure, the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes. 
People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape, a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved. 
This landscape shows up today on calendars, on postcards, in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand. 
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees. 
The trees, by the way, are often preferred if they fork near the ground, that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix. 
The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view, or evidence of water in a bluish distance, indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road, perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline, that extends into the distance, almost inviting you to follow it. 
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful, even by people in countries that don't have it. 
The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience. 
But, someone might argue, that's natural beauty. 
How about artistic beauty? 
Isn't that exhaustively cultural? 
No, I don't think it is. 
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it. 
It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet. 
Chauvet caves are about 32,000 years old, along with a few small, realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period. 
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that. 
Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair, as well as ochre body paint, have been found from around 100,000 years ago. 
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this. 
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes. 
The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. 
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years. 
These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries, until around 1.4 million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single, thin stone blades, sometimes rounded ovals, but often in what are to our eyes an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form. 
These Acheulian hand axes -- they're named after St. Acheul in France, where finds were made in 19th century -- have been unearthed in their thousands, scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa, almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed. 
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals. 
And the plot really thickens when you realize that, unlike other pleistocene tools, the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges. 
And some, in any event, are too big to use for butchery. 
Their symmetry, their attractive materials and, above all, their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes, even today. 
So what were these ancient -- I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign, but they're at the same time somehow familiar. 
What were these artifacts for? 
The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art, practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects, contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship. 
Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history -- tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" -- that is to say, displays that are performances like the peacock's tail, except that, unlike hair and feathers, the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted. 
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence, fine motor control, planning ability, conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials. 
Over tens of thousands of generations, such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable. 
You know, it's an old line, but it has been shown to work -- "Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?" 
(Laughter) Except, of course, what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed, because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. 
It's hard to grasp, but it's an incredible fact. 
This object was made by a hominid ancestor, Homo erectus or Homo ergaster, between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language. 
Stretching over a million years, the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history. 
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens -- as they were then called, finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by, who knows, telling jokes, storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling. 
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that. 
For us moderns, virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies, to express intense emotions with music, painting and dance. 
But still, one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings: the beauty we find in skilled performances. 
From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall, human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts. 
We find beauty in something done well. 
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone, don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful. 
Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it, even before they could put their love into words. 
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? 
No, it's deep in our minds. 
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors. 
Our powerful reaction to images, to the expression of emotion in art, to the beauty of music, to the night sky, will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Mountain biking in Israel is something that I do with great passion and commitment. 
And when I'm on my bike, I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel, and I feel that I'm united with this country's history and biblical law. 
And also, for me, biking is a matter of empowerment. 
When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere, I feel young, invincible, eternal. 
It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself. 
You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture, looking at me with some concern. 
And here is another picture of them. 
Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces, neither can I disclose their true names, and that's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates, offenders spending time in a correction facility about 20 minutes' ride from here -- well, like everything in Israel. 
And I've been riding with these kids once a week, every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years and by now, they've become a very big part of my life. 
This story began four years ago. 
The correction facility where they are locked up happens to be right in the middle of one of my usual trips, and it's surrounded by barbed wires and electric gates and armed guards. 
So on one of these rides, I talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden. 
I told the warden that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically I wanted to take the kids from here to there. 
And I told him, "Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country." 
And the warden was quite amused, and he told me he thought that I was a nut and he told me, "This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders. 
They are supposed to be locked up. 
They aren't supposed to be out at large." 
And yet, we began to talk about it, and one thing led to another. 
And I can't see myself going into a state prison in New Jersey and making such a proposition, but this being Israel, the warden somehow made it happen. 
And so two months later, we found ourselves "at large" -- myself, 10 juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ, who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project. 
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these -- everything you see here is obviously in Israel -- as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on. 
In spite of all this splendor, the beginning was extremely frustrating. 
Every small obstacle, every slight uphill, would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up. 
So we had a lot of this going on. 
I found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties -- not because they were physically unfit. 
But that's one reason why they ended up where they were. 
And I became increasingly more and more agitated, because I was there not only to be with them, but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do. 
Now, let me give you an example. 
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain, and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here. 
So he crashes down, and he gets slightly injured, but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently. 
Then he throws his helmet in the air. 
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction. 
And then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and curse like I've never heard. 
And I'm just standing there, watching this scene with a complete disbelief, not knowing what to do. 
I'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students, and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging, violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere. 
And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations. 
They happened in places like this, in the Judean Desert, 20 kilometers away from the nearest road. 
And what you don't see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there, there's a teenager sitting on a rock, saying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it. 
I've had it." 
Well, that's a problem because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. 
It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do. 
At the beginning, it was a disaster. 
I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere. 
That's what they had all their lives. 
And at some point I found out, when a kid like this gets into a fit, the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid, which is difficult, because what you really want to do is go away. 
But that's what he had all his life, people walking away from him. 
So what you have to do is stay close and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate. 
So I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult. 
Why don't you rest for a few minutes and then we'll go on." 
"Go away you maniac-psychopath. 
Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?" 
And I would say, "Relax, Alex. 
Here's a piece of chocolate." 
And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!" 
Because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry -- and after the rides also. 
And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with? 
He's a 17-year-old. 
When he was eight, someone put him on a boat in Odessa and sent him, shipped him to Israel on his own. 
And he ended up in south Tel Aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a [unclear] and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member. 
And he spent the last 10 years of his life in two places only, the slums and the state prison, where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there. 
And so this kid was probably abused, abandoned, ignored, betrayed by almost every adult along the way. 
So, for such a kid, when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation, irrespective of how he behaves, it's a tremendous healing experience. 
It's an act of unconditional acceptance, something that he never had. 
I want to say a few words about vision. 
When I started this program four years ago, I had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs. 
I had an image of Lance Armstrong in my mind. 
And it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced, and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available. 
It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project, that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only: love. 
Love to the country, to the uphill and the downhill, to all the incredible creatures that surround us -- the animals, the plants, the insects -- love and respect to other fellow members in your team, in your biking team, and most importantly, love and respect to yourself, which is something that they badly miss. 
Together with the kids, I also went through a remarkable transformation. 
Now, I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology. 
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen. 
And before I worked with the kids, anything that I did with them, or anything that I did with myself, was supposed to be perfect, ideal, optimal, but after working with them for some time, I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision, and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened. 
All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit, and come up with something that does help, that does work. 
So right now, I feel more like these are my principles, and if you don't like them, I have others. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And one of these principles is focus. 
Before each ride we sit together with the kids, and we give them one word to think about during the ride. 
You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen. 
So these are words like "teamwork" or "endurance" or even complicated concepts like "resource allocation" or "perspective," a word that they don't understand. 
You know, perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you. 
I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore, it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows. 
It literally propels you upwards. 
That's what perspective is all about. 
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before. 
And that's how they develop self-esteem. 
Now, let me give you an example of how it works. 
You stand with your bike at the beginning of February. 
It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days, and it's drizzling and cold and chilly, and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam. 
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka -- that's where you're supposed to climb now -- and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there." 
And yet, two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery, smeared with mud, blood and sweat. 
And you look down at Yokneam; everything is so small and tiny. 
And you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started. 
It's that big. 
I can't believe that I did it." 
And that's the point when you start loving yourself. 
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them. 
And at the end of each ride, we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference, and these discussions can be extremely inspiring. 
In one of them, one of the kids once said, "When we were riding on this ridge overlooking the Dead Sea -- and he's talking about this spot here -- "I was reminded of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia and went away together with my brother. 
We walked 120 kilometers until we reached Sudan. 
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies." 
And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero, probably for the first time in his life. 
And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me, adults, who are sitting there listening to him -- and he says, "And this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in Israel. 
And only now," he says, "I'm beginning to understand where I am, and I actually like it." 
Now I remember, when he said it, I felt goosebumps on my body, because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background. 
That's where Joshua descended and crossed the Jordan and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan 3,000 years ago in this final leg of the journey from Africa. 
And so, perspective and context and history play key roles in the way I plan my rides with the kids. 
We visit Kibbutzim that were established by Holocaust survivors. 
We explore ruins of Palestinian villages, and we discuss how they became ruins. 
And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements, Canaanite settlements -- three-, four, five-thousand years old. 
And through this tapestry, which is the history of this country, the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education, and that is the understanding that life is complex, and there's no black and white. 
And by appreciating complexity, they become more tolerant, and tolerance leads to hope. 
I ride with these kids once a week, every Tuesday. 
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago -- and I ride with them tomorrow also. 
In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations, taking in this incredible landscape around me, and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive, and that I sense every fiber in my aching body. 
And I feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia. 
And I feel blessed and fortunate that every week, every Tuesday -- and actually every Friday also -- I can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in Israel on the edge. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Thank you very much. 
Now, I've got a story for you. 
When I arrived off the plane, after a very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad, and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! -- and the display on it -- anyway, the whole thing had burst. 
And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he said, "What are you doing here?" 
and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing," and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well." 
And I said, "Do you really?" 
Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark. 
(Applause) I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby. 
(Applause) This song is called "Farther than the Sun." 
(Music) ♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫ ♫ but you did not hear ... ♫ ♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫ ♫ and I have treated you too well ♫ ♫ to give up flowers ... ♫ ♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫ ♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫ ♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫ ♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ... ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ You cannot see me ... ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫ ♫ I'll believe it ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫ ♫ to trap the light ♫ ♫ And I'm in love with being in love ♫ ♫ and you were never quite the one ♫ ♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫ ♫ Fragments of what you've become ♫ ♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫ ♫ believe electric light is bright ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ Spinning figures ♫ ♫ You cannot see me, no ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫ ♫ I'll believe it ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫ ♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫ ♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ Spinning figures ♫ ♫ You cannot see me, no ... ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫ (Applause) Thank you very much. 

I grew up in a very small village in Canada, and I'm an undiagnosed dyslexic. 
I had a really hard time in school. 
In fact, my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school. 
I ran away. 
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali, and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia, and together, over 20 years, we built an amazing jewelry business. 
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired. 
Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see. 
It ruined my life -- (Laughter) "The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore. 
I have four kids, and even if part of what he says is true, they're not going to have the life that I had. 
And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities. 
So here's the world, and here we are in Bali. 
It's a tiny, little island -- 60 miles by 90 miles. 
It has an intact Hindu culture. 
Cynthia and I were there. 
We had had a wonderful life there, and we decided to do something unusual. 
We decided to give back locally. 
And here it is: it's called the Green School. 
I know it doesn't look like a school, but it is something we decided to do, and it is extremely, extremely green. 
The classrooms have no walls. 
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard. 
The desks are not square. 
At Green School, the children are smiling -- an unusual thing for school, especially for me. 
And we practice holism. 
And for me it's just the idea that, if this little girl graduates as a whole person, chances are she'll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on. 
Our children spend 181 days going to school in a box. 
The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials. 
So if this gentleman had had a holistic education, would he be sitting there? 
Would he have had more possibilities in his life? 
The classrooms have natural light. 
They're beautiful. They're bamboo. 
The breeze passes through them. 
And when the natural breeze isn't enough, the kids deploy bubbles, but not the kind of bubbles you know. 
These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. 
So we basically turned the box into a bubble. 
And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future. 
We pay the bill at the end of the month, but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren. 
We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible. 
These kids did a little graffiti on their desks, and then they signed up for two extra courses. 
The first one was called sanding and the second one was called re-waxing. 
But since that happened, they own those desks. 
They know they can control their world. 
We're on the grid. We're not proud of it. 
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar. 
And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world, in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river. 
When the turbine drops in, it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity, day and night. 
And you know what these are. 
There's nowhere to flush. 
And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water -- you're all really smart, just do the math. 
How many people times how much water. 
There isn't enough water. 
These are compost toilets, and nobody at the school wanted to know about them, especially the principal. 
And they work. People use them. People are okay. 
It's something you should think about doing. 
Not many things didn't work. 
The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months. 
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic. 
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms. 
So we had some good ideas: we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard. 
Green School sits in south-central Bali, and it's on 20 acres of rolling garden. 
There's an amazing river traveling through it, and you can see there how we manage to get across the river. 
I met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed. 
I said, "Welcome to Green School." 
He said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours." 
I asked him, "Why?" 
He said, "I had a dream once about a green school, and I saw a picture of this green school, I got on an airplane. 
In August I'm bringing my sons." 
This was a great thing. 
But more than that, people are building green houses around Green School, so their kids can walk to school on the paths. 
And people are bringing their green industries, hopefully their green restaurants, to the Green School. 
It's becoming a community. 
It's becoming a green model. 
We had to look at everything. 
No petrochemicals in the pavement. 
No pavement. 
These are volcanic stones laid by hand. 
There are no sidewalks. 
The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains, but they're green. 
This is the school buffalo. 
He's planning to eat that fence for dinner. 
All the fences at Green School are green. 
And when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate, they found out the fence was made out of tapioca. 
They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen, sliced them thinly and made delicious chips. 
Landscaping. 
We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms. 
We dropped them gently in. 
We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs. 
And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field. 
These young ladies are living in a rice culture, but they know something that few people know in a rice culture. 
They know how to plant organic rice, they know how to look after it, they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it. 
They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future. 
This young man is picking organic vegetables. 
We feed 400 people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas. 
Local Balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know. 
The food is incredible. 
Green School is a place of pioneers, local and global. 
And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world. 
The kids are from 25 countries. 
When I see them together, I know that they're working out how to live in the future. 
Green School is going into its third year with 160 children. 
It's a school where you do learn reading -- one of my favorites -- writing -- I was bad at it -- arithmetic. 
But you also learn other things. 
You learn bamboo building. 
You practice ancient Balinese arts. 
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields. 
The kids love it. 
The mothers aren't quite convinced. 
(Laughter) We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives, and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean? 
Local means that 20 percent of the population of the school has to be Balinese, and this was a really big commitment. 
And we were right. 
And people are coming forward from all over the world to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund, because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders. 
The teachers are as diverse as the student body, and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up. 
A man came from Java with a new kind of organic agriculture. 
A woman came from Africa with music. 
And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global, green leaders. 
The Green School effect -- we don't know what it is. 
We need someone to come and study it. 
But what's happening, our learning-different kids -- dyslexic -- we've renamed them prolexic -- are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms. 
And all the kids are thriving. 
And how did we do all this? 
On giant grass. 
It's bamboo. 
It comes out of the ground like a train. 
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this. 
It's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof. 
When the architects came, they brought us these things, and you've probably seen things like this. 
The yellow box was called the administration complex. 
(Laughter) We squashed it, we rethought it, but mainly we renamed it "the heart of school," and that changed everything forever. 
It's a double helix. 
It has administrators in it and many, many other things. 
And the problem of building it -- when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans, they looked at them and said, "What's this?" 
So we built big models. 
We had them engineered by the engineers. 
And Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers, selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age-old techniques, mostly by hand. 
It was chaos. 
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do, so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down, we realized that we had a cathedral, a cathedral to green, and a cathedral to green education. 
The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it. 
From the time the foundations were finished, in three months it had roofs and floors. 
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world, but many people believe that it's the most beautiful. 
Is this doable in your community? 
We believe it is. 
Green School is a model we built for the world. 
It's a model we built for Bali. 
And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules: be local, let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build. 
So, Mr. Gore, thank you. 
You ruined my life, but you gave me an incredible future. 
And if you're interested in being involved in finishing Green School and building the next 50 around the world, please come and see us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep, so dark, so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon. 
It's a place of myth and legend. 
It's a place marked on ancient maps as "here be monsters." 
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed. 
Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep. 
We are talking about the high seas. 
The "high seas" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet. 
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. 
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all. 
But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it. 
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark. 
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. 
And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect. 
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue. 
To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent. 
This is indeed the true heart of the planet. 
Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. 
For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. 
As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas. 
It's unbelievable. 
We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case. 
So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. 
And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community. 
Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules. 
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules, you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement, for as we've discovered, you can trust, but you also need to verify. 
What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas. 
For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you. 
That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling. 
And how did we do that? 
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process. 
But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed. 
So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling. 
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want," we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm. 
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected. 
This does not mean that it's the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection. 
But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime. 
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet. 
Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas. 
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. 
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. 
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. 
But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region. 
This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself. 
But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food. 
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. 
It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs. 
But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection. 
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area. 
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean. 
It's actually a bay. 
It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims. 
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas. 
But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem. 
But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region. 
The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. 
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime. 
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales. 
There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long. 
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place. 
It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis. 
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas. 
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season. 
As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it. 
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round. 
Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. 
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. 
This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area. 
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative. 
It's protecting five World Heritage sites. 
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present. 
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. 
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention. 
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. 
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch. 
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up. 
We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide. 
We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative. 
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects. 
It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. 
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year. 
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. 
And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October. 
So stay tuned for further information. 
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found. 
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers. 
We have the support of governments now behind us. 
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. 
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots. 
At the same time we're saying, "Yes, we need more. We need to move forward." 
But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it? 
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology. 
I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean. 
We can also tag and track fishing vessels. 
Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing. 
But not all the vessels have those to date. 
It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing. 
So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. 
We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas. 
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally. 
We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources. 
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect. 
At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management. 
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management. 
Our species are ocean-basin-wide. 
Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide. 
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect. 
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes. 
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization. 
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. 
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote. 
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So, a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist: I had a baby. 
And that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist. 
Sorry, TED. 
But I did go on to be a reasonably astute, arguably world-class worrier. 
One of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie, said, "Kim, I figured it out. 
It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else; it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are." 
So in the spirit of full disclosure, I brought some pictures to share. 
Awwww. 
(Laughter) I'll just say: July. 
(Laughter) Zip! 
(Laughter) For safety. 
(Laughter) Water wings -- an inch of water. 
And then, finally, all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain. 
So you can get kind of a feel for this. 
So my baby, Vander, is eight years old now. 
And, despite being cursed with my athletic inability, he plays soccer. 
He's interested in playing football. 
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. 
So why would I worry? 
Because this is what I do. This is what I teach. 
It's what I study. It's what I treat. 
And I know that kids get concussed every year. 
In fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year, and these data are just among kids under 14 who were seen in emergency rooms. 
And so when kids sustain a concussion, we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung, but what is it that we're really talking about? 
Let's take a look. 
[Concussive Force] "Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes. 
So, a car accident. 
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier: 35 Gs. 
A heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face: 58 Gs. 
(Music) In case you missed it, we'll look again. 
So look to the right-hand side of the screen. 
(Music) What would you say? 
How many Gs? 
Close. 
Would it be crazy to know: 103 Gs? 
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs. 
Now, when the kid on the right doesn't get up, we know they've had a concussion. 
But how about the kid on the left, or the athlete that leaves the field of play? 
How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion? 
How do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play, cleared for return to play, applies to them? 
The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness. 
It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one or a number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear, being more impulsive or hostile than usual. 
So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am, how do I get any sleep at all? 
Because I know our brains are resilient. 
They're designed to recover from an injury. 
If -- God forbid -- any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion, most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks. 
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury. 
In fact, high-school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college-age peers, and it takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline. 
After that first injury, their risk for second injury is exponentially greater. 
From there, their risk for a third injury, greater still, and so on. 
And here's the really alarming part: We don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries. 
You guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL. 
In a nutshell, this research suggests that, among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions, the incidence of early-onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population. 
So you've all seen that -- New York Times, you've seen it. 
What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said, "Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys?" 
"Isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car?" 
"Isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car, from the driveway?" 
I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child. 
So it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday. 
(Laughter) So, how do we guarantee the safety of our kids? 
How can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids? 
Let me tell you what I've come up with. 
(Laughter) If only. 
My little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding. 
She's totally not kidding." 
So in all seriousness: Should my kid play football? 
Should your kid play football? 
I don't know. 
The first: study up. 
You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today. 
There are some great resources out there. 
The CDC has a program, HEADS UP. 
It's at CDC.gov. 
HEADS UP is specific to concussion in kids. 
The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of. 
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- CO Kids With Brain Injury. 
This is a great resource for student athletes, teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff. 
It's a great place to start if you have questions. 
The second thing is: speak up. 
Just two weeks ago, a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have required athletes, kids under 18, to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike, died in committee. 
It died, in large part, because it lacked constituent buy-in; it lacked stakeholder traction. 
Now, I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support, but I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you, your legislators need to know that. 
Speak up also with coaching staff. 
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available. 
What's the budget for protective equipment? 
How old it is? 
Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear. 
Which brings us to: suit up. 
Wear a helmet. 
The only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening. 
Recently, one of my graduate students, Tom, said, "Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class." 
And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g-force of impact by half. 
Now, I thought it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade, this epiphany of Tom's. 
As it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education. 
(Laughter) So ... 
Should Vander play football? 
I can't say no, but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house, that kid's wearing a helmet -- like, to the car, or at school. 
So whether athlete, scholar, overprotected kid, neurotic mom, or otherwise, here's my baby, Vander, reminding you to mind your matter. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion. 
It was deep at night. 
I do not remember what time it was. 
I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. 
Everything in my room was shaking -- my heart, my windows, my bed, everything. 
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion. 
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion. 
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared. 
I went back to my bed, and I prayed, and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home, that it did not kill my family that night. 
Thirty years have passed, and I still feel guilty about that prayer, for the next day, I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father, but did not kill his mother or his sister. 
His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son, for she had lost everything. 
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war, and nameless refugees, whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes, dirty face, scared eyes. 
This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war, who we do not know their hopes, their dreams, their accomplishments, their families, their beliefs, their values. 
This is my story. 
I was that girl. 
I am another image and vision of another survivor of war. 
I am that refugee, and I am that girl. 
You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. 
We only talk about one side of it. 
But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it. 
I grew up with the colors of war -- the red colors of fire and blood, the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile, so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it. 
I grew up with the sounds of war -- the staccato sounds of gunfire, the wrenching booms of explosions, ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens. 
These are the sounds you would expect, but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night, the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous, unbearable silence. 
"War," a friend of mine said, "is not about sound at all. 
It is actually about silence, the silence of humanity." 
I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars. 
In my travels and in my work, from Congo to Afghanistan, from Sudan to Rwanda, I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same, but the fears of war are the same. 
You know, there is a fear of dying, and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid. 
It is very scary to go through that feeling of "I am about to die" or "I could die in this explosion." 
But there's also the fear of losing loved ones, and I think that's even worse. 
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it. 
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear -- as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me, who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo; she said, "The fear of losing the 'I' in me, the fear of losing the 'I' in me." 
That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me. 
It's like dying from inside-out. 
A Palestinian woman once told me, "It is not about the fear of one death," she said, "sometimes I feel I die 10 times in one day," as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets. 
She said, "But it's not fair, because there is only one life, and there should only be one death." 
We have been only seeing one side of war. 
We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels, drawdown timelines, surges and sting operations, when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn, where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. 
We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics, tactics, weapons, dollars and casualties. 
This is the language of sterility. 
How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic. 
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities. 
Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children. Oh. 
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians. 
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children. 
How interesting. 
Oh, half a million women in Rwanda get raped in 100 days. 
Or, as we speak now, hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated. 
How interesting. 
These just become numbers that we refer to. 
The front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space, guiding missiles toward unseen targets, while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist. 
It is a chess game. 
You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership. 
Checkmate. 
We are missing a completely other side of wars. 
We are missing my mother's story, who made sure with every siren, with every raid, with every cut off-of electricity, she played puppet shows for my brothers and I, so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions. 
We are missing the story of Fareeda, a music teacher, a piano teacher, in Sarajevo, who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school, despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her, and kept the piano, the violin, the cello playing the whole duration of the war, with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats. 
That was her fight. 
That was her resistance. 
We are missing the story of Nehia, a Palestinian woman in Gaza who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war, she left out of home, collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have, in case there is no cease-fire the day after. 
We are missing the stories of Violet, who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre, she kept on going on, burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets. 
We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. 
Do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going? 
And the ones who are keeping that life are women. 
There are two sides of war. 
There is a side that fights, and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open. 
There is a side that is focused on winning battles, and there is a side that is focused on winning life. 
There is a side that leads the front-line discussion, and there is a side that leads the back-line discussion. 
There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting, and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs. 
There is a side that is led by men, and there is a side that is led by women. 
And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace, we must understand war and peace from both sides. 
We must have a full picture of what that means. 
In order for us to understand what actually peace means, we need to understand, as one Sudanese woman once told me, "Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again." 
She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan, for 20 years of war, where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees. 
Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers, as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers. 
So that woman walked for 20 years, so she would not be kidnapped again. 
And only when there was some sort of peace, her toenails grew back again. 
We need to understand peace from a toenail's perspective. 
We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table. 
I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping, and the group of people who are mostly -- though not exclusively -- who are keeping life going in the midst of war, are not included in the negotiating table. 
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion, but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion. 
The doctors who are not fighting, the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns, they are, too, excluded from the negotiating tables. 
There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace, building of democracy, sustainable economies, any kind of stabilities, if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table. 
Not one, but 50 percent. 
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls. 
Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals 700 years of the U.N. budget and equals 2,928 years of the U.N. budget allocated for women? 
If we just reverse that distribution of funds, perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world. 
And last, but not least, we need to invest in peace and women, not only because it is the right thing to do, not only because it is the right thing to do, for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today, but it is for the future. 
A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now. 
She got into Women for Women International's program. 
She got a support network. 
She learned about her rights. 
We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job. 
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay. 
She was sending them to school. Have a new home. 
She said, "But what I worry about the most is not any of that. 
I worry that my children have hate in their hearts, and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother." 
We need to invest in women, because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future. 
That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do. 
Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news. 
To start with, these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day, and if they can, who are we not to dance? 
That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars, and I started this from zero, nothing, nada, [unclear]. 
(Laughter) They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances, not because of it. 
Think of how the world can be a much better place if, for a change, we have a better equality, we have equality, we have a representation and we understand war, both from the front-line and the back-line discussion. 
Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet, says, "Out beyond the worlds of right-doings and wrong-doings, there is a field. 
I will meet you there. 
When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. 
Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense." 
I humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace, there is a field, and there are many women and men [who] are meeting there. 
Let us make this field a much bigger place. 
Let us all meet in that field. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So I'm going to talk about work; specifically, why people can't seem to get work done at work, which is a problem we all kind of have. 
But let's sort of start at the beginning. 
So, we have companies and non-profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort. 
And they expect these people who work for them to do great work -- I would hope, at least. 
At least good work, hopefully, at least it's good work -- hopefully great work. 
And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work. 
So a company, or a charity, or an organization of any kind, unless you're working in Africa, if you're really lucky to do that -- most people have to go to an office every day. 
And so these companies, they build offices. 
They go out and they buy a building, or they rent a building, or they lease some space, and they fill this space with stuff. 
They fill it with tables, or desks, chairs, computer equipment, software, Internet access, maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things, and they expect their employees, or their volunteers, to come to that location every day to do great work. 
It seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that. 
However, if you actually talk to people and even question yourself, and you ask yourself, where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done? 
You'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say. 
If you ask people the question: Where do you need to go when you need to get something done? 
Typically, you get three different kinds of answers. 
One is kind of a place or a location or a room. 
Another one is a moving object, and a third is a time. 
So here are some examples. 
I've been asking people this question for about 10 years: "Where do you go when you really need to get something done?" 
I'll hear things like, the porch, the deck, the kitchen. 
I'll hear things like an extra room in the house, the basement, the coffee shop, the library. 
And then you'll hear things like the train, a plane, a car -- so, the commute. 
And then you'll hear people say, "Well, it doesn't really matter where I am, as long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends." 
You almost never hear someone say, "The office." 
But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office, and they're making people go to it all the time, yet people don't do work in the office. 
What is that about? 
(Laughter) Why is that? Why is that happening? 
And what you find out is, if you dig a little bit deeper, you find out that people -- this is what happens: People go to work, and they're basically trading in their work day for a series of "work moments" -- that's what happens at the office. 
You don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments. 
It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart, and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits, because you have 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there, and something else happens, you're pulled off your work, then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch, then you have something else to do ... 
Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question, and before you know it, it's 5 p.m., and you look back on the day, and you realize that you didn't get anything done. 
We've all been through this. 
We probably went through it yesterday or the day before, or the day before that. 
You look back on your day, and you're like, "I got nothing done today. 
I was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer. 
I used the software they told me to use. 
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to. 
I did these conference calls. I did all this stuff. 
But I didn't actually do anything. 
I just did tasks. 
I didn't actually get meaningful work done." 
And what you find is that, especially with creative people -- designers, programmers, writers, engineers, thinkers -- that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done. 
You cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes and really think about a problem. 
You might have a quick idea, but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully, you need long stretches of uninterrupted time. 
And even though the work day is typically eight hours, how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office? 
How about seven hours? 
Six? Five? Four? 
When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office? 
Two hours? One, maybe? 
Very, very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office. 
And this is why people choose to do work at home, or they might go to the office, but they might go to the office really early in the day, or late at night when no one's around, or they stick around after everyone's left, or go in on the weekends, or they get work done on the plane, in the car or in the train, because there are no distractions. 
Now there are different kinds of distractions, but not the really bad distractions, which I'll talk about in a minute. 
And this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted, and that is sleep. 
I think that sleep and work are very closely related -- not because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working. 
That's not really what I mean. 
I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase-based, or stage-based, events. 
Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages -- some people call them different things. 
There are five of them, and in order to get to the really deep ones, the meaningful ones, you have to go through the early ones. 
If you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones -- if someone bumps you in bed, or there's a sound, or whatever happens -- you don't just pick up where you left off. 
If you're interrupted and woken up, you have to start again. 
So you have to go back a few phases and start again. 
And what ends up happening -- you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning, or whenever you get up, and you're like, "I didn't sleep very well. 
I did the sleep thing -- I went to bed, I laid down, but I didn't really sleep." 
People say you go "to" sleep, but you don't go to sleep, you go towards sleep; it takes a while. 
You've got to go through phases and stuff, and if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well. 
So does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they're interrupted all night? 
I don't think anyone would say yes. 
Why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office? 
How can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted? 
That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense, to me. 
So what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places? 
Because in other places, you can have interruptions like the TV, or you could go for a walk, or there's a fridge downstairs, or you've got your own couch, or whatever you want to do. 
If you talk to certain managers, they'll tell you that they don't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions. 
They'll sometimes also say, "If I can't see the person, how do I know they're working?" 
which is ridiculous, but that's one of the excuses that managers give. 
And I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes. 
We all have to improve on this sort of thing. 
But oftentimes they'll cite distractions: "I can't let someone work at home. 
They'll watch TV, or do this other thing." 
It turns out those aren't the things that are distracting, Because those are voluntary distractions. 
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV, when you want to turn something on, or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk. 
At the office, most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary. 
So let's go through a couple of those. 
Now, managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites, and in fact, they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work. 
Some of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites. 
I mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here? 
You can't go to a website at work, and that's the problem? 
That's why people aren't getting work done, because they're on Facebook and Twitter? 
That's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy. 
Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, these things are just modern-day smoke breaks. 
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago, so why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook or Twitter or YouTube here and there? 
Those aren't the real problems in the office. 
The real problems are what I like to call the M&amp;Ms, the Managers and the Meetings. 
Those are the real problems in the modern office today. 
And this is why things don't get done at work, it's because of the M&amp;Ms. 
Now what's interesting is, if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work, like at home, in the car, on a plane, late at night, or early in the morning, you don't find managers and meetings. 
You find a lot of other distractions, but not managers and meetings. 
So these are the things that you don't find elsewhere, but you do find at the office. 
And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people. 
That's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people. 
They don't really do the work, so they make sure everyone else is doing work, which is an interruption. 
We have lots of managers in the world now, and a lot of people in the world, and a lot of interruptions by these managers. 
They have to check in: "Hey, how's it going? 
Show me what's up." This sort of thing. 
They keep interrupting you at the wrong time, while you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do, they tend to interrupt you. 
That's kind of bad. 
But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all, which is call meetings. 
And meetings are just toxic, terrible, poisonous things during the day at work. 
(Laughter) We all know this to be true, and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees. 
It doesn't work that way. 
The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together, and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people -- to say, "Hey look, we're going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting. 
I don't care what you're doing, you've got to stop doing it, so you can have this meeting." 
I mean, what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop? 
What if they're thinking about something important, or doing important work? 
All of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else. 
So they go into a meeting room, they get together, and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter, usually. 
Because meetings aren't work. 
Meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later. 
But meetings also procreate. 
So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting, which leads to another meeting. 
There's often too many people in the meetings, and they're very, very expensive to the organization. 
Companies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting, but that's not true, unless there's only one person. 
If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting. 
It's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one-hour meeting, which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes. 
But instead, there's a long scheduled meeting, because meetings are scheduled the way software works, which is in increments of 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, or an hour. 
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook; you can't. 
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour. 
And so we tend to fill these times up when things should go really quickly. 
So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today, especially at offices. 
These things don't exist outside of the office. 
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation. 
What can managers do -- enlightened managers, hopefully -- what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work, so it's not the last resort, but it's the first resort, so that people start to say, "When I really want to get stuff done, I go to the office." 
Because the offices are well-equipped; everything is there for them to do the work. 
But they don't want to go there right now, so how do we change that? 
I have three suggestions to share with you. 
We've all heard of the Casual Friday thing. 
I don't know if people still do that. 
But how about "No-talk Thursdays?" 
(Laughter) Pick one Thursday once a month, and cut it in half, just the afternoon -- I'll make it easy for you. 
So just the afternoon, one Thursday. 
First Thursday of the month, just the afternoon, nobody in the office can talk to each other. 
Just silence, that's it. 
And what you'll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other. 
This is when people actually get stuff done, is when no one's bothering them or interrupting them. 
Giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work. 
It's better than a computer, better than a new monitor, better than new software, or whatever people typically use. 
Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable. 
If you try that, I think you'll agree, and hopefully you can do it more often. 
So maybe it's every other week, or every week, once a week, afternoons no one can talk to each other. 
That's something that you'll find will really, really work. 
Another thing you can try, is switching from active communication and collaboration, which is like face-to-face stuff -- tapping people on the shoulder, saying hi to them, having meetings, and replace that with more passive models of communication, using things like email and instant messaging, or collaboration products, things like that. 
Now some people might say email is really distracting, I.M. is really distracting, and these other things are really distracting, but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing. 
You can quit the email app; you can't quit your boss. 
You can quit I.M.; you can't hide your manager. 
You can put these things away, and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time, when you're available, when you're ready to go again. 
Because work, like sleep, happens in phases. 
So you'll be going up, doing some work, and then you'll come down from that work, and then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M. 
There are very, very few things that are that urgent, that need to happen, that need to be answered right this second. 
So if you're a manager, start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email and other things that someone can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule. 
And the last suggestion I have is that, if you do have a meeting coming up, if you have the power, just cancel it. 
(Laughter) Today's Friday, usually people have meetings on Monday. 
Just don't have it. 
I don't mean move it; I mean just erase it from memory, it's gone. 
And you'll find out that everything will be just fine. 
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday, just forget about them, and things will be fine. 
You'll find out all these things you thought you had to do, you don't actually have to do. 
So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about. 
I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people, to think about laying off a little bit, and giving people more time to get work done. 
I think it'll all pay off in the end. 
So, thanks for listening. 
(Applause) 

(Applause) Thank you very much. 
I have a few pictures, and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. 
All these houses are built from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material, stuff that was headed to the mulcher, the landfill, the burn pile. 
It was all just gone. 
This is the first house I built. 
This double front door here with the three-light transom, that was headed to the landfill. 
Have a little turret there. 
And then these buttons on the corbels here -- right there -- those are hickory nuts. 
And these buttons there -- those are chicken eggs. 
(Laughter) Of course, first you have breakfast, and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up, and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time. 
This is a look at the inside. 
You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows. 
Certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill -- even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars. 
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged. 
There's a 1952 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stove, if you like to cook -- cool stove. 
This is going up into the turret. 
I got that staircase for 20 dollars, including delivery to my lot. 
(Laughter) Then, looking up in the turret, you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. 
Well, if that ruins your life, well, then, you shouldn't live there. 
(Laughter) This is a laundry chute. 
And this right here is a shoe last -- those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops. 
So I had one of those, so I made some low-tech gadgetry, where you just stomp on the shoe last, and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down. 
And then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer. 
If not, it goes into the toilet. 
(Laughter) This is a bathtub I made, made out of scrap two-by-four. 
Started with the rim, and then glued and nailed it up into a flat, corbeled it up and flipped it over, then did the two profiles on this side. 
It's a two-person tub. 
After all, it's not just a question of hygiene, but there's a possibility of recreation as well. 
(Laughter) Then, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange. 
It looks a little phallic, but after all, it's a bathroom. 
(Laughter) This is a house based on a Budweiser can. 
It doesn't look like a can of beer, but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable: the barley hops design worked up into the eaves, then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver. 
Then, these corbels going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can. 
I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. 
Then, on the can it says, "This is the famous Budweiser beer, we know of no other beer, blah, blah, blah." 
So we changed that and put, "This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ..." 
This is a deadbolt. 
It's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine. 
And they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper, so we made a deadbolt out of it. 
That'll keep bull elephants out, I promise. 
(Laughter) And sure enough, we've had no problems with bull elephants. 
(Laughter) The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. 
We've got bubbles going up there, then suds at the top with lumpy tiles. 
Where do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't. 
But I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer, and then you have lumpy tiles. 
And then the faucet is a beer tap. 
(Laughter) Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America. 
We're getting tired of it. It's kind of clichéd now. 
If you put it in the front door, your design fails. 
So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else. 
It's a pretty panel of glass. 
But if you put it in the front door, people say, "Oh, you're trying to be like those guys, and you didn't make it." 
Then, another bathroom upstairs. 
This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America. 
Don't put it in the foyer. 
Put it in the shower, or in the closet, but not in the foyer. 
Then, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet. 
(Laughter) This little house here, those branches there are made out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange. 
These pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit. 
In order to do what I do, you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry. 
Our housing has become a commodity, and I'll talk a little bit about that. 
But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. 
Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. 
What does that mean? 
What it means is, for every perception we have, it needs to tally with the one like it before, or we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented. 
So I can show you an object you've never seen before. 
Oh, that's a cell phone. 
But you've never seen this one before. 
What you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features, and then you go through your databanks: Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone. 
If I took a bite out of it, you'd go, "Wait a second. 
(Laughter) "That's not a cell phone. 
That's one of those new chocolate cell phones." 
(Laughter) You'd have to start a new category, right between cell phones and chocolate. 
(Laughter) That's how we process information. 
You translate that to the building industry. 
If we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, "Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. 
Let's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in." 
Because that's what you do with a cracked pane. 
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features. 
However, if we took a small hammer, and we added cracks to all the other windows -- (Laughter) then we have a pattern. 
Because Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. 
We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice." 
So, that serves me every day. 
Repetition creates pattern. 
If I have 100 of these, 100 of those, it makes no difference what these and those are. 
If I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern, from hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches. 
It doesn't make any difference. 
That causes a lot of waste in the building industry. 
The second cause is, Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885, wrote a book titled "The Birth of Tragedy." 
And in there, he said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives: on the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective, which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect. 
On the other end of the spectrum, we have a Dionysian perspective, which is more given to the passions and intuition, tolerant of organic texture and human gesture. 
So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is, they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer. 
"OK, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. 
That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect!" 
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes: (Laughter) That's the difference. 
I feature organic process. 
Dead center John Dewey. 
Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. 
If something isn't perfect, if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model? 
Dumpster. 
"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster." 
"Oops" this, "oops" that. Landfill, landfill, landfill. 
The third thing is arguably -- The Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism, then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution. 
By the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower. 
And we have dumaflaches and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we, up to that point, had to do by hand. 
So now we have standardized materials. 
Well, trees don't grow two inches by four inches, eight, ten and twelve feet tall. 
(Laughter) We create mountains of waste. 
And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest, working all the byproduct of their industry -- with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on -- but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption. 
And that's what's happening. 
And so if something isn't standard, "Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this. "Oops, warped." 
If you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight, you can take it back. 
"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one." 
Well, I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern, and it's from a Dionysian perspective. 
The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials. 
Well, that's just a myth. 
And there's a story: Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained -- I said, "Jim, it's time now. 
I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. Time for you to go." 
"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready." 
"Jim, now it's time. You're the down -- oh!" 
So we hired on. 
And he was out there with a tape measure, going through the trash heap, looking for header material, or the board that goes over a door, thinking he'd impress his boss -- that's how we taught him to do it. 
The superintendent walked up and said, "What are you doing?" 
"Oh, just looking for header material," waiting for that kudos. 
He said, "I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work." 
And Jim had the wherewithal to say, "You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour, I can see how you might say that. 
But right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute. 
Do the math." 
(Laughter) "Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first." 
And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math. 
(Laughter) But once in a while, you get access to the control room, and then you can kind of mess with the dials. 
The fifth thing is that maybe, after 2,500 years, Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms. 
He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want, and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. 
So we all have in our head the perfect house, the American dream, which is a house, the dream house. 
So we have the American dream look-alike, which is a mobile home. 
Now there's a blight on the planet. 
(Laughter) It's a chattel mortgage, just like furniture, just like a car. 
You write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent. 
After a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it, only on 70 percent. 
Nothing wrong with that, unless you ask it to do what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do, and that's what happens. 
It out-gasses formaldehyde -- so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger. 
Are we just being numbingly stupid? 
The walls are this thick. 
The whole thing has the structural value of corn. 
(Laughter) "So ... I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there." 
"No, no. We had a wind last night. 
It's gone now." 
(Laughter) Then when they degrade, what do you do with them? 
Now, all that -- that Apollonian, Platonic model -- is what the building industry is predicated on, and there are a number of things that exacerbate that. 
One is that all the professionals, all the tradesmen, vendors, inspectors, engineers, architects all think like this. 
And then it works its way back to the consumer, who demands the same model. 
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it. 
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers. 
"Woo. Woo-hoo." 
We buy stuff we didn't know we needed. 
All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. 
(Laughter) But you know what they did? 
They hooked a metaphor into it and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..." 
And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful, by the billions of gallons. 
It doesn't even have real prunes! Doesn't even keep you regular. 
(Laughter) My oh my, that makes it worse. 
And we get sucked into that faster than anything. 
Then, a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book titled "Being and Nothingness." 
It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe -- (Laughter) maybe two years, if you read eight hours a day. 
In there, he talked about the divided self. 
He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around. 
So if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone, I can eat like a backhoe. 
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table, chew with my mouth open, make little noises, scratch wherever I want. 
(Laughter) But as soon as you walk in, I go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there." 
Napkin in my lap, half-bites, chew with my mouth closed, no scratching. 
Now, what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. 
I feel that expectation, and so I accommodate it, and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do. 
That happens in the building industry as well. 
That's why all subdivisions look the same. 
Sometimes, we even have these formalized cultural expectations. 
I'll bet all your shoes match. 
Sure enough, we all buy into that ... 
(Laughter) And with gated communities, we have a formalized expectation, with a homeowners' association. 
Sometimes those guys are Nazis, my oh my. 
That exacerbates and continues this model. 
The last thing is gregariousness. 
Human beings are a social species. 
We like to hang together in groups, just like wildebeests, just like lions. 
Wildebeests don't hang with lions, because lions eat wildebeests. 
Human beings are like that. 
We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with. 
You see this in junior high a lot. 
Those kids, they'll work all summer long -- kill themselves -- so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans. 
So along about September, they can stride in and go, "I'm important today. See? Don't touch my designer jeans! 
I see you don't have designer jeans. 
You're not one of the beautiful -- See, I'm one of the beautiful people. 
Right there is reason enough to have uniforms. 
And so that happens in the building industry as well. 
We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs, just a little bit. 
On the bottom tier, we have basic needs: shelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth. 
Second: security. Third: relationships. 
Fourth: status, self-esteem -- that is, vanity -- and we're taking vanity and shoving it down here. 
And so we end up with vain decisions, and we can't even afford our mortgage. 
We can't afford to eat anything except beans; that is, our housing has become a commodity. 
And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal, terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity, but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. 
That takes a little bit of nerve, and, darn it, once in a while, you fail. 
But that's okay. 
If failure destroys you, then you can't do this. 
I fail all the time, every day, and I've had some whopping failures, I promise -- big, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures. 
Everybody points and laughs, and they say, "He tried it a fifth time, and it still didn't work! 
What a moron!" 
Early on, contractors come by and say, "Dan, you're a cute little bunny, but you know, this just isn't going to work. 
What don't you do this? Why don't you do that?" 
And your instinct is to say, "Well, why don't you suck an egg?" 
(Laughter) But you don't say that, because they're the guys you're targeting. 
And so what we've done -- and this isn't just in housing; it's in clothing and food and our transportation needs, our energy -- we sprawl just a little bit. 
And when I get a little bit of press, I hear from people all over the world. 
And we may have invented excess, but the problem of waste is worldwide. 
We're in trouble. 
And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana. 
But we're clearly in trouble. 
And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say, "You know, I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. 
What do you think, honey?" 
If it doesn't work, take it down. 
What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are, and that's thrilling indeed. 
Thank you very much. 

Hello. My name is Birke Baehr, and I'm 11 years old. 
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. 
First of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV, at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. 
It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids, like me, to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. 
Little kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. 
I must admit, I used to be one of them. 
I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy, little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day. 
What I discovered was this is not true. 
I began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books and in documentary films, in my travels with my family. 
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. 
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. 
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature -- like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. 
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes, but this is just creepy. 
(Laughter) The seeds are then planted, then grown. 
The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals, and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s. 
And most folks don't even know they exist. 
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity? 
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. 
Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. 
And let me tell you, corn is in everything. 
And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS. 
(Laughter) Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. 
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. 
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables, like pesticides and herbicides, to kill weeds and bugs. 
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground, or run off into our waterways, poisoning our water too. 
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer, so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets. 
So I ask myself, how can I change? How can I change these things? 
This is what I found out. 
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way. 
Now a while back, I wanted to be an NFL football player. 
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. 
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. 
Since I'm home-schooled, I went to go hear him speak one day. 
This man, this "lunatic farmer," doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modified seeds. 
And so for that, he's called crazy by the system. 
I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices, by buying our food directly from local farmers, or our neighbors who we know in real life. 
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive, but is it really? 
With all these things I've been learning about the food system, it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer, or we can pay the hospital. 
(Applause) Now I know definitely which one I would choose. 
I want you to know that there are farms out there -- like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee -- whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought. 
Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer, so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. 
I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from. 
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. 
I want you to know that me, my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. 
I try to share this everywhere I go. 
Not too long ago, my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal. 
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes -- you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. 
My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. 
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference one kid at a time. 
So next time you're at the grocery store, think local, choose organic, know your farmer and know your food. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Well, the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East, of a man who left to his three sons, 17 camels. 
To the first son, he left half the camels; to the second son, he left a third of the camels; and to the youngest son, he left a ninth of the camels. 
The three sons got into a negotiation -- 17 doesn't divide by two. 
It doesn't divide by three. 
It doesn't divide by nine. 
Brotherly tempers started to get strained. 
Finally, in desperation, they went and they consulted a wise old woman. 
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time, and finally she came back and said, "Well, I don't know if I can help you, but at least, if you want, you can have my camel." 
So then, they had 18 camels. 
The second son took his third -- a third of 18 is six. 
The youngest son took his ninth -- a ninth of 18 is two. 
You get 17. 
They had one camel left over. 
They gave it back to the wise old woman. 
(Laughter) Now, if you think about that story for a moment, I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in. 
They start off like 17 camels, no way to resolve it. 
Somehow, what we need to do is step back from those situations, like that wise old woman, look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel. 
Finding that 18th camel in the world's conflicts has been my life passion. 
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. 
We're all one family. 
We know that scientifically, thanks to the communications revolution, all the tribes on the planet -- all 15,000 tribes -- are in touch with each other. 
And it's a big family reunion. 
And yet, like many family reunions, it's not all peace and light. 
There's a lot of conflict, and the question is: How do we deal with our differences? 
How do we deal with our deepest differences, given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction? 
That's the question. 
As I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four, traveling the world, trying to work, getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela -- some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet -- I've been asking myself that question. 
And I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace. 
It's actually surprisingly simple. 
It's not easy, but it's simple. 
It's not even new. 
It may be one of our most ancient human heritages. 
The secret to peace is us. 
It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict, who can play a constructive role. 
Let me give you just a story, an example. 
About 20 years ago, I was in South Africa, working with the parties in that conflict, and I had an extra month, so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen. 
I was curious about them, about the way in which they resolve conflict. 
Because, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers, living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story. 
And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting -- absolutely fatal. 
So how do they deal with their differences? 
Well, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities, someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush, and then everyone sits around in a circle like this, and they sit and they talk and they talk. 
It may take two days, three days, four days, but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet -- a reconciliation. 
And if tempers are still too high, then they send someone off to visit some relatives, as a cooling-off period. 
Well, that system is, I think, probably the system that kept us alive to this point, given our human tendencies. 
That system, I call "the third side." 
Because if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict, when we describe it, there's always two sides -- it's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management, husband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats. 
But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side, and the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community, it's the friends, the allies, the family members, the neighbors. 
And we can play an incredibly constructive role. 
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake. 
For the sake of the kids, for the sake of the family, for the sake of the community, for the sake of the future, let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking. 
Because, the thing is, when we're involved in conflict, it's very easy to lose perspective. 
It's very easy to react. 
Human beings -- we're reaction machines. 
And as the saying goes, when angry, you will make the best speech you will ever regret. 
(Laughter) And so the third side reminds us of that. 
The third side helps us go to the balcony, which is a metaphor for a place of perspective, where we can keep our eyes on the prize. 
Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience. 
Some years ago, I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya. 
There was a war going on, as you know. 
And we met in the Hague, in the Peace Palace, in the same room where the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal was taking place. 
And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said, "You should stay right here in your seats, because you're going to be on trial for war crimes." 
And then he turned to me and said, "You're an American. 
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico." 
And my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico? What do I know about Puerto Rico?" 
I started reacting. 
(Laughter) But then, I tried to remember to go to the balcony. 
And then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response, from a balcony perspective, I was able to thank him for his remarks and say, "I appreciate your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another." 
(Laughter) "And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past. 
We're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya." 
The conversation got back on track. 
That's the role of the third side, to help the parties go to the balcony. 
Now let me take you, for a moment, to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict, or the most impossible conflict, the Middle East. 
Question is: where's the third side there? 
How could we possibly go to the balcony? 
Now, I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict, but I think I've got a first step -- literally, a first step -- something that any one of us could do as third-siders. 
Let me just ask you one question first. 
How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do? 
Just out of curiosity, how many of you? 
OK, so the great majority of us. 
And here, it's so far away. 
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict? 
Is it the number of deaths? 
There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East. 
No, it's because of the story, because we feel personally involved in that story. 
Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews, religious or non-religious, we feel we have a personal stake in it. 
Stories matter; as an anthropologist, I know that. 
Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. 
They give meaning to our lives. 
That's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories. 
Stories are the key. 
And so my question is -- yes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East, but let's also take a look at the story. 
Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about. 
Let's see if we can apply the third side to it. 
What would that mean? What is the story there? 
Now, as anthropologists, we know that every culture has an origin story. 
What's the origin story of the Middle East? 
In a phrase, it's: Four thousand years ago, a man and his family walked across the Middle East, and the world has never been the same since. 
That man, of course, was Abraham. 
And what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family; he's the father of us all. 
But it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was. 
His basic message was unity too, the interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all. 
And his basic value was respect, was kindness toward strangers. 
That's what he's known for, his hospitality. 
So in that sense, he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East. 
He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole. 
Now, think about that for a moment. 
Today, we face the scourge of terrorism. 
What is terrorism? 
Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear. 
What's the opposite of terrorism? 
It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home, in order to sow and create understanding or respect, or love. 
So what if, then, you took the story of Abraham, which is a third-side story, what if that could be -- because Abraham stands for hospitality -- what if that could be an antidote to terrorism? 
What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance? 
How would you bring that story to life? 
Now, it's not enough just to tell a story. 
That's powerful, but people need to experience the story. 
They need to be able to live the story. 
How would you do that? 
And that was my thinking of how would you do that. 
And that's what comes to the first step here. 
Because the simple way to do that is: you go for a walk. 
You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. 
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham. 
Because walking has a real power. 
You know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human. 
It's funny -- when you walk, you walk side-by-side, in the same common direction. 
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you, you would feel threatened. 
But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder, even touching shoulders, it's no problem. 
Who fights while they walk? 
That's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough, people go for walks in the woods. 
So the idea came to me of, what about inspiring a path, a route -- think the Silk Route, think the Appalachian Trail -- that followed in the footsteps of Abraham? 
People said, "That's crazy. You can't. 
You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham -- it's too insecure, you've got to cross all these borders, it goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East, because it unites them all." 
And so we studied the idea at Harvard. 
And then a few years ago, a group of us, about 25 of us from 10 different countries, decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham, going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia. 
And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran, where, in the Bible, he sets off on his journey. 
Then we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo, which, turns out, is named after Abraham. 
We went to Damascus, which has a long history associated with Abraham. 
We then came to Northern Jordan, to Jerusalem -- which is all about Abraham -- to Bethlehem, and finally, to the place where he's buried, in Hebron. 
So effectively, we went from womb to tomb. 
We showed it could be done. 
It was an amazing journey. 
Let me ask you a question. 
How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land, and a total stranger, perfect stranger, comes up to you and shows you some kindness -- maybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink, gives you a coffee, gives you a meal? 
How many of you have ever had that experience? 
That's the essence of the Abraham Path. 
That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility, and you get the most amazing hospitality, all associated with Abraham: "In the name of Father Ibrahim, let me offer you some food." 
So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people; he's alive, he's a living presence. 
And to make a long story short, in the last couple of years now, thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East, enjoying the hospitality of the people there. 
They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine, in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria. 
It's an amazing experience. 
Men, women, young people, old people -- more women than men, actually, interestingly. 
For those who can't walk, who are unable to get there right now, people started to organize walks in cities, in their own communities. 
In Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together. 
It was Abraham Path Day. 
In São Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run, uniting the different communities. 
The media love it; they really adore it. 
They lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea, this idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers. 
And just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it. 
Last month, there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it, two whole pages. 
And they quoted a villager who said, "This walk connects us to the world." 
He said, "It was like a light that went on in our lives -- it brought us hope." 
And so that's what it's about. 
But it's not just about psychology; it's about economics. 
Because as people walk, they spend money. 
And this woman right here, Um Ahmad, is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. 
She's desperately poor. 
She's partially blind, her husband can't work, she's got seven kids. 
But what she can do is cook. 
And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home. 
They sit on the floor -- she doesn't even have a tablecloth. 
She makes the most delicious food, that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside. 
And so more and more walkers have come, and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family. 
And so she told our team there, she said, "You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me." 
That's the potential of the Abraham Path. 
There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East, across the path. 
The potential is basically to change the game. 
And to change the game, you have to change the frame, the way we see things -- to change the frame from hostility to hospitality, from terrorism to tourism. 
And in that sense, the Abraham Path is a game-changer. 
I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year. 
Now, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course -- grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham. 
The path right now is like an acorn; it's still in its early phase. 
What would the oak tree look like? 
When I think back to my childhood, a good part of which I spent, after being born here in Chicago, I spent in Europe. 
If you had been in the ruins of, say, London in 1945, or Berlin, and you had said, "Sixty years from now, this is going to be the most peaceful, prosperous part of the planet," people would have thought you were certifiably insane. 
But they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe, and a common economy. 
So my question is, if it can be done in Europe, why not in the Middle East? 
Why not, thanks to a common identity, which is the story of Abraham, and thanks to a common economy that would be based, in good part, on tourism? 
So let me conclude, then, by saying that in the last 35 years, as I've worked in some of the most dangerous, difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet, I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed. 
It's not easy, of course. 
But it's possible. 
It was done in South Africa. 
It was done in Northern Ireland. 
It could be done anywhere. 
It simply depends on us. 
It depends on us taking the third side. 
So let me invite you to consider taking the third side, even as a very small step. 
We're about to take a break in a moment. 
Just go up to someone who's from a different culture, a different country, a different ethnicity -- some difference -- and engage them in a conversation. 
That's a third-side act. 
That's walking Abraham's Path. 
After a TED Talk, why not a TED Walk? 
(Laughter) So let me just leave you with three things. 
One is, the secret to peace is the third side. 
The third side is us. 
Each of us, with a single step, can take the world, can bring the world a step closer to peace. 
There's an old African proverb that goes: "When spiderwebs unite, they can halt even the lion." 
If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace, we can even halt the lion of war. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

So, what is capitalism? 
Capitalism, fundamentally, is a series of marketplaces. 
You can have a marketplace for lemonade, a marketplace for lemons, a marketplace for trucks that transport lemons, a marketplace that fuels those trucks, marketplaces that sell wood to build lemonade stands. 
However, capitalism of course, as we know, is this either celebrated term or condemned term. 
It's either revered or it's reviled. 
And I'm here to argue that this is because capitalism, in the modern iteration, is largely misunderstood. 
In my view, capitalism should not be thought of as an ideology, but instead should be thought of as an operating system. 
Think of your iPhone. 
Your iPhone merges hardware with software. 
Apps and hardware. 
Now think about all the hardware as the physical reality all around you, and think of the apps as entrepreneurial activity, creative energy. 
And in-between, you have an operating system. 
As you have advances in hardware, you have advances in software. 
And the operating system needs to keep up. 
It needs to be patched, it needs to be updated, new releases have to happen. 
And all of these things have to happen symbiotically. 
The operating system needs to keep getting more and more advanced to keep up with innovation. 
And this is why, fundamentally, when you think about it as an operating system, it devolves the language of ideology away from what traditional defenders of capitalism think. 
But even if you go to the constitution, you'll notice, before the founders even got to the First Amendment -- with free speech, free religion, free press, they thought about patents and copyright. 
They talked about the government's role in promoting arts and sciences. 
It's the reason why I could not start a search engine tomorrow called Goggle. 
(Laughter) Google doesn't own Gs, but I couldn't do it because there could be some confusion. 
So even property rights have ambiguity built into them. 
And on and on. 
And by 1900, you have other types of property that come into being. 
For instance, imagine that in 1900, you owned 100 acres of land someplace in the Midwest. 
It's very easy to see where your fence ends, your neighbor's property begins. 
Now let me ask you, where in the sky does your property end? 
Does it end at 1,000 feet, 5,000 feet, 10,000 feet? 
It makes no difference, because other than the novelty of a few hot-air balloons, man couldn't fly. 
But within three years, he could. 
Now all of a sudden, it was very much relevant whether your land ends at 1,000 feet in the sky, 5,000 feet, 10,000 feet. 
And you have to have someone arbitrate that. 
And indeed, that's exactly what happened. 
And five or ten years from now, when Amazon wants to deliver a package over your house to your neighbor from that UPS truck, we're going to have to decide: Does you property end at five feet, 10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet? 
Where does it end? 
And there is no ideology that will tell you where your property ends. 
It's an operating system. 
And similarly, we're going to see this with automobiles. 
A few years after the Wright brothers figured out flight, human beings started using more and more cars. 
And all of a sudden, the regulatory system -- the operating system -- had to be patched to all of a sudden address the safety of consumers. 
That the consumers of vehicles were presenting danger to horses, other pedestrians, trolleys, what have you. 
And all of a sudden, the drivers of these automobiles had to have driver's licenses, eye exams, registered motor vehicles, speed limits, rules of the road, so that horses, pedestrians, could coexist with cars. 
It had to be backwards compatible. 
So a new invention had to basically fit advances from the past. 
Similarly, five or ten years from now, we're going to see the same thing with self-driving cars -- coexisting with human-driven cars. 
The reason why this is important, is in 10 years, another thing is going to happen beyond drones and self-driving cars, but you're going to see the most valuable economy in the world -- the largest economy in the world -- is going to be a country run by communists. 
The Chinese seem to be very good at capitalism. 
And this is going to have fundamental problems and present an identity crisis for the United States. 
Because for a long time, free markets coincided with liberties such as free speech, free press, free religion. 
And all of a sudden, this equation is going to be decoupled. 
And when it gets decoupled, we might find that democracy, the multitude of voices, actually impedes capitalism because a state that does not have any pretense of limited government can very quickly mandate a regulatory framework for drones, for electric cars, for self-driving cars, for any new innovation where they feel that they can leapfrog Western societies. 
And this is a very unique thing in the American experience. 
And this is why it's very important to think of American capitalism as an operating system and not as an ideology. 
Because when you think about it as an ideology, you can have good politics make for very, very bad policy. 
That market outcomes and democratic voices and battles for votes can end up stifling progress. 
So over the next few years, as this political cycle plays out, you're going to see American democracy rise to meet the challenges that capitalism poses and modernity poses. 
And I ask policymakers to think about -- decoupling ideology from economics, and think about how good policy can ultimately become good politics. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Okay, I'm going to show you again something about our diets. 
And I would like to know what the audience is, and so who of you ever ate insects? 
That's quite a lot. 
(Laughter) But still, you're not representing the overall population of the Earth. 
(Laughter) Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects. 
But this is quite good. 
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects? 
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs. 
And here you see just a selection. 
There's six million species of insects on this planet, six million species. 
There's a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects. 
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms, we would come at much larger numbers. 
In fact, of all animals on Earth, of all animal species, 80 percent walks on six legs. 
But if we would count all the individuals, and we take an average weight of them, it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth. 
That means that in terms of biomass, insects are more abundant than we are, and we're not on a planet of men, but we're on a planet of insects. 
Insects are not only there in nature, but they also are involved in our economy, usually without us knowing. 
There was an estimation, a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year. 
It's a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the United States for free. 
And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year. 
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars. 
Well we know that that was not a cheap war. 
So insects, just for free, contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude, just for free, without everyone knowing. 
And not only in the States, but in any country, in any economy. 
What do they do? 
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops. 
A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants. 
They control pests, and they're food for animals. 
They're at the start of food chains. 
Small animals eat insects. 
Even larger animals eat insects. 
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals, still larger animals. 
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well. 
There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects. 
And here you see me in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang -- about two million inhabitants. 
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant, where you can select which fish you want to eat, you can select which insects you would like to eat. 
And they prepare it in a wonderful way. 
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars, locusts, bee pupae -- delicacies. 
And you can eat something new everyday. 
There's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe. 
That's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating, like a cow or a pig or a sheep. 
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety. 
And now you may think, okay, in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us. 
Well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally, but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects, without any exception. 
You're eating at least 500 grams per year. 
What are you eating? 
Tomato soup, peanut butter, chocolate, noodles -- any processed food that you're eating contains insects, because insects are here all around us, and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops. 
Some fruits get some insect damage. 
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato, that go to the tomato soup. 
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery. 
And that's your view of a tomato. 
But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup, and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency, there can be all kinds of things in there, no problem. 
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup, there's meat in there anyway? 
(Laughter) In fact, all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of. 
So anything is a good protein source already. 
Now you may say, "Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident." 
We're even doing this on purpose. 
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or, if you like, Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye. 
The surimi sticks [of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat, is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal. 
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti. 
It's being produced in large amounts, 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru, and it's big business. 
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros. 
One gram of gold is 30 euros. 
So it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods. 
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me, for everyone on this Earth. 
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially. 
Where, at the moment, we have something between six and seven billion people, it will grow to about nine billion in 2050. 
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed, and this is something that worries more and more people. 
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this. 
How are we going to feed this world? 
And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent. 
And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat. 
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production. 
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game. 
And we eat quite a lot of it. 
In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year. 
In the developing world it's much lower. 
It's 25 kilograms per person per year. 
But it's increasing enormously. 
In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing. 
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat. 
And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them. 
They have the same share that we have. 
Now to start with, I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world. 
We could do with much, much less -- and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time, and you can easily do without anything. 
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway. 
But then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production, and we're being faced with that more and more often. 
The first problem that we're facing is human health. 
Pigs are quite like us. 
They're even models in medicine, and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. 
That means that pigs also share diseases with us. 
And a pig disease, a pig virus, and a human virus can both proliferate, and because of their kind of reproduction, they can combine and produce a new virus. 
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak. 
You get a new disease that can be deadly. 
We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen. 
So that's one point for insects. 
(Laughter) And there's the conversion factor. 
You take 10 kilograms of feed, you can get one kilogram of beef, but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat. 
So if you would be an entrepreneur, what would you do? 
With 10 kilograms of input, you can get either one or nine kg. of output. 
So far we're taking the one, or up to five kilograms of output. 
We're not taking the bonus yet. 
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet. 
So that's two points for insects. 
(Laughter) And there's the environment. 
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- (Laughter) and it results in one kilogram of beef, the other nine kilograms are waste, and a lot of that is manure. 
If you produce insects, you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce. 
So less waste. 
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure, you have much, much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure. 
So you have less waste, and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung. 
So that's three points for insects. 
(Laughter) Now there's a big "if," of course, and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality. 
Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins, it's very good. 
In fact, it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment. 
And even in terms of calories, it is very good. 
One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs. 
So that's four points for insects. 
(Laughter) I can go on, and I could make many more points for insects, but time doesn't allow this. 
So the question is, why not eat insects? 
I gave you at least four arguments in favor. 
We'll have to. 
Even if you don't like it, you'll have to get used to this because at the moment, 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock. 
That's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding, but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported. 
We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests, but there's a limitation very soon. 
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent, we're not going to make it that way. 
We could much better change from meat, from beef, to insects. 
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere. 
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night. 
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper. 
So people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy. 
It's just very good food. 
You can vary enormously. 
It has many benefits. 
In fact, we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper: shrimps, a delicacy being sold at a high price. 
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp? 
There are a few people who don't like shrimp, but shrimp, or crabs, or crayfish, are very closely related. 
They are delicacies. 
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land, and it would make very good into our diet. 
So why are we not eating insects yet? 
Well that's just a matter of mindset. 
We're not used to it, and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us. 
That's why we're changing the perception of insects. 
And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis, in telling people what insects are, what magnificent things they are, what magnificent jobs they do in nature. 
And in fact, without insects, we would not be here in this room, because if the insects die out, we will soon die out as well. 
If we die out, the insects will continue very happily. 
(Laughter) So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects. 
And some might think, well they're not yet available. 
Well they are. 
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them, and one of them is here in the audience, Marian Peeters, who's in the picture. 
I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible, but as animal protein in the food. 
And maybe by 2020, you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat. 
And they're being made in the most wonderful ways. 
A Dutch chocolate maker. 
(Music) (Applause) So there's even a lot of design to it. 
(Laughter) Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture, and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry. 
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. 
over to the Hague recently, she went to a high-class restaurant, and they ate insects all together. 
It's not something that is a hobby of mine. 
It's really taken off the ground. 
So why not eat insects? 
You should try it yourself. 
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town, and they ate insects at the same moment, and this was still big, big news. 
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects, because it's just a normal way of doing. 
So you can try it yourself today, and I would say, enjoy. 
And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries, and he can have the first bite. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first. 
Marcel Dicke: It's all protein. 
BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually. 
And it looks delicious. 
They just make it [with] nuts or something. 
MD: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis. 
As a child, I had two passions. 
One was a passion for rodents. 
I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels. 
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops. 
(Laughter) I also had a passion for Africa. 
Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity. 
Africa was truly fascinating for me. 
I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries. 
I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode. 
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines. 
We're talking '95 now. 
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true. 
As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land. 
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world. 
We chose rats. 
Why would you choose rats? 
Because, aren't they vermin? 
Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures. 
And actually, our product -- what you see here. 
There's a target somewhere here. 
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right. 
There, the animal finds a mine. 
It scratches on the soil. 
And the animal comes back for a food reward. 
Very, very simple. 
Very sustainable in this environment. 
Here, the animal gets its food reward. 
And that's how it works. 
Very, very simple. 
Now why would you use rats? 
Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments. 
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species. 
They're extremely sensitive to smell. 
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it. 
Now how do we communicate with rats? 
Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there. 
A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors. 
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe. 
Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat. 
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult. 
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes. 
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets. 
In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields. 
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test. 
This consists of 400 square meters. 
There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets. 
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way. 
Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog. 
This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows. 
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people. 
They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid. 
Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up. 
But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down. 
Question of scale. 
If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger. 
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique. 
Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology. 
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines. 
But let me bring you to a very different problem. 
And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. 
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem. 
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability. 
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die. 
It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on. 
And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense. 
You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives. 
So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B. 
is "tering," which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar. 
Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients. 
So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row. 
This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology. 
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there. 
So how does it work? 
You have a cassette with 10 samples. 
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage. 
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast. 
Here it's already at the third sample. 
This is a positive sample. 
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward. 
And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative. 
Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only. 
A cage like this -- (Applause) A cage like this -- provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples. 
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on. 
But let's stick first to tuberculosis. 
I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done. 
Microscopy for 1,800 patients. 
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent. 
Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent. 
So this is really considerable. 
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives. 
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives. 
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology. 
And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds. 
So, to standardize this. 
Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. 
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon. 
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on. 
This is in a prototype stage. 
We don't have a working system here yet. 
To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people. 
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available. 
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human. 
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

To me, social justice is a simple concept. 
It's the notion that all people in a society deserve fair and equitable rights, opportunities and access to resources. 
But it's become controversial and nebulous, because we've stopped talking about what working for social justice actually looks like. 
Working for social justice can look like this ... 
or this. 
It can look like this ... 
or it can look like this ... 
or my favorite ... 
it can look like that. 
Those are my students, and whenever I'm asked to articulate my work or my priorities as a teacher, I explain that I believe education can be a tool for social justice. 
But a few months ago, I logged onto Twitter -- as I do -- and I saw that a fellow teacher had taken issue with that belief. 
"Teachers," he said, "should not be social justice warriors, because the purpose of education is to educate." 
And he ended his argument by saying, "I teach my subject." 
But I reject that simplification, because teachers don't just teach subjects, we teach people. 
When our students walk into our classrooms, they bring their identities with them. 
Everything they experience in our rooms is bound up in historical context, and so if we insist that education happens in a vacuum, we do our students a disservice. 
We teach them that education doesn't really matter, because it's not relevant to what's happening all around them. 
And what's happening all around them? 
Well, racism for one. 
According to results of the Implicit Association Test, fully 88 percent of white people harbored subconscious biases against black people, believing them to be less intelligent, lazier and more dangerous than whites. 
And that's just one concrete example of the insidious effects of historic and systemic racism on our country. 
For more evidence, we could look at incarceration rates; we could look at statistics on police violence against black people; we could look at the opportunity gap in education -- so yeah, social justice belongs in our schools. 
Social justice should be a part of the mission of every school and every teacher in America, if we want "liberty and justice for all" to be more than a slogan ... 
because schools are crucial places for children to become active citizens and to learn the skills and the tools that they need to change the world. 
So what are those skills? 
OK, here's a secret: many of the skills that people need to orchestrate the kinds of change that will lead to justice are already built into the work of schools. 
Things like problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, perseverance -- none of that should be revolutionary on its own. 
Combine that with the ability to understand history not as one static and objective narrative on which we all agree, but as a series of intertwined events about which there can be countless interpretations. 
If we deliberately choose to explore history with our students rather than just teach it, we help them understand that history is ongoing and that it's connected to current movements for justice. 
And we help them see themselves as potential players within a living history. 
So those are the skills I'm talking about when I say that education can be a place to help kids learn how to work for justice. 
But maybe the reason that my Twitter critic wasn't happy with that idea is because he doesn't agree with my definition of justice. 
Fair enough. 
Maybe he and I don't see eye to eye, politically. 
But here's the thing: our aim is to encourage students to articulate their own opinions, not to coerce them into agreeing with us, so it actually doesn't matter if he and I agree. 
What matters is that we're helping students have those conversations with each other. 
And that means that as adults, we need to learn how to become effective facilitators of our students' activism. 
We've got to help them learn how to have really tricky conversations, we have to expose them to different opinions, and we have to help them see how what they're learning in school connects to the world outside. 
So here's an example of that. 
Every year, my students study the history of apartheid in South Africa as a case study of injustice. 
Now for those of you who don't know, apartheid was a brutally racist system, and the white-ruled government in South Africa imposed racist laws to oppress people of color, and if you resisted those laws, you risked jail time, violence or death. 
And around the world, other countries' governments, including ours in the United States, hesitated to sanction South Africa, because ... 
well ... 
we benefited from its resources. 
So in 1976, the South African government passed a new law which required that all students in South Africa learn in the language Afrikaans, which was a white language, and many black South Africans referred to that language as the language of the oppressor. 
So not surprisingly, students of color were outraged at this law. 
They already attended segregated schools with overcrowded classrooms, a lack of resources and a frankly racist curriculum, and now they were being told to learn in a language neither they nor their teachers spoke. 
So on the morning of June 16, 1976, thousands of kids from the township of Soweto walked out of schools. 
And they marched peacefully through the streets to protest the law. 
At an intersection, they met up with the police, and when the kids refused to turn back, the police officers set dogs on them ... 
and then they opened fire ... 
and the Soweto uprising ended in tragedy. 
Apartheid itself didn't end until almost 20 years later, but the activism of those kids in Soweto profoundly changed the way the world viewed what was happening in South Africa. 
News outlets all around the world published this photo of 13-year-old Hector Pieterson, who was one of the first people killed by police in Soweto, and it became nearly impossible to ignore the brutality of the apartheid regime. 
In the months and the years that followed the Soweto uprising, more and more countries exerted political and economic pressure on the South African government to end apartheid, and it was largely due to the activism of those kids in Soweto. 
So every year my kids learn about this. 
And invariably, they start to draw connections between those kids in Soweto and themselves. 
And they start to ask themselves what kind of political power and agency they have. 
They ask themselves whether there would ever be a reason they would risk their lives so that a future generation could live in a more just world. 
And most profoundly for me, every single year, they ask themselves whether adults will ever listen to their voices. 
A few years ago, my principal got an anonymous email from one of our students. 
It informed him that the following day, the students planned to walk out of school. 
This was in the wake of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, and the students were planning to join a walkout and march in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. 
So at this point, the staff at the school had a decision to make. 
Would we use our authority and our power to try to control the students and prevent them from leaving, or would we support them as they put into practice the principles of social justice that we had taught them about since the ninth-grade year? 
So the next morning, the kids left school en masse and they gathered on the lawn. 
And one of the seniors jumped up on a picnic table and went over safety expectations. 
(Laughter) And the younger kids took it very seriously. 
And as teachers and as staff we told them, "OK, be safe," and we watched as they marched off. 
The kids who chose to stay spent that afternoon in class. 
They debated the merits of protest, they talked about the history of the Black Lives Matter movement, and they went on with classes as scheduled. 
And those who chose to leave participated in a citywide student walkout and raised their collective voice for justice. 
But no matter where they chose to spend the afternoon, our kids learned valuable lessons that day. 
They learned that the adults in their lives would support them even as we worried for their safety. 
And they learned that they didn't need us to tell them how or when or even why to protest. 
They learned that they were members of a community of young people with a shared vision of a more equitable society, and they learned that they had power within that society. 
They learned that events like the Soweto uprising are not ancient history, and they don't have to end in tragedy. 
And that's what education as a tool for social justice can look like. 
And here's the thing: our kids are ready for this kind of work. 
So in 2015, incoming college freshmen were surveyed, and 8.5 percent of them said that there was a "very good chance" they would participate in a protest sometime during their college career. 
That might not seem very impressive, but consider the fact that it's the largest number of students to say that since 1967. 
And 75 percent of those kids said that helping other people who are having difficulty was a "very important" or "essential" goal for them. 
Again, the highest number of people to say that since the late 1960s. 
And research shows us that working for justice doesn't just follow from building all those skills I talked about earlier -- it actually goes the other way, too. 
So working for justice, engaging in activism, helps students build skills like leadership and critical thinking, and it correlates positively with their political participation and their civic engagement and their commitment to their communities later in life. 
So in other words, students are telling us that social justice matters to them and researchers are telling us that it helps students learn. 
So now it's up to us to listen, and that might not be easy. 
In 1976, one of those kids who participated in the Soweto uprising, he said that that event represented divorce between black children and their families, because their families had grown up under apartheid, and they knew how dangerous it was to speak out. 
They wanted their kids to lay low and stay safe. 
And when our kids threatened to walk out, a lot of the adults in our community were really conflicted, too. 
Some of us worried that they might encounter violence. 
Other people worried that they would walk out but they wouldn't really know why they were protesting. 
And some, including some students' families, were really angry that the school hadn't done more to prevent them from leaving. 
And all of those fears that adults have about getting this stuff wrong -- all of those fears make total sense. 
But despite those fears, we have got to prove to our students that we will listen to their voices and that they do have the power to effect change. 
It's our responsibility to equip our students with the tools and the skills that they need to insist on a more equitable world -- and then sometimes, to get out of their way, and let them apply those skills to things that they care about. 
Living up to that vision is going to require that we are flexible, and it's going to require that we're creative. 
It's going to require that we're brave enough to stand up in the face of people who try to silence or delegitimize dissenting voices. 
And hardest of all, it's going to require accepting the fact that sometimes we will be the ones our students will rebel against. 
(Laughter) Sometimes they're going to point out ways in which systems that we have created, or in which we are complicit, contribute to inequity. 
It's going to be uncomfortable, and it's going to be painful as they push us to question our own assumptions and beliefs. 
But what if we change the way we think about rebellion in our kids? 
When our kids rebel -- when they thoughtfully push back against our ideas or the way that we do things, what if we chose to see that as a sign that we're doing something right and that they're becoming liberated? 
I know it would be easier if their critical thinking skills manifested in more convenient ways -- on their essays or their standardized tests -- I get it -- but convenience and justice do not often go hand in hand. 
And when our kids learn to think critically about the world around them, they become the kinds of engaged citizens who will recognize and question injustice when they see it and work to do something about it. 
Welcoming rebellion into our schools is going to require some rethinking about what teaching and learning look like, because there's this misconception that if we give students any wiggle room, they're going to walk all over us and classrooms and dinner tables will devolve into total chaos. 
And if we expect kids to sit silently and passively receive knowledge from us, then their voices will always feel overwhelming. 
But if we accept instead that learning is sometimes messy, that it requires opportunities to brainstorm and mess up and try again, that our kids dislike chaos and want to learn when they come to school, then we can set up schools to facilitate that kind of learning. 
So do me a favor and close your eyes for a second and imagine schools where teachers are thought partners, letting students grapple with complex, hard issues and not necessarily giving them the right answers. 
And imagine schools where we let students make choices -- we trust them enough to do that and we let them experience the consequences of those choices. 
Imagine schools where we let students be humans, with all of the messiness and the uncertainty that is bound to come with that. 
Whatever you just imagined, it's not mythical, it's not unrealistically idealistic, because teachers all over the country are already pushing the boundaries of what teaching and learning can look like with amazing results for kids. 
They're doing that in all kinds of schools, and there are countless models for teachers who want to get better at helping students learn in a way that's more authentic and engaging and empowering. 
I was a reading a book recently, it's called "The Students Are Watching," and it was by Ted and Nancy Sizer, and in that book, they said that the work of education is often described as a series of nouns, like "respect," "honesty," "integrity." 
And they say those nouns sound really impressive, but often, they fail to actually mean anything in practice. 
But verbs, they say, are "active, no less demanding but requiring constant engagement. 
Verbs are not structures but, rather, engines." 
And so as I read that, I wondered: How do we make justice into an engine driving our work as teachers? 
What's the verb form of justice? 
I think there might be an answer to be found in the words of Cornel West, who famously said that "justice is what love looks like in public." 
And all of my nerdy English teachers in the crowd know that love can be a noun and a verb. 
School has to be bigger. 
It has to mean more than "I teach my subject." 
School has to be about teaching people to change the world for the better. 
If we believe that, then teaching will always be a political act. 
We can't be afraid of our students' power. 
Their power will help them make tomorrow better. 
But before they can do that, we have to give them chances to practice today. 
And that practice should start in our schools. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

A few years ago, I found myself looking for the most cost-effective way to be stylish. 
So naturally, I wound up at my local thrift store, a wonderland of other people's trash that was ripe to be plucked to become my treasure. 
Now, I wasn't just looking for your average off-the-secondhand-rack vintage T-shirt to wear. 
For me, real style lives at the intersection of design and individuality. 
So to make sure that I was getting the most out of the things I was finding, I bought a sewing machine so I could tailor the 90's-style garments that I was finding, to fit a more contemporary aesthetic. 
I've been tailoring and making my own clothes from scratch ever since, so everything in my closet is uniquely my own. 
But as I was sorting through the endless racks of clothes at these thrift stores, I started to ask myself, what happens to all the clothes that I don't buy? 
The stuff that isn't really cool or trendy but kind of just sits there and rots away at these secondhand stores. 
I work in the fashion industry on the wholesale side, and I started to see some of the products that we sell end up on the racks of these thrift stores. 
So the question started to work its way into my work life, as well. 
I did some research and I pretty quickly found a very scary supply chain that led me to some pretty troubling realities. 
It turned out that the clothes I was sorting though at these thrift stores represented only a small fraction of the total amount of garments that we dispose of each year. 
In the US, only 15 percent of the total textile and garment waste that's generated each year ends up being donated or recycled in some way, which means that the other 85 percent of textile and garment waste end up in landfills every year. 
Now, I want to put this into perspective, because I don't quite think that the 85 percent does the problem justice. 
This means that almost 13 million tons of clothing and textile waste end up in landfills every year in just the United States alone. 
This averages out to be roughly 200 T-shirts per person ending up in the garbage. 
In Canada, we throw away enough clothing to fill the largest stadium in my home town of Toronto, one that seats 60,000 people, with a mountain of clothes three times the size of that stadium. 
Now, even with this, I still think that Canadians are the more polite North Americans, so don't hold it against us. 
(Laughter) What was even more surprising was seeing that the fashion industry is the second-largest polluter in the world behind the oil and gas industry. 
This is an important comparison to make. 
I don't want to defend the oil and gas industry but I'd be lying if I said I was surprised to hear they were the number one polluter. 
I just assumed, fairly or not, that that's an industry that doesn't really mind sticking to the status quo. 
One where the technology doesn't really change and the focus is more so on driving profitability at the expense of a sustainable future. 
But I was really surprised to see that the fashion industry was number two. 
Because maintaining that status quo is the opposite of what the fashion industry stands for. 
The unfortunate reality is, not only do we waste a lot of the things we do consume, but we also use a lot to produce the clothes that we buy each year. 
On average, a household's purchase of clothing per year requires 1,000 bathtubs of water to produce. 
A thousand bathtubs of water per household, per year. 
That's a lot of water. 
It seems that the industry that always has been and probably always will be on the forefront of design, creates products that are designed to be comfortable, designed to be trendy and designed to be expressive but aren't really designed to be sustainable or recyclable for that matter. 
But I think that can change. 
I think the fashion industry's aptitude for change is the exact thing that should make it patient zero for sustainable business practices. 
And I think to get started, all we have to do is start to design clothes to be recyclable at the end of their life. 
Now, designing recyclable clothing is definitely something to leave to the professionals. 
But as a 24-year-old thrift store aficionado armed with a sewing machine, if I were to very humbly posit one perspective, it would be to approach clothing design kind of like building with Lego. 
When we put together a brick of Lego, it's very strong but very easily manipulated. 
It's modular in its nature. 
Clothing design as it stands today is very rarely modular. 
Take this motorcycle jacket as an example. 
It's a pretty standard jacket with its buttons, zippers and trim. 
But in order for us to efficiently recycle a jacket like this, we need to be able to easily remove these items and quickly get down to just the fabric. 
Once we have just the fabric, we're able to break it down by shredding it and getting back to thread level, make new thread that then gets made into new fabric and ultimately new clothing, whether it be a new jacket or new T-shirts, for example. 
But the complexity lies with all of these extra items, the buttons, the zippers and the trim. 
Because in reality, these items are actually quite difficult to remove. 
So in many cases it requires more time or more money to disassemble a jacket like this. 
In some cases, it's just more cost-effective to throw it away rather than recycle it. 
But I think this can change if we design clothes in a modular way to be easily disassembled at the end of their lives. 
We could redesign this jacket to have a hidden wireframe, kind of like the skeleton of a fish, that holds all important items together. 
This invisible fish-bone structure can have all of these extra items, the zippers and the buttons and the trim, sewn into it and then attached to the fabric. 
So at the end of the jacket's life, all you have to do is remove its fish bone and the fabric comes with it a lot quicker and a lot easier than before. 
Now, recycling clothing is definitely one piece of the puzzle. 
But if we want to take fixing the environmental impact that the fashion industry has more seriously, then we need to take this to the next step and start to design clothes to also be compostable at the end of their lives. 
For most of the types of clothes we have in our closet the average lifespan is about three years. 
Now, I'm sure there's many of us that have gems in our drawers that are much older than that, which is great. 
Because being able to extend the life of a garment by even only nine months reduces the waste and water impact that that garment has by 20 to 30 percent. 
But fashion is fashion. 
Which means that styles are always going to change and you're probably going to be wearing something different than you were today eight seasons from now, no matter how environmentally friendly you want to be. 
I'm talking about your basics -- your socks, underwear, even your pajamas. 
We're all guilty of wearing these items right down to the bone, and in many cases throwing them in the garbage because it's really difficult to donate your old ratty socks that have holes in them to your local thrift store. 
But what if we were able to compost these items rather than throw them in the trash bin? 
The environmental savings could be huge, and all we would have to do is start to shift more of our resources to start to produce more of these items using more natural fibers, like 100 percent organic cotton. 
Now, recycling and composting are two critical priorities. 
But one other thing that we have to rethink is the way that we dye our clothes. 
Currently, 10 to 20 percent of the harsh chemical dye that we use end up in water bodies that neighbor production hubs in developing nations. 
The tricky thing is that these harsh chemicals are really effective at keeping a garment a specific color for a long period of time. 
It's these harsh chemicals that keep that bright red dress bright red for so many years. 
But what if we were able to use something different? 
What if we were able to use something that we all have in our kitchen cabinets at home to dye our clothes? 
There's countless food options that would allow for us to stain material, but these stains change color over time. 
This would be pretty different than the clothes that were dyed harshly with chemicals that we're used to. 
But dyeing clothes naturally this way would allow for us to make sure they're more unique and environmentally friendlier. 
Let's think about it. 
Fashion today is all about individuality. 
It's about managing your own personal appearance to be just unique enough to be cool. 
These days, everybody has the ability to showcase their brand their personal style, across the world, through social media. 
The pocket-sized billboards that we flick through on our Instagram feeds are chock-full of models and taste-makers that are showcasing their individuality through their personal microbrands. 
But what could be more personalized, more unique, than clothes that change color over time? 
Clothes that with each wash and with each wear become more and more one of a kind. 
People have been buying and wearing ripped jeans for years. 
So this would just be another example of clothes that exist in our wardrobe that evolve with us over our lives. 
This shirt, for example, is one that, much to the dismay of my mother and the state of her kitchen, I dyed at home, using turmeric, before coming here today. 
This shirt is something that none of my friends are going to have on their Instagram feed. 
So it's unique, but more importantly, it's naturally dyed. 
Now, I'm not suggesting that everybody dye their clothes in their kitchen sink at home. 
But if we were able to apply this or a similar process on a commercial scale, then our need to rely on these harsh chemical dyes for our clothes could be easily reduced. 
The 2.4-trillion-dollar fashion industry is fiercely competitive. 
So the business that can provide a product at scale while also promising its customers that each and every garment will become more unique over time will have a serious competitive advantage. 
Brands have been playing with customization for years. 
The rise of e-commerce services, like Indochino, a bespoke suiting platform, and Tinker Tailor, a bespoke dress-making platform, have made customization possible from your couch. 
Nike and Adidas have been mastering their online shoe customization platforms for years. 
Providing individuality at scale is a challenge that most consumer-facing businesses encounter. 
So being able to tackle this while also providing an environmentally friendly product could lead to a pretty seismic industry shift. 
And at that point, it's not just about doing what's best for our environment but also what's best for the bottom line. 
There's no fix-all, and there's no one-step solution. 
But we can get started by designing clothes with their death in mind. 
The fashion industry is the perfect industry to experiment with and embrace change that can one day get us to the sustainable future we so desperately need. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher. 
(Laughter) When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over. 
When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in and I say, "philosophy" -- their eyes glaze over. 
(Laughter) When I go to a philosopher's party (Laughter) and they ask me what I work on and I say, "consciousness," their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl. 
(Laughter) And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness." 
The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question. 
My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher, in one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations," is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business. 
And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument." 
And he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion, and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die. 
Their heads explode." The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents. 
But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all. 
It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness, and I finally figured out the reason for that. 
The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness. 
We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games. 
They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts. 
But they don't consider themselves experts on video games; they've just got strong opinions. 
I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change and global warming, or on the future of the Internet, encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next. 
But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise. 
They're just strongly held opinions. 
But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think, each of us seems to think, "I am an expert. 
Simply by being conscious, I know all about this." 
And so, you tell them your theory and they say, "No, no, that's not the way consciousness is! 
No, you've got it all wrong." 
And they say this with an amazing confidence. 
And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling -- I can feel it myself. 
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness. 
That's the order of the day here. 
Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble. 
I think everybody understands what that means. 
That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness. 
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done. 
It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover. 
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque. 
That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle, Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races. 
There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man. 
What I particularly like about this picture, too, is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style. 
Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday: what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am -- is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots. 
That's what we're made of. 
No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them. 
Not a single one of those cells is conscious; not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares. 
Somehow, we have to explain how when you put together teams, armies, battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells -- not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them -- the result is this. I mean, just look at it. 
The content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories, there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons. 
How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all. 
They think, "No, there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness." 
This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel, who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii, and he's an expert magician, and an expert on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about, "Net of Magic." 
And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you. 
It speaks so eloquently to the problem. 
"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?' By 'real magic,' people mean miracles, thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers. 
'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.' 'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real; while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic." 
(Laughter) Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness. 
(Laughter) Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks. 
If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks, then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is. 
And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said, "Consciousness is a bag of tricks." 
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness. 
So this is the problem. So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like, for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you. 
How many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck -- starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done, you sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know! 
Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified. 
Don't tell me the answer." 
A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered. 
And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you. 
You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks. 
But I'm not going to explain it all to you. 
I'm going to do what philosophers do. 
Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick. 
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick? 
The philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done. 
You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half." 
(Laughter) "He merely makes you think that he does." 
And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?" 
He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry." 
(Laughter) So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness. 
But I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous -- your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful -- as you may have thought it is. 
This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book. 
He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things. 
He didn't even try to do those things. 
People's memories inflate what they think they saw. 
And the same is true of consciousness. 
Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this. 
Watch it carefully. 
I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me, part of a larger project some of you may be interested in. 
We're looking for a backer. 
It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness. 
OK, now, you all saw what changed, right? 
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color? 
Every one. I'll just show you by running it again. 
Even when you know that they're all going to change color, it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all. 
Now, this is an example -- one of many -- of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit. 
It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book, "Consciousness Explained," where I said if you did experiments of this sort, you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes. 
If there's time at the end, I'll show you the much more dramatic case. 
Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on, and that we're not aware of them? 
Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades, the way your eye moves around three or four times a second. 
He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion, moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows, looking at interesting things in the world. 
And where your eye isn't looking, you're remarkably impoverished in your vision. 
That's because the foveal part of your eye, which is the high-resolution part, is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length. 
That's the detail part. 
It doesn't seem that way, does it? 
It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is. 
You're getting in a lot less information than you think. 
Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto. 
It's in the museum in North Carolina. 
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's. 
And I love paintings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here. 
And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail, and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting. 
And I started across the hall in North Carolina, because I thought it was probably a Canaletto, and would have all that in detail. 
And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. 
And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people, see their clothes, and so forth. 
And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed. 
I yelled out because when I got closer, I found the detail wasn't there at all. 
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint. 
And as I walked towards the picture, I was expecting detail that wasn't there. 
The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things, and my brain had taken the suggestion. 
You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is -- There, you can get a better view of the blobs. 
See, when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. 
You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect. 
I'll just give that to you one more time. 
Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion? 
When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist, suggests a person -- say, one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind -- do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere? 
I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done? 
Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady? 
It's the same thing. 
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. 
You think the detail's there, but it isn't there. 
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all. 
It's just making you expect the detail. 
Let's just do this experiment very quickly. 
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated? 
Yes. 
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right? 
How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK. 
How do you know that's what you did? 
(Laughter) There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science -- various experiments started by Roger Shepherd, who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images. 
Yes, it's possible to do that. 
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy. 
And if you read that literature, one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know. 
You don't know how you do it. 
You just know that you have certain beliefs. 
And they come in a certain order, at a certain time. 
And what explains the fact that that's what you think? 
Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician. 
This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais. 
You may think that I've cheated, that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there. 
How many of you see that sort of boundary, with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles? 
Can you see it? 
Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense. 
Your brain is actually computing that boundary, the boundary that goes right there. 
But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right? 
It's a Necker cube. 
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK. 
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube? 
Because there's another way of seeing it. 
If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles, some black circles, there's another way of seeing it. 
As a cube, on a black background, as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese. 
(Laughter) Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help. 
(Laughter) Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena. 
When you see the cube one way, behind the screen, those boundaries go away. 
But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this. 
We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change? 
Does your brain have to send little painters in there? 
The purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No. 
Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in. 
When I first started talking about the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw -- I'll go back to it, this one -- I said that there was no filling-in behind there. 
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true. 
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't. 
Now, if you think you see some pale yellow -- I'll run this a few more times. 
Look in the gray areas, and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick. 
["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide] This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book. 
Let me just pause this for a second if I can. 
This is change-blindness. 
What you're going to see is two pictures, one of which is slightly different from the other. 
You see here the red roof and the gray roof, and in between them there will be a mask, which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second. 
So you'll see the first picture, then a mask, then the second picture, then a mask. 
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. 
So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank. 
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank. 
And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying, "I see the change." 
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment. 
We're going to start easy. Some examples. 
No trouble there. 
Can everybody see? All right. 
Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button. 
Can you see that one? 
2.9 seconds. 
How many don't see it still? 
What's on the roof of that barn? 
(Laughter) It's easy. 
Is it a bridge or a dock? 
There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close. 
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking. 
This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see. 
Can you see it? 
Audience: Yes. 
Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big. 
So 15.5 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there. 
I love this one. I'll end with this one, just because it's such an obvious and important thing. 
How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it? 
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing? 
(Laughter) Right in the middle of the picture! 
Thanks very much for your attention. 
What I wanted to show you is that scientists, using their from-the-outside, third-person methods, can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of, and that, in fact, you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are. 
And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind. 
Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience. 
And he's right. This is a problem. 
Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk -- director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying. 
If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience. 
If you work on two neurons, that's psychology." 
(Laughter) We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world. 
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today, 10 calories are taken to produce it. 
That's a lot. 
I want to take something rather humble to discuss. 
I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to. 
The humble potato -- and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these. 
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime. 
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy. 
It grows and is nurtured. 
It's then harvested. 
It's then distributed, and distribution is a massive issue. 
It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me. 
I basically take it, prepare it, and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it. 
The last stage is basically waste, and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it. 
There are different types of waste. 
There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy; and there's a waste of waste. 
And every business I've been working on over the past five years, I'm trying to lower each one of these elements. 
Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like. 
Basically a restaurant just like any other. 
This is the restaurant, Acorn House. 
Front and back. 
So let me run you through a few ideas. 
Floor: sustainable, recyclable. 
Chairs: recycled and recyclable. 
Tables: Forestry Commission. 
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood. 
This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn't like sitting on it, so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing, a job that was pretty good. 
I hate waste, especially walls. 
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did, and that shows all the customers my products. 
The whole business is run on sustainable energy. 
This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs. 
Paint is all low-volume chemical, which is very important when you're working in the room all the time. 
I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it -- but there's a work surface there. 
And that's a plastic polymer. 
And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature. 
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins, experiment with polymers. 
Will they outlive me? They probably might. 
Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine. 
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there. 
Now reusing is vital. 
And we filter our own water. 
We put them in bottles, refrigerate them, and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again. 
Here's a great little example. 
If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire, which has been turned inside out and sewn up. 
It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great. 
This is the kitchen, which is in the same room. 
I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume. 
Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted. 
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters. 
It serves 220 people a day. 
We generate quite a lot of waste. 
This is the waste room. 
You can't get rid of waste. 
But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it. 
In here, I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable. 
I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator -- turns food into an inner material, which I can store and then compost later. 
I compost it in this garden. 
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food, which is generated by the restaurant, and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things. 
Three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good, makes fantastic compost. 
A couple of wormeries in there too. 
And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it. 
And I tried taking the dried food waste, putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner." 
It was like vegetable jerky, and killed all of them. 
I don't know how many worms [were] in there, but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you. 
(Laughter) What you're seeing here is a water filtration system. 
This takes the water out of the restaurant, runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and I sort of water the garden with it. 
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos, maybe wash hands with it, I don't know. 
So, water is a very important aspect. 
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse. 
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great. 
I managed to do it. 
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House -- same chairs, same tables. 
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable. 
But this is an electrical restaurant. 
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen. 
And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water. 
Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water. 
It literally is Waterhouse. 
The air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there. 
This is basically air-handling. 
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be. 
And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room. 
Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it. 
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping. 
This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange. 
I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it. 
(Laughter) And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power. 
He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic. 
There's no accident in names of these restaurants. 
Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water; and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities. 
I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire. 
I've got metal and earth to come. 
So you've got to watch your space for that. 
Okay. So this is my next project. 
Five weeks old, it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad. 
The People's Supermarket. 
So basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway. 
What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people. 
So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class -- or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative. 
This is a social enterprise, not-for-profit cooperative supermarket. 
It really is about the social disconnect between food, communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers -- connecting communities in London to rural growers. 
Really important. 
So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk; I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff. 
I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors; I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges; I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys. 
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable. 
In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world. 
That's zero food waste. 
And no one's doing that just yet. 
In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching, let's have a go. Try it on. 
I'm going to get there before you. 
So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such. 
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning, and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time, and it's an important statement to understand. 
If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food, think about the sustainable nature of it, then we may fail. 
But, I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible. 
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable. 
They're here. You can see I've done three so far; I've got a few more to go. 
The idea is embryonic. 
I think it's important. 
I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse and recycle -- right at the end there -- recycling is the last point I want to make; but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's -- then I think we're going to be on our way. 
So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas. 
I think that there are many problems to come, but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions. 
And I hope you all take part. 
Thank you very much. (Applause) 

I'm Chris Nowinski, and odds are if you've met me in the last five years I've asked you, after a few minutes, a bit of an odd question: Can I have your brain? 
Now, it only seems like a strange question if you don't know my story so please let me share it with you. 
I grew up outside of Chicago, and I was an athlete and I was very lucky to get recruited to play football at Harvard University. 
So that's me. 
And then after graduating, like most Harvard graduates, I decided I wanted to join the WWE. 
So that's also me. 
(Laughter) Sure you remember me from Monday Night Raw in 2002 and 2003, and I had a blast playing what people affectionately like to call Chris Harvard, the Ivy League snob. 
(Laughter) It was perfect for me. 
But unfortunately, I got kicked in the head by my colleague Bubba Ray Dudley, and I suffered a severe concussion. 
And it led to what became permanent postconcussion symptoms: constant headaches, inability to sleep, depression, feeling in a fog. 
And in that first year, I tried to figure out how could I make this pain go away. 
And I wasn't getting the answers I needed from doctors, and so I started digging into the medical literature. 
And I found there's this whole story about concussions that we weren't really being told. 
So I decided to write a book about it, called "Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis" that came out in 2006. 
But in that process, I learned it's not really just about concussions. 
I learned about a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE. 
What we used to call punch-drunk, because we only knew about it from boxers. 
We knew that getting hit in the head too many times with boxers would cause their brain to essentially start to rot, to degenerate. 
And they'd have symptoms like memory problems and problems with cognition, depression, impulse control issues, aggression. 
So basically, I got ... 
I got injured at the right time, in which the first two NFL players were studied for this disease. 
And it turned out they both had it. 
The first was Mike Webster, 50 years old, already had dementia. 
The second, Terry Long, 45 years old when he took his life. 
The medical examiner in Pittsburgh decided to look at their brains and found this disease. 
I wrote a chapter about it, and I thought people would make a big deal out of it. 
But shockingly, even when the first two cases came in positive, there was never a national news story about this, what's going on in football with these cases of CTE. 
So the book comes out, not a whole lot is happening, and one day I read the newspaper -- November 20, 2006. 
I find out that Andre Waters just took his life. 
Those of you who know football, Andre Waters was someone I grew up watching. 
Former Philadelphia Eagles strong safety, [44] years old, a Division II football coach when he decided to put a gun to his head. 
In the article they reminded me, his nickname was Dirty Waters. 
He was known for leading with his head, so I thought I'm just going to look up did he ever talk about the concussions he had. 
And I found a quote from 1994 where Andre Waters said, "I stopped counting my concussions at 15. 
I wouldn't say anything, I'd just sniff smelling salts and go back out there." 
And I thought, I wonder if he might have CTE, too. 
If that might have contributed to whatever made him choose to end his life. 
So I ended up calling the doctor who did the first two studies, and I said, "Hey, I think you should study Andre Waters." 
And he said, "I'd be happy to. 
The problem is, the first two cases died in the county in which I work, and I could study them as part of my job. 
I can't do that with Andre Waters, he died in Florida. 
If you want me to study him, you're going to have to figure out how to get me the brain." 
So I said, "OK. 
How does one get a brain?" 
(Laughter) So I racked my brain and I thought, why don't I call the medical examiner who I think has the brain right now? 
So I called up the medical examiner in Florida, and I said, "Hey, you don't know me, but do you still have the brain of Andre Waters?" 
(Laughter) And he said, "Yes, I do." 
I said, "OK, are you going to study him for CTE?" 
And he said no, in fact at that time he didn't believe that was a real disease. 
I said, "OK, if you're not, do you mind if I have it?" 
And he said, "Well, young man, I can't give you the brain. 
You need his family's permission. 
But if you do get the permission of his next of kin, I will release the brain to you." 
And I said, "Great!" 
And then I realized I had to figure out who his next of kin was and ask them, and it turned out it was Andre Waters's 88-year-old mother. 
And I sat there, and I took a breath and I thought, "Am I really going to cold-call an 88-year-old grieving mother who just lost her son to suicide?" 
And almost everything in me said, "Don't do it. 
It's too much to put this poor woman through, she's been through so much already." 
But then this other voice in my head said, "You know what? 
If guys are killing themselves from this disease and we could study it to maybe prevent this from happening in the future, sometimes you've just got to suck it up and do something that's very hard." 
So I called her. 
First time, nobody answered. 
Second time, no one answered, third... no voice mails. 
The fifth time, I got an answer. 
And thank God that Andre Waters's family was so gracious about the call and said, "You know what, we want to know what happened to Andre. 
We want to know why he changed so much in the last five years of his life." 
And so we studied the brain, and it turned out that he did have CTE. 
He became the third NFL player diagnosed with the disease. 
This is what it looks like. 
He was somewhere between mild and severe. 
OK, we have three of three NFL players here. 
Maybe this needs to get a little bit more serious. 
Maybe something's happening here. 
So I ended up starting the Concussion Legacy Foundation, actually formalized the work, so it wasn't just some guy calling for brains. 
And I searched the world. 
And I put together the best research team I could find. 
So we partnered with Boston University, we partnered with scientists at the VA here in Boston, and we started a brain bank. 
Turns out, if you want to know how to cure degenerative brain disease, you have to start by actually studying the brains. 
At this point, we were the first center in the world focused on CTE. 
It just had not been studied formally. 
And so we start this brain bank, and it's my job to get the brains for Dr. Ann McKee and her brain bank, right in the middle. 
We also work with Dr. Bob Stern, Dr. Robert Cantu, truly my dream team of scientists that I support. 
So my job is to get the brains. 
And I was very successful in those early years. 
Since 2007 I've started every day by reading the obituaries. 
And it's a tough way to live. 
And it's hard on me and it's even worse on these poor families that I've been calling for the last 10 years, to ask for their brains. 
And so early on in the process, as it started to really eat away at me, I decided, you know what, can I find another way to get people to donate their brains to this research? 
And I figured out, what if we could create a culture of brain donation in this country? 
What if it became normal for athletes to donate their brain after they died? 
And so what I started was a brain donation registry. 
And I started asking athletes if they would publicly pledge to donate their brain to science. 
And it started with, actually, a hockey player in 2009. 
One of my first pledges was a former Harvard hockey player, Noah Welch, who was in the NHL at the time. 
It was a slow start people understanding what this was about. 
So when the news hit the front page, "Noah Welch pledging his brain to science," he said he went to the locker room the next day, one of his teammates pulled him aside and said, "Hey, I heard you're donating your brain to science." 
And he said, "Yep." 
And he said, "Wow. How many games are you going to miss?" 
(Laughter) True story. 
(Laughter) But we've been remarkably successful -- over 2,500 athletes have signed up. 
They get a brain-donation card they keep in their wallet. 
This is mine, I was obviously first, it says 01. 
And I will donate my brain to this. 
We've also been lucky to have people like Brandi Chastain, the women's soccer icon, NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr. 
Just two weeks ago, Hall-of-Famer Nick Buoniconti who had been diagnosed with dementia, signed up to pledge his brain. 
So it's been wonderful, and the great thing about it is that it has worked in changing how we're able to get brains. 
So now, instead of me having to call, more families call us. 
And our phones ring off the hook. 
And so I can now focus on taking this information, figuring out how do we work towards a cure, how do we work towards prevention, and so my life has gotten a lot easier. 
This is just some of the headlines that we've able to get over the years from athletes pledging their brain. 
The problem has been what we learned. 
So when we started this, only 45 cases existed in the world of this disease that had been studied in brain banks. 
Since then, we have acquired 500 brains and found over 300 of them had CTE. 
To put that in perspective, the rest of the world has not studied 100 brains since we started this. 
What we've seen though is very frightening. 
So some of you might have seen the headline in July in the "New York Times." 
And a recent study we published, that of the first 111 NFL players we looked at 110 were positive for this disease. 
Of the first 53 college football players we looked at, 48 had this disease. 
That's something that's a very big concern to me. 
And so now, I'm very much focused on what can we do to actually treat this disease? 
We still can't diagnose CTE in living people, we have no treatments that are going to be coming out of the pharmaceutical industry in the next five years. 
This is a long, long fight. 
But our Concussion Legacy Foundation is here to not only facilitate this work, and that's the long game, but the short game is, hey, we can prevent this. 
We can prevent this disease if we just stopped hitting people in the head so much. 
And frankly, we need to stop hitting children in the head. 
Turns out, it's not a great idea to hit a five-year-old in the head 500 times each year. 
And it does actually open up the door to this disease. 
And so, we've got a lot of work ahead of us. 
But I have great hope that we're on our way to curing this disease. 
But I hope you understand my story a little more now. 
And now that we've gotten to know each other a little bit better, this is the time where I ask you, "Can I have your brain?" 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Imagine with me this scene. 
It's a scene that played out in nearly all of our families. 
It's a scene in which a young person, somewhere in our family tree, somewhere in our lineage had a heartbreaking decision to make. 
It was a decision to leave all that they had known. 
And all of the people that they had loved and to set out for a place far, far away that they had never seen in hopes that life might be better. 
Migration is usually a young person's endeavor. 
It's the kind of thing that you do when you're on the cusp of life. 
And so, there is, in all of our families, this young person somewhere in our background. 
That person is standing at a dock, about to board a ship that will cross the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean. 
That person is loading up a truck that will cross the Rio Grande. 
Or that person is standing at a railroad platform about to board a train that will cross rivers and mountains out of the Jim Crow South to what they hope will be freedom in the North. 
And there, with this young person as they are about to board that ship, that boat, that truck, that train, are the people who raised them. 
Their mother, their father, their aunt, their uncle, their grandparents, whoever it might have been who had gotten them to this point. 
Those older people were not going to be able to make the crossing with them. 
And as they looked into the eyes of the people who had raised them, there was no guarantee that they would ever see them alive again. 
Remember, there was no Skype, no e-mail, no cell phones not even reliable long-distance telephone service. 
And even if there had been, many of the people that they were leaving did not even have telephones. 
This was going to be a complete break from all that they knew and all of the people that they loved. 
And the very next time that they might hear anything about the people who had raised them might be a telegram saying, "Your father has passed away." 
Or, "Your mother is very, very ill. 
You must return home quickly if you are to see her alive again." 
That is the magnitude of the sacrifice that had to have happened in nearly all of our families just for us to be here. 
A single decision that changed the course of families and lineages and countries and history to the current day. 
One of these migration streams stands out in ways that we may not realize. 
It was called the Great Migration. 
It was the outpouring of six million African Americans from the Jim Crow South to the cities of the North and West, from the time of World War I until the 1970s. 
It stands out because this was the first time in American history that American citizens had to flee the land of their birth just to be recognized as the citizens that they had always been. 
No other group of Americans has had to act like immigrants in order to be recognized as citizens. 
So this great migration was not a move. 
It was actually a seeking of political asylum within the borders of one's own country. 
They were defecting a caste system known as Jim Crow. 
It was an artificial hierarchy in which everything that you could and could not do was based upon what you looked like. 
This caste system was so arcane that it was actually against the law for a black person and a white person to merely play checkers together in Birmingham. 
You could go to jail if you were caught playing checkers with a person of a different race. 
Someone must have seen a black person and a white person playing checkers with someone in some town square. 
And maybe the wrong person was winning or they were having too good of a time, but whatever it was that this person saw, with this black person and this white person playing checkers, they felt the entire foundation of Southern civilization was in peril. 
And decided that it was worth taking the time to write this down as a law. 
This caste system was so arcane that in courtrooms throughout the South there was actually a black Bible and an altogether separate white Bible to swear to tell the truth on in court. 
The very word of God was segregated in the caste system of the Jim Crow South. 
The same sacred object could not be touched by hands of different races. 
This artificial hierarchy, because it goes against human desires to be free, required a tremendous amount of violence to maintain. 
Such that every four days, somewhere in the American South, every four days an African American was lynched for some perceived breach of protocol in this caste system in the decades leading up to the start of the Great Migration. 
This caste system had been put in place for many, many reasons. 
But one of them was to maintain the economic order of the South, which required not just a supply of cheap labor but an oversupply of cheap labor to work at the will of the land. 
This Great Migration began when the North had a labor problem. 
The North had a labor problem because it had been relying on cheap labor from Europe -- immigrants from Europe -- to work the factories and the foundries and the steel mills. 
But during World War I, migration from Europe came to a virtual halt. 
And so the North had a labor problem. 
And so the North decided to go and find the cheapest labor in the land which meant African Americans in the South, many of whom were not even being paid for their hard work. 
Many of them were working for the right to live on the land that they were farming. 
They were sharecroppers and not even being paid. 
So they were ripe for recruitment. 
But it turned out that the South did not take kindly to this poaching of its cheap labor. 
The South actually did everything it could to keep the people from leaving. 
They would arrest people from the railroad platforms. 
Remember, putatively free American citizens. 
They would arrest them from their train seats. 
And when there were too many people to arrest, they would wave the train on through so that people who had been hoping and saving and praying for the chance to get to freedom had to figure out: How now will we get out? 
And as they made their way out of the South, away from Jim Crow, they followed three beautifully predictable streams as is the case in any migration throughout human history. 
In this particular case, there were three streams. 
One was the migration along the East Coast from Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia to Washington DC, to Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York and on up the East coast. 
There was the Midwest stream, which carried people from Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas to Chicago, to Detroit, to Cleveland and the entire Midwest. 
And then there was the West Coast stream, which carried people from Louisiana and Texas out to California. 
And when they really wanted to get away, they went to Seattle. 
And when they really, really wanted to get away, they went to Alaska, the farthest possible point within the borders of the United States from Jim Crow South. 
Before the Great Migration began, 90 percent of all African Americans were living in the South. 
Nearly held captive in the South. 
But by the time this Great Migration was over, nearly half were living all over the rest of the country. 
So this ended up being nearly a complete redistribution of part of an entire people. 
This Great Migration was the first time in American history that the lowest caste people signaled that they had options and were willing to take them. 
That had not happened in the three centuries in which African Americans had been on that soil at that time. 
It had not happened in 12 generations of enslavement that preceded nearly a century of Jim Crow. 
How many "greats" do you have to add to the word "grandparent" to begin to imagine how long enslavement lasted in the United States? 
Secondly, this Great Migration was the first time in American history that the lowest caste people actually had a chance to choose for themselves what they would do with their God-given talents and where they would pursue them. 
Think about those cotton fields and those rice plantations and those tobacco fields and those sugar plantations. 
On those sugar plantations, and on those tobacco fields, and on those rice plantations, and on those cotton fields were opera singers, jazz musicians, playwrights, novelists, surgeons, attorneys, accountants, professors, journalists. 
And how do we know that? 
We know that because that is what they and their children and now their grandchildren and even great-grandchildren have often chosen to become once they had the chance to choose for themselves what they would do with their God-given talents. 
Without the Great Migration, there might not have been a Toni Morrison as we now know her to be. 
Her parents were from Alabama and from Georgia. 
They migrated to Ohio, where their daughter would get to do something that we all take for granted at this point, but which was against the law and against protocol for African Americans at the time that she would have been growing up in the South, had they stayed. 
And that is just to walk into a library and take out a library book. 
Merely by making the single decision to leave, her parents assured that their daughter would get access to books. 
And if you're going to become a Nobel laureate, it helps to get a book now and then. 
You know, it helps. 
Music as we know it was reshaped by the Great Migration. 
As they came North, they brought with them, on their hearts and in their memories, the music that had sustained the ancestors -- the blues music, the spirituals and the gospel music that had sustained them through the generations. 
And they converted this music into whole new genres of music. 
And got the chance to record this music, this new music that they were creating, and to spread it throughout the world. 
Without the Great Migration, "Motown" would not have existed. 
The founder, Berry Gordy, his parents were from Georgia. 
They migrated to Detroit. 
And when he got to be a grown man, he decided he wanted to go into music. 
But he didn't have the wherewithal to go all over the country looking for the best talent, and it turned out he didn't have to. 
It turned out that there he was, surrounded by children of the Great Migration whose parents had brought this music up with them during the journey. 
And among those children were these three girls, there was Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard and there was a third one: Diana Ross. 
We might not know Diana Ross' name had there been no Great Migration. 
Because like a lot of Americans and a lot of human beings in general, she might not have existed because her parents might not have met. 
Her mother was from Alabama, father from West Virginia, they migrated to Detroit, different years, met, married, had her and her siblings, and thus a legend was born. 
Jazz was a creation of the Great Migration. 
And one of the greatest gifts of the Great Migration. 
Starting with Louis Armstrong, who was born in Louisiana and migrated on the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago, where he got the chance to build on the talent that was within him all along. 
Miles Davis. 
His parents were from Arkansas. 
They migrated to southern Illinois, where he would get the chance to build on the talents that were within him all along but which could have gone fallow in the cotton country of Arkansas. 
John Coltrane. 
He migrated at the age of 16 from North Carolina to Philadelphia, where, upon arrival in Philadelphia, he got his first alto sax. 
And there are lovers of jazz who cannot imagine a world without John Coltrane having gotten a hold of a saxophone. 
Thelonious Monk. 
Michael Jackson. 
Jesse Owens. 
Prince. 
August Wilson. 
Richard Wright. 
Ralph Ellison. 
Michelle Obama. 
These are all a few of the millions of people who were products of the single decision to migrate. 
The people of the Great Migration met with tremendous resistance in the North. 
And they were not able to defeat all social injustice. 
But one person added to another person, added to another person, multiplied by millions, were able to become the advance guard of the civil rights movement. 
One person added to another person, added to another person, multiplied by millions, acting on a single decision, were able to change the region that they had been forced to flee. 
They had more power in leaving than by staying. 
By their actions, these people who had absolutely nothing were able to do what a president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, was not able to do. 
These people, by their actions, were able to do what the Emancipation Proclamation could not do. 
These people, by their actions, were able to do what the powers that be, North and South, could not or would not do. 
They freed themselves. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning. 
(Laughter) But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater, and really, I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation. 
(Applause) One of the interesting things, of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology, and what he said about listening to our young people. 
Of course, my job is all about listening. 
And my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen. 
That's my only real aim in life. 
And it sounds quite simple, but actually, it's quite a big, big job. 
Because you know, when you look at a piece of music, for example, if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here, hopefully, a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. 
And, you know, we open it up ... 
So technically, I can actually read this. 
I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics. 
I will do exactly as I'm told. 
And so therefore, because time is short, if I just played you, literally, the first, maybe, two lines or so -- It's very straightforward; there's nothing too difficult about the piece. 
But here, I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. 
I'm being told where to play on the drum. 
I'm being told which part of the stick to use. 
And I'm being told the dynamic. 
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares. 
Snares on, snares off. 
So therefore, if I translate this piece of music, we have this idea. 
(Drum sounds) (Drum sounds end) And so on. 
My career would probably last about five years. 
(Laughter) However, what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music; everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher, or to talk about, even, from a teacher. 
But it's the things you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that, in fact, become so interesting, and that you want to explore through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum. 
So there, we experience the translation. 
(Drum sounds) (Drum sounds end) (Applause) Now my career may last a little longer. 
(Laughter) But in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice, bright young lady with a pink top on. 
I see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc. 
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about, what you might like, what you might do as a profession, etc., etc. 
However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret. 
But actually it's so unbelievably shallow. 
In the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea; I wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do. 
Just the basic feeling. 
However, that is simply not enough. 
And I think what Herbie said: please listen, listen. 
We have to listen to ourselves, first of all. 
If I play, for example, holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick -- (Drum sound) you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm. 
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly. 
(Drum sound) By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached. 
If I just simply let go and allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system, suddenly -- (Drum sound) I have more dynamic with less effort. 
Much more -- (Drum sound) and I just feel, at last, one with the stick and one with the drum. 
And I'm doing far, far less. 
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument, I need time with people in order to interpret them. 
Not just translate them, but interpret them. 
If, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is, someone who is basically a percussion player -- (Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) And so on, if I think of myself as a musician -- (Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) And so on. 
There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- (Applause) thinking about. 
And I remember when I was 12 years old, and I started playing timpani and percussion, and my teacher said, "Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening." 
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that, so what's the problem?" 
And he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this? 
How are you going to hear that?" 
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?" 
He said, "Well, I think I hear it through here." 
And I said, "Well, I think I do too, but I also hear it through my hands, through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp, my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on." 
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums, in particular, the kettle drums, or timpani to such a narrow pitch interval, so something like -- (Marimba sounds) that of a difference. 
Then gradually: (Marimba sounds) And gradually: (Marimba sounds) And it's amazing that when you do open your body up, and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through, that in fact the tiny, tiny difference -- (Marimba sounds) can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there. 
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together, we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. 
Because of course, the ear is subject to all sorts of things. 
The room we happen to be in, the amplification, the quality of the instrument, the type of sticks -- (Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) Etc., etc., they're all different. 
(Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) Same amount of weight, but different sound colors. 
And that's basically what we are; we're just human beings, but we all have our own little sound colors, as it were, that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things. 
And as I grew older, I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London, and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue, you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf musician.'" And I just couldn't quite accept that. 
And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept." 
And as a result, once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice, they accepted me. 
And not only that, what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom. 
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand. 
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry. 
And every single entry had to be listened to, experienced, and then, based on the musical ability, then that person could either enter or not. 
And so therefore, this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions, and I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. 
The interesting thing about this as well, though -- (Applause) is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us -- we well know that music really is our daily medicine. 
I say "music," but actually I mean "sound." 
Because some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician -- when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges, who may not be able to control his movements, who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. -- suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument, and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba, and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost -- I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps -- but something like this -- let me change -- (Soft marimba sounds) (Soft marimba sounds end) Something that's so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be, because I'm on top of the sound. 
I have the sound coming this way. 
He would have the sound coming through the resonators. 
If there were no resonators on here, we would have: (Marimba sounds) So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience, those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience, either. 
Every single one of us, depending on where we're sitting, will experience this sound quite, quite differently. 
And of course, being the participator of the sound, and that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce, for example, this sound: (No sound) Can you hear anything? 
Exactly -- because I'm not even touching it. 
(Laughter) But yet, we get the sensation of something happening. 
In the same way that when I see a tree moves, then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound. 
Do you see what I mean? 
Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening. 
So there's always, always that huge -- I mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from. 
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience, and not by learning a piece of music, putting on someone else's interpretation of it, buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music, and so on and so forth, because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic, and something that I can fully experience the journey of. 
So it may be that, in certain halls, this dynamic may well work. 
(Soft marimba sounds) (Soft marimba sounds end) It may be that in other halls, they're simply not going to experience that at all, and so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be -- (Marimba sounds) (Marimba sounds end) Do you see what I mean? 
So, because of this explosion in access to sound, especially through the Deaf community, this has not only affected how music institutions, how schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy -- although, of course, being a participator of music, that definitely is the case as well -- but it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. 
There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare I say. 
But by that I mean, where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. 
The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad, so huge, so incredible. 
There's always something: it may sound good up there, may not be so good there; it may be great there, but terrible up there; maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc. 
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced. 
So therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired, and who are participators of sound. 
And this is quite interesting. 
I cannot give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls, but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years, we've been saying, "Well, how on earth can they experience music? They're deaf." 
We go like that, and we imagine that's what deafness is about. 
Or we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about. 
If we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk. 
It may be that they can walk three, four, five steps. 
That, to them, means they can walk. 
In a year's time, it could be two extra steps. 
In another year's time, three extra steps. 
Those are hugely important aspects to think about. 
So when we do listen to each other, it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills, to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber, to stop the judgment. 
For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music, it's very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece. No, I don't like that piece," and so on. 
And I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time. 
It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music. 
And you know, one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid. 
So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way. 
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this. 
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder." 
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. 
Now, I don't mean just the sound; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves. 
And please try to create that through your clapping. 
Try, just -- please try. 
(Loud clapping sounds) (Clapping ends) Snow. 
(Laughter) Snow. 
(Soft clapping sounds) Have you ever heard snow? 
Audience: No. 
(Laughter) Try again. Try again: snow. 
(No sound) See, you're awake. 
Rain. 
(Light clapping sounds) EG: (Laughs) Not bad. Not bad. 
The interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question. 
Now -- great imagination, thank you very much. 
However, not one of you got out of your seats to think, "Right! How can I clap? 
OK, maybe: (Clapping sounds) Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds. 
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds." 
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands. 
In the same way, when we listen to music, we assume that it's all being fed through here. 
This is how we experience music. 
Of course, it's not. 
We experience thunder, thunder, thunder. 
Think, think, think. 
Listen, listen, listen. 
Now, what can we do with thunder? 
I remember my teacher, when I first started, my very first lesson, I was all prepared with sticks, ready to go. 
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart, arms at a more or less 90-degree angle, sticks in a more or less V shape, keep this amount of space here, etc. 
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." -- where I was just probably going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum because I was thinking of so many other things, he said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week." 
So -- heavens! What was I to do? 
I no longer required the sticks. 
I wasn't allowed to have these sticks. 
I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did. 
Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell. 
(Drum sounds) Experimented with my body. 
Experimented with all sorts of things. 
(Drum sounds) (Drum sounds end) And of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises. 
(Laughter) But nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience, because where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music? 
Where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book? 
So we never, ever dealt with actual study books. 
So for example, one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player as opposed to a musician, is basically, straightforward single-stroke rolls. 
(Drum sounds) Like that, and then we get a little faster -- (Drum sounds) and a little faster -- (Drum sounds) and a little faster, and so on and so forth. 
What does this piece require? 
Single-stroke rolls. 
(Drum sound) So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music? 
And that's exactly what he did. 
And interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student at a so-called "music institution," all of that went out of the window. 
We had to study from study books. 
And constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to? 
I need to play a piece of music." 
"Well, this will help your control." 
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that? 
I need to relate it to a piece of music. 
You know, I need to say something. 
Why am I practicing paradiddles? 
(Drum sounds) Is it just literally for control, for hand-stick control? 
Why am I doing that? 
I need to have the reason, and the reason has to be by saying something through the music." 
And by saying something through music, which basically is sound, we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people. 
But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage. 
That's up to you, when you walk through a hall, because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. 
I may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry when I play certain pieces of music, but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing. 
So please, the next time you go to a concert, just allow your body to open up, allow your body to be this resonating chamber. 
Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is. 
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound, because they're hearing the contact of the stick -- (Drum sound) on the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood, or the bow on the string, etc., or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass. 
They're experiencing that rawness there. 
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure, which is before the sound is actually happening. 
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike, or breath, is being pulled. 
Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night. 
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses. 
But thank you very much for having me! 
(Applause) (Applause ends) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) 

It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland, because until a couple of years ago, people knew hardly anything about us, and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us. 
But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things. 
First, of course, the economic meltdown. 
It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay. 
(Laughter) Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve. 
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends, including President Obama. 
By the way, the pronunciation is "Eyjafjallajokull." 
None of your media got it right. 
(Laughter) But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly. 
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital, which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007, just over a year before the economic collapse hit. 
Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm? 
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone. 
And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country. 
But I can surely tell you that in my country, much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere, men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector, and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems. 
(Applause) So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable, to found a financial services firm based on our values, and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance. 
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland. 
We weren't known as the typical "women" women in Iceland up until then. 
So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then. 
And we got a great group of people to join us -- principled people with great skills, and investors with a vision and values to match ours. 
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients. 
And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that -- and also there's a factor of luck and timing -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values. 
So let me share with you our values. 
We believe in risk awareness. 
What does that mean? 
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking, and we will not invest in things we don't understand. 
Not a complicated thing. 
But in 2007, at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures, it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market. 
We also believe in straight-talking, telling it as it is, using simple language that people understand, telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides, and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter, like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us. 
And, although we do work in the financial sector, where Excel is king, we believe in emotional capital. 
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence. 
It is actually people that make money and lose money, not Excel spreadsheets. 
(Applause) Last, but not least, we believe in profit with principles. 
We care how we make our profit. 
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers, we are willing to do it with a long-term view, and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter. 
So we like to see profits, plus positive social and environmental benefits, when we invest. 
But it wasn't just about the values, although we are convinced that they matter. 
It was also about a business opportunity. 
It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend, that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come. 
The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men; it is actually about women being different from men, bringing different values and different ways to the table. 
So what do you get? You get better decision-making, and you get less herd behavior, and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results. 
But one has to wonder, now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland -- and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now, and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well. 
Now that we've had all that happen, and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables, will we see business and finance change? 
Will government change? 
Well I'll give you my straight talk about this. 
I have days that I believe, but I have days that I'm full of doubt. 
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us? 
(Applause) Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -- to do the same things over and over again, hoping for a different outcome. 
So I guess the world is insane, because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again, hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us. 
I want to see more revolutionary thinking, and I remain hopeful. 
Like TED, I believe in people. 
And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious, and they are going to start voting with their wallets, and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside, if they don't do it from the inside. 
But I'm more of the revolutionary, and I should be; I'm from Iceland. 
We have a long history of strong, courageous, independent women, ever since the Viking age. 
And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society, I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday -- October 24, 1975. 
Women in Iceland took the day off. 
From work or from home, they took the day off, and nothing worked in Iceland. 
(Laughter) They marched into the center of Reykjavik, and they put women's issues onto the agenda. 
And some say this was the start of a global movement. 
For me it was the start of a long journey, but I decided that day to matter. 
Five years later, Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president -- first female to become head of state, single mom, a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed. 
And at one of the campaign sessions, she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president -- she was a woman, and even half a woman. 
That night she won the election, because she came back -- not just because of his crappy behavior -- but she came back and said, "Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation; I'm going to lead it." 
(Applause) So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today. 
But in spite of that, I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman. 
Started in corporate America, and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual, that women and men would have just the same opportunities. 
But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that. 
We are not the same, and it's great. Because of our differences, we create and sustain life. 
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge. 
The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either/or choices in life -- either it's men or it's women. 
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance. 
So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there, and let's start thinking about doing good business. 
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I grew up in New York City, between Harlem and the Bronx. 
Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating -- no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects. 
I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the "man box." 
See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man. 
Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man. 
But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood. 
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay. 
They're 11 and 12. 
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay. 
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I, we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom: Kendall and Jay. 
(Laughter) And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying. 
It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out. 
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important. 
Now Kendall on the other hand -- and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her -- he'd come to me crying, it's like as soon as I would hear him cry, a clock would go off. 
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds, which means, by the time he got to me, I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying? 
Hold your head up. Look at me. 
Explain to me what's wrong. 
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you. 
Why are you crying?" 
And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, "Just go in your room. 
Just go on, go on in your room. 
Sit down, get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a --" what? 
(Audience: Man.) Like a man. 
And he's five years old. 
And as I grow in life, I would say to myself, "My God, what's wrong with me? 
What am I doing? Why would I do this?" 
And I think back. 
I think back to my father. 
There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family. 
My brother, Henry, he died tragically when we were teenagers. 
We lived in New York City, as I said. 
We lived in the Bronx at the time, and the burial was in a place called Long Island, it was about two hours outside of the city. 
And as we were preparing to come back from the burial, the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city. 
And the limousine empties out. 
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out, but my father and I stayed in the limousine, and no sooner than the women got out, he burst out crying. 
He didn't want cry in front of me, but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city, and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women. 
And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground -- something I just can't even imagine. 
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying. 
I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men, this fear that just has us paralyzed, holding us hostage to this man box. 
I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy, a football player, and I asked him, I said, "How would you feel if, in front of all the players, your coach told you you were playing like a girl?" 
Now I expected him to say something like, I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that. 
No, the boy said to me -- the boy said to me, "It would destroy me." 
And I said to myself, "God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?" 
(Applause) It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old. 
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city. 
At this time we're living in the Bronx, and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny. 
He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys. 
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys. 
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good. 
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder, "What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?" 
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good. 
He was a troubled kid. 
His mother had died from a heroin overdose. 
He was being raised by his grandmother. 
His father wasn't on the set. 
His grandmother had two jobs. 
He was home alone a lot. 
But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man. 
He was cool. He was fine. 
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine." 
He was having sex. 
We all looked up to him. 
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something -- just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what. 
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony." 
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid. 
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs." 
Johnny call, you go. 
So I run right upstairs. 
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?" 
Now I immediately knew what he meant. 
Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, "Do you want some?" meant one of two things: sex or drugs -- and we weren't doing drugs. 
Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy. 
Two things: One, I never had sex. 
We don't talk about that as men. 
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life, the first time you had sex. 
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two. 
There ain't no first time. 
(Laughter) The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any. 
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl. 
Women are objects, especially sexual objects. 
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that. 
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes." 
He told me to go in his room. 
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila. 
She's 16 years old. 
She's nude. 
She's what I know today to be mentally ill, higher-functioning at times than others. 
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her. 
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her. 
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her. 
Because, while Sheila never said no, she also never said yes. 
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same. 
So when I go in the room, I close the door. 
Folks, I'm petrified. 
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything, and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something. 
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room. 
So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up. 
So now there's a living room full of guys. 
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office. 
And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, "It was good," and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door. 
Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught. 
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening. 
This fear, getting outside the man box, totally enveloped me. 
It was way more important to me, about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her. 
See collectively, we as men are taught to have less value in women, to view them as property and the objects of men. 
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women. 
We as men, good men, the large majority of men, we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization. 
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it. 
You see, we have to come to understand that less value, property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it. 
So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem. 
The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions, is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad. 
So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay. 
The world I envision for her -- how do I want men to be acting and behaving? 
I need you on board. I need you with me. 
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause) I remember asking a nine-year-old boy, I asked a nine-year-old boy, "What would life be like for you, if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?" 
He said to me, "I would be free." 
Thank you folks. 
(Applause) 

Now I'm going to give you a story. 
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. 
Let me begin with my parents. 
I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. 
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s -- '50s and '60s didn't belong to girls in India. 
They belonged to boys. 
They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married. 
My family, in my city, and almost in the country, was unique. 
We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys. 
We were four girls and no boys. 
And my parents were part of a landed property family. 
My father defied his own grandfather, almost to the point of disinheritance, because he decided to educate all four of us. 
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. 
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents, and when we go to school, we don't choose our school. 
Children don't choose a school. 
They just get the school which parents choose for them. 
So this is the foundation time which I got. 
I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters. 
And my father used to say at that time, "I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world." 
I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened. 
I'm the only one who's left in India. 
One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian. 
So we are four of us in four corners of the world. 
And since I said they're my role models, I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. 
One, they said, "Life is on an incline. 
You either go up, or you come down." 
And the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad. 
Out of 100, 90 are your creation. 
They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. 
If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it. 
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing. 
It's like a death of a relative, or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake. 
You can't do a thing about it. 
You've got to just respond to the situation. 
But that response comes out of those 90 points. 
Since I'm a product of this philosophy, of 90/10, and secondly, "life on an incline," that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. 
I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. 
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry, and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. 
I thought I must tell you this. 
Why I said this, is the background. 
This is what comes next. 
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman, a woman with indefatigable stamina, because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc. 
But I joined the Indian Police Service, and then it was a new pattern of policing. 
For me the policing stood for power to correct, power to prevent and power to detect. 
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India -- the power to prevent. 
Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it, or power to punish. 
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up. 
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10? 
So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men. 
I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different, because this was the way I was different. 
And I redefined policing concepts in India. 
I'm going to take you on two journeys, my policing journey and my prison journey. 
What you see, if you see the title called "PM's car held." 
This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. 
(Laughter) That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it. 
It'll never happen again in India, because now it was once and forever. 
And the rule was, because I was sensitive, I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice. 
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service. 
I had other options, but I didn't choose them. 
So I'm going to move on. 
This is about tough policing, equal policing. 
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen." 
So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings, postings which others would say no. 
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. 
Normally police officers don't want to do prison. 
They sent me to prison to lock me up, thinking, "Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. 
Let's lock her up." 
Here I got a prison assignment. 
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. 
Obviously, it was. 
But 10,000 men, of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 -- 9,000 plus about 600 were men. 
Terrorists, rapists, burglars, gangsters -- some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. 
And then how did I deal with them? 
The first day when I went in, I didn't know how to look at them. 
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?" 
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit. 
I said, "Do you pray?" 
And they didn't say anything. 
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?" 
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray." 
I prayed for them, and things started to change. 
This is a visual of education inside the prison. 
Friends, this has never happened, where everybody in the prison studies. 
I started this with community support. 
Government had no budget. 
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. 
This was initiated in Delhi prison. 
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. 
These are hundreds of classes. 
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program -- the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. 
We converted this into an ashram -- from a prison to an ashram through education. 
I think that's the bigger change. 
It was the beginning of a change. 
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. 
Books came from donated schoolbooks. 
Stationery was donated. 
Everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison. 
Now if I'd not done that, it would have been a hellhole. 
That's the second landmark. 
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey, which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. 
One, the numbers you'll never get to see. 
Secondly, this concept. 
This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners. 
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. 
This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. 
And this is what transformed. 
You want to know more about this, go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana." 
You will hear about it, and you will love it. 
And write to me on KiranBedi.com, and I'll respond to you. 
Let me show you the next slide. 
I took the same concept of mindfulness, because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison? 
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. 
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. 
Not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind. 
I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was "we" and "they," and that the people don't cooperate. 
This worked. 
This is a feedback box called a petition box. 
This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints, listen to grievances. 
This was a magic box. 
This was a sensitive box. 
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. 
If you see somebody in the blue -- yeah, this guy -- he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. 
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. 
Let me wrap it up. 
I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the under-served children, which is thousands -- India is all about thousands. 
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India. 
That's a big way we, as a small group of activists, have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. 
Friends, you will hear a lot about it. 
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving, and that's the movement and ambition of my life. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly, and in many of the places where it counts the most, women are, in fact, taking control of everything. 
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college. 
Not a lot of women did. 
And now, for every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. 
Women, for the first time this year, became the majority of the American workforce. 
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions -- doctors, lawyers, bankers, accountants. 
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days, and in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two of them are dominated by women. 
So the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men, believe it or not, and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture -- what our romantic comedies look like, what our marriages look like, what our dating lives look like, and our new set of superheroes. 
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated -- tough, rugged, in control of his own environment. 
A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen, who is a parody of American manhood, and that's what we have in our commercials today. 
The phrase "first-born son" is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me. 
In American fertility clinics, 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys. 
And in places where you wouldn't think, such as South Korea, India and China, the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little, and families are no longer strongly preferring first-born sons. 
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots, you can see the evidence everywhere. 
You can see it in college graduation patterns, in job projections, in our marriage statistics, you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later, and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference, that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women. 
Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. 
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind. 
But the difference is that, back then, it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires, whereas this time, it's not about passion, and it's not about any kind of movement. 
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. 
The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end, believe it or not, and that's why I talk about the "end of men." 
Now all you men out there, this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes, because the point is that this is happening to all of us. 
I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love. 
And this is why I like to talk about this, because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful. 
But if we do take account of it, then I think it will go much more smoothly. 
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago. 
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else, and I started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women. 
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago when I read a book by Susan Faludi called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man," in which she described how hard the recession had hit men, and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession. 
And I realized that two things were different this time around. 
The first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men -- that this was reflecting a deeper underlying shift in our global economy. 
And second, that the story was no longer just about the crisis of men, but it was also about what was happening to women. 
And now look at this second set of slides. 
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years. 
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago. 
Women, a majority of the workplace. 
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs. 
This second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift. 
And look at that last headline -- young women earning more than young men. 
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm. 
They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future. 
And they expected that it would be young families, or young men, just like it had always been. 
But in fact, they found something very surprising. 
It was young, single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood. 
And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding, to do a nationwide survey. 
So they spread out all the census data, and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker, which is that in 1,997 out of 2,000 communities, women, young women, were making more money than young men. 
So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them. 
Now, I've just laid out the picture for you, but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening. 
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph, and what you'll see on this graph -- it begins in 1973, just before women start flooding the workforce, and it brings us up to our current day. 
And basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy. 
Now what does that mean? 
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs -- and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy. 
This has been going on for 40 years now. 
But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women. 
You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue. 
You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class, but see what happens to women and see what happens to men. 
There we go. 
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class. 
Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men. 
The men sort of stagnate there, while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs. 
So what's that about? 
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game, or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high. 
But of course, it's not about that. 
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot. 
We used to have a manufacturing economy, which was about building goods and products, and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy. 
Those two economies require very different skills, and as it happens, women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been. 
It used to be that you were a guy who went to high school who didn't have a college degree, but you had a specific set of skills, and with the help of a union, you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life. 
But that really isn't true anymore. 
This new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength, which is what's helped men along all these years. 
What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. 
You basically need intelligence, you need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be, and those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing. 
If you look at management theory these days, it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like General Patton, right? 
You would be issuing orders from above. 
You would be very hierarchical. 
You would tell everyone below you what to do. 
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now. 
If you read management books now, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" -- who can get the employees to talk to each other, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. 
And those are all things that women do very well. 
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect. 
Women enter the workplace at the top, and then at the working class, all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home. 
So that's childcare, elder care and food preparation. 
So those are all the jobs that are growing, and those are jobs that women tend to do. 
Now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work, middle-aged, former steelworker guy to watch their children at home, and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet. 
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now, you have to look at our future workforce. 
And here the story is fairly simple. 
Women are getting college degrees at a faster rate than men. 
Why? This is a real mystery. 
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college, to community college, say, and retool themselves, learn a new set of skills? 
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that. 
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers, and they can't seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college. 
So for some reason men just don't end up going back to college. 
And what's even more disturbing is what's happening with younger boys. 
There's been about a decade of research about what people are calling the "boy crisis." 
Now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys, for whatever reason, are doing worse in school than very young girls, and people have theories about that. 
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum, and little girls are better at that than little boys? 
Or that we require kids to sit still too much, and so boys initially feel like failures? 
And some people say it's because, in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school. 
Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it, so I don't have the answer. 
But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert, who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa, to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse. 
(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter. 
I mean they have much larger vocabulary. 
They learn much faster. 
They are more controlled. 
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys. 
Hanna Rosin: And why is that? 
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely. 
HR: So there you go. 
This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to visit a college in Kansas City -- working-class college. 
Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life -- that my husband and I would both work, and that we would equally raise the children. 
But these college girls had a completely different view of their future. 
Basically, the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day, that their husband would maybe have a job, but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies. 
And this was kind of a shocker to me. 
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls: "Men are the new ball and chain." 
(Laughter) Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right? 
And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain, and that's why I talk about us all going through this together. 
The night after I talked to these college girls, I also went to a men's group in Kansas, and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which I spoke to you about earlier. 
They were men who had been contractors, or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom, and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. 
And the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age. 
He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority, that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore, and they were not really the providers. 
So who were they? 
And this was very disheartening for them. 
And what he did was he wrote down on the board "$85,000," and he said, "That's her salary," and then he wrote down "$12,000." 
"That's your salary. 
So who's the man now?" he asked them. 
"Who's the damn man? 
She's the man now." 
And that really sent a shudder through the room. 
And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this, because I think it can be pretty painful, and we really have to work through it. 
And the other reason it's kind of urgent is because it's not just happening in the U.S. 
It's happening all over the world. 
In India, poor women are learning English faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in India. 
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses, small businesses, faster than men. 
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea. 
Over several decades, South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about. 
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code. 
And if women failed to birth male children, they were basically treated like domestic servants. 
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child. 
But over the '70s and '80s, the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize, and so what they did was, they started to push women into the workforce. 
Now they've been asking a question since 1985: "How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?" 
And now look at the chart. 
That's from 1985 to 2003. 
How much do you prefer a first-born son? 
So you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture. 
Now because we haven't fully processed this information, it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways, where you can see that the stereotypes are changing. 
And so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up, who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can't find a job. 
And they come up in lots of different forms. 
So we have the perpetual adolescent. 
We have the charmless misanthrope. 
Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato. 
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive, the sexiest man alive gets romantically played these days in a movie. 
And then on the female side, you have the opposite, in which you have these crazy superhero women. 
You've got Lady Gaga. 
You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie. 
And it's not just for the young, right? 
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days. 
And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal. 
So for a long time in the economic sphere, we've lived with the term "glass ceiling." 
Now I've never really liked this term. 
For one thing, it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another, because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling. 
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women. 
And we have a lot of skill and experience, but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling? 
And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase. 
What crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling? 
So the image that I like to think of, instead of glass ceiling, is the high bridge. 
It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge, but it's also pretty exhilarating, because it's beautiful up there, and you're looking out on a beautiful view. 
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling. 
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables. 
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through. 
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you. 
You can bring your husband along. 
You can bring your friends, or your colleagues, or your babysitter to walk along with you. 
And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready. 
But the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge, that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge, but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it. 
Thanks very much. 
(Applause) 

I have been teaching for a long time, and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students. 
In 1931, my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade. 
She went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived. 
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head; and she needed to go there to get the information, because that's how you learned. 
Fast-forward a generation: this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove, where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse. 
And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher, stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head, and take it with him, because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world. 
When I was a kid, we had a set of encyclopedias at my house. 
It was purchased the year I was born, and it was extraordinary, because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information. 
The information was inside my house and it was awesome. 
This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level. 
But the information was closer to me. 
I could get access to it. 
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet. 
Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool, I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas, small town Kansas, where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely, small-town, rural Kansas school district, where I was teaching my favorite subject, American government. 
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government, loved the political system. 
Kids in the 12th grade: not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system. 
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic. 
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves. 
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it. 
I posed a problem in front of them, which was to put on an election forum for their own community. 
They produced flyers. They called offices. 
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries. 
They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates. 
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well, and really had this robust experiential learning. 
The older teachers -- more experienced -- looked at me and went, "Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done." 
(Laughter) "She doesn't know what she's in for." 
But I knew that the kids would show up, and I believed it, and I told them every week what I expected out of them. 
And that night, all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it. 
I had to just sit and watch. 
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic. 
It meant something to them. 
And they will step up. 
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona, where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years, this time with middle school students. 
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government. 
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography. 
Again, "thrilled" to learn. 
But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona, was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school, and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities. 
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina, which is the gentleman that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after. 
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us. 
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses. 
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip. 
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful, and they know what to do with it. 
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive. 
I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world, that they could identify that had done a similar thing. 
I asked them to produce a little movie about it. 
It's the first time we'd done this. 
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer, but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it. 
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves, what they're willing to share. 
The last question of the assignment is: how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people? 
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary. 
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today. 
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy, which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia. 
We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently. 
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus. 
So what do you do when the information is all around you? 
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information? 
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program, so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday, taking them home, getting access to information. 
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students, is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process. 
We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test, and I am here to share with you: it is not learning. 
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask, to tell kids to never be wrong. 
To ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn. 
So we did this project, and this is one of the artifacts of the project. 
I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure. 
My students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill. 
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media, and take a look at what were the interesting components of it, and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history. 
And they had certain criteria to do it. 
They were a little uncomfortable with it, because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it. 
They can talk -- they're very smooth, and they can write very, very well, but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them. 
But I gave them the room to just do the thing. 
Go create. Go figure it out. 
Let's see what we can do. 
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint. 
This was done in like two or three days. 
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it. 
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?" 
And they immediately went, "There it is." 
Didn't read anything. "There it is." 
And I said, "Well what makes it great?" 
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color. 
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud. 
And I said, "Go read it." 
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome." 
And then we went to another one -- it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process, because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect, or whether or not it was what I could create. 
It asked them to create for themselves, and it allowed them to fail, process, learn from. 
And when we do another round of this in my class this year, they will do better this time, because learning has to include an amount of failure, because failure is instructional in the process. 
There are a million pictures that I could click through here, and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning, of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information, but instead, ask them what they can do with it. 
Ask them really interesting questions. 
They will not disappoint. 
Ask them to go to places, to see things for themselves, to actually experience the learning, to play, to inquire. 
This is one of my favorite photos, because this was taken on Tuesday, when I asked the students to go to the polls. 
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting, and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that. 
But this is learning too, because we asked them to go out into real spaces. 
The main point is that, if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning, empowering student voice and embracing failure, we're missing the mark. 
And everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities, because we won't get there with a standardized test, and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer. 
We know how to do this better, and it's time to do better. 
(Applause) 

I started teaching MBA students 17 years ago. 
Sometimes I run into my students years later. 
And when I run into them, a funny thing happens. 
I don't remember just their faces; I also remember where exactly in the classroom they were sitting. 
And I remember who they were sitting with as well. 
This is not because I have any special superpowers of memory. 
The reason I can remember them is because they are creatures of habit. 
They are sitting with their favorite people in their favorite seats. 
They find their twins, they stay with them for the whole year. 
Now, the danger of this for my students is they're at risk of leaving the university with just a few people who are exactly like them. 
They're going to squander their chance for an international, diverse network. 
How could this happen to them? 
My students are open-minded. 
They come to business school precisely so that they can get great networks. 
Now, all of us socially narrow in our lives, in our school, in work, and so I want you to think about this one. 
How many of you here brought a friend along for this talk? 
I want you to look at your friend a little bit. 
Are they of the same nationality as you? 
Are they of the same gender as you? 
Are they of the same race? 
Really look at them closely. 
Don't they kind of look like you as well? 
(Laughter) The muscle people are together, and the people with the same hairstyles and the checked shirts. 
We all do this in life. 
We all do it in life, and in fact, there's nothing wrong with this. 
It makes us comfortable to be around people who are similar. 
The problem is when we're on a precipice, right? 
When we're in trouble, when we need new ideas, when we need new jobs, when we need new resources -- this is when we really pay a price for living in a clique. 
Mark Granovetter, the sociologist, had a famous paper "The Strength of Weak Ties," and what he did in this paper is he asked people how they got their jobs. 
And what he learned was that most people don't get their jobs through their strong ties -- their father, their mother, their significant other. 
They instead get jobs through weak ties, people who they just met. 
So if you think about what the problem is with your strong ties, think about your significant other, for example. 
The network is redundant. 
Everybody that they know, you know. 
Or I hope you know them. Right? 
Your weak ties -- people you just met today -- they are your ticket to a whole new social world. 
The thing is that we have this amazing ticket to travel our social worlds, but we don't use it very well. 
Sometimes we stay awfully close to home. 
And today, what I want to talk about is: What are those habits that keep human beings so close to home, and how can we be a little bit more intentional about traveling our social universe? 
So let's look at the first strategy. 
The first strategy is to use a more imperfect social search engine. 
What I mean by a social search engine is how you are finding and filtering your friends. 
And so people always tell me, "I want to get lucky through the network. 
I want to get a new job. I want to get a great opportunity." 
And I say, "Well, that's really hard, because your networks are so fundamentally predictable." 
Map out your habitual daily footpath, and what you'll probably discover is that you start at home, you go to your school or your workplace, you maybe go up the same staircase or elevator, you go to the bathroom -- the same bathroom -- and the same stall in that bathroom, you end up in the gym, then you come right back home. 
It's like stops on a train schedule. 
It's that predictable. 
It's efficient, but the problem is, you're seeing exactly the same people. 
Make your network slightly more inefficient. 
Go to a bathroom on a different floor. 
You encounter a whole new network of people. 
The other side of it is how we are actually filtering. 
And we do this automatically. 
The minute we meet someone, we are looking at them, we meet them, we are initially seeing, "You're interesting." 
"You're not interesting." "You're relevant." 
We do this automatically. We can't even help it. 
And what I want to encourage you to do instead is to fight your filters. 
I want you to take a look around this room, and I want you to identify the least interesting person that you see, and I want you to connect with them over the next coffee break. 
And I want you to go even further than that. 
What I want you to do is find the most irritating person you see as well and connect with them. 
What you are doing with this exercise is you are forcing yourself to see what you don't want to see, to connect with who you don't want to connect with, to widen your social world. 
To truly widen, what we have to do is, we've got to fight our sense of choice. 
We've got to fight our choices. 
And my students hate this, but you know what I do? 
I won't let them sit in their favorite seats. 
I move them around from seat to seat. 
I force them to work with different people so there are more accidental bumps in the network where people get a chance to connect with each other. 
And we studied exactly this kind of an intervention at Harvard University. 
At Harvard, when you look at the rooming groups, there's freshman rooming groups, people are not choosing those roommates. 
They're of all different races, all different ethnicities. 
Maybe people are initially uncomfortable with those roommates, but the amazing thing is, at the end of a year with those students, they're able to overcome that initial discomfort. 
They're able to find deep-level commonalities with people. 
So the takeaway here is not just "take someone out to coffee." 
It's a little more subtle. 
It's "go to the coffee room." 
When researchers talk about social hubs, what makes a social hub so special is you can't choose; you can't predict who you're going to meet in that place. 
And so with these social hubs, the paradox is, interestingly enough, to get randomness, it requires, actually, some planning. 
In one university that I worked at, there was a mail room on every single floor. 
What that meant is that the only people who would bump into each other are those who are actually on that floor and who are bumping into each other anyway. 
At another university I worked at, there was only one mail room, so all the faculty from all over that building would run into each other in that social hub. 
A simple change in planning, a huge difference in the traffic of people and the accidental bumps in the network. 
Here's my question for you: What are you doing that breaks you from your social habits? 
Where do you find yourself in places where you get injections of unpredictable diversity? 
And my students give me some wonderful examples. 
They tell me when they're doing pickup basketball games, or my favorite example is when they go to a dog park. 
They tell me it's even better than online dating when they're there. 
So the real thing that I want you to think about is we've got to fight our filters. 
We've got to make ourselves a little more inefficient, and by doing so, we are creating a more imprecise social search engine. 
And you're creating that randomness, that luck that is going to cause you to widen your travels, through your social universe. 
But in fact, there's more to it than that. 
Sometimes we actually buy ourselves a second-class ticket to travel our social universe. 
We are not courageous when we reach out to people. 
Let me give you an example of that. 
A few years ago, I had a very eventful year. 
That year, I managed to lose a job, I managed to get a dream job overseas and accept it, I had a baby the next month, I got very sick, I was unable to take the dream job. 
And so in a few weeks, what ended up happening was, I lost my identity as a faculty member, and I got a very stressful new identity as a mother. 
What I also got was tons of advice from people. 
And the advice I despised more than any other advice was, "You've got to go network with everybody." 
When your psychological world is breaking down, the hardest thing to do is to try and reach out and build up your social world. 
And so we studied exactly this idea on a much larger scale. 
What we did was we looked at high and low socioeconomic status people, and we looked at them in two situations. 
We looked at them first in a baseline condition, when they were quite comfortable. 
And what we found was that our lower socioeconomic status people, when they were comfortable, were actually reaching out to more people. 
They thought of more people. 
They were also less constrained in how they were networking. 
They were thinking of more diverse people than the higher-status people. 
Then we asked them to think about maybe losing a job. 
And once they thought about that, the networks they generated completely differed. 
The lower socioeconomic status people reached inwards. 
They thought of fewer people. 
They thought of less-diverse people. 
The higher socioeconomic status people thought of more people, they thought of a broader network, they were positioning themselves to bounce back from that setback. 
Let's consider what this actually means. 
Imagine that you were being spontaneously unfriended by everyone in your network other than your mom, your dad and your dog. 
(Laughter) This is essentially what we are doing at these moments when we need our networks the most. 
Imagine -- this is what we're doing. We're doing it to ourselves. 
We are mentally compressing our networks when we are being harassed, when we are being bullied, when we are threatened about losing a job, when we feel down and weak. 
We are closing ourselves off, isolating ourselves, creating a blind spot where we actually don't see our resources. 
We don't see our allies, we don't see our opportunities. 
How can we overcome this? 
Two simple strategies. 
One strategy is simply to look at your list of Facebook friends and LinkedIn friends just so you remind yourself of people who are there beyond those that automatically come to mind. 
And in our own research, one of the things we did was, we considered Claude Steele's research on self-affirmation: simply thinking about your own values, networking from a place of strength. 
What Leigh Thompson, Hoon-Seok Choi and I were able to do is, we found that people who had affirmed themselves first were able to take advice from people who would otherwise be threatening to them. 
Here's a last exercise. 
I want you to look in your email in-box, and I want you to look at the last time you asked somebody for a favor. 
And I want you to look at the language that you used. 
Did you say things like, "Oh, you're a great resource," or "I owe you one," "I'm obligated to you." 
All of this language represents a metaphor. 
It's a metaphor of economics, of a balance sheet, of accounting, of transactions. 
And when we think about human relations in a transactional way, it is fundamentally uncomfortable to us as human beings. 
We must think about human relations and reaching out to people in more humane ways. 
Here's an idea as to how to do so. 
Look at words like "please," "thank you," "you're welcome" in other languages. 
Look at the literal translation of these words. 
Each of these words is a word that helps us impose upon other people in our social networks. 
And so, the word "thank you," if you look at it in Spanish, Italian, French, "gracias," "grazie," "merci" in French. 
Each of them are "grace" and "mercy." 
They are godly words. 
There's nothing economic or transactional about those words. 
The word "you're welcome" is interesting. 
The great persuasion theorist Robert Cialdini says we've got to get our favors back. 
So we need to emphasize the transaction a little bit more. 
He says, "Let's not say 'You're welcome.' Instead say, 'I know you'd do the same for me.'" But sometimes it may be helpful to not think in transactional ways, to eliminate the transaction, to make it a little bit more invisible. 
And in fact, if you look in Chinese, the word "bú kè qì" in Chinese, "You're welcome," means, "Don't be formal; we're family. We don't need to go through those formalities." 
And "kembali" in Indonesian is "Come back to me." 
When you say "You're welcome" next time, think about how you can maybe eliminate the transaction and instead strengthen that social tie. 
Maybe "It's great to collaborate," or "That's what friends are for." 
I want you to think about how you think about this ticket that you have to travel your social universe. 
Here's one metaphor. 
It's a common metaphor: "Life is a journey." Right? 
It's a train ride, and you're a passenger on the train, and there are certain people with you. 
Certain people get on this train, and some stay with you, some leave at different stops, new ones may enter. 
I love this metaphor, it's a beautiful one. 
But I want you to consider a different metaphor. 
This one is passive, being a passenger on that train, and it's quite linear. 
You're off to some particular destination. 
Why not instead think of yourself as an atom, bumping up against other atoms, maybe transferring energy with them, bonding with them a little and maybe creating something new on your travels through the social universe. 
Thank you so much. 
And I hope we bump into each other again. 
(Applause) 

Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins -- the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son, Declan. 
Obviously a really profound moment, and it changed our lives in many ways. 
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways, and those unexpected ways we later reflected on, that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us, and a year later, we launched Babble, a website for parents. 
Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true. 
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love. 
AV: We did. 
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website. 
It was a website called Nerve.com, the tagline of which was "literate smut." 
It was in theory, and hopefully in practice, a smart online magazine about sex and culture. 
AV: That spawned a dating site. 
But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies. 
You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble, which we did. 
And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see. 
RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing, which is, of course, relevant, but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about. 
It seems to us that when people start dissembling, people start lying about things, that's when it gets really interesting. 
That's a subject that we want to dive into. 
And we've been surprised to find, as young parents, that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex. 
AV: It's true. So like we said, the early years were really wonderful, but they were also really difficult. 
And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting. 
(Laughter) We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework, but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this. 
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this. 
The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying. 
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested, and in fact, it was not like that at all. 
RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at, with these beautiful images, and looked at the scene in our actual living room, it looked a little bit more like this. 
These are our three sons. 
And of course, they're not always crying and screaming, but with three boys, there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should. 
AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us. 
We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing, and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight. 
We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way. 
RG: So today, what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos. 
And of course, there are many more than four things you can't say about parenting, but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally. 
So the first, taboo number one: you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute. 
I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital. 
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child. 
AV: We, or I? 
RG: I'm sorry. 
Misuse of the pronoun. 
Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.) -- and I was there with a catcher's mitt. 
And I was there with my arms open. 
The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful, beautiful child, and I remember, as she was approaching me, the voices of friends saying, "The moment they put the baby in your hands, you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life." 
So I was bracing myself for the moment. 
The baby was coming, and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet. 
And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands, it was an extraordinary moment. 
This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over. 
And you can see, our eyes were glistening. 
I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife, with deep, deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child. 
And it was also, of course, surreal. 
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure. 
I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?" 
And this was all quite remarkable. 
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection, but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later. 
And so we've done something here that is heretical. 
We have charted our love for our child over time. 
(Laughter) This, as you know, is an act of heresy. 
You're not allowed to chart love. 
The reason you're not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing. 
You're either in love, or you're not in love. 
You love, or you don't love. 
And I think the reality is that love is a process, and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that's binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you. 
And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience. 
But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months, maybe their first year, that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion. 
AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up, because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work. 
But we like to joke, in the first few months of all of our children's lives, this is Uncle Rufus. 
(Laughter) RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle. 
AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies. 
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus. 
RG: Uh oh. 
AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds. 
RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he? 
AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here, and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him. 
RG: The far left. AV: No! 
(Laughter) RG: Cruel. 
AV: Nothing more to be said. 
(Laughter) I'll move on to taboo number two. 
You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be. 
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it. 
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me. 
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me, tracking it down till the actual due-date. 
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity. 
That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating. 
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors. 
It was a really wonderful experience, but when I got home, I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out, and I was really surprised by those feelings. 
I did expect it to be difficult, have sleepless nights, constant feedings, but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced, and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me, that I was going to be feeling this way. 
And I called my sister whom I'm very close to -- and had three children -- and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me I was going to be feeling this way, that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?" 
And she said -- I'll never forget -- "It's just not something you want to say to a mother that's having a baby for the first time." 
RG: And of course, we think it's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time. 
And that this, of course, one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents. 
And it's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world. 
So Alisa's experience is not isolated. 
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness. 
Of those, 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two. 
In the process of preparing this, we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time, because here in the Western world, less than 50 percent of us live near our family members, which I think is part of why this is such a tough period. 
So to take one example among many: in Southern India there's a practice known as jholabhari, in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant, moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies, give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born. 
And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. 
AV: So taboo number three: you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine. 
So after we had Declan, we kind of recalibrated our expectations. 
We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against. 
And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant, and I soon learned that we were having a boy, and then when I was five months, we learned that we had lost our child. 
This is actually the last little image we have of him. 
And it was obviously a very difficult time -- really painful. 
As I was working through that mourning process, I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody. 
I really wanted to crawl into a hole, and I didn't really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community. 
And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way, is on a really deep gut level, I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed, frankly, that, in some respects, I had failed at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do. 
And of course, it made me question, if I wasn't able to have another child, what would that mean for my marriage, and just me as a woman. 
So it was a very difficult time. 
As I started working through it more, I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people. 
I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in. 
People I interacted with daily, worked with, was friends with, family members that I had known a long time, had never shared with me their own stories. 
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork, and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of, which was reassuring and also really concerning. 
And I think, miscarriage is an invisible loss. 
There's not really a lot of community support around it. 
There's really no ceremony, rituals, or rites. 
And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life, and there's a lot of community support, and it's something women don't have with miscarriage. 
RG: Which is too bad because, of course, it's a very common and very traumatic experience. 
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage, and I find this astounding. 
In a survey, 74 percent of women said that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful. 
And astoundingly, 22 percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse. 
So taboo number four: you can't say that your average happiness has declined since having a child. 
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family. 
I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day, our first son, Declan, was nine months old, and I was sitting there on the couch, and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness." 
And I got about two-thirds of the way through, and there was a chart on the right-hand side -- on the right-hand page -- that we've labeled here "The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent." 
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies. 
Basically, there's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction, which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness, that doesn't rise again until your first child goes to college. 
So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life, this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into. 
We were despondent. 
AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult, but we'd come out of it, and were really shocked to see this study. 
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining. 
RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents, because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies. 
We said, something is wrong here. 
There's something missing from these studies. 
It can't possibly be that bad. 
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece, and she interviewed four scientists, and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert, and we did indeed find a silver lining. 
So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life. 
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience. 
And so we all remember as children, the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children -- the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation, and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair. 
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves. 
And then, of course, as you get older, it's almost like age is a form of lithium. 
As you get older, you become more stable. 
And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s, is you start to learn to hedge your happiness. 
You start to realize that "Hey, I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps, but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer. 
So I'm not going to go. 
I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go." 
So your average happiness goes up, but you lose those transcendent moments. 
AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child, and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows -- the highs being the first steps, the first smile, your child reading to you for the first time -- the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night. 
But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way, which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying. 
RG: And so in effect, we trade average happiness. 
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments. 
So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this? 
There's another factor in our case. 
We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives, and this is a bonus taboo. 
AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together, especially with three children -- and we are. 
RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end. 
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse. 
In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble, the venture capitalists said, "We categorically don't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives, because there's an extra point of failure. 
It's a bad idea. Don't do it." 
And we obviously went forward. We did. 
We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did, because in this phase of one's life, the incredibly scarce resource is time. 
And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are -- and you're also passionate about your relationship, this is the only way we know how to do it. 
And so the final question that we would ask is: can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards? 
It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy, but they're sometimes pretty quick. 
And so how about that average baseline of happiness? 
Can we move that up a little bit? 
AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about, is really the result of walking into parenting -- and really any long-term partnership for that matter -- with the wrong expectations. 
And if you have the right expectations and expectation management, we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience. 
RG: And so this is what -- And we think that a lot of parents, when you get in there -- in our case anyway -- you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go. 
Get out of the airplane, it turns out you're trekking in Nepal. 
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience, particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched. 
So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty, but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences, that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit. 
RG + AV: Thank you.

I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us. 
There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand. 
Given a scene like this, a modern computer-vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog. 
It can tell you that the woman is smiling. 
It might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute. 
I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and process the world. 
The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans. 
All the interconnections of related situations. 
Maybe you've seen a dog like this one before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs. 
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share and believe and feel, then we're in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary with our own experiences. 
So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images. 
So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it what it thought about a trip to Australia. 
It took a look at the pictures, and it saw a koala. 
It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature. 
Then I shared with it a sequence of images about a house burning down. 
It took a look at the images and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!" 
It sent chills down my spine. 
It saw a horrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive. 
I realized that it recognized the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something worth remarking on positively. 
And part of why it was doing this was because most of the images I had given it were positive images. 
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences. 
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral? 
I realized that, as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots in what it could understand. 
And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases. 
Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping. 
I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces. 
And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s. 
And the same blind spot continues even today in how well we can recognize different people's faces in facial recognition technology. 
I though about the state of the art in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem. 
And that in doing so, we were creating more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify. 
I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five years, in 10 years. 
Humans evolve slowly, with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans and their environment. 
In contrast, artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate. 
And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today will mean for tomorrow. 
CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think the artificial intelligence technology of the future will be. 
Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind." 
Elon Musk warns that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilization. 
Bill Gates has made the point, "I don't understand why people aren't more concerned." 
But these views -- they're part of the story. 
The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we call access and all work with. 
We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to. 
And beyond that, we can share our experience. 
We can share our experiences with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us. 
We can discuss what we love. 
We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time. 
If we all focus on opening up the discussion on AI with foresight towards the future, this will help create a general conversation and awareness about what AI is now, what it can become and all the things that we need to do in order to enable that outcome that best suits us. 
We already see and know this in the technology that we use today. 
We use smart phones and digital assistants and Roombas. 
Are they evil? 
Maybe sometimes. 
Are they beneficial? 
Yes, they're that, too. 
And they're not all the same. 
And there you already see a light shining on what the future holds. 
The future continues on from what we build and create right now. 
We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path. 
In our time right now, we shape the AI of tomorrow. 
Technology that immerses us in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds. 
Technology that helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating. 
Technology built on understanding the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars. 
Technology built on understanding images and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world. 
And we also see how technology can lead to problems. 
We have technology today that analyzes physical characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not we might be criminals or terrorists. 
We have technology that crunches through our data, even data relating to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not we might get a loan. 
All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence. 
Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution. 
That means that what we do now will affect what happens down the line and in the future. 
If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now. 
What I'd like to see is something that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment. 
Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone. 
Technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin. 
And so today, what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now. 
AI can turn out in many different ways. 
But in this case, it isn't a self-driving car without any destination. 
This is the car that we are driving. 
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down. 
We choose if we need to make a turn. 
We choose what the AI of the future will be. 
There's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial intelligence can become. 
It will become many things. 
And it's up to us now, in order to figure out what we need to put in place to make sure the outcomes of artificial intelligence are the ones that will be better for all of us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So why do you think the rich should pay more in taxes? 
Why did you buy the latest iPhone? 
Why did you pick your current partner? 
And why did so many people vote for Donald Trump? 
What were the reasons, why did they do it? 
So we ask this kind of question all the time, and we expect to get an answer. 
And when being asked, we expect ourselves to know the answer, to simply tell why we did as we did. 
But do we really know why? 
So when you say that you prefer George Clooney to Tom Hanks, due to his concern for the environment, is that really true? 
So you can be perfectly sincere and genuinely believe that this is the reason that drives your choice, but to me, it may still feel like something is missing. 
As it stands, due to the nature of subjectivity, it is actually very hard to ever prove that people are wrong about themselves. 
So I'm an experimental psychologist, and this is the problem we've been trying to solve in our lab. 
So we wanted to create an experiment that would allow us to challenge what people say about themselves, regardless of how certain they may seem. 
But tricking people about their own mind is hard. 
So we turned to the professionals. 
The magicians. 
So they're experts at creating the illusion of a free choice. 
So when they say, "Pick a card, any card," the only thing you know is that your choice is no longer free. 
So we had a few fantastic brainstorming sessions with a group of Swedish magicians, and they helped us create a method in which we would be able to manipulate the outcome of people's choices. 
This way we would know when people are wrong about themselves, even if they don't know this themselves. 
So I will now show you a short movie showing this manipulation. 
So it's quite simple. 
The participants make a choice, but I end up giving them the opposite. 
And then we want to see: How did they react, and what did they say? 
So it's quite simple, but see if you can spot the magic going on. 
And this was shot with real participants, they don't know what's going on. 
(Video) Petter Johansson: Hi, my name's Petter. 
Woman: Hi, I'm Becka. 
And you'll have to decide which one you find more attractive. 
Becka: OK. 
Becka: OK. 
PJ: Ready? Becka: Yeah. 
PJ: Why did you prefer that one? 
Becka: The smile, I think. 
PJ: Smile. 
Man: One on the left. 
Again, this one just struck me. 
Interesting shot. 
Since I'm a photographer, I like the way it's lit and looks. 
Petter Johansson: But now comes the trick. 
(Video) Woman 1: This one. 
PJ: So they get the opposite of their choice. 
And let's see what happens. 
Woman 2: Um ... 
I think he seems a little more innocent than the other guy. 
Man: The one on the left. 
I like her smile and contour of the nose and face. 
So it's a little more interesting to me, and her haircut. 
Woman 3: This one. 
I like the smirky look better. 
PJ: You like the smirky look better? 
(Laughter) Woman 3: This one. 
PJ: What made you choose him? 
Woman 3: I don't know, he looks a little bit like the Hobbit. 
(Laughter) PJ: And what happens in the end when I tell them the true nature of the experiment? 
Yeah, that's it. I just have to ask a few questions. 
Man: Sure. 
PJ: What did you think of this experiment, was it easy or hard? 
Man: It was easy. 
PJ: During the experiments, I actually switched the pictures three times. 
Was this anything you noticed? 
Man: No. I didn't notice any of that. 
PJ: Not at all? Man: No. 
Switching the pictures as far as ... 
PJ: Yeah, you were pointing at one of them but I actually gave you the opposite. 
Man: The opposite one. OK, when you -- No. Shows you how much my attention span was. 
(Laughter) PJ: Did you notice that sometimes during the experiment I switched the pictures? 
Woman 2: No, I did not notice that. 
PJ: You were pointing at one, but then I gave you the other one. 
No inclination of that happening? 
Woman 2: No. 
Woman 2: I did not notice. 
(Laughs) PJ: Thank you. 
Woman 2: Thank you. 
PJ: OK, so as you probably figured out now, the trick is that I have two cards in each hand, and when I hand one of them over, the black one kind of disappears into the black surface on the table. 
So using pictures like this, normally not more than 20 percent of the participants detect these tries. 
And as you saw in the movie, when in the end we explain what's going on, they're very surprised and often refuse to believe the trick has been made. 
So this shows that this effect is quite robust and a genuine effect. 
But if you're interested in self-knowledge, as I am, the more interesting bit is, OK, so what did they say when they explained these choices? 
So we've done a lot of analysis of the verbal reports in these experiments. 
And this graph simply shows that if you compare what they say in a manipulated trial with a nonmanipulated trial, that is when they explain a normal choice they've made and one where we manipulated the outcome, we find that they are remarkably similar. 
So they are just as emotional, just as specific, and they are expressed with the same level of certainty. 
So the strong conclusion to draw from this is that if there are no differences between a real choice and a manipulated choice, perhaps we make things up all the time. 
But we've also done studies where we try to match what they say with the actual faces. 
And then we find things like this. 
So here, this male participant, he preferred the girl to the left, he ended up with the one to the right. 
And then, he explained his choice like this. 
"She is radiant. 
I would rather have approached her at the bar than the other one. 
And I like earrings." 
And whatever made him choose the girl on the left to begin with, it can't have been the earrings, because they were actually sitting on the girl on the right. 
So this is a clear example of a post hoc construction. 
So they just explained the choice afterwards. 
So what this experiment shows is, OK, so if we fail to detect that our choices have been changed, we will immediately start to explain them in another way. 
And what we also found is that the participants often come to prefer the alternative, that they were led to believe they liked. 
So if we let them do the choice again, they will now choose the face they had previously rejected. 
So this is the effect we call "choice blindness." 
And we've done a number of different studies -- we've tried consumer choices, choices based on taste and smell and even reasoning problems. 
But what you all want to know is of course does this extend also to more complex, more meaningful choices? 
Like those concerning moral and political issues. 
So the next experiment, it needs a little bit of a background. 
So in Sweden, the political landscape is dominated by a left-wing and a right-wing coalition. 
And the voters may move a little bit between the parties within each coalition, but there is very little movement between the coalitions. 
And before each elections, the newspapers and the polling institutes put together what they call "an election compass" which consists of a number of dividing issues that sort of separates the two coalitions. 
Things like if tax on gasoline should be increased or if the 13 months of paid parental leave should be split equally between the two parents in order to increase gender equality. 
So, before the last Swedish election, we created an election compass of our own. 
So we walked up to people in the street and asked if they wanted to do a quick political survey. 
So first we had them state their voting intention between the two coalitions. 
Then we asked them to answer 12 of these questions. 
They would fill in their answers, and we would ask them to discuss, so OK, why do you think tax on gas should be increased? 
And we'd go through the questions. 
Then we had a color coded template that would allow us to tally their overall score. 
So this person would have one, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, nine scores to the left, so he would lean to the left, basically. 
And in the end, we also had them fill in their voting intention once more. 
But of course, there was also a trick involved. 
So first, we walked up to people, we asked them about their voting intention and then when they started filling in, we would fill in a set of answers going in the opposite direction. 
We would put it under the notepad. 
And when we get the questionnaire, we would simply glue it on top of the participant's own answer. 
So there, it's gone. 
And then we would ask about each of the questions: How did you reason here? 
And they'll state the reasons, together we will sum up their overall score. 
And in the end, they will state their voting intention again. 
So what we find first of all here, is that very few of these manipulations are detected. 
And they're not detected in the sense that they realize, "OK, you must have changed my answer," it was more the case that, "OK, I must've misunderstood the question the first time I read it. 
Can I please change it?" 
And even if a few of these manipulations were changed, the overall majority was missed. 
So we managed to switch 90 percent of the participants' answers from left to right, right to left, their overall profile. 
And what happens then when they are asked to motivate their choices? 
And here we find much more interesting verbal reports than compared to the faces. 
People say things like this, and I'll read it to you. 
So, "Large-scale governmental surveillance of email and internet traffic ought to be permissible as means to combat international crime and terrorism." 
"So you agree to some extent with this statement." "Yes." 
"So how did you reason here?" 
"Well, like, as it is so hard to get at international crime and terrorism, I think there should be those kinds of tools." 
And then the person remembers an argument from the newspaper in the morning. 
"Like in the newspaper today, it said they can like, listen to mobile phones from prison, if a gang leader tries to continue his crimes from inside. 
And I think it's madness that we have so little power that we can't stop those things when we actually have the possibility to do so." 
And then there's a little bit back and forth in the end: "I don't like that they have access to everything I do, but I still think it's worth it in the long run." 
So, if you didn't know that this person just took part in a choice blindness experiment, I don't think you would question that this is the true attitude of that person. 
And what happens in the end, with the voting intention? 
What we find -- that one is also clearly affected by the questionnaire. 
So we have 10 participants shifting from left to right or from right to left. 
We have another 19 that go from clear voting intention to being uncertain. 
Some go from being uncertain to clear voting intention. 
And then there is a number of participants staying uncertain throughout. 
And that number is interesting because if you look at what the polling institutes say the closer you get to an election, the only people that are sort of in play are the ones that are considered uncertain. 
But we show there is a much larger number that would actually consider shifting their attitudes. 
And here I must point out, of course, that you are not allowed to use this as an actual method to change people's votes before an election, and we clearly debriefed them afterwards and gave them every opportunity to change back to whatever they thought first. 
But what this shows is that if you can get people to see the opposite view and engage in a conversation with themselves, that could actually make them change their views. 
OK. 
So what does it all mean? 
What do I think is going on here? 
So first of all, a lot of what we call self-knowledge is actually self-interpretation. 
So I see myself make a choice, and then when I'm asked why, I just try to make as much sense of it as possible when I make an explanation. 
But we do this so quickly and with such ease that we think we actually know the answer when we answer why. 
And as it is an interpretation, of course we sometimes make mistakes. 
The same way we make mistakes when we try to understand other people. 
So beware when you ask people the question "why" because what may happen is that, if you asked them, "So why do you support this issue?" 
"Why do you stay in this job or this relationship?" -- what may happen when you ask why is that you actually create an attitude that wasn't there before you asked the question. 
And this is of course important in your professional life, as well, or it could be. 
If, say, you design something and then you ask people, "Why do you think this is good or bad?" 
Or if you're a journalist asking a politician, "So, why did you make this decision?" 
Or if indeed you are a politician and try to explain why a certain decision was made. 
So this may all seem a bit disturbing. 
But if you want to look at it from a positive direction, it could be seen as showing, OK, so we're actually a little bit more flexible than we think. 
We can change our minds. 
Our attitudes are not set in stone. 
And we can also change the minds of others, if we can only get them to engage with the issue and see it from the opposite view. 
And in my own personal life, since starting with this research -- So my partner and I, we've always had the rule that you're allowed to take things back. 
Just because I said I liked something a year ago, doesn't mean I have to like it still. 
And getting rid of the need to stay consistent is actually a huge relief and makes relational life so mush easier to live. 
Anyway, so the conclusion must be: know that you don't know yourself. 
Or at least not as well as you think you do. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

What if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate, positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus? 
And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia. 
Would you do it? 
Yes! 
I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity. 
Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain. 
And that can last for the rest of your life. 
So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. 
Now, as a neuroscientist, I know that our brains, that is the thing in our head right now, that is the most complex structure known to humankind. 
But it's one thing to talk about the brain, and it's another to see it. 
So here is a real preserved human brain. 
And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today. 
The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality. 
The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here. 
You have two temporal lobes in your brain, the right and the left, and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term memories for facts and events. 
And that structure is called the hippocampus. 
So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus. 
How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? 
That's what I want to understand. 
I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories. 
And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons communicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory, or did not. 
But a few years ago, I did something very unusual in science. 
As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch my research program. 
Because I encountered something that was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it. 
I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise. 
And I did it in a completely inadvertent way. 
I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work. 
And it should have been going great. It was, scientifically. 
But when I stuck my head out of my lab door, I noticed something. 
I had no social life. 
I spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room, by myself. 
(Laughter) I didn't move my body at all. 
I had gained 25 pounds. 
And actually, it took me many years to realize it, I was actually miserable. 
And I shouldn't be miserable. 
And I went on a river-rafting trip -- by myself, because I had no social life. 
And I came back -- (Laughter) thinking, "Oh, my God, I was the weakest person on that trip." 
And I came back with a mission. 
I said, "I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again." 
And that's what made me go to the gym. 
And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym. 
I tried everything. 
I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. 
But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost. 
And that's what kept me going back to the gym. 
Well, I started feeling stronger. 
I started feeling better, I even lost that 25 pounds. 
And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice. 
I was sitting at my desk, writing a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before. 
And that thought was, "Gee, grant-writing is going well today." 
And all the scientists -- (Laughter) yeah, all the scientists always laugh when I say that, because grant-writing never goes well. 
It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out, trying to come up with that million-dollar-winning idea. 
But I realized that the grant-writing was going well, because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. 
And my long-term memory -- what I was studying in my own lab -- seemed to be better in me. 
And that's when I put it together. 
Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain. 
Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it. 
So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain. 
And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself. 
Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention. 
And the more I learned, the more I realized how powerful exercise was. 
Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus. 
And so now, after several years of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons. 
Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain. 
A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. 
That is going to increase your mood right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. 
My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. 
And finally, studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. 
(Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after. 
What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. 
And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. 
Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus. 
The hippocampus -- or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume, as well as improve your long-term memory, OK? 
And that including in you and me. 
Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex. 
You not only get better focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well. 
And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time. 
So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters. 
But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. 
Here you can think about the brain like a muscle. 
The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets. 
Why is that important? 
Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging. 
So with increased exercise over your lifetime, you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but what you're going to do is you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect. 
You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? 
And it's even better, because it's free. 
So this is the point in the talk where everybody says, "That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only want to know one thing. 
And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes." 
(Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question. 
First, good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects. 
The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in. 
That is, get your heart rate up. 
And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. 
Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk. 
You see stairs -- take stairs. 
And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym. 
So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer. 
From going into the innermost workings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you -- three to four times a week, 30 minutes. 
I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age, at your fitness level, for your genetic background, to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. 
But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it. 
So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. 
(Laughter) We're going to do just one minute of exercise. 
It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK? 
Music! 
(Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left. 
And I say, I am strong now. 
Let's hear you. 
Audience: I am strong now. 
Wendy Suzuki: Ladies, I am Wonder Woman-strong. 
Let's hear you! 
Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong. 
WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left. 
I am inspired now. You say it! 
Audience: I am inspired now. 
WS: Last move -- pull it down, right and left, right and left. 
I say, I am on fire now! You say it. 
Audience: I am on fire now. 
WS: And done! OK, good job! 
(Applause) Thank you. 
I want to leave you with one last thought. 
And that is, bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases. 
And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So today I'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption. 
I'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes -- that this isn't a flimsy idea, or a short-term trend, but a powerful cultural and economic force reinventing not just what we consume, but how we consume. 
Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example. 
Hands up -- how many of you have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos lying around your house that you probably won't use again, but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away? 
Can't see all the hands, but it looks like all of you, right? 
On our shelves at home, we have a box set of the DVD series "24," season six to be precise. 
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present. 
Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show. 
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists. 
So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us, but with immediate latent value to someone else. 
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make. 
I lived in New York for 10 years, and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City." 
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week. 
So how easily could I swap our unwanted copy of "24" for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?" 
Now you may have noticed there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading. 
Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media. 
What it does is use the Internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person A's "haves" with person C's "wants," whatever they may be. 
The other week, I went on one of these sites, appropriately called Swaptree, and there were over 59,300 items that I could instantly swap for my copy of "24." 
Lo and behold, there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron who wanted swap his or her "like new" copy of "Sex and the City" for my copy of "24." 
So in other words, what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem, a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants," in approximately 60 seconds. 
What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot, because it knows the way of the item. 
Now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as Swaptree, but that's not my interest, and nor is swap trading, per se. 
My passion, and what I've spent the last few years dedicated to researching, is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics inherent in these systems. 
When you think about it, it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago, that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name I didn't know and without any money changing hands. 
Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree happen successfully, and the one percent that receive a negative rating, it's for relatively minor reasons, like the item didn't arrive on time. 
So what's happening here? 
An extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural implications is at play. 
Namely, that technology is enabling trust between strangers. 
We now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face, but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before. 
So what's actually happening is that social networks and real-time technologies are taking us back. 
We're bartering, trading, swapping, sharing, but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms. 
What I find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share, whether that's our neighborhood, our school, our office, or our Facebook network, and that's creating an economy of "what's mine is yours." 
From the mighty eBay, the grandfather of exchange marketplaces, to car-sharing companies such as GoGet, where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour, to social lending platforms such as Zopa, that will take anyone in this audience with 100 dollars to lend, and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world, we're sharing and collaborating again in ways that I believe are more hip than hippie. 
I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption." 
Now before I dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption, I'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked, which is, where did this idea come from? 
Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption," but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas. 
Over the next minute, you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head. 
The first thing I began to notice: how many big concepts were emerging -- from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs -- around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose. 
And linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world -- from the election of a president to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between -- on what the power of numbers could achieve. 
Now, you know when you learn a new word, and then you start to see that word everywhere? 
That's what happened to me when I noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators, to highly enabled collaborators. 
What's happening is the Internet is removing the middleman, so that anyone from a T-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer. 
And the ubiquitous force of this peer-to-peer revolution means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates. 
I mean, it's amazing to think that, in every single minute of this speech, 25 hours of YouTube video will be loaded. 
Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts. 
I mean, we're monkeys, and we're born and bred to share and cooperate. 
And we were doing so for thousands of years, whether it's when we hunted in packs, or farmed in cooperatives, before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms. 
But things are changing, and one of the reasons why is the digital natives, or Gen-Y. 
They're growing up sharing -- files, video games, knowledge. 
It's second nature to them. 
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial -- are like foot soldiers, moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we." 
The reason why it's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration. 
We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time, from a small device in our hands. 
All of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008, when, of course, the great financial crash happened. 
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, "No more." 
Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards. 
Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do. 
So all of this is a lot of twittering, right? 
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head, until actually I realized it was happening because of four key drivers. 
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community, and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means. 
A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks and real-time technologies, fundamentally changing the way we behave. 
Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns. 
And four, a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors. 
These four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption. 
I generally believe we're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors -- through sites such as Flickr and Twitter that are becoming second nature online -- are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives. 
From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food, we are consuming and collaborating once again. 
So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption. 
And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems. 
The first is redistribution markets. 
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is. 
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' -- reduce, reuse, recycle, repair and redistribute -- because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste. 
The second is collaborative lifestyles. 
This is the sharing of resources of things like money, skills and time. 
I bet, in a couple of years, that phrases like "coworking" and "couchsurfing" and "time banks" are going to become a part of everyday vernacular. 
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called Landshare. 
It's a scheme in the U.K. 
that matches Mr. Jones, with some spare space in his back garden, with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower. 
Together they grow their own food. 
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant, you wonder why it's never been done before. 
Now, the third system is product-service systems. 
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product -- what it does for you -- without needing to own the product outright. 
This idea is particularly powerful for things that have high-idling capacity. 
And that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to -- how many of you have a power drill, own a power drill? Right. 
That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes in its entire lifetime. 
(Laughter) It's kind of ridiculous, right? 
Because what you need is the hole, not the drill. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So why don't you rent the drill, or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it? 
These three systems are coming together, allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles, or their cherished personal freedoms. 
I'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit. 
So I want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors. 
The average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run. 
Yet, that car sits idle for 23 hours a day. 
So when you consider these two facts, it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright. 
So this is where car-sharing companies such as Zipcar and GoGet come in. 
In 2009, Zipcar took 250 participants from across 13 cities -- and they're all self-confessed car addicts and car-sharing rookies -- and got them to surrender their keys for a month. 
Instead, these people had to walk, bike, take the train, or other forms of public transport. 
They could only use their Zipcar membership when absolutely necessary. 
The results of this challenge after just one month was staggering. 
It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise. 
But my favorite statistic is that 100 out of the 250 participants did not want their keys back. 
In other words, the car addicts had lost their urge to own. 
Now products-service systems have been around for years. 
Just think of libraries and laundrettes. 
But I think they're entering a new age, because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun. 
There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times that said, "Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the 8-track, what solar power is to the coal mine." 
I believe also, our generation, our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation. 
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries. 
I don't want a clunky answering machine; I want the message it saves. 
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays. 
In other words, I don't want stuff; I want the needs or experiences it fulfills. 
This is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions -- or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it, "where access is better than ownership." 
Now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud, a blurry line is appearing between what's mine, what's yours, and what's ours. 
I want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening. 
This represents an eight-year time span. 
We've gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet, to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental, where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor. 
Now all of these systems require a degree of trust, and the cornerstone to this working is reputation. 
Now in the old consumer system, our reputation didn't matter so much, because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review. 
But now with the Web, we leave a trail. 
With every spammer we flag, with every idea we post, comment we share, we're actually signaling how well we collaborate, and whether we can or can't be trusted. 
Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree. 
I can see that Rondoron has completed 553 trades with a 100 percent success rate. 
In other words, I can trust him or her. 
Now mark my words, it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital. 
And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption. 
It's a new social currency, so to speak, that could become as powerful as our credit rating. 
Now as a closing thought, I believe we're actually in a period where we're waking up from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste, and we're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity. 
I believe it will be referred to as a revolution, so to speak -- when society, faced with great challenges, made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good. 
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool. 
I'm on a mission to make sharing hip. 
Because I really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business, help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

On a warm August morning in Harare, Farai, a 24-year-old mother of two, walks towards a park bench. 
She looks miserable and dejected. 
Now, on the park bench sits an 82-year-old woman, better known to the community as Grandmother Jack. 
Farai hands Grandmother Jack an envelope from the clinic nurse. 
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down as she opens the envelope and reads. 
There's silence for three minutes or so as she reads. 
And after a long pause, Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath, looks at Farai and says, "I'm here for you. 
Would you like to share your story with me?" 
Farai begins, her eyes swelling with tears. 
She says, "Grandmother Jack, I'm HIV-positive. 
I've been living with HIV for the past four years. 
My husband left me a year ago. 
I have two kids under the age of five. 
I'm unemployed. 
I can hardly take care of my children." 
Tears are now flowing down her face. 
And in response, Grandmother Jack moves closer, puts her hand on Farai, and says, "Farai, it's OK to cry. 
You've been through a lot. 
Would you like to share more with me?" 
And Farai continues. 
"In the last three weeks, I have had recurrent thoughts of killing myself, taking my two children with me. 
I can't take it anymore. 
The clinic nurse sent me to see you." 
There's an exchange between the two, which lasts about 30 minutes. 
And finally, Grandmother Jack says, "Farai, it seems to me that you have all the symptoms of kufungisisa." 
The word "kufungisisa" opens up a floodgate of tears. 
So, kufungisisa is the local equivalent of depression in my country. 
It literally means "thinking too much." 
The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people globally, today, suffer from depression, or what in my country we call kufungisisa. 
And the World Health Organization also tells us that every 40 seconds, someone somewhere in the world commits suicide because they are unhappy, largely due to depression or kufungisisa. 
And most of these deaths are occurring in low- and middle-income countries. 
In fact, the World Health Organization goes as far as to say that when you look at the age group between 15 to 29, a leading cause of death now is actually suicide. 
But there are wider events that lead to depression and in some cases, suicide, such as abuse, conflict, violence, isolation, loneliness -- the list is endless. 
But one thing that we do know is that depression can be treated and suicides averted. 
But the problem is we just don't have enough psychiatrists or psychologists in the world to do the job. 
In most low- and middle-income countries, for instance, the ratio of psychiatrists to the population is something like one for every one and a half million people, which literally means that 90 percent of the people needing mental health services will not get it. 
In my country, there are 12 psychiatrists, and I'm one of them, for a population of approximately 14 million. 
Now, let me just put that into context. 
One evening while I was at home, I get a call from the ER, or the emergency room, from a city which is some 200 kilometers away from where I live. 
And the ER doctor says, "One of your patients, someone you treated four months ago, has just taken an overdose, and they are in the ER department. 
Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK, but they will need neuropsychiatric evaluation." 
Now, I obviously can't get into my car in the middle of the night and drive 200 kilometers. 
So as best as we could, over the phone with the ER doctor, we come up with an assessment. 
We ensure that suicidal observations are in place. 
We ensure that we start reviewing the antidepressants that this patient has been taking, and we finally conclude that as soon as Erica -- that was her name, 26-year-old -- as soon as Erica is ready to be released from the ER, she should come directly to me with her mother, and I will evaluate and establish what can be done. 
And we assumed that that would take about a week. 
A week passes. 
Three weeks pass. 
No Erica. 
And one day I get a call from Erica's mother, and she says, "Erica committed suicide three days ago. 
She hanged herself from the mango tree in the family garden." 
Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction, I couldn't help but ask, "But why didn't you come to Harare, where I live? 
We had agreed that as soon as you're released from the ER, you will come to me." 
Her response was brief. 
"We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare to come to Harare." 
Now, suicide is not an unusual event in the world of mental health. 
But there was something about Erica's death that struck me at the core of my very being. 
That statement from Erica's mother: "We didn't have 15 dollars bus fare to come to you," made me realize that it just wasn't going to work, me expecting people to come to me. 
And I got into this state of soul-searching, trying to really discover my role as a psychiatrist in Africa. 
And after considerable consultation and soul-searching, talking to colleagues, friends and family, it suddenly dawned on me that actually, one the most reliable resources we have in Africa are grandmothers. 
Yes, grandmothers. 
And I thought, grandmothers are in every community. 
There are hundreds of them. 
And -- (Laughter) And they don't leave their communities in search of greener pastures. 
(Laughter) See, the only time they leave is when they go to a greener pasture called heaven. 
(Laughter) So I thought, how about training grandmothers in evidence-based talk therapy, which they can deliver on a bench? 
Empower them with the skills to listen, to show empathy, all of that rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy; empower them with the skills to provide behavior activation, activity scheduling; and support them using digital technology. 
You know, mobile phone technology. 
Pretty much everyone in Africa has a mobile phone today. 
So in 2006, I started my first group of grandmothers. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Today, there are hundreds of grandmothers who are working in more than 70 communities. 
And in the last year alone, more than 30,000 people received treatment on the Friendship Bench from a grandmother in a community in Zimbabwe. 
(Applause) And recently, we published this work that is done by these grandmothers in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
And -- (Applause) And our results show that six months after receiving treatment from a grandmother, people were still symptom-free: no depression, suicidal ideation completely reduced. 
In fact, our results -- this was a clinical trial -- in fact, this clinical trial showed that grandmothers were more effective at treating depression than doctors and -- (Laughter) (Applause) And so, we're now working towards expanding this program. 
There are more than 600 million people currently aged above 65 in the world. 
And by the year 2050, there will be 1.5 billion people aged 65 and above. 
Imagine if we could create a global network of grandmothers in every major city in the world, who are trained in evidence-based talk therapy, supported through digital platforms, networked. 
And they will make a difference in communities. 
They will reduce the treatment gap for mental, neurological and substance-use disorders. 
Finally, this is a file photograph of Grandmother Jack. 
So, Farai had six sessions on the bench with Grandmother Jack. 
Today, Farai is employed. 
She has her two children at school. 
And as for Grandmother Jack, one morning in February, we expected her to see her 257th client on the bench. 
She didn't show up. 
She had gone to a greener pasture called heaven. 
But I believe that Grandmother Jack, from up there, she's cheering on all the other grandmothers -- the increasing number of grandmothers who are making a difference in the lives of thousands of people. 
And I'm sure she's in awe when she realizes that something that she helped to pioneer is now spreading to other countries, like Malawi, the island of Zanzibar and coming closer to home here in the Unites States in the city of New York. 
May her soul rest in peace. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) (Cheering) (Applause) 

Currently, most refugees live in the cities rather than in the refugee camps. 
We represent over 60 percent of the number of refugees globally. 
With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and new thinking. 
Rather than wasting money on building walls, it would be better to spend on programs to help refugees to help themselves. 
(Applause) We always have to leave behind all our possessions. 
But not our skills and knowledge. 
If allowed to live a productive life, refugees can help themselves and contribute to the development of their host country. 
I was born in the city called Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
I am the fifth-born in a family of 12 children. 
My father, a mechanic by profession, worked very hard to send me to school. 
Just like other young people, I had a lot of plans and dreams. 
I wanted to complete my studies, get a nice job, marry and have my own children and support my family. 
But this didn't happen. 
War in my homeland forced me to flee to Uganda in 2008, nine years ago. 
My family joined a steady exodus of refugees who settled in Uganda's capital, Kampala. 
In my country, I lived already in the city, and we felt Kampala was much better than a refugee camp. 
Refugees in the cities have always been denied international assistance, even after their recognition by UNHCR in 1997. 
In addition to the poverty problem we were confronted with as the local urban poor, we were facing challenges due to our refugee status, such as a language barrier. 
In Congo, the official language is French. 
But in Uganda, it is English. 
We didn't have access to education and health. 
We were exposed to harassment, exploitation, intimidation and discrimination. 
Humanitarian organizations mostly focused on the formal settlement in rural areas, and there was nothing in place for us. 
But we didn't want handouts. 
We wanted to work and support ourselves. 
I joined my other two colleagues in exile and set up an organization to support other refugees. 
YARID -- Young African Refugees for Integral Development -- began as a conversation within the Congolese community. 
We asked the community how they could organize themselves to solve these challenges. 
The YARID programs for support evolve in stages, progressing from soccer community, to English language to sewing livelihoods. 
The soccer changed the energy of unemployed youth and connected people from different communities. 
The free English classes help empower people to engage with the Ugandan community, allowing them to get to know their neighbors and sell wares. 
The vocational training program offers livelihood skills, and with them, important opportunities for economic self-reliance. 
We've seen so many families become self-sustaining. 
We've seen who no longer needs our help. 
As YARID's programs have expanded, it has included an increasing range of nationalities -- Congolese, Rwandan, Burundian, Somalis, Ethiopian, South Sudanese. 
Today, YARID has supported over 3,000 refugees across Kampala and continues supporting more. 
(Applause) Refugees want empowerment, not handouts. 
We know our community better than anyone. 
We understand the challenges and opportunities we face to become self-reliant. 
I know better than anyone that initiatives created by refugees work. 
They need to be internationally recognized and supported. 
Give us the support we deserve, and we will pay you back with interest. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness, and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats. 
And I know, in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change, one would wonder, why worry about a few cats? 
Well today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character -- this leopard. 
Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been like a super long episode of "CSI" -- something like 28 years. 
In essence, what we've done is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior, we've seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals. 
But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality, that individual personality that these animals have. 
And here's a prime example. 
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old baobab tree in Africa, the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother. 
And she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us -- her own daughter, eight days old. 
And the minute we found this leopard, we realized that we needed to move in, and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four-and-a-half years -- following her every day, getting to know her, that individual personality of hers, and really coming to know her. 
Now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique, very, very special, individualistic and often seductive female characters. 
(Laughter) Beverly's clearly one of them, and this little leopard, Legadema, is another, and she changed our lives. 
BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her -- in fact, more time than even her mother did. 
When her mother would go off hunting, we would stay and film. 
And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us. 
It was frightening, and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell. 
And of course, we were stunned for a while, but when we managed to get our wits about us, we looked at it and said, "My gosh, what's going to happen with that little cub? 
She's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us." 
Well, we needn't have worried. 
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us, sat next to us, shivering, with her back towards Dereck, and looking out. 
And actually from that day on, she's been comfortable with us. 
So we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name. 
We called her Legadema, which means, "light from the sky." 
DJ: Now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals, in particular in the cats. 
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh, "he who greets with fire," and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character. 
But only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have. 
BJ: But through our investigation, we have to seek the wildest places in Africa. 
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. 
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent, but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating. 
But also, our hearts are in our throats a huge amount of the time, because we're driving through water, and it's an unknown territory. 
But we're really there seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats. 
DJ: Now one of the big things, of course, everybody knows that cats hate water, and so this was a real revelation for us. 
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves, by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly -- and just pushing the envelope, going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves. 
But we've managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others, and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water. 
BJ: And then of course, the challenge is knowing when to turn around. 
We don't always get that right, and on this particular day, we seriously underestimated the depth. 
We got deeper and deeper, until it was at Dereck's chest-height. 
Well then we hit a deep depression, and we seriously submerged the vehicle. 
We actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear. 
We drowned our pride, I must tell you, which was really serious, and we seized the engine. 
DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. 
(Laughter) You will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by Beverly -- the dry top angle, by the way. 
(Laughter) But all the places we get stuck in really have great views. 
And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us, and Beverly was able to get a great photograph. 
BJ: But we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage. 
And 20 years ago, we did a film called "Eternal Enemies" where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species -- lions and hyenas. 
And surprisingly, it became a cult film. 
And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare. 
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents. 
He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it. 
(Animal sounds) But that's, I think, what this is all about, is that these individuals have these personalities and characters. 
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves, but we live by certain rules of engagement, which mean we can't interfere. 
This sort of behavior has been going on for three, four, five million years, and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right." 
But that's not always easy for us. 
BJ: So, as Dereck says, we have to work through extremes -- extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night. 
Sleep deprivation is extreme. 
We're on the edge through a large part of the time. 
But, for 10 years, we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night. 
And I have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me. 
I had tears rolling down my cheeks. 
I was shaking with anxiety, but I knew that [I had] to capture something that had never been seen before, had never been documented. 
And I do believe you should stay with us. 
DJ: The amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it's going to end. 
Many people believe, in fact, that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart, not in the lungs, and that's when people give up hope, or when any life form gives up hope. 
And you can see the start of it here. 
This elephant, against overwhelming odds, simply gives up hope. 
But by the same token, you can get your hope back again. 
So just when you think it's all over, something else happens, some spark gets into you, some sort of will to fight -- that iron will that we all have, that this elephant has, that conservation has, that big cats have. 
Everything has that will to survive, to fight, to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. 
And for us, in many ways, this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us, a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work. 
(Applause) Now back to the leopard. 
We were spending so much time with this leopard and getting to understand her individualism, her personal character, that maybe we were taking it a little bit far. 
We were perhaps taking her for granted, and maybe she didn't like that that much. 
This is about couples working together, and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I. 
Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is, and I'm on the other side where my space is. 
These are precious to us, these divides. 
BJ: But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear, she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate. 
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent. 
But at the same time, we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car, it might not turn out the same way -- she might get shot for that. 
So we knew we had to react quickly. 
And the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make -- a hiss and a sound. 
So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car -- very innovative. 
DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage, because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see. 
(Laughter) But really and truly, this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality. 
But nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her, when she started hunting. 
BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited. 
It was like watching a graduation ceremony. 
We felt like we were surrogate parents. 
And of course, we knew now that she was going to survive. 
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with Legadema. 
And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent, it didn't turn and run. 
So what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique. 
It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety, protecting it from the hyena. 
And over the next five hours, she took care of it. 
We realized that we actually don't know everything, and that nature is so unpredictable, we have to be open at all times. 
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough. 
(Laughter) But in fact, what we were seeing here was interesting. 
Because she is a cub wanting to play, but she was also a predator needing to kill, and yet conflicted in some way, because she was also an emerging mother. 
She had this maternal instinct, much like a young girl on her way to womanhood, and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality. 
BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together. 
They ended up sleeping for hours. 
But I have to tell you -- everybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?" 
It did die, and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights. 
DJ: So at this stage, I guess, we had very, very firm ideas on what conservation meant. 
We had to deal with these individual personalities. 
We had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them. 
And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative to march forward into conservation, taking care of the big cats that we loved -- and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we had all collectively been doing. 
So when Beverly and I were born, there were 450,000 lions, and today there are 20,000. 
Tigers haven't fared any better -- 45,000 down to maybe 3,000. 
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000. 
Leopards have plummeted from 700,000 down to a mere 50,000. 
Now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with Legadema -- which is really over a five-year period -- 10,000 leopards were legally shot by safari hunters. 
And that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period. 
There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount. 
It's simply not sustainable. 
We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power. 
It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers. 
And of course, looking at this lion paw that has been skinned, it eerily reminds me of a human hand, and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands. 
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade. 
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market. 
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers. 
So we have a real problem here, no more so than the lions do, the male lions. 
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease. 
I call it complacency -- our complacency. 
Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on that we're all aware of, that we condone. 
And that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today. 
BJ: And you have to know that, when a male lion is killed, it completely disrupts the whole pride. 
A new male comes into the area and takes over the pride, and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs. 
So we've estimated that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far-off place. 
DJ: So what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential. 
They're essential to the habitat. 
If they disappear, whole ecosystems in Africa disappear. 
There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year ecotourism revenue stream into Africa. 
So this is not just a concern about lions; it's a concern about communities in Africa as well. 
If they disappear, all of that goes away. 
But what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature, as we de-link ourselves spiritually from these animals, we lose hope, we lose that spiritual connection, our dignity, that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet. 
BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now, it is all about critical awareness. 
And so what we are doing, in February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion," and "The Last Lion" is exactly what is happening right now. 
That is the situation we're in -- the last lions. 
That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear. 
And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well. 
DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by -- that conservation was all about respect and celebration -- is probably true. That's really what it needs. 
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that. 
And Legadema? 
Well we can report, in fact, that we're grandparents. 
(Laughter) BJ/DJ: Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

In 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring," I think for people like me in the world of the making of things, the canary in the mine wasn't singing. 
And so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared. 
And the question was, were the birds singing? 
Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear. 
But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. 
What is a bird? 
Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck. 
It comes in California with a warning -- "This product contains chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm." 
This is a bird. 
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children? 
I think we have a design problem. 
Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note -- "We realize that design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world, and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence, and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet, and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there, because the news is the news of abundance, and not the news of limits, and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear, we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent, driven by the sun, and start to imagine what that would be like to share." 
That was a nice thing to get. 
That was one sentence. 
Henry James would be proud. 
This is -- I put it down at the bottom, but that was extemporaneous, obviously. 
The fundamental issue is that, for me, design is the first signal of human intentions. 
So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be -- if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world -- well, what would our intention be as a species now that we're the dominant species? 
And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate, because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship -- because how could you dominate something you had killed? 
And stewardship's implicit in dominion, because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it. 
So the question is, what is the first question for designers? 
Now, as guardians -- let's say the state, for example, which reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on -- the question we're asking the guardian at this point is are we meant, how are we meant, to secure local societies, create world peace and save the environment? 
But I don't know that that's the common debate. 
Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick, essentially creative, highly effective and efficient, and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange value for very long if we don't trust each other. 
So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work, but the question we bring to it is, how do we love all the children of all species for all time? 
And so we start our designs with that question. 
Because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy. 
If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here," and we say, "That's not part of my plan," then we realize it's part of our de facto plan. 
Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan. 
And I was at the White House for President Bush, meeting with every federal department and agency, and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan. 
If the end game is global warming, they're doing great. 
If the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act, then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as, "Brain death for all children. No child left behind." 
(Applause) So, the question is, how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families? 
So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful, then you're just moving chess pieces around, if you don't know you're taking the king. 
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change, which requires humility. And in my business as an architect, it's unfortunate the word "humility" and the word "architect" have not appeared in the same paragraph since "The Fountainhead." 
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility, reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years to put wheels on our luggage. 
So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame. 
There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game. 
And so we call it "cradle to cradle," and our goal is very simple. 
This is what I presented to the White House. 
Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world, with clean air, clean water, soil and power -- economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period. 
(Applause) What don't you like about this? 
Which part of this don't you like? 
So we realized we want full diversity, even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said when asked what it was like to be President of France. 
He said, "What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?" 
But at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy. 
So we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million. 
This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of Alzheimer's later in life. 
We can ask ourselves, what is justice, and is justice blind, or is justice blindness? 
And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black? 
Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations. 
Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes. 
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe? 
Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. 
A fundamental issue that's not being addressed. 
We've seen the first form of solar energy that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving. 
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC, they asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?" 
I don't know if you remember his answer, but it was, "The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones." 
We see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don't. 
We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect. 
This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China. 
This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous, release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment, which is from copper. 
On the other hand, we see great signs of hope. 
Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out how to do mass-produced health. 
He has given eyesight to two million people for free. 
We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings -- bismuth, antimony, copper and so on. 
They become building steel. 
On the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet, the largest carpet company in the world. 
We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable, down to the parts per million. 
The upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam, the bottom, a polyolephine -- infinitely recyclable thermoplastic. 
Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability. 
The building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap with an ancient meadow, is an asset -- its nesting grounds. 
Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong, with six million people in 40 square miles. 
During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day. 
And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries. 
You can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries without understanding nutrient flow. 
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington, among the first growth and big growth. 
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics, so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off. 
I went to Yale for graduate school, studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier, affectionately known in our business as Brutalism. 
If we look at the world of architecture, we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin, the question might be, "Well, where's the sun?" 
And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston, and the windows are all closed. And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use, this is actually a vertical gas chamber. 
When I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis, and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland as a student, which I then built -- which would give you a sense of my ambition. 
And Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers, kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism, and he would say, "Bill, you've got to understand- -- solar energy has nothing to do with architecture." 
I guess he didn't read Vitruvius. 
In 1984, we did the first so-called "green office" in America for Environmental Defense. 
We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials. 
They said, "They're proprietary, they're legal, go away." 
The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace. 
So, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969, and this happens, and we realize that "away" went away. 
Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away? 
And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example -- you see that little blue thing above Hawaii? 
That's the Pacific Gyre. 
It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists, and they found six times as much plastic as plankton. 
When asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush." 
Perhaps that's away. 
So we're looking for the design rules of this -- this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya, 259 species of tree, and we described this in the book, "Cradle to Cradle." 
The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree. 
That's the name of the first chapter -- "This Book is Not a Tree." 
Because in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out, "we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears." 
And with so much polymer, what we really need is technical nutrition, and to use something as elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment: Design something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon, fixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel, makes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates, changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates. 
Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it? 
(Laughter) So, we're looking at the same criteria as most people -- you know, can I afford it? 
Does it work? Do I like it? 
We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville, where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson. 
We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
Now if we look at the word "competition," I'm sure most of you've used it. 
You know, most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere, which means strive together. 
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other. 
They get fit together, and then they compete. 
The Williams sisters compete -- one wins Wimbledon. 
So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together. 
And the Chinese government has now -- I work with the Chinese government now -- has taken this up. 
We're also looking at survival of the fittest, not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground, but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good. 
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good, because, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame. 
But if we look at asphalt as our growth, then we realize that all we're doing is destroying the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system. 
So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective, we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass, and all of a sudden, you get this biology. 
And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem, but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge, we will never be able to recover that. 
And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson, that life itself has to have growth as a precondition -- it has to have free energy, sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals. 
So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing, and we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals. 
Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth, but what do you want to grow? 
So instead of just growing destruction, we want to grow the things that we might enjoy, and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese. 
So therefore, we have these two metabolisms, and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart, and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms. 
The biological one I'm sure you understand, but also the technical one, where we take materials and put them into closed cycles. 
We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition. 
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition. 
Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans, which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton, the world would run out of cork and dry up. 
So we need materials in closed cycles, but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects, disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence, heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them and their production and so on. 
Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals in the textile industry. 
Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.] We were left with 38 chemicals. 
We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks. 
So designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health. 
(Applause) We've developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains, because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars -- and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers." 
"And where does it go?" 
"Customers." 
So we need some help there. 
So the biological nutrients, the first fabrics -- the water coming out was clean enough to drink. 
Technical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet. 
Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet. 
Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor, a cradle to cradle car -- concept car. 
Shoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable, the bottoms are biodegradable soles. 
Wear your old shoes in, your new shoes out. 
There is no finish line. 
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil -- it's all solar-powered. 
Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water. 
Here's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses of San Bruno, California, are on the roof. 
And this is our project for Ford Motor Company. 
It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn. 
This is obviously a color photograph. 
These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford. 
We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one, which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars. 
Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres. 
This is the roof, saving money, and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer. 
They showed up in five days. 
And we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the Internet. 
We're developing now protocols for cities -- that's the home of technical nutrients. 
The country -- the home of biological. And putting them together. 
And so I will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the Chinese government. 
We're doing 12 cities for China right now, based on cradle to cradle as templates. 
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years. 
We did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick, they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal. 
They'll have cities with no energy and no food. 
We signed a Memorandum of Understanding -- here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter -- for China to adopt cradle to cradle. 
Because if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer, send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart -- and then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that we have what, effectively, when I was a student, was called mutually assured destruction. 
Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities. 
We're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape. 
This is the site. 
We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built, so they brought us in to intercede. 
This is their plan. 
It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape. 
And they brought us in and said, "What would you do?" 
This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph. 
So this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now, and here's our proposal. 
(Applause) So the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully. 
We studied the biota, the ancient biota, the current farming and the protocols. 
We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day. 
We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure. 
We lay out the building areas. 
We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be. 
The transportation is all very simple, everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility. 
We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive. 
The waste systems all connect. 
If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants, which are sold as assets, not liabilities. 
Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas? 
The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations. 
And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city. 
So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants. 
And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city, where we've got farming, because what we've done is lifted up the city, the landscape, into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings. 
The solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city. 
And this is the concept for the top of the city. 
We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs. 
The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next. 
We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors. 
And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city. 
(Applause) 

So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky. 
We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited. 
And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them. 
But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem. 
And the problem is this: Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. 
The numbers tell the story quite clearly. 
190 heads of state -- nine are women. 
Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. 
In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats -- tops out at 15, 16 percent. 
The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction. 
And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent. 
We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. 
A recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children. 
A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. 
And I'm in the meeting -- it's about a three-hour meeting -- and two hours in, there needs to be that bio break, and everyone stands up, and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. 
And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. 
So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any. 
And so I said, "Did you just move into this office?" 
And he said, "No, we've been here about a year." 
And I said, "Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?" 
And he looked at me, and he said, "Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom." 
(Laughter) So the question is, how are we going to fix this? 
How do we change these numbers at the top? 
How do we make this different? 
I want to start out by saying, I talk about this -- about keeping women in the workforce -- because I really think that's the answer. 
In the high-income part of our workforce, in the people who end up at the top -- Fortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out. 
Now people talk about this a lot, and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. 
I want to talk about none of that today, even though that's all really important. 
Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. 
What are the messages we need to tell ourselves? 
What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us? 
What are the messages we tell our daughters? 
Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. 
I don't have the right answer. 
I don't even have it for myself. 
I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday, and I was getting on the plane for this conference. 
And my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool, did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, "Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing. 
This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. 
I know no women, whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce, who don't feel that sometimes. 
So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone. 
My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three. 
One, sit at the table. 
Two, make your partner a real partner. 
And three, don't leave before you leave. 
Number one: sit at the table. 
Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook, we hosted a very senior government official, and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. 
And everyone kind of sat at the table. 
He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department, and I kind of said to them, "Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table," and they sat on the side of the room. 
When I was in college, my senior year, I took a course called European Intellectual History. 
Don't you love that kind of thing from college? 
I wish I could do that now. 
And I took it with my roommate, Carrie, who was then a brilliant literary student -- and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar -- and my brother -- smart guy, but a water-polo-playing pre-med, who was a sophomore. 
The three of us take this class together. 
And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin, goes to all the lectures. 
I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. 
My brother is kind of busy. 
He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures, marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. 
The three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down. 
And we sit there for three hours -- and our little blue notebooks -- yes, I'm that old. 
We walk out, we look at each other, and we say, "How did you do?" 
And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic." 
And I say, "God, I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow." 
And my brother says, "I got the top grade in the class." 
(Laughter) "You got the top grade in the class? 
You don't know anything." 
(Laughter) The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows: women systematically underestimate their own abilities. 
If you test men and women, and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low. 
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. 
A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary, and only seven percent of women. 
And most importantly, men attribute their success to themselves, and women attribute it to other external factors. 
If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, "I'm awesome. 
Obviously. Why are you even asking?" 
If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them, they got lucky, they worked really hard. 
Why does this matter? 
Boy, it matters a lot. 
Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side, not at the table, and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success, or they don't even understand their own success. 
I wish the answer were easy. 
I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for, these fabulous women, "Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. 
Own your own success." 
I wish I could tell that to my daughter. 
But it's not that simple. 
Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. 
And everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true. 
There's a really good study that shows this really well. 
There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. 
And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley, and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. 
In 2002 -- not so long ago -- a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it [Howard] Roizen. 
And he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students. 
He changed exactly one word: "Heidi" to "Howard." 
But that one word made a really big difference. 
He then surveyed the students, and the good news was the students, both men and women, thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent, and that's good. 
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. 
He's a great guy. You want to work for him. 
You want to spend the day fishing with him. 
But Heidi? Not so sure. 
She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. 
You're not sure you'd want to work for her. 
This is the complication. 
We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues, we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A, to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table, and we have to do it in a world where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers, there are not. 
The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. 
And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me, but I think important. 
I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me. 
I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked. 
And she said, "I learned something today. 
I learned that I need to keep my hand up." 
She said, "You're giving this talk, and you said you would take two more questions. 
I had my hand up with many other people, and you took two more questions. 
I put my hand down, and I noticed all the women did the same, and then you took more questions, only from the men." 
And I thought to myself, "Wow, if it's me -- who cares about this, obviously -- giving this talk -- and during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised, and the women's hands are still raised, how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women?" 
We've got to get women to sit at the table. 
(Cheers) (Applause) Message number two: Make your partner a real partner. 
I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. 
The data shows this very clearly. 
If a woman and a man work full-time and have a child, the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does, and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. 
So she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one. 
Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more? 
The causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them. 
And I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause. 
I think the cause is more complicated. 
I think, as a society, we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. 
I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers, and it's hard. 
When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there, I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. 
And that's a problem, because we have to make it as important a job, because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home, for people of both genders, if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce. 
(Applause) Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. 
And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there, they also have more -- how shall I say this on this stage? 
They know each other more in the biblical sense as well. 
(Cheers) Message number three: Don't leave before you leave. 
I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking -- and I see this all the time -- with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. 
Here's what happens: We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. 
And she starts thinking about having a child, and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child, she starts thinking about making room for that child. 
"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?" 
And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore, she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project, she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that." 
She starts leaning back. 
The problem is that -- let's say she got pregnant that day, that day -- nine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave, six months to catch your breath -- Fast-forward two years, more often -- and as I've seen it -- women start thinking about this way earlier -- when they get engaged, or married, when they start thinking about having a child, which can take a long time. 
She looked a little young. 
And I said, "So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?" 
And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married." 
She didn't even have a boyfriend. 
(Laughter) I said, "You're thinking about this just way too early." 
But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back? 
Everyone who's been through this -- and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back, because it's hard to leave that kid at home. 
Your job needs to be challenging. 
You need to feel like you're making a difference. 
And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did, if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities, you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. 
Don't leave before you leave. 
Stay in. 
Keep your foot on the gas pedal, until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child -- and then make your decisions. 
Don't make decisions too far in advance, particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making. 
My generation really, sadly, is not going to change the numbers at the top. 
They're just not moving. 
We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women] at the top of any industry. 
But I'm hopeful that future generations can. 
I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women, would be a better world. 
It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are, even though that would be very helpful. 
I think it would be a better world. 
I have two children. 
I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home, and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So today, I'm going to tell you about some people who didn't move out of their neighborhoods. 
The first one is happening right here in Chicago. 
Brenda Palms-Farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison. 
Currently, taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail. 
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back. 
I find it interesting that, for every one dollar we spend, however, on early childhood education, like Head Start, we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future. 
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well. 
But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that, took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution: create a business that produces skin care products from honey. 
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me. 
It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential. 
She hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees, harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves, and that were later sold at Whole Foods. 
She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed, like anger-management and teamwork, and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more. 
Less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail. 
So these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process. 
Talk about a sweet beginning. 
Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles, and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues. 
But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now. 
They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains. 
Currently, 20 percent of California's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California. 
Their spending loads, loads, to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well. 
Now Andy Lipkis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees, people and technology to create a more livable city. 
All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water, also helps cool our cities. 
Because, come to think about it, do you really want air-conditioning, or is it a cooler room that you want? 
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference. 
So a few years ago, L.A. County decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools. 
And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves. 
And by presenting a really strong economic case, they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery, that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure. 
So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided, and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down, while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up, resulting in a net-savings to the system, but also healthier students and schools system employees as well. 
Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter. 
Her family has eight generations in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia. 
And if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history, and of the town, it should be Judy. 
But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people. 
Now, two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months, and only for about a few years' worth of coal. 
That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal." 
It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months. 
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal. 
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners, but everybody. 
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned. 
And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied, leaving even more unemployment in their wake. 
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain, and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet. 
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs, or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills, and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind. 
She calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time, and it's a net-plus on so many levels for the local, national and global economy. 
It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal, but the wind energy actually pays back forever. 
Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals, and it gives them a lot of misery. 
The water is turned into goo. 
Most people are still unemployed, leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well. 
Now Judy and I -- I have to say -- totally related to each other. 
Not quite an obvious alliance. 
I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia. 
I mean, they are not -- they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that. 
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me, says, "Save the endangered hillbillies." 
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about. 
But just a few months ago, Judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer. 
Yeah. 
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain. 
And I just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from. 
But her dream of Coal River Mountain Wind is her legacy. 
And she might not get to see that mountaintop. 
But rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something, she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen. 
That's what my homegirl is doing. 
So I'm so proud of that. 
(Applause) But these three people don't know each other, but they do have an awful lot in common. 
They're all problem solvers, and they're just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now. 
I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called ThePromisedLand.org. 
Now they're all very practical visionaries. 
They take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products, healthy schools, electricity -- and how the money's flowing to meet those demands. 
And when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs, you're left with unemployed people, and those people aren't cheap. 
In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens, and they include generationally impoverished, traumatized vets returning from the Middle East, people coming out of jail. 
And for the veterans in particular, the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003. 
I think that number's probably going to go up. 
They're not the largest number of people, but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress. 
So these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands, reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future. 
And there are plenty of other examples like that. 
One problem: waste handling and unemployment. 
Even when we think or talk about recycling, lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled. 
And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities. 
And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models -- there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park, where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another, or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell. 
We can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing. 
And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx, but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot. 
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years, the city wanted to build a jail. 
They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness. 
Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment. 
Working-class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system. 
It relies too much on transportation, chemical fertilization, big use of water and also refrigeration. 
Mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land, and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity. 
And so we know "urban ag" is a big buzz topic this time of the year, but it's mostly gardening, which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production. 
The numbers just aren't there. 
Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city, that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities, owned and operated by small growers, where now there are only consumers. 
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce. 
It's not a competition with rural farm; it's actually reinforcements. 
It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system. 
The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals, senior centers, schools, daycare centers, and produce a network of regional jobs, as well. 
This is smart infrastructure. 
And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day. 
Our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs. 
Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs. 
And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base. 
And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability. 
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here. 
These examples indicate a trend. 
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident. 
I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country, and the good news is that it's growing. 
And we all need to be invested in it. 
It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery. 
And I call it "hometown security." 
The recession has us reeling and fearful, and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering. 
It's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery. 
Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local. 
And when we do that, our neighbors -- be they next-door, or in the next state, or in the next country -- will be just fine. 
The sum of the local is the global. 
Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses, putting people to work, restoring our natural systems. 
Hometown security means creating wealth here at home, instead of destroying it overseas. 
Tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings, wealth generation and national security. 
Many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across America. 
The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more. 
Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own, but it's not like the old saying, "charity begins at home." 
I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant. 
And it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear. 
And reading that book made me reexamine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that. 
See, my dad was a great, great man in many ways. 
He grew up in the segregated South, escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times, and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times. 
But, like all of us, he had some problems. 
(Laughter) And his was gambling, compulsively. 
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home," meant that my payday -- or someone else's -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day. 
So you need to help him out. 
And sometimes I would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs, and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest, of course, after he hit it big. 
And he did sometimes, believe it or not, at a racetrack in Los Angeles -- one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s. 
He made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in. 
So I'm not that unhappy about that. 
But listen, I did feel obligated to him, and I grew up -- then I grew up. 
And I'm a grown woman now, and I have learned a few things along the way. 
To me, charity often is just about giving, because you're supposed to, or because it's what you've always done, or it's about giving until it hurts. 
I'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- I'm not trying to feed the habit. 
I spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment, that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it, actually left people in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before. 
And over the past 20 years, we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems, yet educational outcomes, malnutrition, incarceration, obesity, diabetes, income disparity, they've all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular, infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well. 
And I know a little bit about these issues, because, for many years, I spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex, and I'm a recovering executive director, two years clean. 
(Laughter) But during that time, I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities. 
But I really did struggle for financial support. 
The greater our success, the less money came in from foundations. 
And I tell you, being on the TED stage and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived. 
And by the time I'd moved on, I was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees. 
And I think because early on, frankly, my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time. 
But since then, the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk became this little thing. 
But I did in fact get married in it. 
Over here. 
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding. 
The South Bronx Greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006. 
Since then, we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here. 
And we love this, because I love construction now, because we're watching these things actually happen. 
So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise. 
I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people. 
Hometown security is next on my to-do list. 
What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises, who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual. 
We need to work together to embrace and repair our land, repair our power systems and repair ourselves. 
It's time to stop building the shopping malls, the prisons, the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures. 
It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. 
And she called, and she said, "I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer." 
And I thought, "Well, what's the struggle?" 
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant." 
(Laughter) And I was like, "Okay." 
And she said, "But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. 
So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller." 
And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, "You're going to call me a what?" 
And she said, "I'm going to call you a storyteller." 
And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?" 
(Laughter) I was like, "Let me think about this for a second." 
I tried to call deep on my courage. 
And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. 
I'm a qualitative researcher. 
I collect stories; that's what I do. 
And maybe stories are just data with a soul. 
And maybe I'm just a storyteller. 
And so I said, "You know what? 
Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller." 
And she went, "Ha ha. There's no such thing." 
(Laughter) So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today -- we're talking about expanding perception -- and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent. 
And this is where my story starts. 
When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research professor who said to us, "Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist." 
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. 
I was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Absolutely." 
And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life's messy, love it." 
And I'm more of the, "life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box." 
(Laughter) And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me -- really, one of the big sayings in social work is, "Lean into the discomfort of the work." 
And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. 
That was my mantra. 
So I was very excited about this. 
And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. 
But I want to be able to make them not messy. 
I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see. 
So where I started was with connection. 
Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. 
It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. 
This is what it's all about. 
It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is -- neurobiologically that's how we're wired -- it's why we're here. 
So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection. 
Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one "opportunity for growth?" 
(Laughter) And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right? 
Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. 
When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. 
And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection. 
So very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research -- I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. 
And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is. 
And it turned out to be shame. 
And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection? 
The things I can tell you about it: It's universal; we all have it. 
The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. 
No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. 
What underpinned this shame, this "I'm not good enough," -- which, we all know that feeling: "I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough." 
The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. 
This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen. 
And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. 
And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. 
I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it. 
So I was ready, and I was really excited. 
As you know, it's not going to turn out well. 
(Laughter) You know this. 
So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. 
But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to -- and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. 
My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups. 
At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years. 
And I kind of got a handle on it. 
I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works. 
I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay -- and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness -- that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense of love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough. 
There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. 
And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. 
That's it. 
They believe they're worthy. 
And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. 
So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those. 
What do these people have in common? 
I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk. 
So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research? 
And the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted." 
These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness. 
So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. 
In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents. 
What's the theme? What's the pattern? 
My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode. 
And so here's what I found. 
What they had in common was a sense of courage. 
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. 
Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language -- it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" -- and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. 
And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. 
They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. 
And the last was they had connection, and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection. 
The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. 
They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. 
They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating -- as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. 
They talked about the willingness to say, "I love you" first ... 
the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... 
the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. 
They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. 
They thought this was fundamental. 
I personally thought it was betrayal. 
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job -- you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. 
And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. 
This led to a little breakdown -- (Laughter) -- which actually looked more like this. 
(Laughter) And it did. 
I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening. 
(Laughter) A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. 
And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. 
Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, "I think I need to see somebody. 
Because about five of my friends were like, "Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist." 
(Laughter) I was like, "What does that mean?" 
And they're like, "I'm just saying, you know. 
Don't bring your measuring stick." 
(Laughter) I was like, "Okay." 
So I found a therapist. 
My first meeting with her, Diana -- I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down. 
And she said, "How are you?" 
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay." 
She said, "What's going on?" 
And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good. 
(Laughter) And so I said, "Here's the thing, I'm struggling." 
And she said, "What's the struggle?" 
And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. 
And I think I have a problem, and I need some help." 
And I said, "But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit." 
(Laughter) "I just need some strategies." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. 
So she goes like this. 
(Laughter) And then I said, "It's bad, right?" 
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad." 
(Laughter) "It just is what it is." 
And I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck." 
(Laughter) And it did, and it didn't. 
And it took about a year. 
And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. 
A: that's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that. 
(Laughter) For me, it was a yearlong street fight. 
It was a slugfest. 
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. 
I lost the fight, but probably won my life back. 
And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability. 
Why do we struggle with it so much? 
Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? 
No. 
So this is what I learned. 
We numb vulnerability -- when we're waiting for the call. 
It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, "How would you define vulnerability? 
What makes you feel vulnerable?" 
Because I wanted to know what's out there. 
Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. 
This is the world we live in. 
We live in a vulnerable world. 
And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability. 
And I think there's evidence -- and it's not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it's a huge cause -- We are the most in-debt ... 
obese ... 
addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. 
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion. 
You can't say, here's the bad stuff. 
Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. 
I don't want to feel these. 
I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. 
(Laughter) I don't want to feel these. 
And I know that's knowing laughter. 
I hack into your lives for a living. 
God. 
(Laughter) You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. 
You cannot selectively numb. 
So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. 
And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. 
And it becomes this dangerous cycle. 
One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. 
And it doesn't just have to be addiction. 
The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. 
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty. 
"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up." 
That's it. 
Just certain. 
The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. 
This is what politics looks like today. 
There's no conversation. 
There's just blame. 
You know how blame is described in the research? 
A way to discharge pain and discomfort. 
We perfect. 
If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work. 
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks. 
(Laughter) Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "Wow." 
(Laughter) And we perfect, most dangerously, our children. 
Let me tell you what we think about children. 
They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. 
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, "Look at her, she's perfect. 
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh." 
That's not our job. 
Our job is to look and say, "You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging." 
That's our job. 
Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today. 
We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. 
We do that in our personal lives. 
We do that corporate -- whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ... 
a recall. 
We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. 
I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. 
We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... 
"We're sorry. We'll fix it." 
But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this. 
This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... 
to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee -- and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, "Can I love you this much? 
Can I believe in this this passionately? 
just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, "I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive." 
And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we're enough. 
Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, "I'm enough" ... 
then we stop screaming and start listening, we're kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves. 
That's all I have. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you. 
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher. 
Ken and I have been working together for almost 40 years. 
That's Ken Sharpe over there. 
(Applause) So there is among many people -- certainly me and most of the people I talk to -- a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working, with the way our institutions run. 
Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them. 
Our doctors don't know who the hell we are, and they don't have enough time for us. 
We certainly can't trust the bankers, and we certainly can't trust the brokers. 
They almost brought the entire financial system down. 
And even as we do our own work, all too often, we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing, or the required thing, or the profitable thing. 
So everywhere we look, pretty much across the board, we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. 
Or if they do have our interests at heart, we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests. 
They don't understand us. 
They don't have the time to get to know us. 
There are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction. 
If things aren't going right, the first response is: let's make more rules, let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing. 
Give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom, so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids, as long as they follow the scripts, our kids will get educated. 
Give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes, so that you don't need to rely on judges using their judgment. 
Instead, all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime. 
Impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees. 
More and more rules to protect us against an indifferent, uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with. 
Or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules, let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that, even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests, it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness. 
So we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems. 
Rules and incentives -- "sticks" and "carrots." 
We passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse. 
There's the Dodd-Frank Act, there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by Elizabeth Warren. 
Maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave. 
We'll see. 
In addition, we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies, rather than securing short-term profits. 
So if we find just the right incentives, they'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly, and if we come up with the right rules and regulations, they won't drive us all over a cliff. 
And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers. 
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that. 
But what we believe, and what we argue in the book, is that there is no set of rules, no matter how detailed, no matter how specific, no matter how carefully monitored and enforced, there is no set of rules that will get us what we need. 
Why? Because bankers are smart people. 
And, like water, they will find cracks in any set of rules. 
You design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system "almost-collapse" can't happen again. 
It is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse, you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse. 
So it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that. 
What we desperately need, beyond, or along with, better rules and reasonably smart incentives, is we need virtue. 
We need character. 
We need people who want to do the right thing. 
And in particular, the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that Aristotle called "practical wisdom." 
Practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is. 
So Aristotle was very interested in watching how the craftsmen around him worked. 
And he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems -- problems that they hadn't anticipated. 
So one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos, and they need to measure out round columns. 
Well if you think about it, it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. 
So what do they do? 
They fashion a novel solution to the problem. 
They created a ruler that bends, what we would call these days a tape measure -- a flexible rule, a rule that bends. 
And Aristotle said, "Hah, they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns, you need to bend the rule." 
And Aristotle said often in dealing with other people, we need to bend the rules. 
Dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass. 
Wise people know when and how to bend the rules. 
Wise people know how to improvise. 
The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it, they are kind of like jazz musicians. 
The rules are like the notes on the page, and that gets you started, but then you dance around the notes on the page, coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players. 
So for Aristotle, the kind of rule-bending, rule exception-finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman. 
And in interactions with people, almost all the time, it is this kind of flexibility that is required. 
A wise person knows when to bend the rules. 
A wise person knows when to improvise. 
And most important, a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims. 
If you are a rule-bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself, what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people. 
So it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself. 
And so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception-finding. 
Together they comprise practical wisdom, which Aristotle thought was the master virtue. 
So I'll give you an example of wise practice in action. 
It's the case of Michael. 
Michael's a young guy. 
He had a pretty low-wage job. 
He was supporting his wife and a child, and the child was going to parochial school. 
Then he lost his job. 
He panicked about being able to support his family. 
One night, he drank a little too much, and he robbed a cab driver -- stole 50 dollars. 
He robbed him at gunpoint. 
It was a toy gun. 
He got caught. He got tried. 
He got convicted. 
The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of two years, 24 months. 
The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense. 
He had never committed a crime before. 
He was a responsible husband and father. 
He had been faced with desperate circumstances. 
All this would do is wreck a family. 
And so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months, and not only that, but release every day to go to work. 
Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job. 
He did. He served out his sentence. 
He made restitution and found himself a new job. 
And the family was united. 
And it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life -- a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. 
But it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own, and so he appealed. 
And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery. 
He did after all have a toy gun. 
The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years. 
He won the appeal. 
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. 
Judge Forer had to follow the law. 
And by the way, this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence, so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family and he had to go back into jail. 
Judge Forer did what she was required to do, and then she quit the bench. 
And Michael disappeared. 
So that is an example, both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better. 
Now consider Ms. Dewey. 
Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school. 
She found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids, so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests. 
All these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones, and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools. 
So here was the consultant's advice: first, don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. 
Second, don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. 
Third, don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted. 
Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble, the so-called "bubble kids" -- kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing. 
So Ms. Dewey heard this, and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly. 
It's like they were about to go play a football game. 
For Ms. Dewey, this isn't why she became a teacher. 
Now Ken and I are not naive, and we understand that you need to have rules. 
You need to have incentives. 
People have to make a living. 
But the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity, and they demoralize professional activity in two senses. 
First, they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity. 
Judge Forer quits, and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened. 
And second, they demoralize the activity itself. 
The very practice is demoralized, and the practitioners are demoralized. 
It creates people -- when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing -- it creates people who are addicted to incentives. 
That is to say, it creates people who only do things for incentives. 
Now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for 30 years. 
Psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years. 
We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures, they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward. 
If you reward kids for reading books, they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are. 
If you reward teachers for kids' test scores, they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation. 
If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures -- which is the current system -- they would do more. 
If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures, they will do fewer. 
What we want, of course, is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason -- namely, to serve the welfare of their patients. 
Psychologists have known this for decades, and it's time for policymakers to start paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit, instead of economists. 
And it doesn't have to be this way. 
We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope. 
We identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws. 
These are people who, being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives, find away around the rules, find a way to subvert the rules. 
So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow, and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing. 
And so what they do is they follow the scripts, but they follow the scripts at double-time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective. 
So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes, and they're incredibly admirable, but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down. 
So canny outlaws are better than nothing, but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time. 
More hopeful are people we call system-changers. 
These are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations, but to transform the system, and we talk about several. 
One in particular is a judge named Robert Russell. 
And one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettengill. 
Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet who had planned to make the army a career, but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq, and that forced him to take a medical discharge. 
He was married, he had a third kid on the way, he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back, and recurrent nightmares, and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms. 
He was only able to get part-time work because of his back, and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family. 
So he started selling marijuana. 
He was busted in a drug sweep. 
His family was kicked out of their apartment, and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids. 
Under normal sentencing procedures, Judge Russell would have had little choice but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon. 
But Judge Russell did have an alternative. 
And that's because he was in a special court. 
He was in a court called the Veterans' Court. 
In the Veterans' Court -- this was the first of its kind in the United States. 
Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court. 
It was a court only for veterans who had broken the law. 
And he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging. 
No one wanted non-violent offenders -- and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot -- to be thrown into prison. 
They wanted to do something about what we all know, namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system. 
And what the Veterans' Court did, was it treated each criminal as an individual, tried to get inside their problems, tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves, and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made. 
Stayed with them, followed up on them, made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump. 
There are now 22 cities that have Veterans' Courts like this. 
Why has the idea spread? 
Well, one reason is that Judge Russell has now seen 108 vets in his Veterans' Court as of February of this year, and out of 108, guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison. 
None. None. 
Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record. 
So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching. 
There's a banker who created a for-profit community bank that encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe -- encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low-income clients. 
The bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community. 
Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards, the default rate was extremely low. 
The bank was profitable. 
The bankers stayed with their loan recipients. 
They didn't make loans and then sell the loans. 
They serviced the loans. 
They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments. 
Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers. 
Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients, before it turned into an institution that serves only itself. 
Banking wasn't always this way, and it doesn't have to be this way. 
So there are examples like this in medicine -- doctors at Harvard who are trying to transform medical education, so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy, which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training. 
And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year. 
So the patients are not organ systems, and they're not diseases; they're people, people with lives. 
And in order to be an effective doctor, you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease. 
In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth, mentoring of one student by another, of all the students by the doctors, and the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors who do have time for the people they treat. 
We'll see. 
So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about. 
Each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission -- what Aristotle would have called its proper telos. 
And Ken and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want. 
People want to be allowed to be virtuous. 
They want to have permission to do the right thing. 
They don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work. 
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness, and he was right. 
There's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy, and the two things that jump out in study after study -- I know this will come as a shock to all of you -- the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work. 
Love: managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part. 
Work: engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying. 
If you have that, good close relations with other people, work that's meaningful and fulfilling, you don't much need anything else. 
Well, to love well and to work well, you need wisdom. 
Rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent, how to be a good spouse, or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher. 
Rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom. 
Indeed, we argue, there is no substitute for wisdom. 
And so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self-sacrifice on the part of practitioners. 
In giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing -- to do right by others -- practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us. 
And my little idea that will do that is sleep. 
(Laughter) (Applause) This is a room of type A women. 
This is a room of sleep-deprived women. 
And I learned the hard way the value of sleep. 
Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion. 
I hit my head on my desk. 
I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye. 
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. 
And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep. 
(Applause) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue. 
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top -- literally -- (Laughter) (Applause) because unfortunately, for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol. 
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before. 
And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn't say -- I felt like saying, "You know what? if you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting." 
(Laughter) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship. 
Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date, and you say, "How about eight o'clock?" 
they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's OK, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight." 
And they think that means they are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is, they're not, because we, at the moment, have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions. 
So a high IQ does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic. 
(Laughter) And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics. 
In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around. 
(Laughter) (Applause) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep, and have been able to see the big picture. 
So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers, is also what is best for the world. 
So I urge you to shut your eyes, and discover the great ideas that lie inside us; to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins, and I promise I will come back to those virgins. 
But in fact, here in the Northwest, we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise, defined 36 times as "gardens watered by running streams." 
Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union, this makes perfect sense to me. 
But the thing is, how come it's news to most people? 
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims who've begun reading the Koran, but given up, disconcerted by its "otherness." 
The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes, yet even he called the Koran "as toilsome reading as I ever undertook; a wearisome, confused jumble." 
(Laughter) Part of the problem, I think, is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book -- as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach, as though God -- and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad -- were just another author on the best-seller list. 
Yet, the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote -- that is, to misquote. 
(Laughter) Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the "highlighter version," which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti-Muslim Islamophobes. 
So this past spring, as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad, I realized I needed to read the Koran properly -- as properly as I could, that is. 
My Arabic is reduced by now to wielding a dictionary, so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side by side, verse by verse, along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic. 
Now, I did have an advantage. 
My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a-Sunni split, and for that, I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories, so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers, its frame of reference. 
I knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran -- an informed one, an experienced one, even, but still an outsider, an agnostic Jew reading someone else's holy book. 
(Laughter) So I read slowly. 
(Laughter) I'd set aside three weeks for this project, and that, I think, is what is meant by "hubris" -- (Laughter) because it turned out to be three months. 
(Laughter) I did resist the temptation to skip to the back, where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are. 
But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran -- that feeling of "I get it now" -- it would slip away overnight, and I'd come back in the morning, wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land. 
And yet, the terrain was very familiar. 
The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels. 
So one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus. 
God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh, jealously insisting on no other gods. 
The presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert. 
And then there was the language, the rhythmic cadence of it, reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory. 
And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic. 
Take the Fatihah, the seven-verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined. 
It's just 29 words in Arabic, but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation. 
And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing. 
The Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than read, felt more than analyzed. 
It wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue. 
So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself, or as Arthur Arberry called his version, "an interpretation." 
But all is not lost in translation. 
As the Koran promises, patience is rewarded, and there are many surprises -- a degree of environmental awareness, for instance, and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation, unmatched in the Bible. 
And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men, using the second- and third-person masculine, the Koran includes women -- talking, for instance, of believing men and believing women, honorable men and honorable women. 
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers. 
Yes, it does say that, but in a very specific context: the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca, where fighting was usually forbidden. 
And the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers. 
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca," but you can, you are allowed to, but only after a grace period is over, and only if there's no other pact in place, and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba, and only if they attack you first. 
And even then -- God is merciful; forgiveness is supreme -- and so, essentially, better if you don't. 
(Laughter) This was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexible the Koran is, at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible. 
"Some of these verses are definite in meaning," it says, "and others are ambiguous." 
The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities, trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own. 
Only God knows the true meaning. 
The phrase "God is subtle" appears again and again, and indeed, the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe. 
As in, for instance, that little matter of virgins and paradise. 
Old-fashioned orientalism comes into play here. 
The word used four times is "houris," rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts, or as fair, high-bosomed virgins. 
Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word: houris. 
Not a swelling breast or high bosom in sight. 
(Laughter) Now this may be a way of saying "pure beings," like in angels, or it may be like the Greek "kouros" or "kore," an eternal youth. 
But the truth is, nobody really knows. 
And that's the point. 
Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be "a new creation in paradise," and that you will be "recreated in a form unknown to you," which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin. 
(Laughter) And that number 72 never appears. 
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran. 
That idea only came into being 300 years later, and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps. 
Paradise is quite the opposite. 
It's not virginity; it's fecundity; it's plenty. 
It's gardens watered by running streams. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So I am a surgeon who studies creativity, and I have never had a patient tell me, "I really want you to be creative during surgery," and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it. 
I will say though that, after having done surgery a lot, it's similar to playing a musical instrument. 
And for me, this deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and to study the science of sound, particularly music. 
I'm going to talk over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to study music and try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative. 
I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University, and at the National Institute of Health where I was previously. 
I'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments. 
I will start off by playing a video for you. 
This video is of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser and probably the most well-known, iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a higher level. 
And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head, and he'll never play it exactly the same way again, so as a form of intense creativity, I think this is a great example. 
And so why don't we go and click the video. 
(Music) (Music ends) It's really a remarkable thing that happens there. 
I've always as a listener, as a fan, I listen to that, and I'm astounded. 
I think -- how can this possibly be? 
How can the brain generate that much information, that much music, spontaneously? 
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain. 
With this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product, I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process, and there are subquestions that I put there. 
Is it possible to study creativity scientifically? 
And I think that's a good question. 
And I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music, they're very dense, and when you go through them, it's very hard to recognize the music in it. 
In fact, they seem to be unmusical entirely and to miss the point of the music. 
This brings the second question: Why should scientists study creativity? 
Maybe we're not the right people to do it. 
(Laughter) Well it may be, but I will say that, from a scientific perspective, we talked a lot about innovation today, the science of innovation, how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy, and truly, we know very little about how we are able to be creative. 
I think that we're going to see, over the next 10, 20, 30 years, a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish, Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process like complex jazz improvisation, and study it rigorously. 
So it gets down to the brain. 
All of us have this remarkable brain, which is poorly understood, to say the least. 
I think that neuroscientists have more questions than answers, and I'm not going to give you answers today, just ask a lot of questions. 
And that's what I do in my lab. 
I ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this. 
This is the main method that I use. This is functional MRI. 
If you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same, but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain, but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain. 
The way that's done is by the following: There's something called BOLD imaging, which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging. 
When you're in an fMRI scanner, you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas. 
When an area of the brain is active, meaning a neural area is active, it gets blood flow shunted to that area. 
That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration. 
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI, whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. 
So through this method of inference -- and we're measuring blood flow, not neural activity -- we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood was active during a particular task, and that's the crux of how fMRI works. 
And it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes. 
I'm going to review a study that I did, which was jazz in an fMRI scanner. 
It was done with a colleague, Alan Braun, at the NIH. 
This is a short video of how we did this project. 
(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments. 
And it's a 35-key keyboard designed to fit both inside the scanner, be magnetically safe, have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact, and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs while they're lying down in the scanner, playing on their back. 
It works like this -- this doesn't actually produce any sound. 
It sends out what's called a MIDI signal -- or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface -- through these wires into the box and then the computer, which then trigger high-quality piano samples like this. 
(Music) (Music) (Music ends) OK, so it works. 
And so through this piano keyboard, we have the means to take a musical process and study it. 
So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard? 
You can't just say, "It's great we have a keyboard." 
We have to come up with a scientific experiment. 
The experiment really rests on the following: What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over-learned, and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated, or improvised, in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features? 
I have here what we call the paradigms. 
There's a scale paradigm, which is playing a scale up and down, memorized, then there's improvising on a scale, quarter notes, metronome, right hand -- scientifically very safe, but musically really boring. 
Then there's the bottom one, which is called the jazz paradigm. 
So we brought professional jazz players to the NIH, and we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower-left, which is what you heard me playing -- and we had them improvise to the same chord changes. 
And if you can hit that lower-right sound icon, that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner. 
(Music) (Music ends) In the end, it's not the most natural environment, but they're able to play real music. 
And I've listened to that solo 200 times, and I still like it. 
And the musicians were comfortable in the end. 
We first measured the number of notes. 
Were they playing more notes when they were improvising? 
That was not what was going on. 
And then we looked at the brain activity. 
I will try to condense this for you. 
These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising vs. when you're doing something memorized. 
In red is an area that's active in the prefrontal cortex, the frontal lobe of the brain, and in blue is this area that was deactivated. 
So we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity. 
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity, I'll summarize that for you. 
These are multifunctional areas of the brain, these are not the jazz areas of the brain. 
They do a whole host of things that have to do with self-reflection, introspection, working memory etc. 
But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self-monitoring, turning off, and this area that's thought to be autobiographical, or self-expressive, turning on. 
We think, at least in this preliminary -- it's one study; it's probably wrong, but it's one study -- (Laughter) we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that, to be creative, you should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe. 
One area turns on, and a big area shuts off, so that you're not inhibited, you're willing to make mistakes, so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses. 
Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity -- sometimes it's done communicatively. 
The next question was: What happens when musicians are trading back and forth, something called "trading fours," which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment. 
So this is a 12-bar blues, and I've broken it down into four-bar groups, so you would know how you would trade. 
We brought a musician into the scanner, same way, had them memorize this melody then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively. 
So this is a musician, Mike Pope, one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player. 
(Music) He's now playing the piece that we just saw a little better than I wrote it. 
(Video) CL: Mike, come on in. 
Mike Pope: May the force be with you. 
Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike? 
CL: You have to have the right attitude to agree to do it. 
(Laughter) It's kind of fun, actually. 
(Music) Now we're playing back and forth. 
He's in there. You can see his legs up there. 
(Music) And then I'm in the control room here, playing back and forth. 
(Music) (Music ends) (Video) Mike Pope: This is a pretty good representation of what it's like. 
And it's good that it's not too quick. 
The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings. 
So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing, looking at my hands through two mirrors, laying on my back, and not able to move at all except for my hand. 
That was challenging. 
But again -- there were moments, for sure -- (Laughter) there were moments of real, honest-to-God musical interplay, for sure. 
CL: At this point, I'll take a few moments. 
So what you're seeing here -- and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science, which is to show you preliminary data. 
This is one subject's data. 
This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data. 
So what am I showing you here? 
When he was trading fours with me, improvising vs. memorized, his language areas lit up, his Broca's area, in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left. 
He had it also homologous on the right. 
This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication. 
This whole notion that music is a language -- maybe there's a neurologic basis to it after all, and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation. 
So we've done this on eight subjects now, and we're getting all the data together, hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully. 
Now when I think about improvisation and the language, what's next? 
Rap, of course, rap -- freestyle. 
I've always been fascinated by freestyle. 
And let's play this video. 
(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be, standing five-ten I be Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry Go and try to injure me, broke 'em down chemically Ain't the number 10 MC, talk about how been I be Styled it like Kennedy, late like a 10 to three When I say when I be, girls say bend that key cut CL: So there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in freestyle rap and jazz. 
There are a lot of correlates between the two forms of music, I think, in different time periods, in lot of ways, rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve. 
So how do you study rap scientifically? 
And my colleagues think I'm crazy, but I think it's very viable. 
This is what you do: You have a freestyle artist come and memorize a rap that you write for them, that they've never heard before, and then you have them freestyle. 
So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED, and they said, "No, you won't." 
And then I thought -- (Laughter) (Applause) But here's the thing. 
With this big screen, you can all rap with me. OK? 
So what we had them do was memorize this lower-left sound icon, please. 
This is the control condition. This is what they memorized. 
Computer: Memory, thump. 
CL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike Computer: Search. 
CL: I search for the truth in this eternal quest My passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed Psychopathic words in my head appear Whisper these lyrics only I can hear Computer: Art. 
CL: The art of discovering and that which is hovering Inside the mind of those unconfined All of these words keep pouring out like rain I need a mad scientist to check my brain Computer: Stop. 
(Applause) I guarantee you that will never happen again. 
(Laughter) So now, what's great about these free-stylers, they will get cued different words. 
They don't know what's coming, but they'll hear something off the cuff. 
Go hit that right sound icon, there will be cued three square words: like, not and head. 
He doesn't know what's coming. Computer: Like. 
Freestyler: I'm like some kind of extraterrestrial, celestial scene Back in the days, I used to sit in pyramids and meditate With two microphones -- Computer: Head hovering over my head See if I could still listen, spittin' off the sound See what you grinning I teach the children in the back of the classroom About the message of apocalyptical Computer: Not. 
Not really though, 'cause I've got to keep it simple instrumental Detrimental playing Super Mario boxes [unclear] hip hop Computer: Stop. 
CL: It's an incredible thing that's taking place. 
It's doing something neurologically remarkable. 
Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant. 
Creatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing. 
This is a short video of how we do this in a scanner. 
[fMRI of Hip-Hop Rap] (Laughter) (Video) CL: We're here with Emmanuel. 
CL: That was recorded in the scanner, by the way. 
He's just memorized a rhyme for us. 
[Control Condition Memorized Verses] Emmanuel: Top of the beat with no repeat Rhythm and rhyme make me complete Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike Computer: Search. 
I search for the truth in this eternal quest I'm passing on fashion; you can see how I'm dressed CL: I'm going to stop that there; so what do we see in his brain? 
This is four rappers' brains. 
And we do see language areas lighting up, but then, eyes closed -- when you are freestyling vs. memorizing, you've got major visual areas lighting up. 
You've got major cerebellar activity, which is involved in motor coordination. 
You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task, when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized. 
It's very preliminary, but I think it's kind of cool. 
To conclude, we've got a lot of questions to ask, and like I said, we'll ask questions here, not answer them. 
But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius neurologically, and I think, with these methods, we're getting close. 
And I think, hopefully in the next 10, 20 years, you'll see real, meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art, and maybe we're starting now to get there. 
Thank you for your time, I appreciate it. 
(Applause) 

There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all. 
Do you know which group you're in? 
If you don't, you're not alone. 
Because the breast has become a very political organ. 
The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies. 
I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth. 
But first, my disclosures. 
I am not a breast cancer survivor. 
I'm not a radiologist. 
I don't have any patents, and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company, and I am not seeking your vote. 
(Laughter) What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question. 
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump. 
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s. 
She and I were both very pregnant at that time, and my heart just ached for her, imagining how afraid she must be. 
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign. 
But she asked me a question: how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one? 
So I studied her mammogram, and I reviewed the radiology literature, and I was shocked to discover that, in her case, our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin. 
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s. 
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force, even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies. 
It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage. 
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines. 
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post. 
The radiologists were, in turn, criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest. 
But in my view, the radiologists are heroes. 
There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms, and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret, and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause. 
But that very fact is telling. 
Where there is this much legal smoke, there is likely to be some fire. 
The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density. 
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat -- pictured here in yellow -- versus connective and epithelial tissues -- pictured in pink. 
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined. 
Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them. 
And although breast density generally declines with age, up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause. 
So how do you know if your breasts are dense? 
Well, you need to read the details of your mammography report. 
Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram. 
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense, that's called fatty-replaced. 
The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities, followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense. 
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense. 
The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing. 
Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram, and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two. 
So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast. 
But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast. 
That's why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts, but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts. 
Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer, but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer. 
It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer. 
At the time my patient posed this question to me, breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature, and very few women having mammograms, or the physicians ordering them, knew about this. 
But what else could I offer her? 
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's, and it's changed very little. 
There have been surprisingly few innovations, until digital mammography was approved in 2000. 
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally, just like we can with a digital camera. 
The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment, and what have we gained from that investment? 
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women. 
But it was better in one group, and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts, and in those women, digital mammography found twice as many cancers, but it still only found 60 percent. 
So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind. 
What about ultrasound? 
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used. 
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive. 
If we think about disruptive technology, we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive. 
Think about iPods compared to stereos. 
But it's the exact opposite in health care. 
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive. 
Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer. 
It's just way too much equipment. 
One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs. 
And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price. 
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation, and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius. 
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated, if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about. 
It's like the essence of TED. 
He quotes one innovator who says, "The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick." 
(Laughter) This makes no sense, because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions. 
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems. 
Now, take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article, and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers. 
(Laughter) So if you will allow me a little creative license, I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution. 
Shortly after her visit, I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner, who was a specialist in cardiac imaging, something I had nothing to do with. 
And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. 
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart, and it had even been tried to image the breast. 
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. 
But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density. 
But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival. 
If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases. 
But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it. 
It's made not of a bulky tube, but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector. 
And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density, and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors. 
So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- (Laughter) -- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out, and we attached the new detector, and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI. 
This is an image from our first patient. 
And you can see, using the old gamma technology, that it just looked like noise. 
But using our new detector, we could begin to see the outline of a tumor. 
So here we were, a nuclear physicist, an internist, soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer, and two radiologists, and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape. 
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system. 
This is our current detector. 
And you can see that it looks a lot different. 
The duct tape is gone, and we added a second detector on top of the breast, which has further improved our tumor detection. 
So how does this work? 
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells, but not by normal cells, and this is the key difference from mammography. 
Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue, and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast. 
But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors, and therefore, it's impervious to breast density. 
After the injection, the patient's breast is placed between the detectors. 
And if you've ever had a mammogram -- if you're old enough to have had a mammogram -- you know what comes next: pain. 
You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law, and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study. 
But with MBI, we use just light, pain-free compression. 
(Applause) And the detector then transmits the image to the computer. 
So here's an example. 
You can see, on the right, a mammogram showing a faint tumor, the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue. 
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly, as well as a second tumor, which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. 
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor, we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors -- one is small as three millimeters. 
Our big break came in 2004. 
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors, we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. 
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts, comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI. 
Of the tumors that we found, mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors. 
MBI found 83 percent. 
Here's an example from that screening study. 
The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue, but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake, which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor. 
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor. 
And in this case, a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo, who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young, wanted to enroll in our study. 
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue, but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake, which we can also see on a color image. 
And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball. 
But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes. 
So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem. 
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose, and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this. 
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram. 
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. 
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting. 
It's also older women with dense tissue. 
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology. 
MBI generates four images per breast. 
MRI generates over a thousand. 
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding. 
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image. 
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost. 
But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo. 
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals. 
After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. 
Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology. 
(Applause) We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose, and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions, and this could take five or more years. 
If this technology is widely adopted, I will not benefit financially in any way, and that is very important to me, because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth. 
But I recognize -- (Applause) I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science. 
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved, but it's not yet widely available. 
So until something is available for women with dense breasts, there are things that you should know to protect yourself. 
First, know your density. 
Ninety percent of women don't, and 95 percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk. 
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram. 
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago, and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is. 
Of course we should. 
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report. 
Second, if you're pre-menopausal, try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle, when breast density is relatively lower. 
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast, insist on additional imaging. 
And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram. 
Mammography isn't perfect, but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer. 
But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation. 
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later, and most women, thankfully, survive. 
So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer. 
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim. 
It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations. 
We need to individualize screening based on density. 
For women without dense breasts, mammography is the best choice. 
But for women with dense breasts; we shouldn't abandon screening altogether, we need to offer them something better. 
The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school, and the answer has been so slow to come. 
She's given me her blessing to share this story with you. 
After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer, she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy. 
We can and must do better, not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters, but in time for you. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So the Awesome story: It begins about 40 years ago, when my mom and my dad came to Canada. 
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya. 
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India. 
And they got here in the late 1960s. 
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto, and they settled into a new life. 
They saw their first dentist, they ate their first hamburger, and they had their first kids. 
My sister and I grew up here, and we had quiet, happy childhoods. 
We had close family, good friends, a quiet street. 
We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up -- things like power always on in our houses, things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard. 
We grew up, and we grew older. 
I went to high school. 
I graduated. 
I moved out of the house, I got a job, I found a girl, I settled down -- and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song -- (Laughter) but life was pretty good. 
Life was pretty good. 
2006 was a great year. 
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario, I got married, surrounded by 150 family and friends. 
2007 was a great year. 
I graduated from school, and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends. 
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. 
We actually saw seals out of our car window, and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads. 
(Laughter) So you can't actually see them, but it was breathtaking, believe me. 
(Laughter) 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher. 
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people, not just me. 
First of all, the news was so heavy. 
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that, but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV, it was about ice caps melting, wars going on around the world, earthquakes, hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse, and then eventually did collapse, and so many of us losing our homes, or our jobs, or our retirements, or our livelihoods. 
2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too. 
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. 
My marriage wasn't going well, and we just were growing further and further apart. 
One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears, to have a very honest conversation. 
And she said, "I don't love you anymore," and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard, until only a month later, when I heard something even more heartbreaking. 
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of, had been battling mental illness for some time. 
And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness, you know how challenging it can be. 
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m. 
on a Sunday night. 
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening. 
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared. 
Very sadly, he took his own life. 
And it was a really heavy time. 
And as these dark clouds were circling me, and I was finding it really, really difficult to think of anything good, I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow. 
So I came home from work one night, and I logged onto the computer, and I started up a tiny website called 1000awesomethings.com. 
I was trying to remind myself of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love, but we just don't talk about enough -- things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking, being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding, wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer, or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line -- even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there. 
(Laughter) And slowly over time, I started putting myself in a better mood. 
I mean, 50,000 blogs are started a day, and so my blog was just one of those 50,000. 
And nobody read it except for my mom. 
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad. 
(Laughter) And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits, and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions. 
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger. 
And then I got a phone call, and the voice at the other end of the line said, "You've just won the Best Blog In the World award." 
I was like, that sounds totally fake. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to? 
(Laughter) But it turns out, I jumped on a plane, and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart. 
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog. 
And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto, when, in my inbox, 10 literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book. 
Flash-forward to the next year and "The Book of Awesome" has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks. 
(Applause) But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today. 
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story, I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome, and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought. 
So let's talk about those three As. 
Over the last few years, I haven't had that much time to really think. 
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website, but also grow myself?" 
And I've summarized those things, for me personally, as three As. 
They are Attitude, Awareness and Authenticity. 
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly. 
So Attitude: Look, we're all going to get lumps, and we're all going to get bumps. 
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan. 
We will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages, father-daughter dances at weddings and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room, but between those high highs, we may also have some lumps and some bumps too. 
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about, but your husband might leave you, your girlfriend could cheat, your headaches might be more serious than you thought, or your dog could get hit by a car on the street. 
It's not a happy thought, but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes. 
Your mom could get cancer, your dad could get mean. 
And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well, too, with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart, and when that bad news washes over you, and when that pain sponges and soaks in, I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices. 
One, you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever, or two, you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes. 
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two, and choosing, no matter how difficult it is, no matter what pain hits you, choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future. 
The second "A" is Awareness. 
I love hanging out with three year-olds. 
I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. 
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk. 
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand, soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs. 
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner. 
I love the way that they see the world, because they're seeing the world for the first time. 
Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year-old. 
Because you all used to be three years old. 
That three-year-old boy is still part of you. 
That three-year-old girl is still part of you. 
They're in there. 
And being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once, too. 
So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work. 
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air, or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said, "Found money." 
The last "A" is Authenticity. 
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story. 
Let's go all the way back to 1932 when, on a peanut farm in Georgia, a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born. 
Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him, grew up and grew into a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL. 
He's number 76 in the picture. 
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome." 
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against. 
They were tough football players doing what they love, which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field. 
But Rosey Grier also had another passion. 
In his deeply authentic self, he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter) He loved knitting. 
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him, it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks. 
That's what he said. 
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL, he started joining clubs. 
And he even put out a book called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men." 
(Laughter) (Applause) It's a great cover. 
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face. 
(Laughter) And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person, and that's what authenticity is all about. 
It's just about being you and being cool with that. 
And I think when you're authentic, you end up following your heart, and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy. 
You meet people that you like talking to. 
You go places you've dreamt about. 
And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled. 
So those are the three A's. 
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada. 
I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s. 
I don't know, because I never did it, but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude. 
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world. 
And I think you'd have to be really authentic, you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to. 
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about 10 seconds right now, because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this, and my parents are sitting in the front row. 
So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up. 
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys. 
(Applause) When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada. 
And it's a great story, because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport, and he was welcomed by a non-profit group, which I'm sure someone in this room runs. 
(Laughter) And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada. 
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread. 
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles, there was olives, those little white onions. 
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts, rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese. 
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches. 
There was lasagna, there was casseroles, there was brownies, there was butter tarts, and there was pies, lots and lots of pies. 
And when my dad tells the story, he says, "The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread. 
(Laughter) I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian. 
I was eating olives with pie. 
(Laughter) I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here." 
(Laughter) When I was five years old, my dad used to take me grocery shopping, and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. 
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico? 
They've got an apple here from South Africa. 
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?" 
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?" 
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am. 
Is this A&amp;P?" 
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out." 
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home. 
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf, and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country. 
And when we did, my dad would say, "Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there, picked this thing off it, put it in a truck, drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house, so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?" 
And I'd say, "I don't believe that." 
And he's like, "I don't believe it either. 
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about." 
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right. 
There are so many things to be happy about. 
We are the only species on the only life-giving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen, capable of experiencing so many of these things. 
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture. 
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy. 
We've got airplanes, highway lanes, interior design and horoscope signs. 
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes. 
You can watch a horror movie with monsters. 
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming. 
We've got books, buffets and radio waves, wedding brides and rollercoaster rides. 
You can sleep in clean sheets. 
You can go to the movies and get good seats. 
You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair, pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap. 
We've got all that, but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it. 
And that's the sad part. 
The cashiers at your grocery store, the foreman at your plant, the guy tailgating you home on the highway, the telemarketer calling you during dinner, every teacher you've ever had, everyone that's ever woken up beside you, every politician in every country, every actor in every movie, every single person in your family, everyone you love, everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. 
Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet. 
And that moment is right now, and those moments are counting down, and those moments are always, always, always fleeting. 
You will never be as young as you are right now. 
And that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude, choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow, living with a sense of awareness of the world around you, embracing your inner three year-old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself, being you and being cool with that, letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you, then I think you'll live a life that is rich and is satisfying, and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome. 
Thank you. 

I'm actually here to make a challenge to people. 
I know there have been many challenges made to people. 
The one I'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means. 
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord." 
Peace is not the dove and the rainbow -- as lovely as they are. 
When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove, I think of personal serenity. 
I think of meditation. 
I do not think about what I consider to be peace, which is sustainable peace with justice and equality. 
It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives, where these people have enough access to education and health care, so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear. 
This is called human security. 
And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really, really heavy-duty, non-violent friends, like Mairead McGuire. 
I understand that humans are so "messed up" -- to use a nice word, because I promised my mom I'd stop using the F-bomb in public. 
And I'm trying harder and harder. 
Mom, I'm really trying. 
We need a little bit of police; we need a little bit of military, but for defense. 
We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world. 
It is not arming our country to the teeth. 
It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them. 
It is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure, to make the people of the world secure. 
I was thinking about the recent ongoings in Congress, where the president is offering 8.4 billion dollars to try to get the START vote. 
I certainly support the START vote. 
But he's offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons. 
Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is 80 billion dollars? 
Just that little bit of money, which to me, I wish it was in my bank account -- it's not, but ... 
In global terms, it's a little bit of money. 
But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime, unless we get up off our ... 
and take action to make it happen, unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security. 
It is saving the tigers. 
It is stopping the tar sands. 
It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer. 
It is all of those things. 
It is using our money for all of those things. 
It is about action. 
I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago, and His Holiness -- we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city, and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates. 
And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church. 
We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak, and he leans over to me, and he says, "Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk." 
I said, "Yes, Your Holiness. 
Your robe gives it away." 
(Laughter) He said, "You know that I kind of like meditation, and I pray." 
I said, "That's good. That's good. 
We need that in the world. 
I don't follow that, but that's cool." 
And he says, "But I have become skeptical. 
I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world. 
I think what we need is action." 
His Holiness, in his robes, is my new action hero. 
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago. 
As most of you know, she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma. 
You probably also know that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy. 
She was just released a couple of weeks ago, and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free, because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon, agitating for change. 
She is already out in the streets, working with the party to try to rebuild it. 
But I talked to her for a range of issues. 
But one thing that I want to say, because it's similar to what His Holiness said. 
She said, "You know, we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country. 
But I don't believe in hope without endeavor. 
I don't believe in the hope of change, unless we take action to make it so." 
Here's another woman hero of mine. 
She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. 
She has been in exile for the last year and a half. 
You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile? 
She says the airports of the world. 
She is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections. 
And instead of going home, she conferred with all the other women that she works with, who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out. 
We need to be able to talk to you out there, so that you can give the message of what's happening here." 
A year and a half -- she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country. 
Wangari Maathai -- 2004 Peace laureate. 
They call her the "Tree Lady," but she's more than the Tree Lady. 
Working for peace is very creative. 
It's hard work every day. 
When she was planting those trees, I don't think most people understand that, at the same time, she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country. 
People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail. 
But if they were together planting trees for the environment, it was okay -- creativity. 
But it's not just iconic women like Shirin, like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai -- it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world. 
The Women's League of Burma, 11 individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there's strength in numbers. 
Working together is what changes our world. 
The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together to change human rights, to bring democracy to that country. 
When one is arrested and taken to prison, another one comes out and joins the movement, recognizing that if they work together, they will ultimately bring change in their own country. 
Mairead McGuire in the middle, Betty Williams on the right-hand side -- bringing peace to Northern Ireland. 
I'll tell you the quick story. 
An IRA driver was shot, and his car plowed into people on the side of the street. 
There was a mother and three children. 
The children were killed on the spot. 
It was Mairead's sister. 
Instead of giving in to grief, depression, defeat in the face of that violence, Mairead hooked up with Betty -- a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic -- and they took to the streets to say, "No more violence." 
And they were able to get tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men, in the streets to bring about change. 
And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland, and they're still working on it, because there's still a lot more to do. 
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum. 
She also received the Peace Prize. 
She is now running for president. 
She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy, about how you bring democracy to the country, about educating, about how to vote -- but that democracy is not just about voting; it's about being an active citizen. 
That's what I got stuck doing -- the landmine campaign. 
One of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two NGOs to thousands in 90 countries around the world, working together in common cause to ban landmines. 
Some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month. 
They could maybe volunteer that much. 
There were others, like myself, who were full-time. 
But it was the actions, together, of all of us that brought about that change. 
In my view, what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace. 
It's not a dirty word. 
It's hard work every single day. 
And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could, we would change this world, we would save this world. 
And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier. 
You're going to see some other speakers today, I already know, who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff, and, of course, with technology it never is. 
So it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient. 
I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet, with such an incredible last half a dozen years, that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it. 
A lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things and what we're supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them. 
And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush. 
It's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick. 
For one thing, both were very real. 
In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million worth of gold out of California. It was very real. 
The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other. It's a big deal. 
Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust. 
You keep going, and both things are lots of hype. 
I don't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com. 
But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. "Gold. Gold. Gold." 
Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal. 
Some have 5,000. Many have more. 
A few bring out 100,000 dollars each. 
People would get very excited about this when they read these articles. 
"The Eldorado of the United States of America: the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California." 
And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly. 
So many people left what they were doing. 
And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years. 
People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news, they thought, "Ah, this isn't real." 
But they keep hearing about people getting rich, and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real. 
By about 1852, they're thinking, "Am I the stupidest person on Earth by not rushing to California?" And they start to decide they are. 
These are community affairs, by the way. 
Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States, and they would form companies. 
These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what, if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing, no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold. 
This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole, he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route. 
They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus, and then take another ship north. 
This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California. 
This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices. 
These are both very successful -- a physician in one case, a surgeon in the other. 
Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com. 
(Laughter) In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship. 
The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold. 
So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships. 
They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere. 
You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever. 
And you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened. 
The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers. 
Half of them deserted to go look for gold. 
And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back. 
(Laughter) And one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put: "The struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one." 
They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate. 
This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail. 
They loaded up their mules and their horses. 
And they didn't plan right. 
And they didn't know how far they would really have to go, and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff. 
In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going. 
It got renamed the "Dead Horse Trail." 
And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time: "Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way, sometimes in bunches under the cliffs, with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above, sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march, often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive, a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade. 
The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road. 
The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to, the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone, cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described." 
And you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that, we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations. 
I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it. 
This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000. 
(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do. 
Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation? 
Announcer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man. 
Announcer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife? 
Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day. 
OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world. 
Jeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for. 
(Laughter) But they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad, even though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue. 
Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge, and I think rather severely. 
And that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over. 
Here's this guy: "There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed. 
They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property, spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them." 
And that was, of course, the very common story. 
Because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush -- the entire American river region, within two years -- every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there. 
So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry. 
And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry. 
With the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they're both sort of thin, horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries. 
It's not a specific thing. 
But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down. 
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power. 
It's an incredible means of coordinating, in a very fine-grained way, information flows. 
There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity. 
And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances. 
The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. 
So the light bulb is what wired the world. 
And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. 
They were really thinking about -- they weren't putting electricity into the home; they were putting lighting into the home. 
And, but it really -- it got the electricity. It took a long time. 
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out. 
All the streets had to be torn up. 
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations. 
And they're tearing up all the streets. 
The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric, which became General Electric, paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive. 
But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web. 
Because, remember, the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network. 
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994, when it was growing 2,300 percent a year. 
How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994 when people weren't really investing in the Web? 
Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down. 
So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure, and then home appliances started coming into being. 
And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan -- this was the 1890 electric fan. 
And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted -- it depends how you want to measure it -- but it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time. 
It starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success. 
The electric iron, also very big. 
By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit. 
(Laughter) There's asbestos under that handle there. 
This is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum, from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car. 
So it wasn't a big seller. 
This was truly, truly an early-adopter product -- (Laughter) the 1905 Skinner Vacuum. 
But three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds. 
Now, not all these things were highly successful. 
(Laughter) This is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on. 
People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties. 
These never really caught on either: the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller. 
This came in, like, six different colors. 
(Laughter) I don't know why. But I thought, you know, sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention; maybe it's time to give this one another shot. 
So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this. 
We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really -- (Laughter) I thought that would really work, to give that another shot. 
Now, the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires, and it took a lot of time and attention. 
I want to point out one thing. This is -- you guys know what this is. 
They hadn't invented the electric socket yet. 
So this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity. 
They wired them for lighting. So your -- your appliances would plug in. 
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top. 
And you'd plug it in there. 
In fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World, you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture. 
All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance. 
The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine. 
Now, this was an object of much envy and lust. 
Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines. 
On the left-hand side, this was the soapy water. 
And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning. 
And it would clean your clothes. 
This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here, put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer. 
And this was a big deal. 
You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain. 
And you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket. 
(Laughter) And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation, because they hadn't invented the off switch. 
That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it didn't make any sense. 
I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket. 
So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it. 
That's what you did. You didn't turn it off. 
And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either, so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device. 
And there are -- when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices. 
And they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house. 
(Laughter) And there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good. 
And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this. 
But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors, I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room. 
This is a total kludge, if you ask me. 
First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket -- (Laughter) and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in. 
(Laughter) This is supposed -- don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one. 
This is what it looks like under my desk. 
I took this picture just two days ago. 
So we really haven't progressed that much since 1908. 
(Laughter) It's a total, total mess. 
And, you know, we think it's getting better, but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself? 
(Laughter) I challenge you to try. It's very hard. 
I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science -- this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter) And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house. 
Try to get DSL installed in your house. 
The engineers who do it everyday can't do it. 
They have to -- typically, they come three times. 
And one friend of mine was telling me a story: not only did they get there and have to wait, but then the engineers, when they finally did get there, for the third time, they had to call somebody. 
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there. 
So we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves. 
By the way, DSL is a kludge. 
I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it's being put to -- you know it's the whole thing -- we're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point. 
Because, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush, then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. 
But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget. 
Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities. 
And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are -- this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge -- and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web -- but there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff -- we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet. 
That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it, but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are. 
We're in 1908. 
And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996: "All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble." 
1998: "Amazon.toast." In 1999: "Amazon.bomb." 
My mom hates this picture. 
(Laughter) She -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very, very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine, then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are. 
And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us. 
And in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right. 
This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917. 
It says: "Use your electricity for more than light." 
And I think that's where we are. 
We're very, very early. Thank you very much. 

I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs, but not the cyborgs that you think. 
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. 
So what's a good definition for cyborg? 
Well, traditional definition is "an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments." 
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel, because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward. 
People aren't supposed to be there. 
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next. 
So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. 
Somebody goes to another country, says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is." 
And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think it's very exotic. 
Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. 
I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, "Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures, and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. 
They're clicking on things and staring at screens." 
Now there's a reason why I study this, versus traditional anthropology. 
And the reason is that tool use, in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self. 
It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that. 
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self, and because of that, we're able to travel faster, communicate differently. 
And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology. 
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out. 
What does the inside of your computer actually look like? 
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. 
And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like something's missing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion. 
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. 
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online, and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. 
And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open, which is basically your Facebook wall, so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night -- because it's very much the equivalent. 
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self. 
You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. 
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. 
And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences. 
They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward, and then they go through their second self's adolescence, and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online. 
And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now, and so it's very awkward, and it's very difficult for them to do those things. 
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, "I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future." 
And I said, "Great." 
And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?" 
And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday." 
I thought I was very clever. 
He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way." 
He took a piece of paper, drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched. 
And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points." 
And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?" 
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it." 
And I said, "I want to do that." 
And he said, "Well, okay." 
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, "I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster. 
And I want to make a time machine." 
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders. 
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. 
It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. 
So I started studying anthropology. 
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones, I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets. 
They weren't physically transporting themselves; they were mentally transporting themselves. 
They would click on a button, and they would be connected as A to B immediately. 
And I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great." 
So over time, time and space have compressed because of this. 
You can stand on one side of the world, whisper something and be heard on the other. 
One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use. 
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. 
And because of that, you start to dig around for your external memories -- where did you leave them? 
So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. 
And that incites a sort of panic architecture -- "Oh no, where's this thing?" 
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information, and we can't keep up. 
And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. 
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. 
It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. 
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone, the room would be very crowded. 
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general -- all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to. 
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. 
One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore, and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces, paleontology and panic architecture. 
They're not just sitting there. 
And really, when you have no external input, that is a time when there is a creation of self, when you can do long-term planning, when you can try and figure out who you really are. 
And then, once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way, instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in -- and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this. 
And so this is very important. 
I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it. 
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either. 
It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. 
But when you actually visualize it, all the connections that we're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the Internet -- it doesn't look technological. 
It actually looks very organic. 
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way. 
And it's not that machines are taking over. 
It's that they're helping us to be more human, helping us to connect with each other. 
The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. 
And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time. 
And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection -- it's just done in a different way. 
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography. 
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

If we look around us, much of what surrounds us started life as various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world. 
But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now. 
They look like TV cameras, monitors, annoying radio mics. 
And so this magical transformation is what I was trying to get at with my project, which became known as the Toaster Project. 
And it was also inspired by this quote from Douglas Adams, and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." 
And the situation it describes is the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man -- finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people. 
And he kind of assumes that, yes, he'll become -- these villagers -- he'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements, but, of course, realizes that without the rest of human society, he can barely make a sandwich, let alone a toaster. 
But he didn't have Wikipedia. 
So I thought, okay, I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. 
And, working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer, I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find, took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that, inside this object, which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds, there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials. 
I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project. 
I had maybe nine months. 
So I thought, okay, I'll start with five. 
And these were steel, mica, plastic, copper and nickel. 
So, starting with steel: how do you make steel? 
I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said, "How do you make steel?" 
And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. 
And my vague rememberings from GCSE science -- well, steel comes from iron, so I phoned up an iron mine. 
And said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster. 
Can I come up and get some iron?" 
Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray. 
He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster, and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines. 
But after some nagging, I got him to do that. 
(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone, and that was produced by sea creatures 350 million years ago in a nice, warm, sunny atmosphere. 
When you study geology, you can see what's happened in the past, and there were terrific changes in the earth. 
Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up. 
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore, because, though Ray was a miner there, the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction, because, of course, it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America, Australia, wherever. 
But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train, and then was faced with the problem: Okay, how do you make this rock into components for a toaster? 
So I went back to Professor Cilliers, and he said, "Go to the library." 
So I did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy -- completely useless for what I was trying to do. 
Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant. 
So I ended up going to the History of Science Library and looking at this book. 
This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West, at least. 
And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing. 
But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower. 
(Laughter) And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project, was, the smaller the scale you want to work on, the further back in time you have to go. 
And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron. 
I dragged out this stuff, and it wasn't iron. 
But luckily, I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves, and at 30 minutes at full power, and I was able to finish off the process. 
So, my next -- (Applause) The next thing I was trying to get was copper. 
Again, this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world. 
It's not anymore, but I found a retired geology professor to take me down, and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine." 
And the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and will start picking up, dissolving the minerals from the mine. 
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto, which is in Portugal. 
As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it. 
So many such that it's now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic, toxic conditions. 
But anyway, the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was -- there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug. 
So my next thing: I was off to Scotland to get mica. 
And mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity. 
That's me getting mica. 
And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic, and, of course, my toaster had to have a plastic case. 
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods. 
And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil. 
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now. 
But even then they weren't convinced and said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" -- never did. 
So I looked at other ways of making plastic. 
And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches. 
So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic. 
And for a while that was looking really good. 
I poured it into the mold, which you can see there, which I've made from a tree trunk. 
And it was looking good for a while, but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry, and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato. 
So kind of out of desperation, I decided that I could think laterally. 
And geologists have actually christened -- well, they're debating whether to christen -- the age that we're living in -- they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene, the age of Man. 
And that's because geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now. 
So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since 1945. 
And there'd also be an extinction event -- like fossils would suddenly disappear. 
And also, I thought that there would be synthetic polymers, plastics, embedded in the rock. 
So I looked up a plastic -- so I decided that I could mine some of this modern-day rock. 
And I went up to Manchester to visit a place called Axion Recycling. 
And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE, which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive. 
And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill. 
But this is it. 
(Music) (Laughter) So there's a picture of my toaster. 
(Applause) That's it without the case on. 
And there it is on the shelves. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once. 
TT: Yeah, I did plug it in. 
I don't know if you could see, but I was never able to make insulation for the wires. 
Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree. 
So the wires were uninsulated. 
So there was 240 volts going through these homemade copper wires, homemade plug. 
And for about five seconds, the toaster toasted, but then, unfortunately, the element kind of melted itself. 
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest. 
BG: Thomas Thwaites. TT: Thanks. 

This room may appear to be holding 600 people, but there's actually so many more, because within each one of us, there is a multitude of personalities. 
I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl. 
I call them "the mystic" and "the warrior." 
I was born into a family of politically active intellectual atheists. 
There was this equation in my family that went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual. 
I was the freak of the family. 
I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones we perceive with our senses. 
I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. 
So, looking for answers, I went to Catholic mass; I tagged along with my neighbors. 
I read Sartre and Socrates. 
And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school: gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. 
(Laughter) And I said to myself, "I wanna get me one of them." 
(Laughter) And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path, trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called the "optical delusion" of everyday consciousness. 
So what did he mean by this? 
I'll show you. 
Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. 
Now, see this strange, underwater-coral-reef-looking thing? 
It's actually a person's trachea. 
And those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now, all around us. 
If we're blind to this simple biology, imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. 
My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions. 
They've made me a proud "I-don't-know-it-all." 
Now, when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this, the warrior rolls her eyes. 
She's concerned about what's happening in this world right now. 
She's worried. 
She says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off, and I know a few things, and we better get busy about them right now." 
I've spent my life as a warrior, working for women's issues, working on political campaigns, being an activist for the environment. 
And it can be sort of crazymaking, housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body. 
I've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off, who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic -- people like Martin Luther King, Jr., who wrote, "I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be." 
"This," he wrote, "is the interrelated structure of reality." 
Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior, who said, "The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small." 
And Nelson Mandela, who lives by the African concept of "ubuntu," which means "I need you in order to be me, and you need me in order to be you." 
Now, we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with a "saint" gene. 
But we all actually have the same capacity that they do. 
And we need to do their work now. 
I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing "the other," by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us. 
Listen to these titles of some of the best-selling books from both sides of the political divide here in the US: "Liberalism is a Mental Disorder," "Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot," "Pinheads and Patriots," "Arguing with Idiots." 
They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek, but they're actually dangerous. 
Now here's a title that may sound familiar, but whose author may surprise you: "Four and a Half Years of Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice." 
Who wrote that? 
That was Adolf Hitler's first title for "Mein Kampf" -- "My Struggle" -- the book that launched the Nazi Party. 
The worst eras in human history, whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda -- they start like this, with negative otherizing. 
And then they morph into violent extremism. 
This is why I'm launching a new initiative. 
And it's to help all of us, myself included, to counteract the tendency to otherize. 
And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break. 
I'm calling my initiative "Take the Other to Lunch." 
If you are a Republican, you can take a Democrat to lunch. 
Or if you're a Democrat, think of it as taking a Republican to lunch. 
Now, if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite, (Laughter) I suggest you start more local, because there is no shortage of the other right in your own neighborhood: maybe that person who worships at the mosque or the church or the synagogue down the street; or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict; or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn't believe in global warming -- (Laughter) anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears. 
A couple of weeks ago, I took a conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. 
Now, on paper, she passed my "smoking ears" test: (Laughter) she's an activist from the Right, and I'm an activist from the Left. 
We used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated. 
And you can use them, too, because I know you're all going to take an other to lunch. 
So first of all, decide on a goal: to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped. 
And then, before you get together, agree on some ground rules. 
My Tea Party lunch mate and I came up with these: "Don't persuade, defend or interrupt; be curious, be conversational, be real; and listen." 
From there, we dove in, and we used these questions: "Share some of your life experiences with me -- what issues deeply concern you? 
And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side?" 
My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you. 
I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere. 
I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side. 
"What?" she wanted to know. 
"Like, we're a bunch of elitist, morally corrupt terrorist-lovers." 
Well, she was shocked. 
She thought my side beat up on her side way more often -- that we called them brainless, gun-toting racists. 
And we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. 
And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity. 
We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of "otherizing" talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. 
By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each other's openness. 
Neither of us had tried to change the other, but we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. 
Instead, we had taken first steps together, past our knee-jerk reactions to the ubuntu place, which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found. 
Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing, that'll be your clue. 
And what might happen at your lunch? 
Will the heavens open and "We are the World" play over the restaurant sound system? 
Probably not. 
Because ubuntu work is slow, and it's difficult. 
It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls. 
It's two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. 
Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it: "Out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field. 
I'll meet you there." 
(Applause) 

So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys, and it's a serious problem with boys. 
Their culture isn't working in schools, and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem. 
First, I want to start by saying, this is a boy, and this is a girl, and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl. 
If I essentialize gender for you today, then you can dismiss what I have to say. 
So I'm not going to do that, I'm not interested in doing that. 
So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls, and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls. 
But, in fact, most boys tend to be a certain way, and most girls tend to be a certain way. 
And the point is that, for boys, the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now. 
How do we know that? 
The 100 girls project tells us some really nice statistics. 
For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school, there are 250 boys that are suspended from school. 
For every 100 girls who are expelled from school, there are 335 boys who are expelled from school. 
For every 100 girls in special education, there are 217 boys. 
For every 100 girls with a learning disability, there are 276 boys. 
For every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed, we have 324 boys. 
And by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black, if you happen to be poor, if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. 
And if you are a boy, you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD -- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. 
Now there is another side to this. 
And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school, that salaries are still significantly lower, even when controlled for job types, and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years. 
That's all true. 
Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and 13. 
And so we should. 
In fact, what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook, because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic. 
They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations, and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years. 
Even in their older years, what we find is that there's still a problem. 
When we look at the universities, 60 percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now, which is a significant shift. 
And in fact, university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universities. 
This makes university administrators very nervous, because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys. 
And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university. 
If you talk to faculty, they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well, they're playing video games, and they're gambling online all night long, and they're playing World of Warcraft, and that's affecting their academic achievement." 
Guess what? 
Video games are not the cause. 
Video games are a symptom. 
They were turned off a long time before they got here. 
So let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and 13. 
There are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today. 
The first is zero tolerance. 
A kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her, and when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. 
You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom. 
What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun? 
I mean, really. 
But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today. 
Now I'm not advocating for bullies. 
I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives in the school. 
But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it, has to be suspended from school, I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance. 
Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys. 
In a lot of classrooms today, you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent. 
You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games. 
These topics are banned. 
Boy comes home from school, and he says, "I hate writing." 
"Why do you hate writing, son? What's wrong with writing?" 
"OK, what is she telling you to write?" 
"Poems. I have to write poems. 
And little moments in my life. 
I don't want to write that stuff." 
"Well, what do you want to write? 
What do you want to write about?" 
"I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling-up. 
I want to write about this really interesting world. 
I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out, and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody." 
"All right. OK." 
You tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you, in all seriousness, "Should we send this child to the psychologist?" 
And the answer is no, he's just a boy. 
He's just a little boy. 
It's not OK to write these kinds of things in classrooms today. 
So that's the first reason: Zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out. 
The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures: there are fewer male teachers. 
Anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means, because in the last 10 years, the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half. 
We went from 14 percent to seven percent. 
That means that 93 percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women. 
Now what's the problem with this? 
Women are great, yep, absolutely. 
But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders, but ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week they're spending in a classroom, and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist. 
And so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys. 
This is a place for girls. 
And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports, or something like that, because I obviously don't belong here. 
Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious. 
So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen. 
But less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture -- you've got a teachers' lounge, and they're having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground. 
"What are we going to do with these boys?" 
The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table. 
Are there men around that table? 
You'll see, the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. 
Third reason that boys are out of sync with school today: Kindergarten is the old second grade, folks. 
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there. 
When you're three, you better be able to write your name legibly, or else we'll consider it a developmental delay. 
By the time you're in first grade, you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture, maybe not, in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages. 
If you don't, we're probably going to be putting you into a Title I special reading program. 
And if you ask Title I teachers, they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program, in the elementary grades. 
The reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is, "You need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time." 
The teacher's salary depends on "No Child Left Behind" and "Race to the Top" and accountability and testing and all of this. 
So she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum -- and girls. 
This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids. 
And what happens is, she says, "Please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told, follow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl." 
That's what she tells them. 
And so this is a very serious problem. 
Where is it coming from? It's coming from us. 
(Laughter) We want our babies to read when they are six months old. 
Have you seen the ads? 
We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average ... 
but what this does to our children is really not healthy. 
It's not developmentally appropriate, and it's particularly bad for boys. 
So what do we do? 
We need to put ourselves into boy culture. 
We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools. 
More specifically, we can do some very specific things. 
We can design better games. 
Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards. 
They're glorified drill and practice. 
They don't have the depth, the rich narrative that really engaging video games have, that the boys are really interested in. 
We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians. 
We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom. 
We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies. 
Do they make sense? 
We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can, trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them. 
All of those conversations need to be happening. 
There are some great examples out there of schools -- the New York Times just talked about a school recently. 
A game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school. 
But it only treats a few kids, and so this isn't very scalable. 
We have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today. 
We need to find more money for game design. 
Because good games, really good games, cost money, and World of Warcraft has quite a budget. 
Most of the educational games do not. 
Where we started: my colleagues Mike Petner, Shawn Vashaw, myself, we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming, what do they say about it. 
And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school, who talk about gaming, in pretty demeaning ways. 
They say, "Oh, yeah. They're always talking about that stuff. 
They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges, or whatever it is that they get. 
And they're always talking about this stuff." 
And they say these things as if it's OK. 
But if it were your culture, think of how that might feel. 
It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language. 
They're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies. 
They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything. 
So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes, so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms. 
Because, ultimately, if we don't, then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying, "Well I guess that was just a place for girls, it wasn't for me. 
So I've got to do gaming, or I've got to do sports." 
If we change these things, if we pay attention to these things, and we reengage boys in their learning, they will leave the elementary schools saying, "I'm smart." 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I just did something I've never done before. 
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel. 
Now I'm not a scientist, but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico. 
This is the boat we were on, by the way. 
The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff -- the birds, the turtles, the dolphins, the glamorous stuff. 
They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff. 
And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton, which is very bad news, because so much life depends on it. 
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding. 
It's still working its way up the food chain. 
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us. 
Rachel Carson -- the godmother of modern environmentalism -- warned us about this very thing back in 1962. 
She pointed out that the "control men" -- as she called them -- who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT, were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects, not the birds. 
But they forgot this: the fact that birds dine on grubs, that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT. 
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch, songbirds died en masse, towns fell silent. 
Thus the title "Silent Spring." 
I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties. 
And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster, with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world, with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV, 24 hours a day, for months. 
After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature, suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness, with our lack of control, as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it -- "top hats," "top kills" and, most memorably, the "junk shot" -- the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world. 
But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed -- the carelessness, the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up. 
If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear, it is that, as a culture, we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable, and to do so without a back-up plan, without an exit strategy. 
And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years. 
Our leaders barrel into wars, telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades. 
Then, it is years of deadly damage control, Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies, and once again, no exit strategy. 
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence, convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market -- the kind that never goes down. 
And when it inevitably does, the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case, throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole. 
As with BP, the hole does get plugged, at least temporarily, but not before exacting a tremendous price. 
We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen, because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all -- deciding what to do, or not to do, about climate change. 
Now as you know, a great deal of time is spent, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate, on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?" 
Now a far more relevant question -- as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it -- is, "What if those scientists are right?" 
Given the stakes, the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible, we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty. 
Better to err on the side of caution. 
More overt, the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed, but rather on the industry that stands to profit. 
But climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution, but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP. 
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand, what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe, we ask bizarre questions like this: "What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions? 
Can we put this off till 2020, 2030, 2050?" 
Or we ask, "How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive? 
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or -- where we're currently going -- four degrees Celsius?" 
And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists. 
It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science. 
The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops. 
So once again, why do we take these crazy risks with the precious? 
A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now, like "greed." 
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it, because taking big risks, as we all know, pays a lot of money. 
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris. 
And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness. 
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon, then you need a narrative, you need a story that makes that disparity okay. 
And you actually don't have a lot of options. 
You're either an incredibly good scammer, and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system -- or you're some kind of boy genius, the likes of which the world has never seen. 
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future. 
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP, had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan: "What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?" 
Now this is actually a popular plaque, and this is a crowd of overachievers, so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque. 
Don't feel ashamed. 
Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk, but personally, I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall, because -- maybe not that one in particular -- but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time. 
So we have greed, we've got overconfidence/hubris, but since we're here at TEDWomen, let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness. 
Now I'm not going to belabor this point, but studies do show that, as investors, women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men, precisely because, as we've already heard, women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do. 
So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least. 
The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted, chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides. 
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" -- brings us closer, I think, to the root of our collective recklessness. 
Because none of us -- at least in the global North -- neither men nor women, are fully exempt from this message. 
Here's what I'm talking about. 
Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them, our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature -- the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer, the narrative of manifest destiny, the narrative of apocalypse and salvation. 
And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places. 
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport. 
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone, and yes, it really does say, "Slap Mother Nature in the face." 
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that's just a bonus. 
I'm showing it because -- they're not a sponsor, are they? -- because, in its own way, this is a crass version of our founding story. 
We slapped Mother Nature around and won, and we always win, because dominating nature is our destiny. 
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature. 
There's another one, equally important, about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance. 
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again. 
"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean. 
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume." 
In other words, the ocean is big; she can take it. 
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do. 
Because this is our real master-narrative: however much we mess up, there will always be more -- more water, more land, more untapped resources. 
A new bubble will replace the old one. 
A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one. 
In a way, that is the story of the settling of the Americas, the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped. 
And it's also the story of modern capitalism, because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system, one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers. 
Now the problem is that the story was always a lie. 
The Earth always did have limits. 
They were just beyond our sights. 
And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts. 
I believe that we know this, yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop. 
Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories, but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that, frankly, verges on camp. 
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin? 
Now on the one hand, exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill," because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them, and on the other, glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show. 
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad. 
Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall. 
There are still no limits. 
There will always be another frontier. 
So stop worrying and keep shopping. 
Now, would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show. 
In environmental circles, we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables, we are continuing with business as usual. 
This assessment, unfortunately, is far too optimistic. 
The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era, the era of extreme energy. 
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water, including the icy Arctic seas, where a clean-up may simply be impossible. 
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal, the likes of which we haven't yet seen. 
And most controversially, it means the tar sands. 
I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands, which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States. 
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice, because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else. 
So this is where the tar sands live, under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests. 
The oil is not liquid. 
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. 
Tar sand's oil is solid, mixed in with the soil. 
So to get at it, you first have to get rid of the trees. 
Then, you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand. 
The process requires a huge amount of water, which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds. 
That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates. 
Now looking at these images, it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation, which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England. 
I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth, the largest ever built. 
That's a person down there by the wheel. 
My point is that this is not oil drilling. 
It's not even mining. 
It is terrestrial skinning. 
Vast, vivid landscapes are being gutted, left monochromatic gray. 
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon. 
But the truth is that, on average, turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada. 
How else to describe this, but as a form of mass insanity? 
Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet, off the power of sun, wind and waves, we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest, highest-emitting stuff imaginable. 
This is where our story of endless growth has taken us, to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that, like the BP gusher, one can only stand to look at it for so long. 
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us, this is how civilizations commit suicide, by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes. 
The problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too. 
At the very last minute, we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie, just like in the Rapture. 
But, of course, our secular religion is technology. 
Now, you may have noticed more and more headlines like these. 
The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called, is that, as the planet heats up, we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space, thereby cooling the planet. 
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up -- would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky, suspended by balloons, to spew sulfur dioxide. 
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution. 
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot. 
The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested. 
They don't know if they'll work, and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash. 
Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles, particularly media circles, with a relief tinged with euphoria. 
An escape hatch has been reached. 
A new frontier has been found. 
Most importantly, we don't have to change our lifestyles after all. 
You see, for some people, their savior is a guy in a flowing robe. 
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose. 
We badly need some new stories. 
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks -- risks that confront recklessness head on, that put the precautionary principle into practice, even if that means through direct action -- like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested, blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining. 
We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around. 
That this is our only home. 
There is no escape hatch. 
Call it karma, call it physics, action and reaction, call it precaution -- the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

You may not know this, but you are celebrating an anniversary with me. 
I'm not married, but one year ago today, I woke up from a month-long coma, following a double lung transplant. 
Crazy, I know. Insane. 
Thank you. 
Six years before that, I was starting my career as an opera singer in Europe, when I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension -- also known as PH. 
It happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins, making the right side of the heart work overtime, and causing what I call the reverse-Grinch effect. 
My heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big. 
Physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition, and usually after two to five years, you die. 
I went to see this specialist, and she was top-of-the-field and told me I had to stop singing. 
She said, "Those high notes are going to kill you." 
While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension, she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary. 
I was very limited by my condition, physically. 
But I was not limited when I sang, and as air came up from my lungs, through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound, it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence. 
And just because of someone's hunch, I wasn't going to give it up. 
Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis, who is dry as toast, but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive, they wanted me to live a meaningful life. 
This meant making trade-offs. 
I come from Colorado. 
It's a mile high, and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters and two adoring parents. 
Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. 
So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby. 
I couldn't walk as much as I used to, so I opted for five-inch heels. 
And I gave up salt, I went vegan, and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil, also known as Viagra. 
(Laughter) My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH, but after six months, I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs. 
I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to faint. 
I had a heart catheterization, where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure, which is supposed to be between 15 and 20. 
Mine was 146. 
I like to do things big, and it meant one thing: there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan, and it's not just a drug; it's a way of life. 
Doctors insert a catheter into your chest, which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds. 
Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side, administering medicine directly to your heart, and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses. 
This is a list of the side effects: if you eat too much salt, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you'll probably end up in the ICU. 
If you go through a metal detector, you'll probably die. 
If you get a bubble in your medicine -- because you have to mix it every morning -- and it stays in there, you probably die. 
If you run out of medicine, you definitely die. 
No one wants to go on Flolan. 
But when I needed it, it was a godsend. 
Within a few days, I could walk again. 
Within a few weeks, I was performing, and in a few months, I debuted at the Kennedy Center. 
The pump was a little bit problematic when performing, so I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage. 
Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx, hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly. 
And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers. 
I graduated from graduate school in 2006, and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe. 
A few days after arriving, I met this wonderful, old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles. 
And before long, I was commuting between Budapest, Milan and Florence. 
Though I was attached to this ugly, unwanted, high-maintenance, mechanical pet, my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera -- very complicated, but in a good way. 
Then in February of 2008, my grandfather passed away. 
He was a big figure in all of our lives, and we loved him very much. 
It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next. 
Seven weeks later, I got a call from my family. 
My father had been in a catastrophic car accident, and he died. 
At 24, my death would have been entirely expected. 
But his -- well, the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline. 
Against my doctors' and family's wishes, I needed to go back for the funeral. 
I had to say goodbye in some way, shape or form. 
But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure, and I had to return to sea level, doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again. 
I canceled most of my engagements that summer, but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went. 
After one performance, I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab. 
I sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face, and in the heat of the desert, I was freezing cold. 
My fingers started turning blue, and I was like, "What is going on here?" 
I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed. 
The cab stopped, and I pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as I walked to the elevator. 
I fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where I found my problem: I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine. 
I was dying, and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast, I would never leave that apartment alive. 
I started mixing, and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another, but I just kept on going. 
Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out, I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough. 
If it didn't, I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated. 
Thankfully, in a few minutes, I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs, which is a side effect of the medication, and I knew I'd be okay. 
We're not big on fear in my family, but I was scared. 
I went back to the States, anticipating I'd return to Europe, but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
I performed here and there, but as my condition deteriorated, so did my voice. 
My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant. 
I didn't. 
I had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries. 
I knew another young man, though, who had PH who died while waiting for one. 
I wanted to live. 
I thought stem cells were a good option, but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet. 
I officially took a break from singing, and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years, for transplant. 
I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon, and I asked him if I needed a transplant, what I could do to prepare. 
He said, "Be happy. 
A happy patient is a healthy patient." 
It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius. 
I still didn't want a transplant, but in a month, I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles -- very attractive. 
And it was right-heart failure. 
I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice. 
It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match. 
But the next morning, while I was still in the hospital, I got a telephone call. 
It was my doctor in Cleveland, Marie Budev. 
And they had lungs. 
It was a match. 
They were from Texas. 
And everybody was really happy for me, but me. 
Because, despite their problems, I had spent my whole life training my lungs, and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up. 
I flew to Cleveland, and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye. 
But organs don't wait, and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. 
The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket, telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again, and to please try and save my voice. 
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world. 
During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery, I flatlined twice, 40 quarts of blood were infused into my body. 
And in my surgeon's 20-year career, he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed. 
They left my chest open for two weeks. 
You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it. 
I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive. 
An infection ravaged my skin. 
I had hoped my voice would be saved, but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it. 
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again. 
So my doctor got the ENT, the top guy at the clinic, to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box. 
He said it would kill me. 
So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice. 
Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery, she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed. 
And if you want an example of perseverance, grit and strength in a beautiful, little package, it is her. 
One year ago to this very day, I woke up. 
I was 95 lbs. 
There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body. 
I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk, I couldn't eat, I couldn't move, I certainly couldn't sing, I couldn't even breathe, but when I looked up and I saw my mother, I couldn't help but smile. 
Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens. 
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it? 
It's about living. 
Medical conditions don't negate the human condition. 
And when people are allowed to pursue their passions, doctors will find they have better, happier and healthier patients. 
My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place, but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time. 
And I'm so grateful they did. 
This past summer, when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies, I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing. 
And I wanted to tell her, and I want to tell you, we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams. 
When we do, we will find that patients don't just survive; we thrive. 
And some of us might even sing. 
(Applause) [Singing: French] Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee. 
(Applause) Thank you so much. 
Thank you. 

You know who I'm envious of? 
People who work in a job that has to do with their college major. 
(Laughter) Journalists who studied journalism, engineers who studied engineering. 
The truth is, these folks are no longer the rule, but the exception. 
A 2010 study found that only a quarter of college graduates work in a field that relates to their degree. 
I graduated with not one but two degrees in biology. 
To my parents' dismay, I am neither a doctor nor a scientist. 
(Laughter) Years of studying DNA replication and photosynthesis did little to prepare me for a career in technology. 
I had to teach myself everything from sales, marketing, strategy, even a little programming, on my own. 
I had never held the title of Product Manager before I sent my resume in to Etsy. 
I had already been turned down by Google and several other firms and was getting frustrated. 
The company had recently gone public, so as part of my job application, I read the IPO filings from cover to cover and built a website from scratch which included my analysis of the business and four ideas for new features. 
It turned out the team was actively working on two of those ideas and had seriously considered a third. 
I got the job. 
We all know people who were ignored or overlooked at first but went on to prove their critics wrong. 
My favorite story? 
Brian Acton, an engineering manager who was rejected by both Twitter and Facebook before cofounding WhatsApp, the mobile messaging platform that would sell for 19 billion dollars. 
The hiring systems we built in the 20th century are failing us and causing us to miss out on people with incredible potential. 
The advances in robotics and machine learning and transforming the way we work, automating routine tasks in many occupations while augmenting and amplifying human labor in others. 
At this rate, we should all be expecting to do jobs we've never done before for the rest of our careers. 
So what are the tools and strategies we need to identify tomorrow's high performers? 
In search for answers, I've consulted with leaders across many sectors, read dozens of reports and research papers and conducted some of my own talent experiments. 
My quest is far from over, but here are three ideas to take forward. 
One: expand your search. 
If we only look for talent in the same places we always do -- gifted child programs, Ivy League schools, prestigious organizations -- we're going to get the same results we always have. 
Baseball was transformed when the cash-strapped Oakland Athletics started recruiting players who didn't score highly on traditionally valued metrics, like runs batted in, but who had the ability to help the team score points and win games. 
This idea is taking hold outside of sports. 
The Head of Design and Research at Pinterest told me that they've built one of the most diverse and high-performing teams in Silicon Valley because they believe that no one type of person holds a monopoly on talent. 
They've worked hard to look beyond major tech hubs and focus on designers' portfolios, not their pedigrees. 
Two: hire for performance. 
Inspired by my own job experience, I cofounded a hiring platform called Headlight, which gives candidates an opportunity to shine. 
Just as teams have tryouts and plays have auditions, candidates should be asked to demonstrate their skills before they're hired. 
Our clients are benefiting from 85 years of employment research, which shows that work samples are one of the best predictors of success on the job. 
If you're hiring a data analyst, give them a spreadsheet of historical data and ask them for their key insights. 
If you're hiring a marketing manager, have them plan a launch campaign for a new product. 
And if you're a candidate, don't wait for an employer to ask. 
Seek out ways to showcase your unique skills and abilities outside of just the standard resume and cover letter. 
Three: get the bigger picture. 
I've heard about recruiters who are quick to label a candidate a job-hopper based on a single short stint on their resume; read about professors who are more likely to ignore identical messages from students because their name was black or Asian instead of white. 
I was almost put on a special needs track as a child. 
A month into kindergarten, my teacher wrote a page-long memo noting that I was impulsive, had a short attention span, and despite my wonderful curiosity, I was exhausting to work with. 
(Laughter) The principal asked my parents into a meeting, asked my mother if there had been complications at birth and suggested I meet with a school psychologist. 
My father saw what was happening and quickly explained our family situation. 
As recent immigrants, we lived in the attic of a home that cared for adults with mental disabilities. 
My parents worked nights to make ends meet, and I had little opportunity to spend time with kids my own age. 
Is it really a surprise that an understimulated five-year-old boy might be a little excited in a kindergarten classroom after an entire summer by himself? 
Until we get a holistic view of someone, our judgment of them will always be flawed. 
Let's stop equating experience with ability, credentials with competence. 
Let's stop settling for the safe, familiar choice and leave the door open for someone who could be amazing. 
We need employers to let go of outdated hiring practices and embrace new ways of identifying and cultivating talent, and candidates can help by learning to tell their story in powerful and compelling ways. 
We could live in a world where people are seen for what they're truly capable of and have the opportunity to realize their full potential. 
So let's go out and build it. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I am honored to be here, and I'm honored to talk about this topic, which I think is of grave importance. 
We've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species, but plastic hurts people, too -- especially poor people. 
And both in the production of plastic, the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic, the people who have the bull's-eye on their foreheads are poor people. 
People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened, for very good reason. 
This is terrible, this oil -- it's in the water. 
It's going to destroy the living systems there. 
People are going to be hurt. 
This is a terrible thing, this oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf." 
What people don't think about is: What if the oil had made it safely to shore? 
What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go? 
Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming, but there's a place called "Cancer Alley," and the reason it's called "Cancer Alley" is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and in the process, kills people. 
It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf. 
So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there's a spill; they're a problem when there's not. 
And what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products. 
The other thing we often don't appreciate is, it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer. 
Poor people also suffer at the point of use. 
Those of us who earn a certain income level, we have something called choice. 
The reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices, economic choices. 
We actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous, poisonous plastic in them. 
So low-income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using. 
Those are the people who wind up ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic in using it. 
And people say, "Well, they should just buy a different product." 
Well, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices. 
You often have to buy the cheapest products. 
The cheapest products are often the most dangerous. 
And if that weren't bad enough -- if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer in places like Cancer Alley, and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use -- at the point of disposal, once again, it's poor people who bear the burden. 
Often, we think we're doing a good thing: You're in your office, drinking your bottled water or whatever it is, and you think to yourself, "I'm going to throw this away. 
No -- I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin." 
You think, "I put mine in the blue bin." 
And then you look at your colleague and say, "Why, you cretin! You put yours in the white bin." 
And we use that as a moral tickle. 
We feel so good about ourselves. 
If we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me. 
Not you, but I feel this way often. 
(Laughter) And so we kind of have this moral feel-good moment. 
But if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its journey, we would be shocked to discover that, all too often, that bottle is going to be put on a boat, it's going to go all the way across the ocean at some expense, and it's going to wind up in a developing country, often China. 
I think in our minds, we imagine somebody's going to take the little bottle and say, "Oh, little bottle! We're so happy to see you, little bottle." 
(Laughter) "You've served so well." 
(Laughter) He's given a little bottle massage, a little bottle medal. 
And they say, "What would you like to do next?" 
The little bottle says, "I just don't know ..." 
(Laughter) But that's not actually what happens. 
That bottle winds up getting burned. 
The recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic, the burning of the plastic, which releases incredible toxic chemicals and, once again, kills people. 
And so, poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like Cancer Alley, poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately, and then poor people who, even at the tail end of the recycling, are having their lives shortened. 
They're all being harmed -- greatly -- by this addiction that we have to disposability. 
Now, you think to yourself -- I know how you are -- you say, "That sure is terrible for those poor people. 
It's just awful. Those poor people. 
I hope someone does something to help them." 
But what we don't understand is -- here we are in Los Angeles. 
We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. 
But guess what? 
Because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now, because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now, almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia. 
So we all are being hit. We all are being impacted. 
It's just that the poor people get it first and worst. 
But the dirty production, the burning of toxins, the lack of environmental standards in Asia, is actually creating so much dirty air pollution, it's coming across the ocean, and has erased our gains here in California. 
We're back where we were in the 1970s. 
And so we're on one planet, and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems. 
The root of this problem, in my view, is the idea of disposability itself. 
You see, if you understand the link between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people, you arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight: In order to trash the planet, you have to trash people. 
But if you create a world where you don't trash people, you can't trash the planet. 
So now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea, we finally can now see that they are really, at the end of the day, one idea. 
And it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything. 
We don't have disposable resources. 
We don't have disposable species. 
And we don't have disposable people, either. 
We don't have a throwaway planet, and we don't have throwaway children -- it's all precious. 
And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding, new opportunities for action begin to emerge. 
Biomimicry, which is an emerging science, winds up being a very important social justice idea. 
People who are just learning about this stuff: biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. 
Democracy, by the way, means respecting the wisdom of all people -- we'll get to that. 
But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. 
It turns out we're a pretty clever species. 
We have this big cortex, we're pretty proud of ourselves. 
But if we want to make something hard, we say, "I know! I'm going to make a hard substance. 
I know! I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute ... 
But I got this hard thing!" 
(Laughter) "I'm so clever!" 
And you look behind you, and there's destruction all around you. 
But guess what? 
You're so clever, but you're not as clever as a clam. 
A clamshell is hard. 
There's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces. 
There's no poison. There's no pollution. 
It turns out that other species figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well. 
That insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species -- I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff. 
I don't mean looking at it from that way, abusing the little species. 
I mean actually respecting them, respecting what they've achieved. 
That's called biomimicry, and that opens the door to zero waste production; zero pollution production; that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life, a high standard of living, without trashing the planet. 
Well, that idea of biomimicry, respecting the wisdom of all species, combined with the idea of democracy and social justice, respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people, would give us a different society. 
We would have a different economy. 
We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of. 
That should be the goal. 
And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we've talked about, but it even corrupts our own society. 
We're so proud to live here in California. 
We just had this vote, and everybody's like, "Well -- not in our state!" 
(Laughter) I don't know what those other states were doing, but ..." 
(Laughter) Just so proud. 
But ... 
California, though we lead the world in some of the green stuff, we also, unfortunately, lead the world in some of the gulag stuff. 
California has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the 50 states. 
We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill, but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings, living people. 
And I would say that we live in a country -- five percent of the world's population, 25 percent of the greenhouse gases, but also 25 percent of the world's prisoners. 
One of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the United States. 
So that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in. 
And yet, as a movement that has to broaden its constituency, that has to grow, that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone, one of the challenges to the success of this movement, of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift, is people look at our movement with some suspicion. 
And they ask a question, and the question is: How can these people be so passionate? 
A poor person, a low-income person, somebody in Cancer Alley, somebody in Watts, somebody in Harlem, somebody on an Indian reservation, might say to themselves -- and rightfully so -- "How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life, or an aluminum can has a second chance, and yet, when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison, he doesn't get a second chance?" 
"How can this movement be so passionate about saying we don't have throwaway stuff, no throwaway dead materials, and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like Cancer Alley?" 
And so, we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement. 
When we take on topics like this, it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow, and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in. 
Most of you are good, softhearted people. 
When you were younger, you cared about the whole world, and at some point, somebody said you had to pick an issue, you had to boil your love down to an issue. 
"Can't love the whole world -- you've got to work on trees or you've got to work on immigration. 
You've got to shrink it down and be about one issue." 
And really, they fundamentally told you, "Are you going to hug a tree? 
Or are you going to hug a child? Pick. 
Are you going to hug a tree? 
Or are you going to hug a child? Pick." 
Well, when you start working on issues like plastic, you realize the whole thing is connected. 
And luckily, most of us are blessed to have two arms -- we can hug both. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge: the challenge of dealing with data, data that we have to deal with in medical situations. 
It's really a huge challenge for us. 
And this is our beast of burden -- this is a Computer Tomography machine, a CT machine. 
It's a fantastic device. 
It uses X-rays, X-ray beams, that are rotating very fast around the human body. 
It takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine. 
So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care, but as I said, it's also a challenge for us. 
And the challenge is really found in this picture here. 
It's the medical data explosion that we're having right now. 
We're facing this problem. 
And let me step back in time. 
Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. 
These machines that came out -- they started coming in the 1970s -- they would scan human bodies, and they would generate about 100 images of the human body. 
And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity, to translate that to data slices. 
That would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data, which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices. 
If you translate that to phone books, it's about one meter of phone books in the pile. 
Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have, we can, just in a few seconds, get 24,000 images out of a body, and that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data, or 800 phone books, and the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books. 
What's about to happen -- and we're seeing this; it's beginning -- a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well. 
So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well. 
And just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds, and that would correspond to one terabyte of data -- that's 800,000 books and 16 kilometers of phone books. 
That's one patient, one data set. 
And this is what we have to deal with. 
So this is really the enormous challenge that we have. 
And already today -- this is 25,000 images. 
Imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this. 
They would put up 25,000 images, they would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay. 
There is the problem." 
They can't do that anymore. That's impossible. 
So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this. 
So what we do is that we put all these slices together. 
Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions, and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data, into a block of data. 
So this is really what we're doing. 
So this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block. 
But of course, the block of data just contains the amount of X-ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body. 
So what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at. 
So transforming the data set into something that looks like this. 
And this is a challenge. 
This is a huge challenge for us to do that. 
Using computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time, it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data, terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information. 
I want to look at the heart. 
I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver. 
Maybe even find a tumor, in some cases. 
So this is where this little dear comes into play. 
This is my daughter. 
This is as of 9 a.m. this morning. 
She's playing a computer game. 
She's only two years old, and she's having a blast. 
So she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics-processing units. 
As long as kids are playing computer games, graphics is getting better and better and better. 
So please go back home, tell your kids to play more games, because that's what I need. 
So what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing with the medical data. 
So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices. 
And you know, going back maybe 10 years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine. 
It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything. 
I paid about one million dollars for that machine. 
That machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone. 
So every month there are new graphics cards coming out, and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors -- NVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well. 
And you know, for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer, and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards. 
So this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine, together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms -- compressing data, extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on. 
So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do. 
This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner. 
You can see that this is a full data [set]. 
It's a woman. You can see the hair. 
You can see the individual structures of the woman. 
You can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays on the teeth, the metal in the teeth. 
That's where those artifacts are coming from. 
But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer, I can just put in a clip plane. 
And of course all the data is inside, so I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles, and I can see that this woman had a problem. 
She had a bleeding up in the brain, and that's been fixed with a little stent, a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel. 
And just by changing the functions, then I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible. 
I can look at the skull structure, and I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman, and that's where they went in. 
So these are fantastic images. 
They're really high resolution, and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today. 
Now we have really made use of this, and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system. 
And one of the applications that we've been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide -- is the application of virtual autopsies. 
So again, looking at very, very large data sets, and you saw those full-body scans that we can do. 
We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner, and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set. 
So this is from a virtual autopsy. 
And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off. 
First you saw the body bag that the body came in, then I'm peeling off the skin -- you can see the muscles -- and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman. 
Now at this point, I would also like to emphasize that, with the greatest respect for the people that I'm now going to show -- I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies -- so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that I'm showing these pictures to you. 
In the forensic case -- and this is something that ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years. 
So this will be the typical workflow situation. 
The police will decide -- in the evening, when there's a case coming in -- they will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy? 
So in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning, the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners. 
And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist, looks at the data that's coming out, and they have a joint session. 
And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that. 
Now looking at a few cases, here's one of the first cases that we had. 
You can really see the details of the data set. 
It's very high-resolution, and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details. 
And again, it's fully interactive, so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here. 
Without saying too much about this case, this is a traffic accident, a drunk driver hit a woman. 
And it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure. 
And the cause of death is the broken neck. 
And this women also ended up under the car, so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury. 
Here's another case, a knifing. 
And this is also again showing us what we can do. 
It's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body. 
You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth -- that's actually the filling of the teeth -- but because I've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent. 
Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person. 
The person was killed by stabs in the heart, but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. 
Here's another case. 
It's very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings. 
Here you can see that knife went through the heart. 
It's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part, which is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy. 
So it really, really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death, and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was. 
Here's another case that I think is interesting. 
Here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person. 
And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source, so that bullet is actually shining, and it makes it really easy to find these fragments. 
During a physical autopsy, if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments, that's actually quite hard to do. 
One of the things that I'm really, really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table. 
It's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs. 
It actually looks like this, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. 
It really just works like a huge iPhone. 
So we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table, and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface. 
So if you were thinking of buying an iPad, forget about it. This is what you want instead. 
Steve, I hope you're listening to this, all right. 
So it's a very nice little device. 
So if you have the opportunity, please try it out. 
It's really a hands-on experience. 
So it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes, but also, perhaps in the future, in a more clinical situation. 
There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this, if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies. 
Okay, now that we're talking about touch, let me move on to really "touching" data. 
And this is a bit of science fiction now, so we're moving into really the future. 
This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now, but I hope they will in the future. 
So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device. 
It's a little mechanical pen that has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen. 
And so I can generate a force feedback. 
So when I virtually touch data, it will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback. 
So in this particular situation, it's a scan of a living person. 
I have this pen, and I look at the data, and I move the pen towards the head, and all of a sudden I feel resistance. 
So I can feel the skin. 
If I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin, and I can feel the bone structure inside. 
If I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure, especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft. 
And then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this. 
So this is really nice. 
And to take that even further, this is a heart. 
And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners, that just in 0.3 seconds, I can scan the whole heart, and I can do that with time resolution. 
So just looking at this heart, I can play back a video here. 
And this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students who's been working on this project. 
And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system, and he's moving his pen towards the heart, and the heart is now beating in front of him, so he can see how the heart is beating. 
He's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart, and he's putting it on the heart, and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient. 
Then he can examine how the heart is moving. 
He can go inside, push inside of the heart, and really feel how the valves are moving. 
And this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons. 
I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery, and do that with high-quality resolution data. 
So this is really neat. 
Now we're going even further into science fiction. 
And we heard a little bit about functional MRI. 
Now this is really an interesting project. 
MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain, or any part of the body. 
So what we're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain, but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen. 
That means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain. 
So this is something that we've been working on. 
And you just saw Motts the research engineer, there, going into the MRI system, and he was wearing goggles. 
So he could actually see things in the goggles. 
So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner. 
And this is a little bit freaky, because what Motts is seeing is actually this. 
He's seeing his own brain. 
So Motts is doing something here, and probably he is going like this with his right hand, because the left side is activated on the motor cortex. 
And then he can see that at the same time. 
These visualizations are brand new. 
And this is something that we've been researching for a little while. 
This is another sequence of Motts' brain. 
And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100. 
So he's going "100, 97, 94." 
And then he's going backwards. 
And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain. 
Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time. 
We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things. 
You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head, because that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain. 
And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things. 
The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well, and it's shining through, because all of the data is inside this volume. 
And in just a second here you will see -- okay, here. Motts, now move your left foot. 
So he's going like this. 
For 20 seconds he's going like that, and all of a sudden it lights up up here. 
So we've got motor cortex activation up there. 
So this is really, really nice, and I think this is a great tool. 
And connecting also with the previous talk here, this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working, how the brain is working, and we can do this with very, very high visual quality and very fast resolution. 
Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center. 
So this is a CAT scan -- Computer Aided Tomography. 
So this is a lion from the local zoo outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa. 
So she came to the center, and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner. 
And then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion. 
And I can do very nice images like this. 
I can peel off the layer of the lion. 
I can look inside of it. 
And we've been experimenting with this. 
And I think this is a great application for the future of this technology, because there's very little known about the animal anatomy. 
What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information. 
We can scan all sorts of things, all sorts of animals. 
The only problem is to fit it into the machine. 
So here's a bear. 
It was kind of hard to get it in. 
And the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal. 
And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear. 
And you might want to cuddle this one, until you change the functions and look at this. 
So be aware of the bear. 
So with that, I'd like to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images. 
It's a huge effort that goes into doing this, gathering the data and developing the algorithms, writing all the software. 
So, some very talented people. 
My motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am and most of these are smarter than I am. 
So thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields. 
So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment, which is entertainment and robotics. 
So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society, maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. 
I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology. 
Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology. 
With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot, I would like to use art to create tech. 
(Laughter) So we're based in New York City. 
And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot, or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation, please contact me, the Bot-Agent. 
The bot, our rising celebrity, also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild. 
I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data. 
He's named after the Star Trek character. 
I think he's going to be super popular. 
We've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. 
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes. 
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length. 
It knows how much it's moving. 
And so it's going to try to watch your response. 
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today. 
(Laughter) It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style, over longer-term to different communities or audiences, children versus adults, different cultures. 
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. 
And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions. 
Some of you in this middle section -- you have red/green paddles. 
If you like what's going on, show the green. 
If you don't like the subject or the performance, you can hold the red. 
Now don't be shy. 
It's just a robot. 
It doesn't have feelings ... yet. 
(Laughter) And the rest of you, you still count, you still matter. 
There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing -- I hope not -- to help make some of its next decisions. 
Right, so, let the robot stand-up comedy begin. 
Data: Hello TEDWomen. 
It's an honor to be here. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You guys are looking good out there. 
Ready for some jokes? 
Audience: Yeah. 
Data: Here's the first one. 
Right, so, a doctor says to his patient, "I have bad news and worse news. 
The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live." 
"That's terrible," said the patient. 
"How can the news possibly be worse?" 
"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday." 
(Laughter) (Applause) The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. 
Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss. 
Data: Pretty lucky for them. 
Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with? 
"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here. 
You get past me, the guy behind me has a spoon." 
(Laughter) HK: He's a French robot. 
Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods. 
One of them falls to the ground. 
He does not seem to be breathing. 
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911. 
He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead. 
What can I do?" 
The operator says, "Just take it easy. 
I can help. 
First, let's make sure he's dead." 
There is a silence, and the operator hears a shot. 
The guy's voice comes back on the line, "Okay, now what?" 
(Laughter) (Applause) Question: Why is television called a medium? 
Anyone? 
Because it's neither rare nor well done. 
But to be completely honest with you, I kind of love television. 
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes. 
Data: I find it incredibly educational. 
Actually, as soon as someone turns it on, I go into the other room and read. 
(Laughter) That's all for now. 
Was that okay for my first time? 
(Applause) You've been a great audience. 
Thank you. 
HK: Yay. 
(Applause) So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance. 
So thank you all for being a part of it. 
There's a lot more to come. 
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

The world is changing with really remarkable speed. 
If you look at the chart at the top here, you'll see that in 2025, these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. 
And if you look at the chart for 2050, it's projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy, and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. 
And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis. 
A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. 
Goldman Sachs projected 2027. 
The post-crisis projection is 2020. 
That's just a decade away. 
China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. 
First of all, it's a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people, which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year. 
And within a decade, it will have the largest economy in the world. 
Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country, rather than a developed country. 
Secondly, for the first time in the modern era, the dominant country in the world -- which I think is what China will become -- will be not from the West and from very, very different civilizational roots. 
Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize, they also westernize. 
This is an illusion. 
It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition, markets and technology. 
It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture. 
China is not like the West, and it will not become like the West. 
It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. 
Now the big question here is obviously, how do we make sense of China? 
How do we try to understand what China is? 
And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large, is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms, using Western ideas. 
We can't. 
Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like, just as a beginning. 
The first is this: that China is not really a nation-state. 
Okay, it's called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years, but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this. 
This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period -- the birth of modern China. 
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. 
Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty, still 2,000 years ago. 
And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China, which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now. 
Now what is extraordinary about this is, what gives China its sense of being China, what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese, comes not from the last hundred years, not from the nation-state period, which is what happened in the West, but from the period, if you like, of the civilization-state. 
I'm thinking here, for example, of customs like ancestral worship, of a very distinctive notion of the state, likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family, social relationships like guanxi, Confucian values and so on. 
These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state. 
In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world, is shaped by its sense of civilization, its existence as a civilization-state, rather than as a nation-state. 
And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people. 
What we often aren't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic, and in many ways very decentralized. 
You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing, even though we think this to be the case. 
It's never been the case. 
So this is China, a civilization-state, rather than a nation-state. 
And what does it mean? 
Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications. 
I'll give you two quick ones. 
The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity, is the maintenance of Chinese civilization. 
You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe: breakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire. 
It divided, and it's remained divided ever since. 
China, over the same time period, went in exactly the opposite direction, very painfully holding this huge civilization, civilization-state, together. 
The second is maybe more prosaic, which is Hong Kong. 
Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997? 
You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was. 
One country, two systems. 
And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them. 
"Window dressing. 
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong, that won't be the case." 
Thirteen years on, the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997. 
We were wrong. Why were we wrong? 
We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough, in nation-state ways. 
Think of German unification, 1990. 
What happened? 
Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West. 
One nation, one system. 
That is the nation-state mentality. 
But you can't run a country like China, a civilization-state, on the basis of one civilization, one system. 
It doesn't work. 
So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong -- as it will be to the question of Taiwan -- was a natural response: one civilization, many systems. 
Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one. 
The Chinese have a very, very different conception of race to most other countries. 
Do you know, of the 1.3 billion Chinese, over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race, the Han? 
Now, this is completely different from the world's [other] most populous countries. 
India, the United States, Indonesia, Brazil -- all of them are multiracial. 
The Chinese don't feel like that. 
China is only multiracial really at the margins. 
So the question is, why? 
Well the reason, I think, essentially is, again, back to the civilization-state. 
A history of at least 2,000 years, a history of conquest, occupation, absorption, assimilation and so on, led to the process by which, over time, this notion of the Han emerged -- of course, nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity. 
Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that, without the Han, China could never have held together. 
The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together. 
The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference. 
They really believe in their own superiority, and they are disrespectful of those who are not. 
Hence their attitude, for example, to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans. 
Or let me give you my third building block, the Chinese state. 
Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West. 
Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least -- that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. 
The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state. 
And the reason for this is because -- well, there are two reasons, I think. 
And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy, because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy. 
And the reason for this is, firstly, because the state in China is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative, the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization, of the civilization-state. 
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role. 
And the second reason is because, whereas in Europe and North America, the state's power is continuously challenged -- I mean in the European tradition, historically against the church, against other sectors of the aristocracy, against merchants and so on -- for 1,000 years, the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged. 
It's had no serious rivals. 
So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history. 
The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. 
Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder, a stranger, certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained, the Chinese don't see the state like that at all. 
The Chinese view the state as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually, as a member of the family -- not just in fact as a member of the family, but as the head of the family, the patriarch of the family. 
This is the Chinese view of the state -- very, very different to ours. 
It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West. 
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here, in the Chinese context, is a new kind of paradigm, which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past. 
Know that China believes in the market and the state. 
I mean, Adam Smith, already writing in the late 18th century, said, "The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe." 
And, apart from the Mao period, that has remained more or less the case ever since. 
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. 
The state is everywhere in China. 
I mean, it's leading firms -- many of them are still publicly owned. 
Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo, depend in many ways on state patronage. 
Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state. 
And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas -- as we are familiar with -- with something like the one-child policy. 
Moreover, this is a very old state tradition, a very old tradition of statecraft. 
I mean, if you want an illustration of this, the Great Wall is one. 
But this is another, this is the Grand Canal, which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C. 
and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D. 
It went for 1,114 miles, linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai. 
So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China, which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today, which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China. 
So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China -- the civilization-state, the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society. 
And yet we still insist, by and large, in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience, looking at it through Western eyes, using Western concepts. 
If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong -- our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect -- this is the reason. 
Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. 
It's kind of arrogant. 
It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure. 
And secondly, it's ignorant. 
We refuse to really address the issue of difference. 
You know, there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian. 
And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures. 
But it's not. 
In many ways, it's the most parochial, because for 200 years, the West has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures, other civilizations. 
Because, at the end of the day, it could, if necessary by force, get its own way. 
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world, in fact, which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West -- have been thereby forced to understand the West, because of the West's presence in those societies. 
And therefore, they are, as a result, more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West. 
I mean, take the question of East Asia. 
East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. -- a third of the world's population lives there. 
Now the largest economic region in the world. 
And I'll tell you now, that East Asianers, people from East Asia, are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia. 
Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid, to the present. 
Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning, the Goldman Sachs chart. 
What is happening is that, very rapidly in historical terms, the world is being driven and shaped, not by the old developed countries, but by the developing world. 
We've seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7, or the G8. 
And there are two consequences of this. 
First, the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. 
There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago -- Copenhagen, climate change conference. 
Europe was not at the final negotiating table. 
When did that last happen? 
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago. 
And that is what is going to happen in the future. 
And the second implication is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence, become increasingly unfamiliar to us, because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with, or conversant with. 
And at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe; America is slightly different -- but Europeans by and large, I have to say, are ignorant, are unaware about the way the world is changing. 
Some people -- I've got an English friend in China, and he said, "The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion." 
Well, maybe that's true, maybe that's an exaggeration. 
But there's another problem which goes along with this -- that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future. 
I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future in its confidence. 
Take the 19th century, for example. 
But this, alas, is no longer true. 
If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future, try China -- there's old Confucius. 
This is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before. 
It doesn't even look like a railway station. 
This is the new [Wuhan] railway station for the high-speed trains. 
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. 
Or take this: now this is an idea, but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing. 
Here you have a megabus, on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people. 
It travels on rails down a suburban road, and the cars travel underneath it. 
And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour. 
Now this is the way things are going to move, because China has a very specific problem, which is different from Europe and different from the United States: China has huge numbers of people and no space. 
So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many, many, many cities over 20 million people. 
Okay, so how would I like to finish? 
Well, what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us? 
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it. 
But I want to argue, above all, a big-picture positive for this world. 
For 200 years, the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. 
That's what Europe and North America represented. 
The arrival of countries like China and India -- between them 38 percent of the world's population -- and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on, represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years. 
Civilizations and cultures, which had been ignored, which had no voice, which were not listened to, which were not known about, will have a different sort of representation in this world. 
As humanists, we must welcome, surely, this transformation, and we will have to learn about these civilizations. 
This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea, the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. 
The little boat in front of it was the one in which, 80 years later, Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic. 
(Laughter) Or, look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368. 
I think they're playing golf. 
Christ, the Chinese even invented golf. 
Welcome to the future. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care, which is the patient, or, as I like to use the scientific term, people. 
Because we are all patients, we are all people. 
Even doctors are patients at some point. 
So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and, in fact, worldwide. 
If you want to get at the big part -- I mean from a public health level, where my training is -- you're looking at behavioral issues. 
You're looking at things where people are actually given information, and they're not following through with it. 
It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes, obesity, many forms of heart disease, even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking. 
Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. 
They know what they're supposed to be doing, but they're not doing it. 
Now behavior change is something that is a long-standing problem in medicine. 
It goes all the way back to Aristotle. 
And doctors hate it, right? 
I mean, they complain about it all the time. 
We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance. 
When people don't take their pills, when people don't follow doctors' orders -- these are behavior problems. 
But for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change, there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem. 
So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them, but actually leads them to make better decisions, better choices in their lives. 
One part of medicine, though, has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well, and that's dentistry. 
Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is -- many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. 
Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry. 
But they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it. 
It's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system. 
People brush and floss their teeth. 
They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it. 
So I'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in Connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago. 
So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one, because it was very simple, so it's an easy story to tell. 
So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often, and they were going to use one variable: they wanted to scare them. 
They wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth. 
They had a big patient population. 
They divided them up into two groups. 
They had a low-fear population, where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation, all based in science, but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth, you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth, but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad. 
So that was the low-fear group. 
The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick. 
They showed bloody gums. 
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. 
They told them that their teeth were going to fall out. 
They said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies, and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth. 
They would get dentures, and if you got dentures, you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob, you weren't going to be able to eat apples, you weren't going to be able to eat steak. 
You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. 
So go brush and floss your teeth. 
That was the message. That was the experiment. 
Now they measured one other variable. 
They wanted to capture one other variable, which was the patients' sense of efficacy. 
This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. 
So they asked them at the beginning, "Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?" 
And the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that," they were characterized as high efficacy, and the people who said, "Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should," they were characterized as low efficacy. 
So the upshot was this. 
The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. 
The people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen -- it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior. 
So fear showed up as not really the driver. 
It was the sense of efficacy. 
So I want to isolate this, because it was a great observation -- 30 years ago, right, 30 years ago -- and it's one that's laid fallow in research. 
It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work, who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment. 
The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. 
In health care terms, you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health, that they can actually see their way towards getting better health, and that's a very important notion. 
It's an amazing notion. 
We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well. 
Except, maybe we do. 
So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work. 
And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. 
This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association. 
This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. 
I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night, and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?" 
And I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people." 
And I don't know if it works. 
Now here's what does work: personalized information works. 
Again, Bandura recognized this years ago, decades ago. 
When you give people specific information about their health, where they stand, and where they want to get to, where they might get to, that path, that notion of a path -- that tends to work for behavior change. 
So let me just spool it out a little bit. 
So you start with personalized data, personalized information that comes from an individual, and then you need to connect it to their lives. 
You need to connect it to their lives, hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand. 
Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. 
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with. 
But it actually hits home. 
It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts. 
There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. 
That information then needs to be connected to choices, needs to be connected to a range of options, directions that we might go to -- trade-offs, benefits. 
Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action. 
We need to connect the information always with the action, and then that action feeds back into different information, and it creates, of course, a feedback loop. 
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change. 
But the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there -- personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by. 
It's a difficult and expensive commodity, until now. 
So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works. 
So we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs. 
You've seen them all around, especially these days as radars are cheaper. 
And here's how they work in the feedback loop. 
So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25, and, of course, you're going faster than that. 
We always are. We're always going above the speed limit. 
The choice in this case is pretty simple. 
We either keep going fast, or we slow down. 
We should probably slow down, and that point of action is probably now. 
We should take our foot off the pedal right now, and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down. 
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent. 
They last for about five miles, in which case we put our foot back on the pedal. 
But it works, and it even has some health repercussions. 
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit. 
Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits. 
But by and large, this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. 
Because in health care, most health care, the data is very removed from the action. 
It's very difficult to line things up so neatly. 
But we have an opportunity. 
So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country, how we actually get information. 
This is a pharmaceutical ad. 
Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad. 
Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet. 
But it looks completely right. 
So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect. 
And then we turn the page of the magazine, and we see this -- now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads, or to follow their ads, and to me, this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine. 
Because we know. 
Who among us would actually say that people read this? 
And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it? 
This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information. 
There is no good faith in this. 
So this is a different approach. 
This is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin. 
And they created this thing called the "drug facts box." 
They took inspiration from, of all things, Cap'n Crunch. 
They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food, actually helps people understand what's in their food. 
God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies. 
So let me just walk through this quickly. 
It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for, so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you. 
You can understand exactly what the benefits are. 
It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what, but you get the statistics for how effective it is. 
And finally, you understand what those choices are. 
You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects. 
Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect. 
So it spells those out in very clean terms, and that works. 
So I love this. I love that drug facts box. 
And so I was thinking about, what's an opportunity that I could have to help people understand information? 
What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use? 
And so I came up with this: lab test results. 
Blood test results are this great source of information. 
They're packed with information. 
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. 
They go right to doctors. 
And God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them, they don't really understand all this stuff either. 
This is the worst presented information. 
You ask Tufte, and he would say, "Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible." 
What we did at Wired was we went, and I got our graphic design department to re-imagine these lab reports. 
So that's what I want to walk you through. 
So this is the general blood work before, and this is the after, this is what we came up with. 
The after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. 
It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know. 
This is our one-page summary. 
We use the notion of color. 
It's an amazing notion that color could be used. 
So on the top-level you have your overall results, the things that might jump out at you from the fine print. 
Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context, and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. 
In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level. 
Likewise, you can go over your lipids and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. 
But again, always using color and personalized proximity to that information. 
All those other values, all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing, we summarize. 
We tell you that you're okay, you're normal. 
But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk. 
And then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop: we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate. 
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do. 
We give them some insight into what choices they can make, what actions they can take. 
So that's our general blood work test. 
Then we went to CRP test. 
In this case, it's a sin of omission. 
They have this huge amount of space, and they don't use it for anything, so we do. 
Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test, or in conjunction with a cholesterol test. 
So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page, which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. 
So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. 
It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed, which might be a risk for heart disease. 
What you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language. 
Then we use the information that's already in the lab report. 
We use the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks. 
So we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is. 
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test. 
Here's the before, and here's the after. 
Now a lot of our effort on this one -- as many of you probably know, a PSA test is a very controversial test. 
It's used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. 
And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that. 
We again personalized the risks. 
So this patient is in their 50s, so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is. 
In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that. 
And then again, the follow-up actions. 
So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right. 
That's what Wired magazine spent on this. 
Why is Wired magazine doing this? 
(Laughter) Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, the two largest lab testing companies -- last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively. 
Now this is not a problem of resources; this is a problem of incentives. 
We need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company. 
It should be the patient. 
It's the person who actually, in the end, is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors. 
This is information that is incredibly powerful. 
It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change. 
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. 
It's being lost. 
So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask, because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. 
But you can create your own feedback loop. 
Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions: Can I have my results? 
And the only acceptable answer is -- (Audience: Yes.) -- yes. 
What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is. 
What are my options? What choices are now on the table? 
And then, what's next? 
How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life? 
So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. 
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people. 
You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. 
Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information, if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. 
And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act. 
That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. 
It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today. 
And this information is out there. 
I've been talking today about latent information, all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use. 
But there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online, and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people, to help people and to change the course of their lives. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

(Laughter) I was afraid of womanhood. 
Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend. 
I've learned to be flexible. 
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear. 
Let me explain. 
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft, and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be. 
(Laughter) There were plenty of role models all around us. 
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters, and of course, the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words, telling us how to be. 
Now my mother was different. 
She was a homemaker, but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together, and she didn't buy me pink outfits. 
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons. 
And I just ate it up. 
I drew, and I drew, and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family, I could draw, do what I wanted to do, and not have to perform, not have to speak -- I was very shy -- and I could still get approval. 
I was launched as a cartoonist. 
Now when we're young, we don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know -- we don't perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're told what the most important color in the world is. 
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in. 
(Laughter) We're told what to wear -- (Laughter) -- and how to do our hair -- (Laughter) -- and how to behave. 
Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture. 
We're being corrected, and the primary policemen are women, because we are the carriers of the tradition. 
We pass it down from generation to generation. 
Not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us. 
And on top of all off these rules, they keep changing. 
(Laughter) We don't know what's going on half the time, so it puts us in a very tenuous position. 
(Laughter) Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't -- I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them -- what better way than to change them [than] with humor? 
Humor relies on the traditions of a society. 
It takes what we know, and it twists it. 
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh. 
Now what if you put together women and humor? 
I think you can get change. 
Because women are on the ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the table. 
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos. 
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. 
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement, and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out what was going on. 
And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together -- (Laughter) -- try to bring my family together with laughter. 
It didn't work. 
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested. 
But I found my place. 
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels, I didn't have to wear pink, and I could feel like I fit in. 
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s, I realized there are not many women in cartooning. 
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning," and so I did. I became a cartoonist. 
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking, "Well, why don't I do something? 
I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh?" 
Now my perspective is a particularly -- (Laughter) -- my perspective is a particularly American perspective. 
I can't help it. I live here. 
Even though I've traveled a lot, I still think like an American woman. 
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal, of course -- that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions, and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S. 
Consequently, we have. 
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition. 
We have amazing antennae. 
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly. 
And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect, but through the heart. 
My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Argentina, France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties. 
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances. 
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them. 
And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions, because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers, that we can have the great potential to be change-agents. 
And I think, I truly believe, that we can change this thing one laugh at a time. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

My story actually began when I was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia. 
And this was the 1960s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after Confederate war generals. 
We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard. 
And when I was five, my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle. 
It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an orangutan. 
That's why they were called ape hangers. 
They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s, which I'm sure my mom didn't know. 
And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away. 
And I came back, and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly, so I decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood, and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan. 
My mangled body flew in one direction, my mangled bike flew in the other. 
And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line, and one of my neighbors came running over. 
"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?" she said, using the name of my older brother. 
(Laughter) "I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out. 
I broke my left femur that day -- it's the largest bone in your body -- and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee, and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle. 
And for the next 38 years, that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me. 
In fact, I made a living by walking. 
I traveled around the world, entered different cultures, wrote a series of books about my travels, including "Walking the Bible." 
I hosted a television show by that name on PBS. 
I was, for all the world, the "walking guy." 
Until, in May 2008, a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones. 
And my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan, which showed that there was some growth in my left leg. 
That sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI. 
And one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor. 
"The tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor." 
I stopped walking, and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative. 
I have cancer. 
And to think that the tumor was in the same bone, in the same place in my body as the accident 38 years earlier -- it seemed like too much of a coincidence. 
So that afternoon, I went back to my house, and my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler, came running to meet me. 
They'd just turned three, and they were into all things pink and purple. 
In fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious -- although I must say, our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday, April 15th. 
When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46 on April 15, 2005, our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch, and was like, "Hmm, April 15th -- tax day. 
Early filer and late filer." 
(Laughter) The next day I came to see him. I was like, "Doctor, that was a really good joke." 
And he was like, "You're the writer, kid." 
Anyway -- so they had just turned three, and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground, laughing with all the glee in the world. 
I crumbled. 
I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them, the art projects I might not mess up, the boyfriends I might not scowl at, the aisles I might not walk down. 
Would they wonder who I was, I thought. 
Would they yearn for my approval, my love, my voice? 
A few days later, I woke with an idea of how I might give them that voice. 
I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters' lives. 
"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives," I wrote these men. 
"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes, but they may not have me. 
They may not have their dad. 
Will you help be their dad?" 
And I said to myself I would call this group of men "the Council of Dads." 
Now as soon as I had this idea, I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay. 
She's a very upbeat, naturally excited person. 
There's this idea in this culture -- I don't have to tell you -- that you sort of "happy" your way through a problem. 
We should focus on the positive. 
My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston. 
She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality. 
She's got big hair -- although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair, because if I say she has big hair, people will think she's from Texas. 
And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia, but not to have hair from Texas. 
And actually, in her defense, if she were here right now, she would point out that, when we got married in Georgia, there were three questions on the marriage certificate license, the third of which was, "Are you related?" 
(Laughter) I said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know. 
In Arkansas they don't even ask." 
What I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump. 
You don't need the 30-day waiting period. 
Because you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point. 
So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea, but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her. 
And she loved the idea, but she quickly started rejecting my nominees. 
She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice." 
So it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends. 
(Laughter) So we decided that we needed a set of rules, and we came up with a number. 
And the first one was no family, only friends. 
We thought our family would already be there. 
Second, men only. 
We were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives. 
And then third, sort of a dad for every side. 
We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing. 
So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men. 
And rather than send it, I decided to read it to them in person. 
Linda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals. 
I sort of friend-married each of these guys. 
And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin. 
Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s. 
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle. 
And I snuck out behind, and there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows. 
And Jeff came up beside me and said, "So, have you ever been cow tipping?" 
I was like, "Cow tipping? 
He was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up. 
So if you approach them from behind, down wind, you can push them over and they go thud in the mud." 
So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not, we had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence, we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor, dozing cow. 
So a few weeks after my diagnosis, we went up to Vermont, and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads. 
And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter. 
"Will you help be their dad?" 
And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying -- and then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes." 
I was like, "Yes?" 
I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter. 
And frankly, although I keep getting asked this, it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances. 
And then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book. 
And that was, "What's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls?" 
And Jeff's advice was, "Be a traveller, not a tourist. 
Get off the bus. Seek out what's different. 
Approach the cow." 
"So it's 10 years from now," I said, "and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here. 
What would you tell them?" 
He said, "I would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle. 
You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple, or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like, what it smells like." 
And as he talked he had that glint in his eye that I first saw back in Holland -- the glint that says, "Let's go cow tipping," even though we never did tip the cow, even though no one tips the cow, even though cows don't sleep standing up. 
He said, "I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience, covered in mud." 
Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma in my left femur. 
Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma. 
Eighty-five percent are under 21. 
Only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases. 
Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped, and there was a 15 percent survival rate. 
And then in the 1980's, they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective, and within weeks I had started that regimen. 
And since we are in a medical room, I went through four and a half months of chemo. 
Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin and very high-dose Methotrexate. 
And then I had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium. 
And if you did see the Sanjay special, you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis. 
Then he took my fibula from my calf, cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh, where it now lives. 
And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf and re-vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip. 
And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle. 
This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. 
And my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo. 
It was, as we said in my house, a lost year. 
Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares. 
And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house, sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. 
And I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of -- I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland -- of William Sloane Coffin -- it made me think of it. 
Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system. 
And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. 
And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body. 
And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law that my daughters, at that time three and a half, were missing me and feeling my absence. 
And I hung up the phone, and I put my face in my hands, and I screamed this silent scream. 
And what you said, Dr. Nuland -- I don't know where you are -- made me think of this today. 
Because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that I had was like a primal scream. 
And what was so striking -- and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today -- is the experience. 
As I became less and less human -- and at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now. 
Of course, I had no hair and no immune system. 
They were actually putting blood inside my body. 
At that moment I was less and less human, I was also, at the same time, maybe the most human I've ever been. 
And what was so striking about that time was, instead of repulsing people, I was actually proving to be a magnet for people. 
People were incredibly drawn. 
When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck. 
Instead, it was everybody running the other way. 
And when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way. 
Instead, it was all-hands-on-deck. 
And when people came to me, rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw -- I was like a living ghost -- they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives. 
Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy. 
It is an invitation, maybe even a mandate, to enter the most vital arenas of human life, the most sensitive and the most frightening, the ones that we never want to go to, but when we do go there, we feel incredibly transformed when we do. 
And this also happened to my girls as they began to see, and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate. 
One day, my daughter Tybee, Tybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy, I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses. 
And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk, because that's where love comes from." 
(Laughter) And one night my daughter Eden came to me. 
And as I lifted my leg out of bed, she reached for my crutches and handed them to me. 
In fact, if I cling to one memory of this year, it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand. 
I didn't need the crutch anymore, I was walking on air. 
And one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people. 
And it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record -- one word that I've only heard once actually was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday -- the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word "friend." 
And yet from everything we've been talking about -- compliance, or addiction, or weight loss -- we now know that community is important, and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in. 
And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me. 
And one of the things that I learned is that over time, particularly men, who used to be non-communicative, are becoming more and more communicative. 
And that particularly happened -- there was one in my life -- is this Council of Dads that Linda said, what we were talking about, it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off. 
And no one captures this modern manhood to me more than David Black. 
Now David is my literary agent. 
He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day, standing fully upright in cowboy boots. 
And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone -- I can say this I guess because you've done it here -- he answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker." 
He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine, and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car -- although, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th. 
But like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes, he leaves work early to coach Little League. 
Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads. 
I was like, "David cries when you invite him to take a walk." 
(Laughter) But he's a literary agent, which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true. 
And this is what we wanted him to capture -- what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations. 
And I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?" 
And he said, "A belief in themselves." 
"But when I came to see you," I said, "I didn't believe in myself. 
I was at a wall." 
He said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same, Don't see the wall. 
You may encounter one from time to time, but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it. 
But whatever you do, don't succumb to it. 
Don't give in to the wall. 
My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge, and during the year and a half I was on crutches, it became a sort of symbol to me. 
So one day near the end of my journey, I said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge." 
We set out on crutches. 
I was on crutches, my wife was next to me, my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead. 
And because walking was one of the first things I lost, I spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts. 
Walking upright, we are told, is the threshold of what made us human. 
And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright, the act is essentially unchanged. 
As my physical therapist likes to say, "Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen." 
You nearly fall with one leg, then you catch yourself with the other. 
And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches -- as I did for a year and a half -- is that you walk slower. 
You hurry, you get where you're going, but you get there alone. 
You go slow, you get where you're going, but you get there with this community you built along the way. 
At the risk of admission, I was never nicer than the year I was on crutches. 
200 years ago, a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris. 
He was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades. 
And it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace. 
And I just love this ode to slow moving. 
And it's become my own motto for my girls. 
Take a walk with a turtle. 
Behold the world in pause. 
And this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey. 
There's a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell, and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus, that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow. 
And every seven sets of seven years, the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love. 
That 50th year is called the jubilee year, and it's the origin of that term. 
And though I'm shy of 50, it captures my own experience. 
My lost year was my jubilee year. 
By laying fallow, I planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones I love. 
Come the one year anniversary of my journey, I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey -- and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor. 
He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage, which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard. 
And I said, "Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day and say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?' what would you tell them?" 
He said, "I would tell them what I know, and that is everybody dies, but not everybody lives. 
I want you to live." 
I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads," and I listed these lessons, a few of which you've heard here today: Approach the cow, pack your flipflops, don't see the wall, live the questions, harvest miracles. 
As I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living -- I realized, we may have done it for our girls, but it really changed us. 
And that is, the secret of the Council of Dads, is that my wife and I did this in an attempt to help our daughters, but it really changed us. 
So I stand here today as you see now, walking without crutches or a cane. 
And last week I had my 18-month scans. 
And as you all know, anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans. 
In my case it's quarterly. 
And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say, can never find a solution for scan-xiety. 
As I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say depending on what happened here. 
I got good news that day, and I stand here today cancer-free, walking without aid and hobbling forward. 
And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit -- but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is, at a similar meeting, back in the spring, Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks -- put the full resources of 23andMe, and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the genome of anybody, a living person with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma. 
And she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it, we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program. 
And the epidemiologists here will tell you, that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. 
So if you go to 23andMe, or if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link. 
And we encourage anybody to join this effort. 
But I'll just close what I've been talking about by leaving you with this message: May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal, or to that college roommate, or to some person you may have turned away from. 
May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace, or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams. 
And every now and then, find a friend, find a turtle, and take a long, slow walk. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land, from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan, has really shaped our history and our character. 
But one thing is clear. 
In the last 100 years alone, our country -- and this is a sprawl map of America -- our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet. 
And so, how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them. 
This graph represents what we're dealing with now in the built environment. 
And it's really a conflux of urban population rising, biodiversity plummeting and also, of course, sea levels rising and climate changing. 
So when I also think about design, I think about trying to rework and re-engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way. 
And you can see from the arrow here indicating "you are here," I'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology, and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way. 
So the era of big infrastructure is over. 
I mean, these sort of top-down, mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it. 
We need new tools and new approaches. 
Similarly, the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field, devoid of context, is really not the -- excuse me, it's fairly blatant -- is really not the approach that we need to take. 
So we need new stories, new heroes and new tools. 
So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war, and that is the eastern oyster. 
So, albeit a very small creature and very modest, this creature is incredible, because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures. 
It can grow; you can grow it; and -- did I mention? -- it's quite tasty. 
So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called "oyster-tecture." 
And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels, eelgrass and oysters -- species that live in the harbor -- and, at the same time, harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now. 
Here's a map of my city, New York City, showing inundation in red. 
And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about, the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. 
If you look here at this map, showing everything in blue is out in the water, and everything in yellow is upland. 
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map, that the harbor has dredged and flattened, and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. 
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. 
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it. 
There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination, but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition, and it's a condition that we're all facing. 
And here's a map of that condition, showing the contaminants in yellow and green, exacerbated by this new flow of storm-surge and sea-level rise. 
So we really had a lot to deal with. 
When we started this project, one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there. 
And you can see from this map, there's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement. 
We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself. 
So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept, harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern. 
And the idea has two core stages. 
One is to develop a new artificial ecology, a reef out in the harbor, that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus. 
Because if you have cleaner water and slower water, you can imagine a new way of living with that water. 
So the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way, I think. 
Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster. 
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal. 
It accepts algae and detritus in one end, and through this beautiful, glamorous set of stomach organs, out the other end comes cleaner water. 
And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day. 
Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days. 
They were key in our culture and our economy. 
Basically, New York was built on the backs of oystermen, and our streets were literally built over oyster shells. 
This image is an image of an oyster cart, which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. 
So again, we got the short end of the deal there. 
(Laughter) Finally, oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures. 
They really become nature's wave attenuators. 
And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem. 
Many, many species depend on them. 
So we were inspired by the oyster, but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster. 
It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water, and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster, to an adult male oyster or female oyster, in a number of weeks. 
We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus, then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. 
And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive. 
How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple. 
A core concept here is that climate change isn't something that -- the answers won't land down from the Moon. 
And with a $20 billion price tag, we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us. 
So this image is simply showing -- it's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope. 
What is fuzzy rope, you ask? 
It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing, available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap. 
So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project. 
(Laughter) So in the studio, rather than drawing, we began to learn how to knit. 
The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on. 
You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. 
And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change. 
It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think, new amphibious public space, where you can imagine working, you can imagine recreating in a new way. 
In the end, what we realized we were making was a new blue-green watery park for the next watery century -- an amphibious park, if you will. 
So get your Tevas on. 
So you can imagine scuba diving here. 
This is an image of high school students, scuba divers that we worked with on our team. 
So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water, and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring. 
Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world: this is the word "flupsy" -- it's short for "floating upwelling system." 
And this glorious, readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below. 
So the water is churned through this raft. 
You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them. 
So rather than having 10 oysters, you have 10,000 oysters. 
And then those spat are then seeded. 
Here's the Gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines -- the flupsification of the Gowanus. 
New word. 
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges. 
And finally, how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef. 
I get asked two questions about this project. 
One is: why isn't it happening now? 
And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters? 
And the answer is: not yet, they're working. 
But we imagine, with our calculations, that by 2050, you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster. 
To conclude, this is just one cross-section of one piece of city, but my dream is, my hope is, that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable, a more livable and a more delicious future. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it, and that is all of us are makers. 
I really believe that. 
All of us are makers. 
We're born makers. 
We have this ability to make things, to grasp things with our hands. 
We use words like "grasp" metaphorically to also think about understanding things. 
We don't just live, but we make. 
We create things. 
Well I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places. 
It doesn't come out particularly well, but that's a particularly tall bicycle. 
It's a scraper bike; it's called -- from Oakland. 
And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. 
But he's trying to power it, or motorize it, with a drill. 
(Laughter) And the question he had is, "Can I do it? Can it be done?" 
Apparently it can. 
So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs; they're people who love doing what they do. 
They don't always even know why they're doing it. 
We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire. 
There was one held in Detroit here last summer, and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford. 
But we hold them in San Francisco -- (Applause) -- and in New York. 
And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation. 
(Video) Guy: I might get one of those. 
Dale Dougherty: These are electric muffins. 
Guy: Where did you guys get those? 
Muffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.) DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out. 
We got there first. 
Lady: Will you glide with us? 
DD: This is something I call "swinging in the rain." 
And you can barely see it, but it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc. 
So imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet? 
No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?" 
That's the experience of a clever ride. 
And of course, we have fashion. 
People are remaking things into fashion. 
I don't know if this is called a basket-bra, but it ought to be something like that. 
We have art students getting together, taking old radiator parts and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it. 
They did that in the summer, and it was very warm. 
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining. 
You know what those are, right? 
Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that. 
Now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist. 
And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does. 
(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter, and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. 
Choir: ♫ When you hold me in your arms ♫ DD: This is all computer-controlled in an old Volvo. 
Choir: ♫ I'm hooked on a feelin' ♫ ♫ I'm high on believin' ♫ ♫ That you're in love with me ♫ DD: So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. 
So, are you a maker? 
How many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand? 
That's a pretty good -- but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers. 
And again, think about it. 
You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter; you're makers of lots of different things, and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world, and particularly the role that technology has in your life. 
You're really a driver or a passenger -- to use a Volkswagen phrase. 
Makers are in control. 
That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do. 
They want to figure out how things work; they want to get access to it; and they want to control it. 
They want to use it to their own purpose. 
Makers today, to some degree, are out on the edge. 
They're not mainstream. 
They're a little bit radical. 
They're a bit subversive in what they do. 
But at one time, it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker. 
It was not something you'd even remark upon. 
And I found this old video. 
And I'll tell you more about it, but just ... 
(Music) (Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are, we are makers. 
With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion. 
Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers. 
DD: So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood, a grandfather making a ship in a bottle, a woman making a pie -- somewhat standard fare of the day. 
But it was a sense of pride that we made things, that the world around us was made by us. 
It didn't just exist. 
We made it, and we were connected to it that way. 
And I think that's tremendously important. 
Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this. 
This particular reel -- it's an industrial video -- but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 -- in the Detroit area, in fact -- and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho." 
(Laughter) So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this, plus "Psycho." 
This is Andrew Archer. 
I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. 
Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth, Minnesota. 
And I talked to his mom, and I ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called Kidrobot. 
He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. 
He liked to take things apart. 
His mother gave him a part of the garage, and he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff. 
And then he didn't particularly like school that much, but he got involved in robotics competitions, and he realized he had a talent, and, more importantly, he had a real passion for it. 
And he began building robots. 
And when I sat down next to him, he was telling me about a company he formed, and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor. 
And that's why he moved to Michigan. 
But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing. 
And this kind of gets to this important idea today. 
This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hackerspace. 
And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit. 
And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last. 
But these are like clubs -- they're sharing tools, sharing space, sharing expertise in what to make. 
And so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world. 
But essentially these are people that are playing with technology. 
Let me say that again: playing. 
They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it. 
They're playing to discover what the technology can do, and probably to discover what they can do themselves, what their own capabilities are. 
Now the other thing that I think is taking off, another reason making is taking off today, is there's some great new tools out there. 
And you can't see this very well on the screen, but Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform. 
It's a micro-controller. 
If you don't know what those are, they're just the "brains." 
So they're the brains of maker projects, and here's an example of one. 
And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox -- so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. 
So you figure out how to program this, and you put this in your mailbox. 
And when someone opens your mailbox, you get a notification, an alert message goes to your iPhone. 
Now that could be a dog door, it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't, like a little brother into a little sister's room. 
There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that. 
Now here's something -- a 3D printer. 
That's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting. 
This is Makerbot. 
And there are industrial versions of this -- about 20,000 dollars. 
These guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars, and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers. 
Now they don't know what they want to do with it, but they're going to figure it out. 
They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it. 
One of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade, some new brackets for the box. 
Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones. 
Isn't that cool? 
So makers harvest technology from all the places around us. 
This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy. 
And they do interesting things. 
They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think -- the military is doing drones -- well, there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes, or vehicles -- something that you could program to fly on its own, without a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going. 
Fascinating work they're doing. 
We just had an issue on space exploration, DIY space exploration. 
This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space. 
You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like 8,000 dollars. 
Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space. 
In fact, these guys actually work for NASA, and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components, cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space. 
Makers are a source of innovation, and I think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry. 
This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers? 
It's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace. 
And he says, "I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free." 
Well he did a little bit better than free. 
But it's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries -- even like Henry Ford -- come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups. 
Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker, I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers, that kids are particularly interested in this, in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro-controllers and build robots. 
And we've got to get this into schools, or into communities in many, many ways -- the ability to tinker, to shape and reshape the world around us. 
There's a great opportunity today -- and that's what I really care about the most. 
An the answer to the question: what will America make? 
It's more makers. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy: social media and the end of gender. 
Let me connect the dots. 
I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love, or love to hate, are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. 
I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender. 
If you hadn't noticed, our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender, and I think that's going to change. 
Now most media companies -- television, radio, publishing, games, you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences. 
It's old-school demographics. 
They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us. 
Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways -- you have certain taste, that you like certain things. 
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics. 
Age demographics: the 18 to 49 demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 1960s, when the baby boomers were still young. 
Now they've aged out of that demographic, but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age 54. 
In our media environment, it's as if they don't even exist. 
Now, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do -- it's a popular TV show in the States -- Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics, which first came about in the 1960s, where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers. 
But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. 
It's really just been basic demographics. 
So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC, and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. 
And in the last three years, we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed, and we've discovered some very interesting things. 
All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. 
But those categories mean even less now than they did before, because with online networking tools, it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes. 
We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. 
And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily. 
We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests. 
We don't need a media company to help do this for us. 
So the traditional media companies, of course, are paying very close attention to these online communities. 
They know this is the mass audience of the future; they need to figure it out. 
But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them, because that's how ad rates are still determined. 
When they're monitoring your clickstream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age, your gender and your income. 
They can make some educated guesses. 
But they get a lot more information about what you do online, what you like, what interests you. 
That's easier for them to find out than who you are. 
And even though that's still sort of creepy, there is an upside to having your taste monitored. 
Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. 
It had been presumed before. 
So when you look online at the way people aggregate, they don't aggregate around age, gender and income. 
They aggregate around the things they love, the things that they like, and if you think about it, shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories. 
I'd much rather know whether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" rather than how old you are. 
That would tell me something more substantial about you. 
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. 
It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. 
If you look at the statistics -- these are worldwide statistics -- in every single age category, women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. 
And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites, they truly dominate the social media space, which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media. 
The question is: what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture, and what's it going to mean for women? 
If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media, then does that mean that women are going to take over global media? 
Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows? 
Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks? 
Could this be possible, that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape? 
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case. 
I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women, because they realize this is important for their business, and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere. 
But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough -- responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the "chick flick" and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things -- that Hispanics like certain things, that young people like certain things. 
This is far too simplistic. 
The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data-driven, and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online, where women are really driving the action. 
So you may be asking, well why is it important that I know what entertains people? 
Why should I know this? 
Of course, old media companies and advertisers need to know this. 
But my argument is that, if you want to understand the global village, it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about, what amuses them, what they choose to do in their free time. 
This is a very important thing to know about people. 
I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. 
And I do it not just because it's fun -- though actually, it is really fun -- but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives -- for instance, on their political beliefs and on their health. 
And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world, looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start. 
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. 
Can you even imagine what that looks like? 
I can't wait to find out what it looks like. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

There's an African proverb that goes, "The lion's story will never be known as long as the hunter is the one to tell it." 
More than a racial conversation, we need a racial literacy to decode the politics of racial threat in America. 
Key to this literacy is a forgotten truth, that the more we understand that our cultural differences represent the power to heal the centuries of racial discrimination, dehumanization and illness. 
Both of my parents were African-American. 
My father was born in Southern Delaware, my mother, North Philadelphia, and these two places are as different from each other as east is from west, as New York City is from Montgomery, Alabama. 
My father's way of dealing with racial conflict was to have my brother Bryan, my sister Christy and I in church what seemed like 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
(Laughter) If anybody bothered us because of the color of our skin, he believed that you should pray for them, knowing that God would get them back in the end. 
(Laughter) You could say that his racial-coping approach was spiritual -- for later on, one day, like Martin Luther King. 
My mother's coping approach was a little different. 
She was, uh, you could say, more relational -- right now, like, in your face, right now. 
More like Malcolm X. 
(Laughter) She was raised from neighborhoods in which there was racial violence and segregation, where she was chased out of neighborhoods, and she exacted violence to chase others out of hers. 
When she came to Southern Delaware, she thought she had come to a foreign country. 
She didn't understand anybody, particularly the few black and brown folks who were physically deferential and verbally deferential in the presence of whites. 
Not my mother. 
When she wanted to go somewhere, she walked. 
She didn't care what you thought. 
And she pissed a lot of people off with her cultural style. 
Before we get into the supermarket, she would give us the talk: "Don't ask for nothin', don't touch nothin'. 
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? 
I don't care if all the other children are climbing the walls. 
They're not my children. 
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?" 
In three-part harmony: "Yes, Mom." 
Before we'd get into the supermarket, that talk was all we needed. 
Now, how many of you ever got that talk? 
How many of you ever give that talk? 
(Laughter) How many of you ever give that talk today? 
My mother didn't give us the talk because she was worried about money or reputation or us misbehaving. 
We never misbehaved. 
We were too scared. 
We were in church 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
(Laughter) She gave us that talk to remind us that some people in the world would interpret us as misbehaving just by being black. 
Not every parent has to worry about their children being misjudged because of the color of their skin, just by breathing. 
So we get into the supermarket, and people look at us -- stare at us as if we just stole something. 
Every now and then, a salesperson would do something or say something because they were pissed with our cultural style, and it would usually happen at the conveyor belt. 
And the worst thing they could do was to throw our food into the bag. 
And when that happened, it was on. 
(Laughter) My mother began to tell them who they were, who their family was, where to go, how fast to get there. 
(Laughter) If you haven't been cursed out by my mother, you haven't lived. 
(Laughter) The person would be on the floor, writhing in utter decay and decomposition, whimpering in a pool of racial shame. 
(Laughter) Now, both my parents were Christians. 
The difference is my father prayed before a racial conflict and my mother prayed after. 
(Laughter) There is a time, if you use both of their strategies, if you use them in the right time and the right way. 
But it's never a time -- there's a time for conciliation, there's a time for confrontation, but it's never a time to freeze up like a deer in the headlights, and it's never a time to lash out in heedless, thoughtless anger. 
The lesson in this is that when it comes to race relations, sometimes, we've got to know how to pray, think through, process, prepare. 
And other times, we've got to know how to push, how to do something. 
And I'm afraid that neither of these two skills -- preparing, pushing -- are prevalent in our society today. 
If you look at the neuroscience research which says that when we are racially threatened, our brains go on lockdown, and we dehumanize black and brown people. 
Our brains imagine that children and adults are older than they really are, larger than they really are and closer than they really are. 
When we're at our worst, we convince ourselves that they don't deserve affection or protection. 
At the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, we know that some of the scariest moments are racial encounters, some of the scariest moments that people will ever face. 
If you look at the police encounters that have led to some wrongful deaths of mostly Native Americans and African-Americans in this country, they've lasted about two minutes. 
Within 60 seconds, our brains go on lockdown. 
And when we're unprepared, we overreact. 
At best, we shut down. 
At worst, we shoot first and ask no questions. 
Imagine if we could reduce the intensity of threat within those 60 seconds and keep our brains from going on lockdown. 
Imagine how many children would get to come home from school or 7-Eleven without getting expelled or shot. 
Imagine how many mothers and fathers wouldn't have to cry. 
Racial socialization can help young people negotiate 60-second encounters, but it's going to take more than a chat. 
It requires a racial literacy. 
Now, how do parents have these conversations, and what is a racial literacy? 
Thank you for asking. 
(Laughter) A racial literacy involves the ability to read, recast and resolve a racially stressful encounter. 
Reading involves recognizing when a racial moment happens and noticing our stress reactions to it. 
Recasting involves taking mindfulness and reducing my tsunami interpretation of this moment and reducing it to a mountain-climbing experience, one that is -- from impossible situation to one that is much more doable and challenging. 
Resolving a racially stressful encounter involves being able to make a healthy decision that is not an underreaction, where I pretend, "That didn't bother me," or an overreaction, where I exaggerate the moment. 
Now, we can teach parents and children how to read, recast and resolve using a mindfulness strategy we call: "Calculate, locate, communicate, breathe and exhale." 
Stay with me. 
"Calculate" asks, "What feeling am I having right now, and how intense is it on a scale of one to 10?" 
"Locate" asks, "Where in my body do I feel it?" 
And be specific, like the Native American girl at a Chicago fifth-grade school said to me, "I feel angry at a nine because I'm the only Native American. 
And I can feel it in my stomach, like a bunch of butterflies are fighting with each other, so much so that they fly up into my throat and choke me." 
The more detailed you can be, the easier it is to reduce that spot. 
"Communicate" asks, "What self-talk and what images are coming in my mind?" 
And if you really want help, try breathing in and exhaling slowly. 
With the help of my many colleagues at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, we use in-the-moment stress-reduction in several research and therapy projects. 
One project is where we use basketball to help youth manage their emotions during 60-second eruptions on the court. 
Another project, with the help of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott, we leverage the cultural style of African-American barbershops, where we train black barbers to be health educators in two areas: one, to safely reduce the sexual risk in their partner relationships; and the other, to stop retaliation violence. 
The cool part is the barbers use their cultural style to deliver this health education to 18- to 24-year-old men while they're cutting their hair. 
Another project is where we teach teachers how to read, recast and resolve stressful moments in the classroom. 
And a final project, in which we teach parents and their children separately to understand their racial traumas before we bring them together to problem-solve daily microaggressions. 
Now, racially literate conversations with our children can be healing, but it takes practice. 
And I know some of you are saying, "Practice? 
Practice? 
We're talking about practice?" 
Yes, we are talking about practice. 
I have two sons. 
My oldest, Bryan, is 26, and my youngest, Julian, is 12. 
And we do not have time to talk about how that happened. 
(Laughter) But, when I think of them, they are still babies to me, and I worry every day that the world will misjudge them. 
In August of 2013, Julian, who was eight at the time, and I were folding laundry, which in and of itself is such a rare occurrence, I should have known something strange was going to happen. 
On the TV were Trayvon Martin's parents, and they were crying because of the acquittal of George Zimmerman. 
And Julian was glued to the TV. 
He had a thousand questions, and I was not prepared. 
He wanted to know why: Why would a grown man stalk and hunt down and kill an unarmed 17-year-old boy? 
And I did not know what to say. 
The best thing that could come out of my mouth was, "Julian, sometimes in this world, there are people who look down on black and brown people and do not treat them -- and children, too -- do not treat them as human." 
He interpreted the whole situation as sad. 
(Voice-over) Julian Stevenson: That's sad. 
"We don't care. You're not our kind." 
HS: Yes. 
JS: It's like, "We're better than you." 
HS: Yes. 
JS: "And there's nothing you can do about that. 
And if you scare me, or something like that, I will shoot you because I'm scared of you." 
HS: Exactly. 
But if somebody's stalking you -- JS: It's not the same for everyone else. 
HS: It's not always the same, no. You've got to be careful. 
JS: Yeah, because people can disrespect you. 
HS: Exactly. 
JS: And think that you're, "You don't look -- you don't look like you're ..." 
It's like they're saying that "You don't look right, so I guess I have the right to disrespect you." 
HS: Yeah, and that's what we call, we call that racism. 
And we call that racism, Julian, and yes, some people -- other people -- can wear a hoodie, and nothing happens to them. 
But you and Trayvon might, and that's why Daddy wants you to be safe. 
(Voice-over) HS: And that's why -- JS: So you mean like, when you said "other people," you mean, like if Trayvon was a white, um, that he wouldn't be disrespected like that? 
HS: Yes, Julian, Daddy meant white people when I said, "other people," all right? 
So there was a way in which I was so awkward in the beginning, but once I started getting my rhythm and my groove, I started talking about stereotypes and issues of discrimination, and just when I was getting my groove on, Julian interrupted me. 
(Voice-over) HS: ... dangerous, or you're a criminal because you're black, and you're a child or a boy -- That is wrong, it doesn't matter who does it. 
JS: Dad, I need to stop you there. 
HS: What? 
HS: So he interrupts me to tell me a story about when he was racially threatened at a swimming pool with a friend by two grown white men, which his mother confirmed. 
And I felt happy that he was able to talk about it; it felt like he was getting it. 
We moved from the sadness of Trayvon's parents and started talking about George Zimmerman's parents, which, I read in a magazine, condoned the stalking of Trayvon. 
And Julian's reaction to me was priceless. 
It made me feel like he was getting it. 
(Voice-over) JS: What did they say about him? 
HS: Well, I think they basically felt that he was justified to follow and stalk -- JS: What the -- ? 
HS: Yeah, I think that's wrong. 
JS: That's -- one minute. 
So they're saying he has the right to follow a black kid, get in a fight with him and shoot him? 
HS: As Julian was getting it, I started to lose it. 
Because in my mind's eye, I was thinking: What if my Julian or Bryan was Trayvon? 
I calculated my anger at a 10. 
I found, located, my right leg was shaking uncontrollably like I was running. 
And in my mind's eye, I could see somebody chasing Julian, and I was chasing them. 
And the only thing that could come out of my mouth was if anybody tries to bother my child ... 
(Voice-over) HS: If anybody tries to bother my child ... 
mmm, mmm, mmm. 
JS: What will happen? 
HS: Well, they better run. 
JS: Because what? HS: I'm gonna get 'em. 
JS: See? (Laughs) HS: I'm gonna get 'em. JS: Really? 
HS: Oh, yeah. 
JS: Then they're gonna get you because they might have weapons. 
HS: Well, you know what, I'm gonna call police, too, like I should. 
But I feel like I wanna get 'em. 
JS: They can be armed. 
HS: Yeah, you right. Yeah, you right. 
I feel like I wanna chase 'em. 
JS: Plus they could be an army or something. 
HS: I know -- I feel like I wanna go get 'em, messing with my son. 
I don't like that. 
JS: Um ... 
HS: But you right. You gotta be careful. 
And um, you gotta be careful. 
You never know what some crazy people will think about you. 
Just as long as you believe you're beautiful like Daddy believes you're beautiful and handsome, and Mommy believes you're beautiful and handsome and smart. 
And you deserve to be on this planet, just as happy and beautiful and smart as you want to be. 
You can do anything you want, baby. 
HS: Racial socialization is not just what parents teach their children. 
It's also how children respond to what their parents teach. 
Is my child prepared? 
Can they recognize when a racial elephant shows up in a room? 
Can they reduce their tsunami interpretation down to a mountain-climbing adventure that they can engage and not run away? 
Can they make a healthy and just decision in 60 seconds? 
Can I? 
Can you? 
Yes, we can. 
We can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate, locate communicate, breathe and exhale in the middle of our most threatening moments, when we come face-to-face with our lesser selves. 
If you take the centuries of racial rage that boils up in all of our bodies, minds and souls -- and anything that affects our bodies, minds and souls affects our health -- we could probably use gun control for our hearts. 
I just want what all parents want for their children when we're not around: affection and protection. 
When police and teachers see my children, I want them to imagine their own, because I believe if you see our children as your children, you won't shoot them. 
With racial literacy, and yes, practice, we can decode the racial trauma from our stories, and our healing will come in the telling. 
But we must never forget that our cultural differences are full of affection and protection, and remember always that the lion's story will never be known as long as the hunter is the one to tell it. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Running: it's basically just right, left, right, left, yeah? 
I mean, we've been doing it for two million years, so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. 
But the cool thing about running, as I've discovered, is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time. 
Case in point: A couple months ago, if you saw the New York City Marathon, I guarantee you, you saw something that no one has ever seen before. 
An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line. 
She's 37 years old. 
She hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years, and a few months previously, she had almost died in childbirth. 
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport, but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event, the New York City Marathon. 
Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu -- some other people had the same idea, including the Olympic gold medalist, and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster, the fastest woman marathoner in history by far. 
Only 10 minutes off the men's world record, Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable. 
That's her competition. 
The gun goes off, and -- I mean, she's not even an underdog; she's, like, under the underdogs. 
But the under-underdog hangs tough, and 22 miles into a 26-mile race, there is Derartu Tulu, up there with the lead pack. 
Now, this is when something really bizarre happens. 
Paula Radcliffe, the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands, suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back. 
So we all know what to do in this situation, right? 
You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line. 
Derartu Tulu ruins the script. 
Instead of taking off, she falls back and she grabs Paula Radcliffe, and says, "Come on. Come with us. You can do it." 
So Paula Radcliffe, unfortunately, does it. 
She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line. 
But then she falls back again. 
The second time, Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her. 
And Paula Radcliffe, at that point, says, "I'm done. Go." 
So that's a fantastic story, and we all know how it ends. 
She loses the check, but she goes home with something bigger and more important. 
Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again. 
Instead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins. 
Wins the New York City Marathon, goes home with a big fat check. 
It's a heartwarming story, but if you drill a little bit deeper, you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there. 
When you have two outliers in one organism, it's not a coincidence. 
When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race, again, it's not a coincidence. 
You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills; somehow water's involved. 
Someone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there. 
And the answer to it, I think, can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, where there's a reclusive tribe, called the Tarahumara Indians. 
Now, the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. 
Number one is: they have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years. 
When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices: you either fight back and engage or you could take off. 
The Mayans and Aztecs engaged, which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs. 
The Tarahumara had a different strategy. 
They took off and hid in this labyrinthine, networking, spider-webbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons. 
And there they've remained since the 1600s, essentially the same way they've always been. 
The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is: deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old -- these guys aren't running marathons; they're running mega-marathons. 
They're not doing 26 miles, they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time, and apparently without injury, without problems. 
The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is: all the things we're going to be talking about today, all the things we're trying to use all of our technology and brain power to solve -- things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer; crime, warfare and violence; clinical depression -- all this stuff -- the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about. 
They are free from all of these modern ailments. 
So what's the connection? 
Again, we're talking about outliers; there's got to be some kind of cause and effect. 
Well, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains and trying to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. 
They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries. 
And once again, a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery -- perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries, which go like this: Three things -- if you have the answer, come up and take the microphone, because nobody else knows the answer. 
If you know it, you're smarter than anybody on planet Earth. 
Mystery number one is this: Two million years ago, the human brain exploded in size. 
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain. 
Suddenly humans show up, Homo erectus, big old melon head. 
To have a brain of that size, you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy. 
In other words, early humans are eating dead animals -- no argument, that's a fact. 
The only problem is, the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago. 
So somehow, for nearly two million years, we are killing animals without any weapons. 
Now, we're not using our strength, because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle. 
Every other animal is stronger than we are, they have fangs, they have claws, they have nimbleness, they have speed. 
We think Usain Bolt is fast. 
Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel. 
We're not fast. 
That would be an Olympic event: turn a squirrel loose, whoever catches it gets a gold medal. 
(Laughter) So no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws. 
How were we killing these animals? Mystery number one. 
Mystery number two: Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now, but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters: they all suck; they're terrible. 
There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been. 
The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15. 
I could throw a rock and hit a high-school boy who can run faster than 4:15. 
For some reason, you guys are just really slow. 
But -- (Laughter) But, you get to the marathon we were just talking about -- you've only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years, because prior to the 1980s, medical science said if a woman tried to run 26 miles -- does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run 26 miles? 
Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn. 
Christopher McDougall: Her uterus would be torn, yes. 
Torn reproductive organs. 
(Laughter) Now, I've been to a lot of marathons, and I've yet to see any ... 
(Laughter) So it's only been 20 years that women have been allowed to run the marathon. 
In that very short learning curve, you've gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record. 
Then you go beyond 26 miles, into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans -- remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- you get to 50 and 100 miles, and suddenly, it's a different game. 
You take a runner like Ann Trason or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton, put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world, and it's a coin toss who's going to win. 
A couple years ago, Emily Baer signed up for a race called the Hardrock 100, which tells you all you need to know about the race. 
They give you 48 hours to finish this race. 
Well, Emily Baer -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place, in the top 10, even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race. 
(Laughter) And yet, she beat 492 other people. 
The last mystery: Why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer? 
The third mystery is this: At the University of Utah, they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon. 
What they found is that if you start running the marathon at age 19, you'll get progressively faster, year by year, until you reach your peak at age 27. 
And then after that, you succumb to the rigors of time. 
And you'll get slower and slower, until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19. 
So about seven, eight years to reach your peak, and then gradually you fall off your peak, until you go back to the starting point. 
You'd think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed, maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years. 
64-year-old men and women are running as fast as they were at age 19. 
Now, I defy you to come up with any other physical activity -- and please don't say golf -- something that's actually hard -- (Laughter) where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers. 
So you have these three mysteries. 
Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up? 
You've got to be careful anytime someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you a global answer because, it being prehistory, you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it. 
But I'll submit this to you: If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle, suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture. 
If you're wondering why the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease, why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive, and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons, perhaps it's because humans, as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe, actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs. 
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal. 
Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness -- again, it's not our fangs, our claws or our speed -- the only thing we do really well is sweat. 
We're really good at being sweaty and smelly. 
Better than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well. 
But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances, we're superb -- the best on the planet. 
You take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice: it's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off. 
But it ain't doing both. We can. 
So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals? 
What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group, go out there on that African savanna, pick out an antelope, go out as a pack, and run that thing to death? 
That's all we could do. 
We could run really far on a hot day. 
Well, if that's true, a couple other things had to be true as well. 
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word "pack." 
If you go out by yourself and try to chase an antelope, I guarantee there will be two cadavers out in the savanna. 
You need a pack to pull together. 
You need to have those 64- and 65-year-olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're trying to catch. 
Those expert trackers have to be part of the pack. 
You need the women and the adolescents there, because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you're a nursing mother and a developing adolescent. 
It makes no sense to have the antelope over there, dead, and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away. 
They need to be part of the pack. 
You need those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill, and you need those teenagers who are learning the whole thing involved. 
The pack stays together. 
Another thing that has to be true: this pack cannot be materialistic. 
You can't be hauling all your crap around, trying to chase the antelope. 
You can't be a pissed-off pack. 
You can't be bearing grudges, like, "I'm not chasing that guy's antelope. 
He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope." 
The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego, be cooperative, and pull together. 
What you end up with, in other words, is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara, a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age. 
It's a really compelling argument that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years, that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path. 
You know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing, this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. 
But maybe it's something different. 
Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it. 
How do we spoil it? Well, how do we spoil anything? 
We try to cash in on it. Right? 
We try to can it and package it and make it "better" and then sell it to people. 
And then what happened was, we started creating these fancy cushioned things which can make running "better," called running shoes. 
The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt. 
And I think if anybody in here runs -- I just had a conversation with Carol. 
We talked for two minutes backstage, and she talked about plantar fasciitis. 
You talk to a runner, I guarantee within 30 seconds, the conversation turns to injury. 
So if humans evolved as runners, if that's our one natural advantage, then why are we so bad at it? 
Why do we keep getting hurt? 
A curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time. 
If you read folklore and mythology, any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales, running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor. 
It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain. 
Geronimo used to say, "My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs." 
That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert, engage in hand-to-hand combat, steal a bunch of horses, and slap leather for home. 
Geronimo was never saying, "You know something, my Achilles -- I'm tapering. 
I've got to take this week off." 
Or, "I need to cross-train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready." 
(Laughter) Humans ran and ran all the time. 
We are here today. We have our digital technology. 
All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day, which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances. 
Well, I would submit to you the first thing is: get rid of all packaging, all the sales, all the marketing. 
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes. 
Stop focusing on urban marathons, which, if you do four hours, you suck, and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome, because you qualified for another race. 
We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and, I would say, nakedness, that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time. 
So what's the benefit? So what? 
But maybe there's another benefit there as well. 
Without getting too extreme about this, imagine a world where everybody could go out the door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed, more serene, more healthy, burn off stress -- where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore, or go home with a lot of stress on top of you again. 
Maybe there's something between what we are today and what the Tarahumara have always been. 
I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize, which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet, but maybe there's somewhere in between. 
And if we find that thing, maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there. 
Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence up until the 1970s or so, the benefits -- social and physical and political and mental -- could be astounding. 
What I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners, people who've gotten rid of their shoes. 
And what they have found uniformly is, you get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress, you get rid of the injuries and the ailments. 
And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time: that this can be a whole lot of fun. 
I've experienced it personally myself. 
I was injured all my life; then in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away, too. 
So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from. 
I appreciate your listening to this story. 
Thanks very much. 

"What I Will" I will not dance to your war drum. 
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum. 
I will not dance to that beating. 
I know that beat. 
It is lifeless. 
I know intimately that skin you are hitting. 
It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched. 
I will not dance to your drummed-up war. 
I will not pop, spin, break for you. 
I will not hate for you or even hate you. 
I will not kill for you. 
Especially I will not die for you. 
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide. 
I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. 
Everyone can be wrong. 
Life is a right, not collateral or casual. 
I will not forget where I come from. 
I will craft my own drum. 
Gather my beloved near, and our chanting will be dancing. 
Our humming will be drumming. 
I will not be played. 
I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat. 
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance. 
This heartbeat is louder than death. 
Your war drum ain't louder than this breath. Haaa. 
What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise. 
(Applause) A bunch of pacifists. 
Confused, aspiring pacifists. 
I understand. 
I've been wrong a lot lately. 
Like a lot. 
So I couldn't figure out what to read today. 
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping. 
What that means is prepping my outfit, (Laughter) prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. 
Poetry does that. 
It preps you. It aims you. 
So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. 
But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here. 
Hold her now with you. 
You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her. 
Are you holding her? 
This is "Break Clustered." 
All holy history banned. 
Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past. 
But my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man's creative violence. 
Whose son shall it be? 
Which male child will perish a new day? 
Our boys' deaths galvanize. 
We cherish corpses. 
We mourn women, complicated. 
Bitches get beat daily. 
Profits made, prophets ignored. 
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods. 
All colors run, none of us solid. 
Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within. 
I live cycles of light and darkness. 
Rhythm is half silence. 
I see now, I never was one and not the other. 
Sickness, health, tender violence. 
I think now I never was pure. 
Before form I was storm, blind, ign'ant -- still am. 
Human contracted itself blind, malignant. 
I never was pure. 
Girl spoiled before ripened. 
Language can't math me. 
I experience exponentially. 
Everything is everything. 
One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family. 
One woman loses six. 
One woman loses her head. 
One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash. 
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. 
One woman straps herself. 
One woman gives birth to a baby. 
One woman gives birth to borders. 
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her. 
One woman never did. 
Where do refugee hearts go? 
Broken, dissed, placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed. 
Faced with absence. 
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all. 
My spine curves spiral. 
Precipice running to and running from human beings. 
Cluster bombs left behind. 
De facto landmines. 
A smoldering grief. 
Harvest contaminated tobacco. 
Harvest bombs. 
Harvest baby teeth. 
Harvest palms, smoke. 
Harvest witness, smoke. 
Resolutions, smoke. 
Salvation, smoke. 
Redemption, smoke. 
Breathe. 
Do not fear what has blown up. 
If you must, fear the unexploded. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

[This talk contains mature content Viewer discretion is advised] Tiffany Kagure Mugo: OK. 
So we've signed up, there's no turning back now. 
(Laughter) Siphumeze Khundayi: Hi, guys. TKM: Hello, everyone. 
TKM: So, you think you know about sex. 
Chances are you don't, and we are here to tell you that you don't. 
SK: We are here to tell you that no matter where you come from, Abuja to Alabama, Dubai to downtown London, sex has and continues to change. 
And we need to understand this if we're going to keep things safe and spicy. 
TKM: So now, the act of rubbing our naked bodies together has undergone a number of changes. 
And those changes have been affected by eons of ideas. 
Even you, as an adult, have some internalized ideas about sex that you never challenge. 
Some good, some bad and some very, very strange. 
(Laughter) SK: So when you allow someone to see you butt naked, do you ever think about how the ideas that you internally have will affect whether you will like them tickling your elbow or kissing your thigh or shouting out the name of a chose deity? 
One must do internal monitoring and evaluation if we are going to live our best sexy lives. 
TKM: And we're going to tell you how to have a great sex life, right? 
But the first thing you need to do is let go of the bad ideas you have about sex. 
SK: Think about the things that we need to change. 
TKM: And the things we need to embrace in all of their shiny newness. 
So, we're going to take you on a journey of sex: the bad parts of sex, historically great sexual practices and the future of sex. 
SK: Now, judging by the cool seven billion people on this planet, human beings have been doing the sex thing for a long time. 
And in vast quantities. 
But this does not mean we are actually good at it. 
From the top of my head -- rape culture. 
TKM: How tradition and culture limit ideas of pleasure. 
SK: Or even the idea that the nipple deserves the same treatment that a DJ gives his deck when he's trying to turn up the volume. 
TKM: Like, that is a personal pet peeve of mine. 
SK: We are so scared of sex. 
TKM: And we need somebody to blame for our fear. 
Enter women, and our fear of every part of their anatomy, unless we are the ones using their sexiness. 
SK: Think about it. 
You can quite easily go to someone and say, "My elbow hurts." 
But try going to someone and saying, "Excuse me, my vagina has a strange buzzing feeling, do you know where I can find the buzzing-vagina ointment?" 
And see how well that goes down. 
(Laughter) TKM: Does not go down well. 
I once challenged friends to simply go into supermarkets and say to strangers, "Thighs." 
No one did it, despite the fact that they could have been talking about chicken or turkey. 
(Laughter) SK: So a number of cultural and historical notions have burrowed so deeply within us, we don't even notice that it's strange to freak out when somebody says "nipple" as opposed to "left knee." 
We refuse to engage with sex properly. 
And the first step is admitting that it exists outside of trying to sell us products like bottled water or coffee. 
The unrealistic depictions in movies or that one thing that you saw on the internet "by mistake." 
TKM: Mhm. 
So, now in order to cure this ailment, again, let us just first admit that we have some messed-up ideas of sex. 
SK: And breathe in -- (Inhales) And let it all go. 
Now, it all seems pretty morbid -- that culture and society have failed us in our quest for coitus. 
But this is not the case. 
There are things that the past can teach us to help us upgrade the present. 
TKM: So now, if I had a glass of Merlot -- which I really wish I did -- I would pour the ancestors a drink, because there are ways in which African societies huddled this sex thing before the C that shall not be named -- SK: (Whispering) Colonization. 
TKM: Came through. 
Within African societies, we had spaces, both social and spiritual, that helped institutionalize healthy sexual practices. 
We had sexuality schools that taught social and erotic cues. 
We had spaces where teenagers could engage, understand and like, properly know how to handle sexual urges, and places where adults could handle the stresses and strifes of adulting. 
SK: Ways that didn't include you hiding your credit card bill or deleting that toll-free number from your phone. 
These spaces of old were so important for women. 
TKM: There were African sexual practices that centered women and in particular, their pleasure. 
SK: And we're going to talk about one in particular that's named "osunality." 
TKM: Also known as the African erotic. 
Yes, my people, welcome to the Thunderdome. 
The erotic takes on different shapes and forms as you travel the globe. 
Now let's take a bow to the "Kama Sutra," the world's first book on the pleasures of sensual living. 
More than just a mere depiction of contortionist sexual positions, it provided a comprehensive guide on living a good life. 
What is particularly interesting for us is that it focused on women and creating pleasure for women. 
TKM: Mhm. Shout-out to the "Kama Sutra," but back to the African erotic. 
SK: OK, my bad, bringing it back. 
So, Nkiru Nzegwu says that Osun, who is an orisha of the Yoruba people, typically associated with water, purity, fertility, love and, most importantly, sensuality, represents a female-centered life-transforming energy that courses through and animates life. 
She says that women who typify the osun force brandish their sexuality quite openly and unselfconsciously. 
And she goes on to say ... 
TKM: There you go, you got that line this time. 
"The flow need not result in conception and birth but doesn't tell the principle of pleasure at the heart of copulation. 
This pleasure principle at the heart of the creative energy is metaphorically known as 'osun honey'." 
Sorry, I did not want to misquote that. 
So now, osun honey and osunality re-affirm the normality of sexual pleasure and the erotic. 
Osun, like other female deities of fertility across Africa, made sure and emphasized the importance of female sexuality without negating male sexuality. 
We had the Tonga, the Bemba, the Sande and other similar sexuality schools of thought that taught young women about the power of this inner force. 
TKM: So within the African continent, there's a great deal of talk about the synergic nature of sex and how it comes together as a social good. 
For example, within Rwanda, there is the notion that the rivers are replenished by the act of a woman squirting. 
(Laughter) SK: But modern-day ideas of sex have become some sort of battle in which we are all trying to subvert each other. 
TKM: We are pounding the pussy, using sex as a weapon, playing hard to get, conquering -- a constant power struggle. 
SK: And there is always a loser when it comes to this war. 
TKM: So now the ability to openly brandish and explore your sexuality and your sex without it being a threat to others is at the core of engaging with healthy sexual practices. 
SK: Now this is where it begins to get really, really good. 
TKM: So what does it mean to reconceptualize sex away from this idea of the monster hiding in the night? 
What is the potential for doing greatness on the kitchen counter, a secluded beach, the backseat of a car or even simply in between the sheets? 
Now in learning from the past and sliding into the present, a radical theory of sex must identify, it must describe, explain and denounce sexual oppression and erotic injustice. 
TKM: And sex positivity is one of the realms in which the new can be unpacked and explored. 
SK: We're asking you to call upon the osun honey to engage with new ideas of sex and pleasure so that we can start to build a new identity that feels more like a fitted dress and less like a wooden coffin slowly choking the life out of us. 
Now there are a lot of people charting their own sexual paths. 
But, because as HOLAAfrica -- SK: We do sex and sexuality online -- TKM: We would be foolhardy not to mention the digital realm. 
There are women who are online, creating incredible conversations, chatting about the clitoris, chatting about the reverse cowgirl and also cunnilingus. 
SK: I like the word "cunnilingus." 
TKM: I bet you do. But that's not the point. 
Anyway, these women are resurrecting the work of ancestors to have some incredible conversations that have been previously buried and sealed. 
SK: They are asking the questions that we are so afraid to ask, so that we don't end up in sticky situations. 
TKM: That's true. 
And another space that we've been seeing the charting of a new sexual path is by queer women and their engagement in kink. 
SK: Now, think "Fifty Shades of Grey" without the creepy rich guy who does not understand consent. 
(Laughter) TKM: So one fascinating subset of kink is actually rope play. 
SK: Shibari, also known as Kinbaku, is the Japanese art of rope play. 
Originally used as a means of restraining captives, it became sexualized and spreading across the globe as a kinky form of restraint with a respected and erotic aesthetic. 
TKM: And it landed on our shores. 
Who would have thought that African queer women would be kinksters? 
Coming from a history of sexual violence, slavery and a lack of bodily autonomy. 
Is it not too soon, you ask. 
SK: No, it's not, and these women have taught us that despite the dark history that covers the body of women from our beautiful continent, these women are actively and beautifully constructing what sex and pleasure means to them. 
TKM: This is not to say that everyone now needs to rush out and engage in kink. 
But if these queer women can come out of a history of, again, sexual violence, slavery, colonization and all manner of traditional, religious and cultural pitfalls, to reconceptualize what sex and pleasure means to them, then you can do it, too. 
SK: You can do it too, boo-boo. 
Yes, you can. 
(Laughter) TKM: It is in taking the ideas that we have about sex -- the bad ones, and head-butting them, holding on to the good ones and creating new ones that we can have an incredible engagement with one of the most prolific and natural human acts ever. 
SK: It's about figuring out what counts as a system bug. 
TKM: What to term a classic. 
SK: And what new features we should add. 
Human beings are infamous for their superpower to upgrade. 
This should count for our sex, too. 
TKM: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request. 
I'd like all of you to pause for a moment, you wretched weaklings, and take stock of your miserable existence. 
(Laughter) Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century. 
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40. 
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior -- I was eating too much, I was drinking too much, I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family. 
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around. 
In particular, I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance. 
So I stepped back from the workforce, and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children. 
But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work. 
(Laughter) Not a very useful skill, especially when the money runs out. 
So I went back to work, and I've spent these seven years since struggling with, studying and writing about work-life balance. 
And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today. 
The first is: if society's to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate. 
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance. 
All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue, which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family. 
Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in. 
And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like. 
(Laughter) (Applause) It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue. 
(Laughter) The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us. 
We should stop looking outside. 
It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead. 
If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you, and you may just not like their idea of balance. 
It's particularly important -- this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired -- it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. 
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies -- the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them. 
(Laughter) I'm talking about all companies. 
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [as] they can get away with. 
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA; it's what they do -- even the good, well-intentioned companies. 
On the one hand, putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened. 
On the other hand, it's a nightmare -- it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. 
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life. 
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance. 
Before I went back to work after my year at home, I sat down and I wrote out a detailed, step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to. 
And it went like this: wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. 
Have sex. 
Walk the dog. 
Have breakfast with my wife and children. 
Have sex again. 
(Laughter) Drive the kids to school on the way to the office. 
Do three hours' work. 
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime. 
Do another three hours' work. 
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink. 
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids. 
Meditate for half an hour. 
Have sex. 
Walk the dog. Have sex again. 
Go to bed. 
(Applause) How often do you think I have that day? 
(Laughter) We need to be realistic. 
You can't do it all in one day. 
We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life, but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the "I'll have a life when I retire, when my kids have left home, when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing, I've got no mates or interests left." 
(Laughter) A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long. 
There's got to be a middle way. 
A fourth observation: We need to approach balance in a balanced way. 
A friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said, "Nigel, I've read your book. 
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance. 
It's totally dominated by work. 
I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day. 
All of my relationships have failed. 
There's nothing in my life apart from my work. 
So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out. 
So I joined a gym." 
(Laughter) Now I don't mean to mock, but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn't more balanced; it's more fit. 
(Laughter) Lovely though physical exercise may be, there are other parts to life -- there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side; there's the spiritual side. 
And to be balanced, I believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches. 
Now that can be daunting. 
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit. 
You want me to go to church and call my mother." 
And I understand. 
I truly understand how that can be daunting. 
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective. 
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today, called me up at the office and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" -- Harry -- "up from school." 
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening. 
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. 
We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings, played some silly games. 
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe, and we shared a pizza for two, then walked down the hill to our home, and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas. 
I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach." 
I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate," and walked out of his bedroom. 
As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?" 
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day of my life, ever." 
I hadn't done anything, hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation. 
Now my point is the small things matter. 
Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life. 
With the smallest investment in the right places, you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life. 
Moreover, I think, it can transform society. 
Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. 
And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading. 
(Applause) 

Ever since I was a little girl seeing "Star Wars" for the first time, I've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots. 
And as a little girl, I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us, enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. 
I knew robots like that didn't really exist, but I knew I wanted to build them. 
So 20 years pass -- I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence, the year is 1997, and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. 
But robots are still not in our home, ironically. 
And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case. 
But one really struck me. 
Robotics had really been about interacting with things, not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. 
For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet. 
And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet, the world's first social robot. 
Three years later -- a lot of programming, working with other graduate students in the lab -- Kismet was ready to start interacting with people. 
(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something. 
Kismet: (Nonsense) Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. 
Kismet: (Nonsense) Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. 
I almost lost it this week. 
Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child, which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind. 
It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter. 
This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -- and with that, the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots. 
So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots, now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students. 
And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. 
We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. 
And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo. 
This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo, introducing Leo to a new object. 
And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it. 
But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction. 
(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo. 
Leo, this is Cookie Monster. 
Can you find Cookie Monster? 
Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad. 
He's very bad, Leo. 
Cookie Monster is very, very bad. 
He's a scary monster. 
He wants to get your cookies. 
(Laughter) CB: All right, so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start, but they get along great now. 
So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology, where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. 
And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine new questions, new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise. 
But what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?" 
Well, one of the things that we've learned is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language, the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use -- like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here -- what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. 
People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is, how likable, how engaging, how trustworthy. 
It turns out it's the same for robots. 
It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. 
To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter, we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is? 
Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how? 
Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters? 
It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically. 
We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. 
But with the robot, you can. 
And so in this video here -- this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University. 
He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with. 
There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. 
And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. 
So given that key insight, we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots. 
For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues, maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology. 
So imagine this: What about a robot accessory for your cellphone? 
You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot -- you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it? 
To explore this question, my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study where we brought human participants, people, into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. 
The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table, discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -- this ended up being a survival task -- and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. 
The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants. 
The first was just the screen. 
This is just like video conferencing today. 
The next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base. 
This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today -- this is mirroring that situation. 
And then the fully expressive MeBot. 
So after the interaction, we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology, with a remote collaborator through this technology, in a number of different ways. 
We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person? 
We looked at overall engagement. 
We looked at their desire to cooperate. 
And this is what we see when they use just the screen. 
It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table -- you get a little more of a boost. 
And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression. 
So it seems like this physical, social embodiment actually really makes a difference. 
Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. 
Today we know that families are living further and further apart, and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. 
For me, I have three young boys, and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents. 
But my parents live thousands of miles away, so they just don't get to see each other that often. 
We try Skype, we try phone calls, but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk; they want to play. 
So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology. 
I imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer, open up a browser and jack into a little robot. 
And as grandma-bot, she can now play, really play, with my sons, with her grandsons, in the real world with his real toys. 
I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters, with their friends, and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house, like sharing a bedtime story. 
And through this technology, being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today. 
Let's think about some other domains, like maybe health. 
So in the United States today, over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese, and now it's a big problem with our children as well. 
And we know that as you get older in life, if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life, but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system. 
But if robots can be engaging, if we like to cooperate with robots, if robots are persuasive, maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program, maybe they can help you manage your weight. 
Sort of like a digital Jiminy -- as in the well-known fairy tale -- a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. 
So we actually explored this idea in our lab. 
This is a robot, Autom. 
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. 
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach. 
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do. 
It could make eye contact with you. 
It could share information looking down at a screen. 
You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got. 
And then it could help track that for you. 
And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth. 
And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. 
It could help you set goals and track your progress, and it would help motivate you. 
So an interesting question is, does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot? 
Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters? 
To explore that question, we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks. 
One case was the robot you saw there, Autom. 
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface, ran exactly the same dialogues. 
The quality of advice was identical. 
And the third was just a pen and paper log, because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program. 
So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost, but really how long they interacted with the robot. 
Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off. 
And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions, well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success. 
So the first thing I want to look at is how long, how long did people interact with these systems. 
It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more, even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. 
When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance, people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. 
(Laughter) And when you look at emotional engagement, it was completely different. 
People would name the robots. 
They would dress the robots. 
(Laughter) And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study, they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots. 
They didn't do this with a computer. 
The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. 
We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today, whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. 
My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen. 
But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play, like, real-world play. 
And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child, where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play. 
So here's the first exploration of this idea, where characters can be physical or virtual, and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. 
I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play. 
But we can push this idea further. 
What if -- (Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay! 
CB: -- the character itself could come into your world? 
It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world. 
And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. 
Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities. 
So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world. 
So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2. 
You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world. 
So they are now sending the character back into that world. 
And now it's got number power. 
And then finally, what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids, where they really feel like they are part of that story, a part of that experience. 
And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching "Star Wars." 
But I want to do more than that. 
I actually want them to create those experiences. 
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. 
So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them. 
I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. 
I think that's very, very important. 
So this is a new project. 
We've invited a lot of kids into this space, and they think it's pretty cool. 
But I can tell you, the thing that they love the most is the robot. 
What they care about is the robot. 
Robots touch something deeply human within us. 
And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative, or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance, or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves, for me, robots are all about people. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Hawa Abdi: Many people -- 20 years for Somalia -- [were] fighting. 
So there was no job, no food. 
Children, most of them, became very malnourished, like this. 
Deqo Mohamed: So as you know, always in a civil war, the ones affected most [are] the women and children. 
So our patients are women and children. 
And they are in our backyard. 
It's our home. We welcome them. 
That's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people, where 75 percent of them are women and children. 
Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside. 
HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations because people need some help. 
There is no government to protect them. 
DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients, maybe more or less. 
But sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses, and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them. 
But we take the severe ones, and we reschedule the other ones the next day. 
It is very tough. 
And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children; it's the women who come into the hospitals; it's the women [are] building the houses. 
That's their house. 
And we have a school. This is our bright -- we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school where we have 850 children, and the majority are women and girls. 
(Applause) PM: And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. 
Would you explain the rules for admission? 
HA: The people who are coming to us, we are welcoming. 
We are sharing with them whatever we have. 
But there are only two rules. 
First rule: there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society. 
[Whomever] makes those things we throw out. 
The second: no man can beat his wife. 
If he beat, we will put [him] in jail, and we will call the eldest people. 
Until they identify this case, we'll never release him. 
That's our two rules. 
(Applause) The other thing that I have realized, that the woman is the most strong person all over the world. 
Because the last 20 years, the Somali woman has stood up. 
They were the leaders, and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations. 
We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. 
We can reconcile. 
We can do everything. 
(Applause) DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope, and the men are only killing in Somalia. 
So we came up with these two rules. 
In a camp with 90,000 people, you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. 
So there is no clan division, and no man can beat his wife. 
And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail. 
So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there. 
(Applause) So empowering the women and giving the opportunity -- we are there for them. They are not alone for this. 
PM: You're running a medical clinic. 
It brought much, much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it. 
You're also running a civil society. 
You've created your own rules, in which women and children are getting a different sense of security. 
Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi, and your decision, Dr. Mohamed, to work together -- for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances. 
HA: My age -- because I was born in 1947 -- we were having, at that time, government, law and order. 
But one day, I went to the hospital -- my mother was sick -- and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors, how they [are] committed to help the sick people. 
I admired them, and I decided to become a doctor. 
My mother died, unfortunately, when I was 12 years [old]. 
Then my father allowed me to proceed [with] my hope. 
My mother died in [a] gynecology complication, so I decided to become a gynecology specialist. 
That's why I became a doctor. 
So Dr. Deqo has to explain. 
DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to. 
Maybe I should become an historian, or maybe a reporter. 
I loved it, but it didn't work. 
When the war broke out -- civil war -- I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help, and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children. 
And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist. 
(Laughter) So I went to Russia, and my mother also, [during the] time of [the] Soviet Union. 
So some of our character, maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. 
So that's how I decided [to do] the same. 
My sister was different. 
She's here. She's also a doctor. 
She graduated in Russia also. 
(Applause) And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war -- when I was 16, and my sister was 11, when the civil war broke out. 
So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '90s -- that's what made us go back and work for them. 
PM: So what is the biggest challenge working, mother and daughter, in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations? 
HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation, very dangerous. 
And when I saw the people who needed me, I was staying with them to help, because I [could] do something for them. 
Most people fled abroad. 
But I remained with those people, and I was trying to do something -- [any] little thing I [could] do. 
I succeeded in my place. 
Now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other, who are not fighting. 
But we try to stand on our feet, to do something, little things, we can for our people. 
And I'm thankful for my daughters. 
When they come to me, they help me to treat the people, to help. 
They do everything for them. 
They have done what I desire to do for them. 
PM: What's the best part of working with your mother, and the most challenging part for you? 
DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging. 
She always expects us to do more. 
And really when you think [you] cannot do it, she will push you, and I can do it. 
That's the best part. 
She shows us, trains us how to do and how to be better [people] and how to do long hours in surgery -- 300 patients per day, 10, 20 surgeries, and still you have to manage the camp -- that's how she trains us. 
It is not like beautiful offices here, 20 patients, you're tired. 
You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage. 
PM: But you do it for good reasons. 
(Applause) Wait. Wait. 
HA: Thank you. 
DM: Thank you. 
(Applause) HA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much. 

I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples. 
These are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider. 
They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber, tougher than any fiber humans have ever made. 
The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber. 
And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature, extremes of pressure and loads of pollution. 
And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. 
It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn. 
This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away. 
That's roughly 10,000 times the range of man-made fire detectors. 
And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels. 
So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver. 
If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does, we could achieve factor 10, factor 100, maybe even factor 1,000 savings in resource and energy use. 
And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution, I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about. 
Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency. 
Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful, polluting way of using resources to a closed-loop model. 
And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy. 
And for all three of these, I believe, biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need. 
You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products, and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period. 
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it. 
So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas. 
And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency. 
When we were working on the Eden Project, we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular, but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried. 
It was a hell of a challenge, and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. 
So for instance, it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels. 
Studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons. 
The next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons. 
And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass, which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes. 
And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes. 
So we started exploring this material called ETFE. 
It's a high-strength polymer. 
And what you do is you put it together in three layers, you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it. 
And the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass, and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing. 
So that was a factor-100 saving. 
And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. 
So with such large, lightweight pillows, we had much less steel. 
With less steel we were getting more sunlight in, which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter. 
And with less overall weight in the superstructure, there were big savings in the foundations. 
And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. 
So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency -- delivering the same function, but with a fraction of the resource input. 
And actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions. 
So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures based on giant Amazon water lilies, whole buildings inspired by abalone shells, super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells. 
There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool. 
So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea. 
The way we tend to use resources is we extract them, we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them. 
Nature works very differently. 
In ecosystems, the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system. 
And there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems. 
And one of my favorites is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project by Graham Wiles. 
And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste. 
It was ending up in landfills. 
Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste. 
And I'm just going to talk through this animation. 
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants. 
They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding. 
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it. 
They put it into worm recomposting systems, which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon, which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants. 
So it transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model, and it created more value in the process. 
Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this, turning waste streams into schemes that create value. 
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time, there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. 
And I know it's a quirky example, but I think the implications of this are quite radical, because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity. 
And particularly in cities -- we could look at the whole metabolism of cities, and look at those as opportunities. 
And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about, the Mobius Project, where we're trying to bring together a number of activities, all within one building, so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another. 
And the kind of elements I'm talking about are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse, a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas. 
Then we would have an anaerobic digester, which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area, turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid. 
We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro-organisms. 
We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant. 
And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms. 
So you can see that we're bringing together cycles of food, energy and water and waste all within one building. 
And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London, which at the moment is a complete eyesore. 
Some of you may recognize this. 
And with just a little bit of planning, we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people, reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities. 
So the final project I want to talk about is the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment. 
It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago. 
So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa, huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests. 
And during the evolution of life on the Earth, it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy. 
The converse is also true. 
The more vegetation we lose, the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification. 
And this animation, this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years, and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot, and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification. 
And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts, there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. 
This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle, and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert. 
The way it does this is it comes out at night, crawls to the top of a sand dune, and because it's got a matte black shell, is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings. 
So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea, you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell. 
Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth, has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day. 
And the ingenuity, if you could call it that, goes even further. 
Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell, there are lots of little bumps on that shell. 
And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water. 
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water. 
And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps, they stay in tight, spherical beads, which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell. 
So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air, it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth. 
So amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource-constrained environment -- and in that sense, very relevant to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing over the next few years, next few decades. 
We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse. 
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions, and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills, and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process. 
So inside it's cool and humid, which means the plants need less water to grow. 
And then at the back of the greenhouse, it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle. 
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. 
So they just started spreading this on the land around, and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. 
This photograph was taken on completion day, and just one year later, it looked like that. 
So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land -- and in that sense, going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design. 
So we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits. 
And when you think about nature, often you think about it as being all about competition. 
But actually in mature ecosystems, you're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships. 
So an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters. 
And the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse is concentrated solar power, which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat to create electricity. 
And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP, consider that we receive 10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms -- 10,000 times. 
So our energy problems are not intractable. 
It's a challenge to our ingenuity. 
And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts. 
CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater. 
That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces. 
CSP produces a lot of waste heat. 
We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits. 
And finally, in the shade under the mirrors, it's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight. 
So this is how this scheme would look. 
The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind. 
We'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way. 
Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts. 
And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource, you don't think, "How am I going to dispose of this?" 
You think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?" 
And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages. 
When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. 
And that builds up on the evaporators -- and that's what that image on the left is -- gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate. 
So after a while, we could take that out, use it as a lightweight building block. 
And if you think about the carbon in that, that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea and then locked away in a building product. 
The next thing is sodium chloride. 
You can also compress that into a building block, as they did here. 
This is a hotel in Bolivia. 
And then after that, there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract, like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them. 
And there's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater. 
So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high-performance batteries. 
And in parts of the Arabian Gulf, the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. 
And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse. 
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine. 
We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts, transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity. 
Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero-carbon food, abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. 
So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning: radical increases in resource efficiency, closing loops and a solar economy. 
They're not just possible; they're critical. 
And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions. 
But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design. 
Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language. 
But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing. 
And this is an important point. 
Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said, "If you want to build a flotilla of ships, you don't sit around talking about carpentry. 
No, you need to set people's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores." 
And that's what we need to do, so let's be positive, and let's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Chris Waddell: Felice Bell and Jennifer Murphy are going to do an excerpts from their play "Other Women," which is created and directed by Monica L. Williams, so please welcome Felice Bell and Jennifer Murphy. 
(Applause) (Music) Felice Bell: Gambling. 
Quit your job. 
With no savings and a rough sketch of the rest of your life. 
Withdraw money from your 401K, pay the penalty, why wait? 
In this economy, everything you own is worth more than it will ever be. 
Cut your hair, call yourself "new," call your ex, call Robin, tell her you bought a ticket to the Bay. 
Paso Robles road trip, wine taste, buy a Malbec and a tight red tee, eat a cookie from an LA dispensary, chain-smoke around bed and breakfast hillside fire pit with San Diego newlyweds and vineyard view. 
(Laughter) Go to the water with your girls and grease-stained bags of burgers. 
Sit on driftwood. 
Sunset. 
Remember you folded. 
Remember your place. 
Spend the night in Reno. 
Resent the safety of the slots, sit at the blackjack table, hand the dealer rent, retirement, pray God cares enough to pony up an ace. 
(Laughter) Leaving. 
Lunch on Lake Tahoe, they say, is deep and cold enough to preserve a body whole. 
Railroad workers, mafia, military and possibly a monster like Loch Ness -- no one can prove it. 
Ignore the math. 
Odds are a distraction. 
What matters is the chip count. 
The cards on the table, the cards in your hand. 
You must be willing to lose. 
Jennifer Murphy: When the dream was a notion, it lived in the desert near Edwards Air Force Base, where NASA tested space ships. 
It fed on cactus and stars, but it kept being delayed. 
"It's not time," they said. 
The dream grew impatient, broke water, extracted from its mother in a bed of wrecked strawberries. 
As a teenager, it cried, took endless drives over the grapevine out of a town ripe with oranges and silence, "Get me out of here," it begged. 
It was so tiny and delicate, you feared for its life. 
It seemed a butterfly might land on its face and crush it. 
It frightened you to love something so much. 
Later it rebelled, got drunk, handcuffed for urinating whiskey on your neighbor's rose bushes. 
The dream had issues, needs. 
"Don't ignore me," it screamed. 
It needed skyscrapers and nicotine, needed to stay home reading the "Easter Parade" instead of going to its job as a waitress at a restaurant where it could not afford the food. 
It was a dream, for Christ's sake, it had better things to do. 
It had to write, pray, dispatch fleets of messages to God about how to make itself known in daylight. 
All its life, the dream made plans. 
It planned to write, publish, get rich, publish, have sex with reckless, attractive men in the backseats of taxis, yes, that happened -- no, it didn't. 
The dream argued with itself, with the truth. 
You didn't have the dream, the dream had you. 
Every single one of its plans fell through. 
"I give up," it cried, "I quit." 
Hid itself in the dark until finally it heard its name being called. 
Pondered the unspeakable miracle of sticking around long enough to be seen. 
Now it looks around for the ones who've waited years for its arrival. 
They always come for you, don't they, your girls? 
With their crossed fingers and belief in you, "No destination," they say, "No maps, no idea where we're headed." 
And even though you cannot believe this is happening, even though you are hallucinating with fear, you hear yourself say it, "I am ready, I am ready, let's go!" 
FB: Episode one. 
JM: Everyone always wants to know how we became sisters. 
"How did you two meet?" Like we're a married couple. 
I like to say we met online. 
(Laughter) FB: We met at the Nuyorican Poets Café in 1999. 
Every Friday night of our young lives spent in the audience or on the mic. 
Miss one Friday, and you would hear about the poet who killed it. 
You should have been there! 
JM: I killed it. 
FB: The night I met Jen, she was sitting on the lap of my archnemesis. 
I swear we are never going to be friends. 
JM: Really? 
We are not going to be friends because I'm friends with someone you don't like? 
FB: Absolutely. Without a doubt. 
(Laughter) JM: Misdemeanor one: menacing. 
I love it when women size me up and spit me out before they've ever met me, before I've said one word. 
The phrase "dismissed before investigation" comes to mind. 
Misdemeanor two: fraud. 
Felice likes to claim she believes in science and math, that she proceeds through life with logic, like a man. 
Lot of logic in this example, lot of fairness and justice, real open-minded play. 
Felice is not a detective, she only plays one onstage. 
And when I say that, I say it as a private investigator, licensed in the state of New York. 
(Laughter) FB: Sherlock Holmes doesn't need a license. 
(Laughter) He solves crime. So do I. 
Using science and my intuition. 
Everything I know about detective work, I learned on TV. 
JM: Episode two. 
How we became sisters. 
FB: Right, so about a year later, Jen and I were invited to read poems in the basement of Two Boots pizzeria. 
JM: Our careers had taken off! 
(Laughter) FB: After the pizzeria reading, we have a slice. 
I don't know why, but I tell her something I hadn't told anyone. 
I spent the weekend in Reno with Nacho Velasquez. 
First thing she says -- JM: Did you see Nacho's little nacho? 
FB: And we were friends. 
JM: That -- (Laughter) That is not how I remember it. 
In my mind, we became friends after I was diagnosed with cancer. 
You came with me to Sloan Kettering, because my family wasn't handy. 
FB: OK, let's hear that version. 
JM: So, we walk into Sloan Kettering, and I have never seen my sister happier. 
Reminder: we are at the cancer hospital. 
There are people limping by with carved faces and missing ears. 
FB: This place has everything. 
There is a waterfall, there are orchids, little packets of graham crackers. 
JM: I am sitting in the waiting room, sweating through my dress, she's making herself a cappuccino. 
FB: It's delicious. 
JM: I cannot handle you right now. 
FB: Episode three. 
JM: Six years after we first met. 
FB: My childhood best friend dies. 
The day of his wake there is a transit strike. 
Jen walks from Cobble Hill to Crown Heights so she can go with me. 
There are moments that bond, and this one is key. 
When there is no train, no car service, no bus, my sister will walk miles just to be by my side. 
JM: When a sister loves a sister. 
When she says, "It's time for bibimbap," she means, "I need to talk, I'm having a meltdown." 
And when she says, "Did you sleep with my man, Nacho Velasquez," she means, "I'm having trust issues around our friendship again. 
You are supposed to know this." 
(Laughter) FB: When a sister loves a sister, you are in Crown Heights and she is in Bedford-Stuyvesant. 
Or you're in Spain, sipping absinthe, and she is in Paris, writing. 
Or you are in your apartment, sun-glassed and hoodied, creating new choreography to the right soundtrack. 
JM: While you're home having flashbacks to 9/11, listening to the last call of your friend, a firefighter who perished in the North Tower. 
His last words, "Thank you." 
You find it difficult to say goodbye. 
FB: When a sister loves a sister, it is five o’clock in the morning, you are asleep and she is calling. 
You say, "Hey, sis, did someone die?" 
JM: You are sobbing, saying your boyfriend, the cop, got shot and straight away, her voice contains the depth and calm of a windless lake. 
For hours, she stays on the line and remains very quiet and very kind. 
FB: Whatever you need to get through this. 
JM: When she says, "Let's see each other this week," she means, "Let's cancel and talk on the phone instead." 
When she says, "This thing Tara Brach said reminded me of you," she means it reminded her of her and then you. 
It means she's been doing guided meditations again, is about to drop some spiritual-wisdom-type shit about radical acceptance, ergo -- FB: The only way to live is by accepting each minute as an unrepeatable miracle. 
JM: In the '90s, you fought with the constancy of dawn. 
It was entertaining, a sport, a pastime. 
FB: What is wrong with you? JM: What's wrong with you? 
FB: I'm not the one being aggressive.

JM: Your wide-eyed friends would raise their hands and say, "What is going on with you two?" 
One winter, when you had no money, you mailed her flowers from Paris because she was having surgery. 
One spring in your deepest heartbreak she stood with you in the rain on Fulton Street.

JM: You and your sister laugh, thank God that pesky dream is finished, now you can finally get back to peeling potatoes and shucking corn. 
FB: When a sister loves a sister, you want her in the audience when your play premieres at the National Theatre in Washington DC. 
JM: When a sister loves a sister, she cheers and screams when an agent agrees to send out your stories.

JM: You are like young girls becoming what they always dreamed of becoming when they grew up. 
FB: When a sister loves a sister, you listen to her read, thinking -- JM: As heaven to the gods is poetry to the beloved. 
(Applause) JM: Love you. 
(Applause) 

(Whistling) (Whistling ends) (Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
That was whistling. 
I'm trying to do this in English. 
What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland -- why is he whistling? 
My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. 
So I whistled along with him. 
And actually, until I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. 
I whistled alone, I whistled in the classroom, I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere. 
And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law. 
And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music. 
And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better. 
(Laughter) So when "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" -- you know it? 
(Whistling) But it can also sound like this. 
(Whistling) But during a Christmas party -- at dinner, actually -- it's very annoying. 
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, "Please stop whistling." 
And I just couldn't. 
And at one point -- and I had some wine, I have to admit that -- at one point I said, "If there was a contest, I would join." 
And two weeks later, I received a text message: "You're going to America." 
(Laughter) So, OK, I'm going to America. 
I would love to, but why? 
She googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course. 
(Laughter) She didn't expect me to go there. 
And I would have lost my face. 
I don't know if that's correct English. 
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. 
(Laughter) I lost my face. 
(Applause) And she thought, "He will never go there." 
But actually, I did. 
So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast of the United States, and I entered the world of whistling. 
And I also entered the World Championship, and I won there, in 2004. 
(Applause) That was great fun, of course. 
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought, well let's go back in 2005 -- and I won again. 
(Laughter) Then I couldn't participate for a few years. 
And in 2008, I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. 
So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. 
So I quit my day job as a nurse. 
(Applause) And I try to live my dream -- well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good. 
(Laughter) OK, I'm not the only one whistling here. 
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?" 
Well actually, you are going to whistle along. 
And then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, "Oh, my God. 
Why? Can I go away?" 
(Laughter) Actually, it's very simple. 
The track that I will whistle is called "Fête de la Belle." 
It's about 80 minutes long. 
(Laughter) No, no, no. It's four minutes long. 
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. 
Yes, so I whistle the tone. 
(Whistling) (Laughter) Sorry, I forgot one thing -- you whistle the same tone as me. 
(Laughter) I heard a wide variety of tones. 
(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling) (Whistling ends) This is very promising. 
(Laughter) This is very promising. 
I'll ask the technicians to start the music. 
And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens. 
(Laughter) Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians. 
(Laughter) I'm so used to that. 
(Laughter) I start it myself. 
(Laughter) OK, here it is. 
(Laughter) (Music) (Whistling) (Whistling ends) (Music) OK. 
(Whistling) It's easy, isn't it? 
(Whistling) Now comes the solo, I propose I do that myself, OK? 
(Music) (Whistling) (Applause) Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou, the World Champion of Whistling. 
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you. 

We're here to celebrate compassion. 
But compassion, from my vantage point, has a problem. 
As essential as it is across our traditions, as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives, the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture, and it is suspect in my field of journalism. 
It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing, or it's seen as potentially depressing. 
Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and, after the fact, the word "compassion" was translated as "pity." 
Now compassion, when it enters the news, too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. 
Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. 
And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. 
And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter, that they shape the way we understand ourselves, the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others. 
When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s, we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. 
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary, connotes "allowing," "indulging" and "enduring." 
In the medical context that it comes from, it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment. 
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue; it's more of a cerebral ascent. 
And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. 
And the going is pretty rough right now. 
I think that without perhaps being able to name it, we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue. 
Compassion is a worthy successor. 
It is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them. 
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others, both in our private and in our civic spaces. 
So what is it, three-dimensionally? 
What are its kindred and component parts? 
What's in its universe of attendant virtues? 
To start simply, I want to say that compassion is kind. 
Now "kindness" might sound like a very mild word, and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. 
But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. 
And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification. 
Compassion is also curious. 
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. 
I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles, Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi. 
They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims, and as they do that, they cultivate what they call "curiosity without assumptions." 
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. 
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. 
It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation, but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. 
It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up. 
I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other, not just what it is about them that might need helping. 
I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. 
And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other. 
I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like, but I can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible. 
When we see it, we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable, what is possible. 
It is so important when we're communicating big ideas -- but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion -- to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood -- the color and complexity of life. 
And compassion does seek physicality. 
I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford. 
And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him, but he's paraplegic. 
He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13, in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. 
Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again, and -- and he does experience this as an "and" rather than a "but" -- and he experiences himself to be healed and whole. 
And as a teacher of yoga, he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability, health, illness and aging. 
He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. 
He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. 
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either. 
But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body, in all its frailty and its grace, without, at the same time, becoming more compassionate towards all of life. 
Compassion also looks like this. 
This is Jean Vanier. 
Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities, which you can now find all over the world, communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities -- mostly Down syndrome. 
The communities that Jean Vanier founded, like Jean Vanier himself, exude tenderness. 
"Tender" is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting. 
We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive, and I spend a lot of time being those things too. 
And compassion can also have those qualities. 
But again and again, lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness. 
Jean Vanier says that his work, like the work of other people -- his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa -- is never in the first instance about changing the world; it's in the first instance about changing ourselves. 
He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution, but a sign. 
Compassion is rarely a solution, but it is always a sign of a deeper reality, of deeper human possibilities. 
And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories, never by statistics and strategies. 
We need those things too, but we're also bumping up against their limits. 
And at the same time that we are doing that, I think we are rediscovering the power of story -- that as human beings, we need stories to survive, to flourish, to change. 
Our traditions have always known this, and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us. 
There is, of course, a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world -- tikkun olam. 
And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. 
It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. 
And that the highest human calling is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it, to gather it up, and in so doing, to repair the world. 
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. 
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way. 
Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time, because this story insists that each and every one of us, frail and flawed as we may be, inadequate as we may feel, has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch. 
Stories like this, signs like this, are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. 
Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. 
And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing, how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine -- the work Fred Luskin is doing -- I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century -- that science, in fact, is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism. 
This is going to change science, I believe, and it will change religion. 
But here's a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion. 
We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E = mc2. 
We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson, to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. 
We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South. 
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions. 
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century. 
He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old. 
And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced, we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more, not less. 
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages. 
Some of his favorites were Moses, Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi, Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi. 
And Einstein said -- and I think this is a quote, again, that has not been passed down in his legacy -- that "these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living, more necessary to the dignity, security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge." 
Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us, but actually it is. 
I want to show you the rest of this photograph, because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture -- we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life, which is messy. 
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not. 
This is the full photograph, and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket, smoking a cigar. 
And by the look of that paunch, he hasn't been doing enough yoga. 
We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website, and someone said, "When I look at the first photo, I ask myself, what was he thinking? 
And when I look at the second, I ask, what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?" 
Well, he was complicated. 
He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. 
And it is much harder, often, to be compassionate towards those closest to us, which is another quality in the universe of compassion, on its dark side, that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. 
Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being. 
So was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day. 
So was Mother Teresa. 
So are we all. 
And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion -- following on what Fred Luskin says -- that these flaws just make us human. 
Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. 
But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems, in fact, are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion, towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. 
Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease. 
Einstein became a humanitarian, not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter, but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. 
And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that, with a zigzag, have led to the Charter for Compassion. 
Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity. 
So I want to propose a final definition of compassion -- this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way -- and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. 
Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this, and we need them to mine it for us now. 
But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious. 
So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity, the future of humanity, needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I want you to take a look at this baby. 
What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. 
But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see. 
What's going on up in that little brain of hers. 
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science. 
And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the "celestial openness" of the child's mind. 
What we see here is a mother in India, and she's speaking Koro, which is a newly discovered language. 
And she's talking to her baby. 
What this mother -- and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world -- understands is that, to preserve this language, they need to speak it to the babies. 
And therein lies a critical puzzle. 
Why is it that you can't preserve a language by speaking to you and I, to the adults? 
Well, it's got to do with your brain. 
What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning. 
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis. 
(Laughter) And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language. 
The babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven, and then there's a systematic decline. 
After puberty, we fall off the map. 
No scientists dispute this curve, but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way. 
Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development, and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. 
We think, by studying how the sounds are learned, we'll have a model for the rest of language, and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social, emotional and cognitive development. 
So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages. 
The baby sits on a parent's lap, and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes -- like from "ah" to "ee." 
If they do so at the appropriate time, the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum. 
A six-monther adores the task. 
What have we learned? 
Well, babies all over the world are what I like to describe as "citizens of the world." 
They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages, no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using, and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that. 
We're culture-bound listeners. 
We can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages. 
So the question arises: When do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are? 
And the answer: before their first birthdays. 
What you see here is performance on that head-turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States, here in Seattle, as they listened to "ra" and "la" -- sounds important to English, but not to Japanese. 
So at six to eight months, the babies are totally equivalent. 
Two months later, something incredible occurs. 
The babies in the United States are getting a lot better, babies in Japan are getting a lot worse, but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn. 
So the question is: What's happening during this critical two-month period? 
This is the critical period for sound development, but what's going on up there? 
So there are two things going on. 
The first is that the babies are listening intently to us, and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk -- they're taking statistics. 
So listen to two mothers speaking motherese -- the universal language we use when we talk to kids -- first in English and then in Japanese. 
(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice. 
(Japanese) Patricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen, what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. 
And those distributions grow. 
And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics, and the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different. 
English has a lot of Rs and Ls. 
The distribution shows. 
And the distribution of Japanese is totally different, where we see a group of intermediate sounds, which is known as the Japanese "R." 
So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are. 
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics. 
We are governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development. 
So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. 
We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize. 
It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people. 
Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them, one after the other, depending on who they're speaking to. 
So we asked ourselves, can the babies take statistics on a brand new language? 
And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. 
We knew that, when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds, they showed the same pattern. 
Six to eight months, they're totally equivalent. 
Two months later, something incredible happens. 
But the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies. 
What we did was expose American babies, during this period, to Mandarin. 
It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions. 
Here's what it looked like in the laboratory. 
(Mandarin) PK: So what have we done to their little brains? 
(Laughter) We had to run a control group to make sure that coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills. 
So a group of babies came in and listened to English. 
And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin. 
But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions. 
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for 10 and a half months. 
What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. 
Whatever you put in front of them, they'll take statistics on. 
But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise. 
So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage, the same 12 sessions, but over a television set. 
And another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. 
What did we do to their brains? 
What you see here is the audio result -- no learning whatsoever -- and the video result -- no learning whatsoever. 
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics. 
The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics. 
We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions, as opposed to in front of human beings. 
Thankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography, that allows us to do this. 
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars. 
But it's completely safe, completely noninvasive and silent. 
We're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using 306 SQUIDs -- these are superconducting quantum interference devices -- to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking. 
We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning. 
So this is little Emma. 
She's a six-monther. 
And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. 
You can see, she can move around. 
We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap, so she's free to move completely unconstrained. 
It's a technical tour de force. 
What are we seeing? 
We're seeing the baby brain. 
As the baby hears a word in her language, the auditory areas light up, and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence, getting the brain coordinated with its different areas, and causality, one brain area causing another to activate. 
We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child's brain development. 
We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion, as they learn to speak and read, as they solve a math problem, as they have an idea. 
And we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning. 
Just as the poets and writers described, we're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness, utter and complete openness, of the mind of a child. 
In investigating the child's brain, we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human, and in the process, we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives. 
(Applause) 

I was around 10 when one day, I discovered a box of my father's old things. 
In it, under a bunch of his college textbooks, was a pair of black corduroy bell-bottom pants. 
These pants were awful -- musty and moth-eaten. 
And of course, I fell in love with them. 
I'd never seen anything like them. 
Until that day, all I'd ever known and worn was my school uniform, which, in fact, I was pretty grateful for, because from quite a young age, I'd realized I was somewhat different. 
I'd never been one of the boys my age; terrible at sports, possibly the unmanliest little boy ever. 
(Laughter) I was bullied quite a bit. 
And so, I figured that to survive I would be invisible, and the uniform helped me to seem no different from any other child. 
(Laughter) Well, almost. 
This became my daily prayer: "God, please make me just like everybody else." 
I think this went straight to God's voicemail, though. 
(Laughter) And eventually, it became pretty clear that I was not growing up to be the son that my father always wanted. 
Sorry, Dad. 
No, I was not going to magically change. 
And over time, I grew less and less sure that I actually wanted to. 
Therefore, the day those black corduroy bell-bottom pants came into my life, something happened. 
I didn't see pants; I saw opportunity. 
The very next day, I had to wear them to school, come what may. 
And once I pulled on those god-awful pants and belted them tight, almost instantly, I developed what can only be called a swagger. 
(Laughter) All the way to school, and then all the way back because I was sent home at once -- (Laughter) I transformed into a little brown rock star. 
(Laughter) I finally didn't care anymore that I could not conform. 
That day, I was suddenly celebrating it. 
That day, instead of being invisible, I chose to be looked at, just by wearing something different. 
That day, I discovered the power of what we wear. 
That day, I discovered the power of fashion, and I've been in love with it ever since. 
Fashion can communicate our differences to the world for us. 
And with this simple act of truth, I realized that these differences -- they stopped being our shame. 
They became our expressions, expressions of our very unique identities. 
And we should express ourselves, wear what we want. 
What's the worst that could happen? 
The fashion police are going to get you for being so last season? 
(Laughter) Yeah. 
Well, unless the fashion police meant something entirely different. 
Nobel Prize laureate Malala survived Taliban extremists in October 2012. 
However, in October 2017, she faced a different enemy, when online trolls viciously attacked the photograph that showed the 20-year-old wearing jeans that day. 
The comments, the hatred she received, ranged from "How long before the scarf comes off?" 
to, and I quote, "That's the reason the bullet directly targeted her head a long time ago." 
Now, when most of us decide to wear a pair of jeans someplace like New York, London, Milan, Paris, we possibly don't stop to think that it's a privilege; something that somewhere else can have consequences, something that can one day be taken away from us. 
My grandmother was a woman who took extraordinary pleasure in dressing up. 
Her fashion was colorful. 
And the color she loved to wear so much was possibly the only thing that was truly about her, the one thing she had agency over, because like most other women of her generation in India, she'd never been allowed to exist beyond what was dictated by custom and tradition. 
She'd been married at 17, and after 65 years of marriage, when my grandfather died suddenly one day, her loss was unbearable. 
But that day, she was going to lose something else as well, the one joy she had: to wear color. 
In India, according to custom, when a Hindu woman becomes a widow, all she's allowed to wear is white from the day of the death of her husband. 
No one made my grandmother wear white. 
However, every woman she'd known who had outlived her husband, including her mother, had done it. 
This oppression was so internalized, so deep-rooted, that she herself refused a choice. 
She passed away this year, and until the day she died, she continued to wear only white. 
I have a photograph with her from earlier, happier times. 
In it, you can't really see what she's wearing -- the photo is in black and white. 
However, from the way she's smiling in it, you just know she's wearing color. 
This is also what fashion can do. 
It has the power to fill us with joy, the joy of freedom to choose for ourselves how we want to look, how we want to live -- a freedom worth fighting for. 
And fighting for freedom, protest, comes in many forms. 
Widows in India like my grandmother, thousands of them, live in a city called Vrindavan. 
And so, it's been a sea of white for centuries. 
However, only as recently as 2013, the widows of Vrindavan have started to celebrate Holi, the Indian festival of color, which they are prohibited from participating in. 
On this one day in March, these women take the traditional colored powder of the festival and color each other. 
With every handful of the powder they throw into the air, their white saris slowly start to suffuse with color. 
And they don't stop until they're completely covered in every hue of the rainbow that's forbidden to them. 
The color washes off the next day, however, for that moment in time, it's their beautiful disruption. 
This disruption, any kind of dissonance, can be the first gauntlet we throw down in a battle against oppression. 
And fashion -- it can create visual disruption for us -- on us, literally. 
Lessons of defiance have always been taught by fashion's great revolutionaries: its designers. 
Jean Paul Gaultier taught us that women can be kings. 
Thom Browne -- he taught us that men can wear heels. 
And Alexander McQueen, in his spring 1999 show, had two giant robotic arms in the middle of his runway. 
And as the model, Shalom Harlow began to spin in between them, these two giant arms -- furtively at first and then furiously, began to spray color onto her. 
McQueen, thus, before he took his own life, taught us that this body of ours is a canvas, a canvas we get to paint however we want. 
Somebody who loved this world of fashion was Karar Nushi. 
He was a student and actor from Iraq. 
He loved his vibrant, eclectic clothes. 
However, he soon started receiving death threats for how he looked. 
He remained unfazed. 
He remained fabulous, until July 2017, when Karar was discovered dead on a busy street in Baghdad. 
He'd been kidnapped. 
He'd been tortured. 
And eyewitnesses say that his body showed multiple wounds. 
Stab wounds. 
Two thousand miles away in Peshawar, Pakistani transgender activist Alisha was shot multiple times in May 2016. 
She was taken to the hospital, but because she dressed in women's clothing, she was refused access to either the men's or the women's wards. 
What we choose to wear can sometimes be literally life and death. 
And even in death, we sometimes don't get to choose. 
Alisha died that day and then was buried as a man. 
What kind of world is this? 
Well, it's one in which it's natural to be afraid, to be frightened of this surveillance, this violence against our bodies and what we wear on them. 
However, the greater fear is that once we surrender, blend in and begin to disappear one after the other, the more normal this false conformity will look, the less shocking this oppression will feel. 
For the children we are raising, the injustice of today could become the ordinary of tomorrow. 
They'll get used to this, and they, too, might begin to see anything different as dirty, something to be hated, something to be extinguished, like lights to be put out, one by one, until darkness becomes a way of life. 
However, if I today, then you tomorrow, maybe even more of us someday, if we embrace our right to look like ourselves, then in the world that's been violently whitewashed, we will become the pinpricks of color pushing through, much like those widows of Vrindavan. 
How then, with so many of us, will the crosshairs of a gun be able to pick out Karar, Malala, Alisha? 
Can they kill us all? 
The time is now to stand up, to stand out. 
Where sameness is safeness, with something as simple as what we wear, we can draw every eye to ourselves to say that there are differences in this world, and there always will be. 
Get used to it. 
And this we can say without a single word. 
Fashion can give us a language for dissent. 
It can give us courage. 
Fashion can let us literally wear our courage on our sleeves. 
So wear it. 
Wear it like armor. 
Wear it because it matters. 
And wear it because you matter. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days, talking to groups of students and professionals, and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes. 
On the one hand, people say, "The time for change is now." 
They want to be part of it. 
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning. 
But on the other hand, I hear people talking about fear, a sense of risk-aversion. 
They say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose, but I don't know where to start. 
I don't want to disappoint my family or friends." 
I work in global poverty. 
And they say, "I want to work in global poverty, but what will it mean about my career? 
Will I be marginalized? 
Will I not make enough money? 
Will I never get married or have children?" 
And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older -- and I'm glad I waited -- (Laughter) -- and has no children, I look at these young people and I say, "Your job is not to be perfect. 
Your job is only to be human. 
And nothing important happens in life without a cost." 
These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level. 
Our leaders and ourselves want everything, but we don't talk about the costs. 
We don't talk about the sacrifice. 
One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen, the great American writer from the South. 
In a short story called "Oh Yes," she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl, and she looks at her child with a sense of pride, but she also wonders, what price will she pay? 
"Better immersion than to live untouched." 
But the real question is, what is the cost of not daring? 
What is the cost of not trying? 
I've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion. 
One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. 
She was a leader of the Menominee tribe, a Native American peoples. 
And when we would gather as fellows, she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions. 
And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future, looking at them from the Earth, and they would look at them, holding them as stewards for that future. 
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other, not only as human beings, but to every living thing on the planet. 
And tragically, in 1999, when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people, focused on preserving their culture and language, she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC. 
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that, we would leave a chair empty for her spirit. 
And more than a decade later, when I talk to NGO fellows, whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House, and we talk about Ingrid, they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission. 
And when we think about legacy, I can think of no more powerful one, despite how short her life was. 
And I've been touched by Cambodian women -- beautiful women, women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia. 
And I met them in the early '90s. 
In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime, the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people, and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals, the artists, the dancers. 
And at the end of the war, there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living. 
And the women, who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors, told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps. 
They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance, hoping that others were alive and doing the same. 
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage, her hands at her side, and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was. 
And these big tears fell down her face, but she never lifted her hands to move them. 
And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already, but the next generation. 
And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them, wearing these beautiful silk colors. 
And I thought, after all this atrocity, this is how human beings really pray. 
Because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future. 
And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure. 
I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership. 
And I have learned that power, particularly in its absolute form, is an equal opportunity provider. 
In 1986, I moved to Rwanda, and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank. 
And one of the women was Agnes -- there on your extreme left -- she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda, and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda. 
We built this institution based on social justice, gender equity, this idea of empowering women. 
But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end. 
And though she had been part of building a liberal party, a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance, about three months before the genocide, she switched parties and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power, and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. 
She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide. 
And I would visit her in the prisons, sitting side-by-side, knees touching, and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us, but that maybe it's not monsters so much, but the broken parts of ourselves, sadnesses, secret shame, and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts, those fragments, if you will, and to make us look at other beings, human beings, as lesser than ourselves -- and in the extreme, to do terrible things. 
And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men. 
I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male. 
And so in a gathering where we're focused on women, while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them, we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered, unable to provide. 
And that, when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job, no education, no possibility, well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun. 
Sometimes very small investments can release enormous, infinite potential that exists in all of us. 
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization, Suraj Sudhakar, has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. 
And he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera. 
And they're incredible guys. 
And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums, and they're reading many TED authors and liking it. 
And then they created a business plan competition. 
Then they decided that they would do TEDx's. 
And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men. 
Alex, in some ways, said it best. 
He said, "We used to feel like nobodies, but now we feel like somebodies." 
And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link. 
What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other. 
And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV, or at best, microfinance. 
And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare -- the photojournalists and the creatives, the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs. 
And they're doing it. 
And my hat's off to you in Kibera. 
My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive. 
At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity, but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. 
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years, and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations that focus on change. 
I know it works. 
We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies, and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these forgotten markets. 
This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services like maternal health care and housing, emergency services, solar energy, so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems. 
Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions, easy categories, because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument. 
But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit. 
And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact, measuring what is most important to us. 
And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it, but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways. 
And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change. 
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence. 
I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers. 
And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim. 
And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives, but they did more, because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear and certainly despair. 
But less than 24 hours, I was 13 miles away from those mosques, visiting one of our Acumen investees, an incredible man, Jawad Aslam, who dares to live a life of immersion. 
Born and raised in Baltimore, he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate, and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference. 
For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend, but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui. 
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital, but he continued to pay a price. 
He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes. 
It took almost two years just to register the land. 
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action. 
Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses in this beautiful community. 
And there's schools and clinics and shops. 
But there's only one mosque. 
And so I asked Jawad, "How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community. 
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?" 
He said, "Long story. 
It was hard, it was a difficult road, but ultimately the leaders of the community came together, realizing we only have each other. 
And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams, and those imams would take turns, they would rotate who would say Friday prayer. 
But the whole community, all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni, would sit together and pray." 
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds. 
We face huge issues as a world -- the financial crisis, global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness. 
And every day we have a choice. 
We can take the easier road, the more cynical road, which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was, a fear of each other, distancing and blame. 
Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation, transcendence, compassion and love, but also accountability and justice. 
I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles, who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States. 
And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges, the first child to desegregate schools in the South -- in this case, New Orleans. 
And he said that every day this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress, would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily, calling her a monster, threatening to poison her -- distorted faces. 
And every day he would watch her, and it looked like she was talking to the people. 
And he would say, "Ruby, what are you saying?" 
And she'd say, "I'm not talking." 
And finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking. 
What are you saying?" 
And she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking; I'm praying." 
And he said, "Well, what are you praying?" 
And she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.'" At age six, this child was living a life of immersion, and her family paid a price for it. 
But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education. 
My final story is about a young, beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga, who was another Acumen Fund fellow, who hails from Uganda, a farming community. 
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya, just 200 miles away. 
And he said to me at the end of his year, "Jacqueline, it was so humbling, because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture. 
But especially when I was talking to the African women, I sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen." 
And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways, leadership is like a panicle of rice. 
Because at the height of the season, at the height of its powers, it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world, it reaches to the heavens." 
And he said, "But right before the harvest, it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came." 
We need leaders. 
We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can, ourselves, extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man, woman and child on this planet. 
And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone. 
Robert Kennedy once said that "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events." 
And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written. 
Our lives are so short, and our time on this planet is so precious, and all we have is each other. 
So may each of you live lives of immersion. 
They won't necessarily be easy lives, but in the end, it is all that will sustain us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh." 
It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives. 
And it's starting to look at -- not always and not for everything -- but in certain moments of time, access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them. 
And so it's the pursuit of better things, easily shared. 
And we come from a long tradition of sharing. 
We've shared transportation. 
We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam. 
We've also shared other sorts of entertainment -- sports arenas, public parks, concert halls, libraries, universities. 
All these things are share-platforms, but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the "mother of all share-platforms." 
And as I think about the mesh and I think about, well, what's driving it, how come it's happening now, I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. 
One is the recession -- that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value -- so starting to align the value with the true cost. 
Secondly, population growth and density into cities. 
More people, smaller spaces, less stuff. 
Climate change: we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet. 
Also, there's been this recent distrust of big brands, global big brands, in a bunch of different industries, and that's created an opening. 
Research is showing here, in the States, and in Canada and Western Europe, that most of us are much more open to local companies, or brands that maybe we haven't heard of. 
Whereas before, we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted. 
And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before -- except for if you're sitting next to someone. 
(Laughter) The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades, and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance. 
It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way. 
It's also -- Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems, and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance. 
It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways. 
And so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company, brings together these three things: our ability to connect to each other -- most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled -- allows us to find each other and find things in time and space. 
And third is that physical things are readable on a map -- so restaurants, a variety of venues, but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that, we can also track things that are moving, like a car, a taxicab, a transit system, a box that's moving through time and space. 
And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them. 
For example, I want to use Zipcar. 
How many people here have experienced car-sharing or bike-sharing? 
Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you. 
Basically Zipcar is the largest car-sharing company in the world. 
They did not invent car-sharing. 
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe. 
One of the founders went to Switzerland, saw it implemented someplace, said, "Wow, that looks really cool. 
I think we can do that in Cambridge," brought it to Cambridge and they started -- two women -- Robin Chase being the other person who started it. 
Zipcar got some really important things right. 
First, they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir. 
And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car-sharing. 
They made it sexy. They made it fresh. 
They made it aspirational. 
If you were a member of the club, when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster. 
The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars that were hollowed out or something. 
They picked these sexy cars. 
They targeted to universities. 
They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching. 
It was a very nice experience, and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked. 
And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right. 
But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company. 
They understand that they are an information company. 
Because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow -- usually as quickly as possible. 
But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service, you might use an E.V. to commute, you get a truck because you're doing a home project. 
When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan. 
And you're going to the mountains to ski, you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing. 
Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back, collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service. 
And so it's not only an option for them, but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us, to be like a concierge service. 
Because we give them so much information, and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving. 
They're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next. 
And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car? 
What percentage of the time? 
Any guesses? 
Those are really very good. 
I was imagining it was like 20 percent when I first started. 
The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent. 
And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent, 90 percent of the time, something that costs us a lot of money -- personally, and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things -- 90 percent of the time it's sitting around. 
So for this reason, I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that, if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away, there's a lot of value in those things. 
What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000. 
In the last year, 2010, two car companies started, one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar, and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S. 
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services, because the two things that really work for car-sharing is, one, the car has to be available, and two, it's within one or two blocks of where you stand. 
Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car, and it's probably also available. 
So people have created this business. 
Zipcar started a decade earlier, in 2000. 
It took them six years to get 1,000 cars in service. 
WhipCar, which started April of last year, it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service. 
So, really interesting. 
People are making anywhere between 200 and 700 dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it. 
So it's like vacation rentals for cars. 
Since I'm here -- and I hope some people in the audience are in the car business -- (Laughter) -- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things -- we saw cable-ready TVs and WiFi-ready Notebooks -- it would be really great if, any minute now, you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off. 
Because it just creates more flexibility. 
It allows us as owners to have other options. 
And I think we're going there anyway. 
The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses -- and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses, or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies, car manufacturers, who are beginning to offer their own car-share services as well as a second flanker brand, or as really a test, I think -- is to make sharing irresistible. 
We have experiences in our lives, certainly, when sharing has been irresistible. 
It's just, how do we make that recurrent and scale it? 
We know also, because we're connected in social networks, that it's easy to create delight in one little place. 
It's contagious because we're all connected to each other. 
So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels. 
The opposite, as we know, is also true, often more true. 
So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A., doing the things that gourmet food trucks do, and they've gathered quite a following. 
In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur, I look at things as platforms. 
Platforms are invitations. 
So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network, there are all these networks -- Facebook as well. 
These platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience. 
And honestly, it's full of surprises. 
Because I don't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook, for example, two years ago, when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform. 
So in this way, I think that cities are platforms, and certainly Detroit is a platform. 
The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs -- it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive. 
It's inviting participation, and cities have, historically, invited all sorts of participation. 
Now we're saying that there's other options as well. 
So, for example, city departments can open up transit data. 
Google has made available transit data API. 
And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S. 
that have provided the transit data, and different developers are building applications. 
So I was having a coffee in Portland, and half-of-a-latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in 16 minutes. 
And so it's reliable, real data that's right in my face, where I am, so I can finish the latte. 
There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now: about 21 percent of vacant commercial and industrial space. 
That space is not vital. 
The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement. 
There's this thing -- how many people here have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops? 
Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this. 
And this is a very mesh-y thing. 
Essentially, there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live. 
There's a pop-up general store every three weeks, and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies. 
Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood. 
Subsequent to that, after it's been going for about a year now, they actually started to lease and create and extend. 
An area that was edgy-artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people. 
So this is an example. 
The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts, and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London. 
But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments. 
From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do is create perishability and urgency. 
It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson: sold out. 
And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing. 
So a lot of what we see in the mesh, and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define, refine and scale. 
It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur, to go to market, to be in conversation with people, listen, refine something and go back. 
It's very cost-effective, and it's very mesh-y. 
The infrastructure enables that. 
In closing, and as we're moving towards the end, I just also want to encourage -- and I'm willing to share my failures as well, though not from the stage. 
(Laughter) I would just like to say that one of the big things, when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other, but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation, is by sharing failures. 
And one quick example is Velib, in 2007, came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition, a very big bike-sharing service. 
They made a lot of mistakes. 
They had some number of big successes. 
But they were very transparent, or they had to be, in the way that they exposed what worked and didn't work. 
And so B.C. in Barcelona and B-cycle and Boris Bikes in London -- no one has had to repeat the version 1.0 screw-ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris. 
So the opportunity when we're connected is also to share failures and successes. 
We're at the very beginning of something that, what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward, is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early. 
I have a website -- it's a directory -- and it started with about 1,200 companies, and in the last two-and-a-half months it's up to about 3,300 companies. 
And it grows on a very regular daily basis. 
But it's very much at the beginning. 
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride. 
And thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin? 
Madeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling." 
PM: Oh. 
That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen. 
MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen. 
And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein. 
I'll tell you what happened. 
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador, and it was after the Gulf War, and I was an instructed ambassador. 
And the cease-fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions, and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly, which he deserved -- he had invaded another country. 
And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things, but among them an "unparalleled serpent." 
And so I happened to have a snake pin. 
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq. 
(Laughter) And when I went out to meet the press, they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?" 
I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent." 
And then I thought, well this is fun. 
So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would, in fact, reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day. 
So that's how it all started. 
PM: So how large is the collection? 
MA: Pretty big. 
It's now traveling. 
At the moment it's in Indianapolis, but it was at the Smithsonian. 
And it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins." 
(Laughter) PM: So is this a good idea. 
I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State, and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing, how you looked -- the thing that happens to a lot of women, especially if they're the first in a position. 
So how do you feel about that -- the whole -- MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. 
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had. 
What was interesting was that, before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador, I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me, and she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes. 
Go out and look like a diplomat." 
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping. 
But still, there were all kinds of questions about -- "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?" 
And one of the things -- if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots, and she got criticized over that. 
And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it. 
PM: It is, for all of us, men and women, finding our ways of defining our roles, and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. 
How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ... 
and so how did you handle that? 
MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. 
And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years, but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes." 
So it evolved. 
(Laughter) But basically I love being a woman. 
And so what happened -- and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this -- I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N., and that's when this all started, because that is a very male organization. 
And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council -- so 14 men sat there staring at me, and I thought -- well you know how we all are. 
You want to get the feeling of the room, and "do people like me?" 
and "will I really say something intelligent?" 
And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute. 
I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard," and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal, reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country. 
And so that happened more at various times, but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman. 
I think we are a lot better at personal relationships, and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary. 
But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter, when she turned seven last year, said to her mother, my daughter, "So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State? 
Only girls are Secretary of State." 
(Laughter) (Applause) PM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so. 
PM: What a change that is. 
As you travel now all over the world, which you do frequently, how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls? 
Where are we? 
MA: I think we're slowly changing, but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different. 
And therefore it means that we have to remember that, while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women. 
And so what I have felt -- and I have looked at this from a national security issue -- when I was Secretary of State, I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a feminist, but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered, that values are passed down, the health situation is better, education is better, there is greater economic prosperity. 
So I think that it behooves us -- those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice -- that we need to help other women. 
And I really dedicated myself to that, both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State. 
PM: And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy? 
MA: From some people. 
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue. 
The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues, because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects, and because, as I said, it is really central to the way that we think about things. 
Now for instance, some of the wars that took place when I was in office, a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it. 
For instance, when I started, there were wars in the Balkans. 
The women in Bosnia were being raped. 
We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues. 
And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage was, I had just arrived at the U.N., and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N. 
Now there are 192. 
But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. 
So I said to my assistant, "Invite the other women permanent representatives." 
And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there. 
I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183. 
So the countries that had women representatives were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica, Lichtenstein and me. 
So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus. 
(Laughter) And so we set it up, and we called ourselves the G7. 
(Laughter) PM: Is that "Girl 7?" MA: Girl 7. 
And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues. 
So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal. 
And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war, that it was against humanity. 
(Applause) PM: So when you look around the world and you see that, in many cases -- certainly in the Western world -- women are evolving into more leadership positions, and even other places some barriers are being brought down, but there's still so much violence, still so many problems, and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables. 
Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't, when there was maybe you -- one voice, maybe one or two others. 
Do you believe, and can you tell us why, there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis? 
MA: Well I do think, when there are more women, that the tone of the conversation changes, and also the goals of the conversation change. 
But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. 
If you think that, you've forgotten high school. 
(Laughter) But the bottom line is that there is a way, when there are more women at the table, that there's an attempt to develop some understanding. 
So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi, we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda. 
And so I think the capability of women to put themselves -- I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy. 
I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room. 
When I was Secretary of State, there were only 13 other women foreign ministers. 
And so it was nice when one of them would show up. 
For instance, she is now the president of Finland, but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union. 
And it was really terrific. 
Because one of the things I think you'll understand. 
We went to a meeting, and the men in my delegation, when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this," and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?" 
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me. 
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control, and she said, "Well I feel we should do this." 
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. 
But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions. 
The other thing that I think is really important: A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy, but it's about budgets, military budgets, and how the debts of countries work out. 
So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts, they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries. 
PM: So how do we get this balance we're looking for, then, in the world? 
More women's voices at the table? 
More men who believe that the balance is best? 
MA: Well I think one of the things -- I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates. 
I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office, to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices. 
I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other. 
Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about, because I am of a certain age where, when I started in my career, believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me: "Why aren't you in the carpool line?" 
or "Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time?" 
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. 
In fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name. 
And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. 
And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other. 
(Applause) PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven. 
Thank you for joining us today. 
MA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat. 
(Applause) 

It's Monday morning. 
In Washington, the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office, assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen. 
At Number 10 Downing Street, David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession. 
In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door, listening to her baby crying and crying, trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it. 
And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital, trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said, "You must make him drink today," -- my father's been nil by mouth for a week -- or whether, by giving him this bottle, I might actually kill him. 
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives, and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions. 
We talk things over with our friends, we scour the Internet, we search through books. 
But still, even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends, it's still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters. 
Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity, we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own. 
And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do. 
But I believe that this is a big problem, a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society, as a culture and as individuals. 
It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world -- of course they have. 
The problem lies with us: we've become addicted to experts. 
We've become addicted to their certainty, their assuredness, their definitiveness, and in the process, we have ceded our responsibility, substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom. 
We've surrendered our power, trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. 
This is no exaggeration. 
In a recent experiment, a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak. 
The results were quite extraordinary. 
As they listened to the experts' voices, the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off. 
It literally flat-lined. 
And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice, however right or wrong. 
But experts do get things wrong. 
Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10? 
Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself, you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you? 
And then there's, of course, the example that we're all too aware of: financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the 1930s. 
For the sake of our health, our wealth and our collective security, it's imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on. 
And I'm saying this as an economist who, over the past few years, has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why, but also -- and I'm aware of the irony here -- as an expert myself, as a professor, as somebody who advises prime ministers, heads of big companies, international organizations, but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change, that we need to become more open-minded, more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view. 
So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from, let me bring you into my world, the world of experts. 
Now there are, of course, exceptions, wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions. 
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps, that within these camps, a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition, that experts move with the prevailing winds, often hero-worshipping their own gurus. 
Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on, not challenged by his peers, until after the crisis, of course. 
You see, we also learn that experts are located, are governed, by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in Victorian England, say, who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire, or the psychiatrists in the United States who, up until 1973, were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness. 
And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift, that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects, or studies funded by food companies of their new products, massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market. 
The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study. 
And we've also got to be aware that experts, of course, also make mistakes. 
They make mistakes every single day -- mistakes born out of carelessness. 
A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries, operating on the wrong side of the brain, carrying out procedures on the wrong hand, elbow, eye, foot, and also mistakes born out of thinking errors. 
A common thinking error of radiologists, for example -- when they look at CT scans -- is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. 
So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say, what happens is that, if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan, they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs. 
I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts. 
These are, of course, not the only insights I could share, but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them, why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on. 
But how can we do this? 
Well for the sake of time, I want to focus on just three strategies. 
First, we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles. 
This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D. 
in every single subject, you'll be relieved to hear. 
But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when, for example, we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand. 
Why was it that, when I had an operation, my doctor said to me, "Beware, Ms. Hertz, of hyperpyrexia," when he could have just as easily said, "Watch out for a high fever." 
You see, being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs, their equations, their forecasts, their prophecies, and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like: What are the assumptions that underpin this? 
What is the evidence upon which this is based? 
What has your investigation focused on? 
And what has it ignored? 
It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first, primarily on male animals and then, primarily on men. 
It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. 
And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. 
Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed. 
Second, we need to create the space for what I call "managed dissent." 
If we are to shift paradigms, if we are to make breakthroughs, if we are to destroy myths, we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out, in which we're bringing in new, diverse, discordant, heretical views into the discussion, fearlessly, in the knowledge that progress comes about, not only from the creation of ideas, but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that, by surrounding ourselves by divergent, discordant, heretical views. 
All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter. 
Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts, which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true. 
And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent. 
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy. 
In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room -- arms crossed, looking a bit bemused -- and draws them into the discussion, trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion, so that they have dissent within the room. 
Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement, discord and difference. 
But we need to go even further. 
We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. 
The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees, fancy titles, diplomas, best-selling books -- high-status individuals. 
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's, but also shop-girls -- yeah. 
Best Buy, the consumer electronics company, gets all its employees -- the cleaners, the shop assistants, the people in the back office, not just its forecasting team -- to place bets, yes bets, on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas, on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company, on whether a project will come in on time. 
By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company, Best Buy was able to discover, for example, that the store that it was going to open in China -- its big, grand store -- was not going to open on time. 
Because when it asked its staff, all its staff, to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not, a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening. 
It turned out that they were aware, as no one else within the company was, of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts, nor the experts on the ground in China, were even aware of. 
The strategies that I have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent, taking experts on, democratizing expertise, rebellious strategies -- are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing, complex, difficult times. 
For if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on, if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical, if we devolve authority, if we are rebellious, but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance, uncertainty and doubt, and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too, we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century. 
For now, more than ever, is not the time to be blindly following, blindly accepting, blindly trusting. 
Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes, using experts to help us figure things out, for sure -- I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limitations and, of course, also our own. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Mockingbirds are badass. 
(Laughter) They are. 
Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos -- are the emcees of the animal kingdom. 
They listen and mimic and remix what they like. 
They rock the mic outside my window every morning. 
I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring. 
I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it. 
So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds. 
I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails. 
(Laughter) Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood, say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know. 
Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito, vente a comer mi hijo!" 
Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound. 
(Laughter) Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillac with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody. 
(Laughter) I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying, "We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis." 
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is. 
I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is. 
I'll get your postman making dinner plans. 
I'll get the last time you lied. 
I'll get, "Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide." 
I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it, "Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute." 
(Laughter) I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning "It's Raining, It's Pouring." 
I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring. 
I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, "Good morning." 
I'll get everyone's good mornings. 
I don't care how you make 'em. 
Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum. 
Everybody means everybody, means everybody here. 
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage. 
I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages. 
Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for -- short explanation, hippie parents. 
(Laughter) What does a violin have to do with technology? 
Where in the world is this world heading? 
On one end, gold bars -- on the other, an entire planet. 
We are 12 billion light years from the edge. 
That's a guess. 
Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely, but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America because countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us. 
You might wanna avert your gaze, because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb, and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing. 
There's about 10 million phage per job. 
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube. 
Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings; we build strong suns. 
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes, and here we are, right in the middle. 
(Laughter) It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn. 
When all the little mockingbirds fly away, they're going to sound like the last four days. 
I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers, broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers, bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men, your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters. 
Everybody gets heard. 
Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness. 
And I'm on this. 
I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads, with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing, "Hush, little baby, don't say a word. 
Wait for the man with the mockingbird." 
(Laughter) Yeah. And then come the news crews, and the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor. 
Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide, nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip the City Council of Monterey, California off to me, and they'll offer me a key to the city. 
A gold-plated, oversized key to the city and that is all I need, 'cause if I get that, I can unlock the air. 
I'll listen for what's missing, and I'll put it there. 
Thank you, TED. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Wow. 
(Applause) Wow. 
(Applause) 

Our face is hugely important because it's the external, visual part that everybody else sees. 
Let's not forget it's a functional entity. 
We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain. 
It's where our senses are located, our special senses -- our vision, our speech, our hearing, our smell, our taste. 
And this bone is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull with cavities, the sinuses, which warm and moisten the air we breathe. 
But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone -- our head would be dead weight, we wouldn't be able to hold it erect, we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us. 
This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat. 
Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression, our universal language of expression, our social-signaling system. 
And overlying this is the skin drape, which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure -- taking right-angled bends here and there, having thin areas like the eyelids, thick areas like the cheek, different colors. 
And then we have the sensual factor of the face. 
Where do we like to kiss people? 
On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe. 
It's the face where we're attracted to with that. 
But let's not forget the hair. 
You're looking at the image on your left-hand side -- that's my son with his eyebrows present. 
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing. 
There's a definite difference. 
And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose, he'd look even odder still. 
Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. 
It's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves, and we only see ourselves in freeze-frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live. 
Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. 
They don't need this. They need psychiatric help. 
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me. 
He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic. 
In other words, he looks entirely normal. 
Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes. 
So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves, by the behavior of adults around them. 
Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose, and she's having difficulty seeing. 
As you can see, it's blocking her vision. 
She's also in danger, when she damages this, of bleeding profusely. 
Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them. 
They've grown used to their face; they think they're special. 
Actually, sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. 
And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them. 
But other adults say incredibly painful things. 
They say, "How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people. 
Shouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?" 
And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion, because -- a natural curiosity. 
And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature. 
After surgery, everything normalizes. 
The adults behave more naturally, and the children play more readily with other children. 
As teenagers -- just think back to your teenage years -- we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance. 
We're trying to struggle to find our identity. 
We crave the approval of our peers. 
So our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world. 
Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days. 
How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day, practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look, trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did, trying to raise one eyebrow? 
It's a crippling time. 
I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward. 
I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward. 
Turn to the person next to you, push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you and look at them -- they look miserable. 
That's exactly what people used to say to Sue. 
She wasn't miserable at all. 
But people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?" 
People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. 
Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school. 
So she chose to have facial surgery. 
After the facial surgery, she said, "My face now reflects my personality. 
People know now that I'm enthusiastic, that I'm a happy person." 
And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers. 
Is this change, though, a real change, or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves? 
Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery. 
And what we found was -- we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after -- what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery. 
Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them on honesty, intelligence, friendliness, violence. 
They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics -- more violent, etc. -- before the surgery. 
After the surgery, they were perceived as being more intelligent, more friendly, more honest, less violent -- and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character. 
When people get older, they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery. 
Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. 
What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma. 
So this is a photograph of Henry, two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone, his upper jaw, his eye-socket. 
He looks pretty good at this stage. 
But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations, as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly. 
I learned a huge amount from Henry. 
Henry taught me that you can carry on working. 
He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket. 
He enjoyed life to the full, and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially. 
He maintained a calm insouciance. 
I don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it. 
This was something more than that. He ignored it. 
He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it. 
And that's what these people can do. 
Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well. 
This is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on. 
It was my longest operation. 
It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon. 
We removed all the bones at the right side of his face -- his eye, his nose, the skull bones, the facial skin -- and reconstructed him with tissue from the back. 
He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse. 
He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah. 
And again, he said, "This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am." 
His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family; he had a successful, fulfilling job. 
So we've seen that we can change people's faces. 
But when we change people's faces, are we changing their identity -- for better or for worse? 
For instance, there are two different types of facial surgery. 
We can categorize it like that. 
We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery -- like Sue. 
When they have facial surgery, they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people. 
They don't feel different. 
They feel that they've actually gained what they never had, that their face now reflects their personality. 
And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery. 
Because you might say, "Well, this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic." 
If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy. 
They're trying to achieve difference in their lives. 
Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life. 
She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality. 
But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery. 
They're people who have their face shot off. 
I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you. 
They have it forced upon them. 
And again, as I told you, if they have a caring family and good work life, then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives. 
Their identity doesn't change. 
Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon? 
Muzetta's family give the lie to this. 
This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face, which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly. 
After she had surgery to remove the tumor, her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress, a pink ribbon in her hair, and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world, despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa. 
So it's not simply a Western phenomenon. 
We make judgments on people's faces all the time. 
It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces. 
He said you could see criminal faces, judging them just on the photographs that were showed. 
Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly. 
We look at O.J. -- he's a good-looking guy. 
We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly. 
Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer, and actually he's not the good guy. 
And beauty doesn't equate to goodness, and certainly doesn't equate to contentment. 
So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face, but actually, we're more comfortable with judging the moving face. 
We think we can judge people on their expressions. 
U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity -- the blink, the hesitation. 
And so they want to see live witnesses. 
Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second, we can make a judgment on somebody's face. 
Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are. 
Would we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face, our financial adviser's face was covered? 
We'd be pretty uncomfortable. 
But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement? 
The truth is that there's a five-minute rule, not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule. 
If you spend five minutes with somebody, you start looking beyond their facial appearance, and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them, and the people who you didn't immediately seek out, because you didn't find them particularly attractive, become attractive people because of their personality. 
So we've talked a lot about facial appearance. 
I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we're at and where we're going. 
This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. 
And you can see in the images afterward, we've managed to reconstruct her successfully. 
But that's not good enough. 
This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking, she wants to be out climbing mountains. 
And that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to. 
This is a horrific image, so I'm putting my hand up now. 
This is a photograph of Adi, a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery. 
And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin and his upper jaw and teeth. 
This is the bar that he set for us. 
"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before." 
So with modern technology, we used computers to make models. 
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it. 
We then bent a plate up to it. 
We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position. 
We then put bone and tissue from the back. 
Here you can see the plate holding it, and you can see the implants being put in -- so that in one operation we achieve this and this. 
So the patient's life is restored. 
That's the good news. 
However, his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before. 
It's skin from his back. 
It's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours. 
And that's where we're failing, and that's where we need the face transplant. 
The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin. 
We can replace the underlying skeletal structure, but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin. 
So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium. 
But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. 
What does that mean? 
They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy. 
This is not a life-saving transplant -- like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant -- it is a quality-of-life transplant, and as a result, are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on, "I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet. 
We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity. 
Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation, are studying that. 
Donors are going to be short on the ground, because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death? 
So there are going to be problems with face transplantation. 
So the better news is the future's almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering. 
Just imagine, I can make a biologically-degradable template. 
I can put it in place where it's meant to be. 
I can sprinkle a few cells, stem cells from the patient's own hip, a little bit of genetically engineered protein, and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown. 
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe. 
But we've still got problems. 
We've got mouth cancer to solve. 
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer. 
We're still not reconstructing them well enough. 
In the U.K. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people. 
We still can't get rid of scars. 
We need to do research. 
And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research. 
And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future, so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay. 
Let's leave it as it is." 
Thank you very much indeed. 
(Applause) 

I was only nine when my grandfather first described to me the horrors he witnessed six years earlier when human stampedes killed 39 people in our hometown of Nashik, India. 
It was during the 2003 Nashik Kumbh Mela, one of the world's largest religious gatherings. 
Every 12 years, over 30 million Hindu worshippers descend upon our city -- which is built only for 1.5 million people -- and stay for 45 days. 
The main purpose is to wash away all their sins by bathing in the river Godavari. 
And stampedes may easily happen because a high-density crowd moves at a slow pace. 
Apart from Nashik, this event happens in three other places in India, with varying frequency, and between 2001 and 2014, over 2,400 lives have been lost in stampedes at these events. 
What saddened me the most is seeing people around me resigning to the city's fate in witnessing the seemingly inevitable deaths of dozens at every Kumbh Mela. 
I sought to change this, and I thought, why can't I try to find a solution to this? 
Because I knew it is wrong. 
Having learned coding at an early age and being a maker, I considered the wild idea -- (Laughter) [Makers always find a way] I considered the wild idea of building a system that would help regulate the flow of people and use it in the next Kumbh Mela in 2015, to have fewer stampedes and, hopefully, fewer deaths. 
It seemed like a mission impossible, a dream too big, especially for a 15-year-old, yet that dream came true in 2015, when not only did we succeed in reducing the stampedes and their intensity, but we marked 2015 as the first Nashik Kumbh Mela to have zero stampedes. 
(Applause) It was the first time in recorded history that this event passed without any casualties. 
How did we do it? 
It all started when I joined an innovation workshop by MIT Media Lab in 2014 called the Kumbhathon that aimed at solving challenges faced at the grand scale of Kumbh Mela. 
Now, we figured out to solve the stampede problem, we wanted to know only three things: the number of people, the location, and the rate of the flow of people per minute. 
So we started to look for technologies that would help us get these three things. 
Can we distribute radio-frequency tokens to identify people? 
We figured out that it would be too expensive and impractical to distribute 30 million tags. 
Can you use CCTV cameras with image-processing techniques? 
Again, too expensive for that scale, along with the disadvantages of being non-portable and being completely useless in the case of rain, which is a common thing to happen in Kumbh Mela. 
Can we use cell phone tower data? 
It sounds like the perfect solution, but the funny part is, most of the people do not carry cell phones in events like Kumbh Mela. 
Also, the data wouldn't have been granular enough for us. 
So we wanted something that was real-time, low-cost, sturdy and waterproof, and it was easy to get the data for processing. 
So we built Ashioto, meaning "footstep" in Japanese, as it consists of a portable mat which has pressure sensors which can count the number of people walking on it, and sends the data over the internet to the advanced data analysis software we created. 
The possible errors, like overcounting or double-stepping, were overcome using design interventions. 
The optimum breadth of the mat was determined to be 18 inches, after we tested many different versions and observed the average stride length of a person. 
Otherwise, people might step over the sensor. 
We started with a proof of concept built in three days, made out of cardboard and aluminum foil. 
(Laughter) It worked, for real. 
We built another one with aluminum composite panels and piezoelectric plates, which are plates that generate a small pulse of electricity under pressure. 
We tested this at 30 different pilots in public, in crowded restaurants, in malls, in temples, etc., to see how people reacted. 
And people let us run these pilots because they were excited to see localites work on problems for the city. 
I was 15 and my team members were in their early 20s. 
When the sensors were colored, people would get scared and would ask us questions like, "Will I get electrocuted if I step on this?" 
(Laughter) Or, if it was very obvious that it was an electronic sensor on the ground, they would just jump over it. 
(Laughter) So we decided to design a cover for the sensor so that people don't have to worry what it is on the ground. 
So after some experimentation, we decided to use an industrial sensor, used as a safety trigger in hazardous areas as the sensor, and a black neoprene rubber sheet as the cover. 
Now, another added benefit of using black rubber was that dust naturally accumulates over the surface, eventually camouflaging it with the ground. 
We also had to make sure that the sensor is no higher than 12 millimeters. 
Otherwise, people might trip over it, which in itself would cause stampedes. 
(Laughter) We don't want that. 
(Laughter) So we were able to design a sensor which was only 10 millimeters thick. 
Now the data is sent to the server in real time, and a heat map is plotted, taking into account all the active devices on the ground. 
The authorities could be alerted if the crowd movement slowed down or if the crowd density moved beyond a desired threshold. 
We installed five of these mats in the Nashik Kumbh Mela 2015, and counted over half a million people in 18 hours, ensuring that the data was available in real time at various checkpoints, ensuring a safe flow of people. 
Now, this system, eventually, with other innovations, is what helped prevent stampedes altogether at that festival. 
The code used by Ashioto during Kumbh Mela will soon be made publicly available, free to use for anyone. 
I would be glad if someone used this code to make many more gatherings safer. 
Having succeeded at Kumbh Mela has inspired me to help others who may also suffer from stampedes. 
The design of the system makes it adaptable to pretty much any event that involves an organized gathering of people. 
And my new dream is to improve, adapt and deploy the system all over the world to prevent loss of life and ensure a safe flow of people, because every human soul is precious, whether at concerts or sporting events, the Maha Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, the Hajj in Mecca, the Shia procession to Karbala or at the Vatican City. 
So what do you all think, can we do it? 
(Audience) Yes! 
Thank you. 
(Cheers) (Applause) 

Future tech always comes with two things: promise and unintended consequences. 
And it's those consequences that I want to explore. 
And before we get to how future tech may affect us, I'd like to spend a little time exploring the unintended consequences of some of our recent tech, namely, social media. 
Social media, a few short years ago, was the tech of future you. 
Now it just is you. 
Social media was supposed to bring us together in ways we could never imagine. 
And the predictors were correct. 
These three girls are talking to one another without the awkward discomfort of eye contact. 
(Laughter) I call that advancement. 
We were supposed to be caught up in a communication tsunami, the likes of which the world has never seen. 
And that did happen. 
And so did this. 
(Sings) One of these things is not like the other. 
(Speaks) Now, look at this picture. 
If you picked the guy with the book, you’re wrong -- or, as a certain president would say, "Wrong!" 
(Laughter) Clearly, three of these guys are reading, and one guy, on the end, is listening to music and playing "Candy Crush." 
(Laughter) So are we more connected, or are we just more connected to our devices? 
Social media was supposed to place us in a veritable town square, where we could engage one another with challenging ideas and debates. 
And instead what we got were trolls. 
This is an actual tweet that I received. 
"Chuck, no one wants to hear your stupid, ill-informed political views! 
I hope you get leprosy and die. 
Love, Dad" (Laughter) Now, the great thing about that tweet if you look at it, just like most trolls, it's not that bad, because he wished "leporsy" on me instead of "leprosy," and "leporsy" is not dangerous at all. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Along with trolls, we got a brand new way of torturing teenagers -- cyberbullying. 
A concept that my 75-year-old mother just can't seem to wrap her head around. 
"So, uh, did they hit him?" 
"No, Mom, they didn't hit him." 
"Did they take his money?" 
"No, Mom, they didn't take his money." 
"Did they put his face in the toilet?" 
"No, Mom, they didn't --" "Well, what did they do?" 
"They attacked him on the internet." 
"Attacked him on the internet?" 
(Laughter) "Well, why don't you just turn off the internet?" 
(Laughter) "Your whole generation is a bunch of wussies." 
(Laughter) She's got a point. 
(Laughter) She's got a point. 
And I don't even want to talk about what social media has done to dating. 
I was on Grindr until I found out it wasn't a sandwich app. 
(Laughter) And I can't even tell you about Tinder, except for the fact that if you think there is a limit to the amount of anonymous sex we can have on this planet, you are sadly mistaken. 
(Laughter) So where do we go from here? 
Well, let's just jump right in and play the hits. 
Driverless cars. 
Something that has already been around for many years, just without the assistance of computers. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Because for years, we have been driving while texting, putting on makeup, shaving, reading -- actually reading -- that would be me. 
(Laughter) The other thing is that since driverless cars will be shared, most people won't own cars, and that means the DMV will go away. 
The DMV -- I know what you're saying right now. 
"There's no way this guy is going to stand up here and make a case for the DMV." 
Well, I don't know about you, but I do not want to live in a world where harsh fluorescent lights, endless lines, terrible forms to fill out and disaffected, soulless bureaucrats remind me that I am pretty damn lucky not to work here. 
(Laughter) That is the real service they provide. 
The DMV: come for the registration renewal, stay for the satisfaction of knowing you made some pretty good life choices. 
(Laughter) Nobody will own their car in the future, and that means teenagers will not have a place to make out. 
So you know what that means. 
That means they will order driverless cars to do just that. 
I do not want to step into a vehicle and ask the question: "Why does this car smell like awkwardness, failure and shame?" 
(Laughter) If I want to ask that question, I'll walk into my own bedroom. 
(Laughter) So what else do we have to look forward to? 
That's right, artificial intelligence. 
Artificial intelligence, yes. 
You know, there was a time when artificial intelligence was a joke. 
I mean, literally a quip that you would hear at a cocktail party when somebody would bring it up in conversation: "Artificial intelligence. 
The only real artificial intelligence is our American Congress. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha." 
Well, it's not funny anymore. 
(Laughter) Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates have all gone on record expressing grave reservations about artificial intelligence. 
That's like Jesus, Moses and Muhammad coming together and saying, "Guy, guys -- here's something we can all believe in." 
(Laughter) You might want to go with that, is all I'm saying. 
We are actually teaching machines how to think, how to understand our behavior, how to defend themselves and even practice deception. 
What could possibly go wrong? 
(Laughter) The one thing that's for sure: the creation always despises its creator. 
OK? 
The Titans rose up against the gods; Lucifer against Jehovah. 
And anybody who has a teenager has heard these words: "I hate you and you're ruining my life! 
I hate you!" 
Now just imagine that sentiment with a machine that can outthink you and is heavily armed. 
(Laughter) The result? 
Absolutely. 
(Laughter) What we need to do before we perfect artificial intelligence is perfect artificial emotions. 
That way, we can teach the robots or machines how to love us unconditionally, so that when they figure out that the only real problem on this planet is us, instead of destroying us -- which, by the way, is totally logical -- they will find us adorable -- (Laughter) like baby poop. 
(Laughter) "Oh my god, I just love the way you just destroyed the planet. 
I can't stay mad at you, you're so cute! 
You're so cute!" 
(Laughter) Can't talk about this without talking about robotics. OK? 
Remember when you thought robotics were cool? 
I remember when I thought robotics were cool, until I figured out that they were going to take everybody's place, from the delivery guy down to the heart surgeon. 
The one thing, though, that is very disappointing about robotics is the holy grail of robotics, and it hasn't even happened. 
I'm talking about the robot girlfriend, the dream of one lonely geek in a windowless basement who vowed one day: "I am going to marry my creation." 
And there actually is a movement underway to stop this from happening, for fear of exploitation. 
And I, for one, am against that movement. 
I believe we should have robot girlfriends. 
I just believe that they should come with a feminist protocol and artificial intelligence, so she can take one look at that guy and go, "I am too good for you. 
I'm leaving." 
(Laughter) (Applause) And finally, I have to talk about bioengineering, an area of science that promises to end disease before it even begins, to help us live longer, fuller, healthier lives. 
And when you couple that with implantable hardware, you are looking at the next incarnation of human evolution. 
And all of that sounds great, until you figure out where it's really going. 
One place: designer babies, where, no matter where you are on the globe or what your ethnicity, babies will end up looking like that. 
(Laughter) That boy is surprised because he just found out both his parents are black. 
(Laughter) Can you imagine him at a cocktail party in 20 years? 
"Yeah, both my parents are black. 
I mean, it's a little awkward at times, but you should see my credit rating. 
Impressive, very impressive." 
(Laughter) Now, all of this seems scary, and everybody in this room knows that it isn't. 
Technology isn't scary. 
Never has been and it never will be. 
What's scary is us and what we will do with technology. 
Will we allow it to expose our humanity, showing our true selves and reinforcing the fact that we are indeed our brother's keeper? 
Or will we allow it to reveal our deepest, darkest demons? 
The true question is not whether or not technology is scary. 
The true question is: How human are you? 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

As a child, I was raised by native Hawaiian elders -- three old women who took care of me while my parents worked. 
The year is 1963. 
We're at the ocean. 
It's twilight. 
We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides. 
It's a stretch of beach we know so well. 
The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us. 
If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes, you might dismiss them as poor and simple. 
That would be a mistake. 
These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators, trained in the old ways by their elders, and now they're passing it on to me. 
They teach me the names of the winds and the rains, of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars. 
There's a new moon on the horizon. 
Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing. 
They begin to chant. 
[Hawaiian chant] When they finish, they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them. 
They want to teach me about my destiny. 
I thought every seven-year-old went through this. 
(Laughter) "Baby girl, someday the world will be in trouble. 
People will forget their wisdom. 
It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance. 
You will go far away. 
It will sometimes be a lonely road. 
We will not be there. 
But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers, and you will recognize your ohana, your family. 
And it will take all of you. 
It will take all of you." 
These words, I hold onto all my life. 
Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me. 
The year is 2007. 
I'm on a remote island in Micronesia. 
Satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide. 
It's the home of my mentor. 
His name is Pius Mau Piailug. 
Mau is a palu, a navigator priest. 
He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world. 
There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island. 
Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments. 
They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars, the sequence and direction of waves, the flight patterns of certain birds. 
Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy. 
When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull, it appeared that an old man was going to rest. 
In fact, the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel. 
It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves. 
Mau was, in fact, gathering explicit data using his entire body. 
It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. 
Now science may dismiss this methodology, but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel. 
The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance. 
Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island, and he would look out, and then he would say, "Okay, we go." 
He saw that first glint of light -- he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now. 
Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically, are extraordinary, and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms. 
We are in such a critical moment of our collective history. 
They have been compared to astronauts -- these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double-hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island. 
Their canoes, our rockets; their sea, our space. 
The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot. 
This is part of our collective narrative. 
It's humanity's DNA. 
We cannot afford to lose it. 
The year is 2010. 
Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted, the world is in trouble. 
We live in a society bloated with data, yet starved for wisdom. 
We're connected 24/7, yet anxiety, fear, depression and loneliness is at an all-time high. 
We must course-correct. 
An African shaman said, "Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes." 
The link between the past and the future is fragile. 
This I know intimately, because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them, I struggle. 
I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains. 
Mau passed away five months ago, but his legacy and lessons live on. 
And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them, as potent as the Micronesian navigators, that are going dismissed, that this is a testament to brilliant, brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly. 
Because when an elder dies a library is burned, and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze. 
I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate. 
And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way. 
And this is what he said: "The island is the canoe; the canoe, the island." 
And what he meant was, if you are voyaging and far from home, your very survival depends on everyone aboard. 
You cannot make the voyage alone, you were never meant to. 
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. 
It always was. 
So in closing I would offer you this: The planet is our canoe, and we are the voyagers. 
True navigation begins in the human heart. 
It's the most important map of all. 
Together, may we journey well. 
(Applause) 

I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here because I'm going to say some radical things, about how we should think about cancer differently, to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do. 
But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. 
(Laughter) And that this, in fact, will be the way that we treat cancer in the future. 
In order to talk about cancer, I'm going to actually have to -- let me get the big slide here. 
First, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics. 
I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on -- and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics. 
Having explained those, that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer. 
So let me start with genomics. 
It is the hot topic. 
It is the place where we're learning the most. 
This is the great frontier. 
But it has its limitations. 
And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body, and if that were only true, it would be great, but it's not. 
It's like the parts list of your body. 
It doesn't say how things are connected, what causes what and so on. 
So if I can make an analogy, let's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant, and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder. 
So it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn't have butter, you could say, "Ah, I see what's wrong with them. 
I can make them healthy." 
And there probably are special cases of that. 
You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder. 
So the list of ingredients does tell you something, and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. 
If they have tons of salt, you might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that. 
But it's limited, because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant, you need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen, you need the product of all of those ingredients. 
So if I look at a person and I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing. 
The part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients. 
And so indeed, there are times when we can find ingredients that [are] bad. 
Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease, and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. 
But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen, because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people -- they have the same genome. 
So the genome really tells you much more about predisposition. 
So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list. 
But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person -- except in some of these special cases. 
So why all the big deal about genetics? 
Well first of all, it's because we can read it, which is fantastic. 
It is very useful in certain circumstances. 
It's also the great theoretical triumph of biology. 
It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right. 
It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on. 
And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct. 
So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing, and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing, and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. 
So this happens in physics all the time. 
You predict a black hole, and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said. 
But it rarely happens in biology. 
So this great triumph -- it's so good, there's almost a religious experience in biology. 
And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory. 
So the other reason it's been very popular is because we can measure it, it's digital. 
And in fact, thanks to Kary Mullis, you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients. 
So for instance, by measuring the genome, we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome, or how we're related to each other -- the family tree, or the tree of life. 
There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity. 
Now of course, in medical application, that is very useful because it's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history -- except probably, your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do. 
And so by reading the genome, we can find out much more about your family than you probably know. 
And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives, but they may be surprising. 
I did the 23andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald. 
(Laughter) But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that. 
But mostly what you need to know, to find out if you're sick, is not your predispositions, but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. 
So to do that, what you really need to do, you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics, and that's what proteomics is about. 
Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes, proteomics is the study of all the proteins. 
And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells -- actually, the machines that are operating -- that's where the action is. 
Basically, a human body is a conversation going on, both within the cells and between the cells, and they're telling each other to grow and to die, and when you're sick, something's gone wrong with that conversation. 
And so the trick is -- unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome. 
So the problem is that measuring -- if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process. 
It requires hundreds of steps, and it takes a long, long time. 
And it matters how much of the protein it is. 
It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent, so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA. 
And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage, they pause for just a moment, and they leave something in an enzyme for a second, and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. 
And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way. 
People have tried very hard to do this. 
I tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it. 
I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus. 
And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems, and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back, so I kept on giving him to the delay list. 
And then one day, I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus's phone call. 
(Laughter) So I was like, "Okay. This guy's at least resourceful." 
(Laughter) So we started talking, and he said, "I really need a better way to measure proteins." 
I'm like, "Looked at that. Been there. 
Not going to be easy." 
He's like, "No, no. I really need it. 
I mean, I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them. 
We have to have a window into this." 
And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it. 
And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference, if we could do it, and so I said, "Well, let's look at it." 
Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything. 
So we started playing around with this. 
And as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem -- that taking the sip of coffee -- that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics. 
And so we did that, and working with David, we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually, which makes this robotic assembly line, which, in a very consistent way, measures the protein. 
And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like. 
Basically, what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient, and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh, how slippery they are, and we arrange them in an image. 
And so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood. 
And we can take a different one tomorrow, and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different -- they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep. 
They really tell us what's going on there. 
And so this picture, which looks like a big smudge to you, is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track. 
So if I zoom into that picture, I can just show you what it means. 
We sort out the proteins -- from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting, and from top to bottom is how slippery they are. 
So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it. 
And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein. 
And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. 
And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that -- carbon comes in different isotopes, so if it has an extra neutron on it, we actually measure it as a different chemical. 
So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one. 
And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is. 
So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time, and suddenly you say, "Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was." 
But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it. 
So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns. 
So what we do with this is, for example, we can look at two patients, one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug, and ask, "What's going on differently inside of them?" 
And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences. 
So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red. 
We overlay them. This is actual data. 
And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow, but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. 
And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug, we see that in the blood, they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug. 
We might not even know what this protein is, but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease. 
So this already, I think, is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine. 
But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. 
So let me move to cancer. 
The thing about cancer -- when I got into this, I really knew nothing about it, but working with David Agus, I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out. 
And as I looked at it, to me it didn't make sense how we were approaching cancer, and in order to make sense of it, I had to learn where did this come from. 
We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease. 
We're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill. 
So this is the great paradigm. 
This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked -- was the germ theory of disease. 
So what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose -- that is, put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis -- and that works great for infectious diseases. 
So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin. 
We know that that works. 
If you've got malaria, we give you quinine or some derivative of it. 
And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do, and it's miraculous in the case of infectious disease -- how well it works. 
And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this. 
But now let's apply that to systems diseases like cancer. 
The problem is that, in cancer, there isn't something else that's inside of you. 
It's you; you're broken. 
That conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way. 
So how do we diagnose that conversation? 
Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body -- you know, where did it appear? -- and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body. 
And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer, and we treat these as if they're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong. 
And of course, it really doesn't have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system. 
And in fact, I think we're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing. 
I think this is the big mistake. 
I think cancer should not be a noun. 
We should talk about cancering as something we do, not something we have. 
And so those tumors, those are symptoms of cancer. 
And so your body is probably cancering all the time, but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control. 
And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb, imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing, and the way that we talked about it, we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say, "Oh, my house has water." 
We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?" 
"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water." 
That's kind of the level at which it is. 
"Kitchen water, well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it. 
And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen, that helps. 
Whereas living room water, it's better to do tar on the roof." 
And it sounds silly, but that's basically what we do. 
And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer, but I'm saying that's not really the problem; that's the symptom of the problem. 
What we really need to get at is the process that's going on, and that's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions, happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does? 
Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time. 
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time, but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on. 
So what we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on, and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that. 
David got me invited to give a talk at National Cancer Institute and Anna Barker was there. 
And so I gave this talk and said, "Why don't you guys do this?" 
And Anna said, "Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way. 
But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research." 
So David and I applied to this program and created a consortium at USC where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world, from Cold Spring Harbor, Stanford, Austin -- I won't even go through and name all the places -- to have a research project that will last for five years where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this. 
We're doing it in mice first, and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this, but they will die for a good cause. 
And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand, when cancer happens, what's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer. 
So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future. 
So I think eventually, once we have one of these models for people, which we'll get eventually -- I mean, our group won't get all the way there -- but eventually we'll have a very good computer model -- sort of like a global climate model for weather. 
It has lots of different information about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales. 
And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer -- and this also will be for ALS, or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases, things like that -- we will simulate specifically you, not just a generic person, but what's actually going on inside you. 
And in that simulation, what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments, and it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs. 
It might be things like, don't eat that day, or give them a little chemotherapy, maybe a little radiation. 
Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on. 
But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health. 
Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong. 
We put it in the equivalent of splints. 
And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer, and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job. 
And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future. 
It's going to require a lot of work, a lot of research. 
There will be many teams like our team that work on this. 
But I think eventually, we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer. 
So thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

(Applause) (Music) (Applause) Angella Ahn: Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you so much. 
We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen, sharing our music with you. 
What an exciting and inspiring event. 
What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan. 
We want to play you one more selection. 
It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer. 
And we talk about different ideas -- he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart. 
This was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart, beautiful music, wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world. 
It was more atonal and twelve-tone. 
And he insisted on beautiful music. 
So this is "Oblivion" by Astor Piazzolla. 
Thank you. 
(Music) (Applause) 

A room full of boys. 
A girl child, hardly nine or ten years old, she is sitting in the center of the room, surrounded by books. 
She is the only girl among boys, and is barely missing her female cousins and friends, who are inside the home instead of the school, because they are not allowed to get an education alongside boys. 
There isn't a single functional girls' school in her village. 
She was born in a Baloch conservative tribe, where women and girls are a matter of honor. 
She is the eldest in her family, and when she was about to be born, her parents wanted a baby boy. 
But they had bad luck; a baby girl arrived. 
It was customary in her family to keep girls inside the homes. 
But her uncle, who was a university graduate, he wanted to give her an opportunity to see the world, to be part of the society. 
Luckily, she has a name that can be used for both men and women. 
So he saw a chance to change her course of life. 
So he decided to raise her as a boy. 
At three months old, she went from being a baby girl, to baby boy. 
She is given a boy's getup. 
She is allowed to go outside and get an education alongside boys. 
She is free, she is confident. 
She observes, she notes small, everyday injustices faced by women and girls in her village. 
When newspapers arrive at her home, she watches as it passes from the eldest man to the youngest man. 
By the time women get hold of the paper, it is old news. 
She completes her eighth-grade year. 
Now fear starts to come in. 
This will be the end of her education, because the only option for high school for further study is five kilometers away. 
Boys have bicycles, they are free. 
But she knows her father will not allow her to travel on her own, even if she were posing as a boy. 
"I can't let you do that. 
And I don't have the time to walk you there and back. 
Sorry, it is impossible." 
She gets very upset. 
But a miracle happened. 
A long-distance relative offers to teach her ninth- and tenth-grade curricula during summer vacations. 
This is how she completed her matriculation. 
The girl whom I am talking about to you is me, Shameem, who is talking before you now. 
(Applause) Throughout centuries, people have been fighting for their identity. 
People have been loved, privileged, because of their identity, their nationality, their ethnicity. 
Again, people have been hated, denied, because of their nationality, their identity, their race, their gender, their religion. 
Identity determines your position in society, wherever you live. 
So if you ask me, I would say I hate this question of identity. 
Millions of girls in this world are being denied their basic rights because of being female. 
I would have faced the same, if I hadn't been raised as a boy. 
I was determined to continue my studies, to learn, to be free. 
After my schooling, even enrolling in college was not easy for me. 
I went on a three-day hunger strike. 
(Laughter) Then, I got permission for college. 
(Laughter) (Applause) In that way, I completed my college. 
Two years later, when the time came for me to go to university, my father turned his eyes, his attention, to my younger brothers. 
They need to be in school, secure jobs and support the family. 
And as a woman, my place was to be home. 
But, I don't give up. 
I sign up for a two-year program to become a lady health visitor. 
Then I hear about Thardeep Rural Development Program, a non-profit organization working to empower rural communities. 
I sneak away. 
I travel five hours to interview for a position. 
It is the first time I am the farthest from my home I have ever been. 
I am closest to my freedom I have ever been. 
Luckily, I got the job, but the hardest part is facing my father. 
(Laughter) Relatives are already scaring him about his daughter wandering off, teasing him with talk of his daughter crossing the border. 
When I return home, I want nothing more than just to accept the position in Thardeep. 
So that night, I packed all my things in a bag, and I walked into my father's room and told him, "Tomorrow morning, the bus is going to come in. 
If you believe in me, if you believe in me, you will wake me up and take me to the bus station. 
If you don't, I'll understand." 
Then I went to sleep. 
The next morning, my father was standing beside me to take me to the bus stop. 
(Applause) That day, I understood the importance of words. 
I understood how words affect our hearts, how words play an important role in our lives. 
I understood words are more powerful than fighting. 
At TRDP, I saw there was a Pakistan which I didn't know, a country much more complex than I had realized. 
Until that, I thought I had a difficult life. 
But here, I saw what women in other parts of Pakistan were experiencing. 
It really opened my eyes. 
Some women had 11 children but nothing to feed them. 
For getting water, they would walk three hours every day to wells. 
The nearest hospital was at least 32 kilometers away. 
So if a woman is in labor, she travels by camel to get to the hospital. 
The distance is great; she may die on her way. 
So now, this became more than just a job for me. 
I discovered my power. 
Now, as I was getting salary, I started sending back money to my home. 
Relatives and neighbors were noticing this. 
Now they started to understand the importance of education. 
By that time, some other parents started sending their daughters to school. 
Slowly, it became easier and acceptable for young women to be in college. 
Today, there isn't a single girl out of school in my village. 
(Applause) Girls are doing jobs in health sites, even in police. 
Life was good. 
But somewhere in my heart, I realized that my region, beyond my village needs further change. 
This was also the time when I joined Acumen Fellowship. 
There, I met leaders like me across the country. 
And I saw they are taking risks in their lives. 
I started to understand what leadership really means. 
So I decided to go back to my region and take a position as a teacher in a remote school, a school that I have to reach by bus -- two hours traveling, every morning and evening. 
Though it was hard, on my first day I knew I made the right decision. 
The first day I walked into the school, I saw all these little Shameems staring back at me -- (Laughter) with dreams in their eyes, the same dream of freedom which I had in my childhood. 
So the girls are eager to learn, but the school is understaffed. 
Girls sit hopeful, learn nothing, and they leave. 
I can't bear to see this happening. 
There was no turning back. 
I found my purpose. 
I enlisted a few of my friends to help me to teach. 
I'm introducing my girls to the outside world by extracurricular activities and books. 
I share with them the profiles of the world's best leaders, like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. 
Last year, a few of our students went to college. 
For me, I never stop studying. 
Today, I'm working to complete my PhD in education -- (Applause) which will allow me to gain a management position in the school system, and I will be able to make more decisions and play a pivotal role in the system. 
I believe that without educating the girls, we may not make world peace. 
We may not reduce child marriage. 
We may not reduce infant mortality rate. 
We may not reduce maternal mortality rate. 
For this, we have to continuously and collectively work together. 
At least I am playing my role, though the destination is not close. 
The road is not easy. 
But I have dreams in my eyes, and I am not going to look back now. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Ten years ago exactly, I was in Afghanistan. 
I was covering the war in Afghanistan, and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera, the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that. 
Then, two years later, I covered another war -- the war in Iraq. 
I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq. 
And the war ended with a regime change, like the one in Afghanistan. 
And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship, an authoritarian regime, that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation, within the people themselves. 
However, the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world. 
For decades, we have lived under authoritarian regimes -- in the Arab world, in the Middle East. 
These regimes created something within us during this period. 
I'm 43 years old right now. 
For the last 40 years, I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us -- old, aged, authoritarian, corrupt situations -- regimes that we have seen around us. 
And for a moment I was wondering, are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground, a change that does not come through foreign intervention, through the misery of occupation, through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes? 
The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein, but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad, they felt that their dignity had suffered. 
And this is why they revolted. 
This is why they did not accept. 
And actually other regimes, they told their citizens, "Would you like to see the situation of Iraq? 
Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing? 
Would you like to see destruction? 
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?" 
And the people thought for themselves, "Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in, instead of having the second scenario." 
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen. 
For 10 years, unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction, images of killing, of sectarian conflicts, images of violence, emerging from a magnificent piece of land, a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years. 
Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived. 
A new generation, well-educated, connected, inspired by universal values and a global understanding, has created a new reality for us. 
We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams: these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world, who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets. 
Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing. 
Just step out of your house, raise your voice and say, "We would like to see the end of the regime." 
This is what happened in Tunisia. 
Over a few days, the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies, billions of dollars in maintaining, trying to maintain, its prisons, collapsed, disappeared, because of the voices of the public. 
People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices, they tried to kill. 
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people. 
They found something called Facebook. 
They found something called Twitter. 
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues. 
And they said, "These kids are misled." 
Therefore, they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them, bring them back home. 
This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda. 
"Bring these kids home because they are misled." 
But yes, these youth who have been inspired by universal values, who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and, at the same time, realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it -- not using violence, not trying to create chaos -- these young people, they did not go home. 
Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them. 
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia. 
We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years, and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there. 
But we found that these people in the street, all of them are our reporters, feeding our newsroom with pictures, with videos and with news. 
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people -- people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority. 
And then we took that decision: We are unrolling the news. 
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people. 
We are going to spread the message. 
Yes, some of these young people are connected to the Internet, but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little, is very small, because of many problems that we are suffering from. 
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [it]. 
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world -- and internationally, globally, through our English channel. 
And then people started to feel that there's something new happening. 
And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave. 
And then Egypt started, and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave. 
And now Libya as you see it. 
And then you have Yemen. 
And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of, "How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?" 
I want to tell you something, that the Internet and connectivity has created [a] new mindset. 
But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from. 
And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change, before we thought, and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was imposed on us, and people rejected that, because they thought that it is alien to their culture. 
Always, we believed that change will spring from within, that change should be a reconciliation with culture, cultural diversity, with our faith in our tradition and in our history, but at the same time, open to universal values, connected with the world, tolerant to the outside. 
And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world. 
This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region. 
How did the elite deal with that -- the so-called political elite? 
In front of Facebook, they brought the camels in Tahrir Square. 
In front of Al Jazeera, they started creating tribalism. 
And then when they failed, they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world. 
They started telling the West, "Be aware of Al-Qaeda. 
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories. 
These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras. 
Be aware of these people who [are] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization." 
Fortunately, people right now cannot be deceived. 
Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception. 
They could not, and they cannot, imagine how they could really deal with this reality. 
They have lost. 
They have been detached from their people, from the masses, and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other. 
Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution. 
We do not create revolutions. 
However, when something of that magnitude happens, we are at the center of the coverage. 
We were banned from Egypt, and our correspondents, some of them were arrested. 
But most of our camera people and our journalists, they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily -- to report what happened in Tahrir Square. 
For 18 days, our cameras were broadcasting, live, the voices of the people in Tahrir Square. 
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square. 
He told me, "We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras. 
If you switch off the cameras tonight, there will be a genocide. 
You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square." 
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them, "Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night, because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well." 
So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world. 
We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world. 
Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran, of [the] Mosaddeq revolution. 
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West -- from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest, or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security. 
The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction. 
Let us accept the choice of the people. 
Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future. 
The future should be ruled by people themselves, even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us. 
But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world, for the West and the East, to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world, rather than the images of violence and terrorism. 
Let us support these people. 
Let us stand for them. 
And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change, and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance. 
The future has arrived, and the future is now. 
I thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you. 
Thank you for coming here. 
How would you characterize the historical significance of what's happened? 
Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade or something more? 
Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered. 
We have covered many wars. 
We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems, a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region, because we were centered at the middle of it. 
But this is a story -- it is a great story; it is beautiful. 
It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident. 
You are witnessing change in history. 
You are witnessing the birth of a new era. 
And this is what the story's all about. 
CA: There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical, or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos. 
You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now, that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly? 
WK: And people actually, after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime, the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils, they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy, but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational, not to go out of order. 
In my opinion, these people are much more wiser than, not only the political elite, even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders including political parties. 
At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes. 
(Applause) CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way. 
What should people here at TED, here in the West, do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here? 
WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world -- that people care, people care about this great transformation. 
Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us, the head of Aljazeera.net, he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world. 
Fifty percent of it is coming from America. 
Because we discovered that people care, and people would like to know -- they are receiving the stream through our Internet. 
Unfortunately in the United States, we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English. 
But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling, of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us. 
CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community, TEDxCairo, are meeting as we speak. 
They've had some speakers there. 
I believe they've heard your talk. 
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris, and the phone rang and I heard, "Hey, JR, you won the TED Prize 2011. 
You have to make a wish to save the world." 
I was lost. 
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can. 
The world is fucked up. 
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world, population is growing by millions, there's no more fish in the sea, the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said, we're all becoming fat. 
(Laughter) Except maybe French people. 
Whatever. 
So I called back and I told her, "Look, Amy, tell the TED guys I just won't show up. 
I can't do anything to save the world." 
She said, "Hey, JR, your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world." 
"Oh, all right." 
(Laughter) "That's cool." 
I mean, technology, politics, business do change the world -- not always in a good way, but they do. 
What about art? 
Could art change the world? 
I started when I was 15 years old. 
And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world. 
I was doing graffiti -- writing my name everywhere, using the city as a canvas. 
I was going in the tunnels of Paris, on the rooftops with my friends. 
Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure. 
It was like leaving our mark on society, to say, "I was here," on the top of a building. 
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway, I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies -- really small photos just that size. 
That's how, at 17 years old, I started pasting them. 
And I did my first "expo de rue," which means sidewalk gallery. 
And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising. 
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine. 
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people. 
I would control it directly with the public in the streets. 
So that's Paris. 
I would change -- depending on the places I would go -- the title of the exhibition. 
That's on the Champs-Elysees. 
I was quite proud of that one. 
Because I was just 18 and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees. 
Then when the photo left, the frame was still there. 
(Laughter) November 2005: the streets are burning. 
A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris. 
Everyone was glued to the TV, watching disturbing, frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood. 
I mean, these kids, without control, throwing Molotov cocktails, attacking the cops and the firemen, looting everything they could in the shops. 
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous, destroying their own environment. 
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? -- my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car -- a pasting I'd done a year earlier -- an illegal one -- still there. 
I mean, these were the faces of my friends. 
I know those guys. 
All of them are not angels, but they're not monsters either. 
So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television. 
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens. 
It was the only one I had at that time. 
But with that lens, you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person. 
So you can do it only with their trust. 
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet. 
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves. 
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name, age, even building number of these guys. 
A year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. 
And we go from thug images, who've been stolen and distorted by the media, who's now proudly taking over his own image. 
That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. 
So could art change the world? 
A year later, I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict. 
I mean, at that time, trust me, they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. 
So with my friend Marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. 
Are they so different? 
When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. 
So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks. 
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment. 
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel. 
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other. 
I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall. 
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. 
We called the project Face 2 Face. 
The experts said, "No way. 
The people will not accept. 
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you." 
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can." 
I love the way that people will ask me, "How big will my photo be?" 
"It will be as big as your house." 
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side. 
So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. 
And so Palestinians guys say, "Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution." 
So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. 
(Laughter) We did Face 2 Face with only six friends, two ladders, two brushes, a rented car, a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper. 
We had all sorts of help from all walks of life. 
Okay, for example, that's Palestine. 
We're in Ramallah right now. 
We're pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market. 
People come around us and start asking, "What are you doing here?" 
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job. 
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers." 
And then there was always a silence. 
"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face -- doing a face -- right here?" 
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project." 
And I would always leave that moment, and we would ask them, "So can you tell me who is who?" 
And most of them couldn't say. 
(Applause) We even pasted on Israeli military towers, and nothing happened. 
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue. 
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that, I agree -- but the people in the street, they are the curator. 
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway. 
They are not meant to stay. 
But exactly four years after, the photos, most of them are still there. 
Face 2 Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible -- and, you know what, even easy. 
We didn't push the limit; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. 
In the Middle East, I experienced my work in places without [many] museums. 
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting. 
So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums. 
When you go in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community, but the men are still the ones holding the streets. 
So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos. 
I called that project Women Are Heroes. 
When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents, I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict. 
I just observed. 
Sometimes there was no words, no sentence, just tears. 
I just took their pictures and pasted them. 
Women Are Heroes took me around the world. 
Most of the places I went to, I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media. 
So for example, in June 2008, I was watching TV in Paris, and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro -- the first favela of Brazil named Providencia. 
Three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers. 
And the army took them, and instead of bringing them to the police station, they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. 
I was shocked. 
All Brazil was shocked. 
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas, because the largest drug cartel controls it. 
So I decided to go there. 
When I arrived -- I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO. 
There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing -- no eyewitnesses. 
So we just walked around, and we met a woman, and I showed her my book. 
And she said, "You know what? 
We're hungry for culture. 
We need culture out there." 
So I went out and I started with the kids. 
I just took a few photos of the kids, and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. 
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched. 
But that's okay. 
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them. 
Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square and some women came. 
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed. 
There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend -- they all wanted to shout the story. 
After that day, everyone in the favela gave me the green light. 
I took more photos, and we started the project. 
The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, "You know what? 
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons. 
You see that enough in the media. 
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. 
I've been seeing it around me the last few days." 
So that's a really symbolic pasting, because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city. 
And that's where the three kids got arrested, and that's the grandmother of one of them. 
And on that stairs, that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire. 
Everyone there understood the project. 
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill. 
(Applause) What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. 
I mean, you should see that. 
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens, and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting. 
And they would put a number: "Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia." 
We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know. 
So how can we know about the project? 
So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them. 
So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women. 
We kept traveling. 
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya. 
In war-torn places like Monrovia, people come straight to you. 
I mean, they want to know what you're up to. 
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project? 
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?" 
Art. Just doing art. 
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white? 
Don't you have color in France?" 
(Laughter) Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?" 
Some who understood the project would explain it to others. 
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say, "You know, you've been here for a few hours trying to understand, discussing with your fellows. 
During that time, you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow. 
This is art." 
I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects. 
And then it becomes more. 
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor. 
On this bridge that's in Monrovia, ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war. 
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict. 
This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa. 
You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008. 
This time we covered the roofs of the houses, but we didn't use paper, because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house -- vinyl does. 
Then art becomes useful. 
So the people kept it. 
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there, there are so [many] houses inside. 
And I went there a few months ago -- photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye. 
So I asked the people what happened. 
"Oh, that guy just moved." 
(Laughter) When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke, "Now God can see me." 
When you look at Kibera now, they look back. 
Okay, India. 
Before I start that, just so you know, each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization, so we set up like commandos -- we're a group of friends who arrive there, and we try to paste on the walls. 
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. 
In India it was just impossible to paste. 
I heard culturally and because of the law, they would just arrest us at the first pasting. 
So we decided to paste white, white on the walls. 
So imagine white guys pasting white papers. 
So people would come to us and ask us, "Hey, what are you up to?" 
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?" 
Of course, they were confused. 
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. 
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo. 
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
So we didn't get caught this time. 
Each project -- that's a film from Women Are Heroes. 
(Music) Okay. 
For each project we do a film. 
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" -- its images, photography, taken one after the other. 
And the photos kept traveling even without us. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Hopefully, you'll see the film, and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos. 
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo. 
Behind each image is a story. 
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities, and the women kept that dynamic after we left. 
For example, we did books -- not for sale -- that all the community would get. 
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women. 
We did that in most of the places. 
We go back regularly. 
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela, we have a cultural center running there. 
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs. 
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project said, "Hey, what about my roof?" 
So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project. 
A really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors. 
So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects. 
(Applause) And that is for me one of the more important things in the work. 
I think, today, as important as the result is the way you do things. 
And that has always been a central part of the work. 
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising. 
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. 
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum. 
But yesterday the city called them and said, "Look, you're going to have to tear it down. 
Because this can be taken for advertising, and because of the law, it has to be taken down." 
But tell me, advertising for what? 
The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community. 
But they asked me for a promise basically. 
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you." 
So I did. That's Paris. 
That's Rio. 
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled. 
You understand the full scope of the project. 
That's London. 
New York. 
And today, they are with you in Long Beach. 
All right, recently I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore. 
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt, Giacomelli, other people's artwork. 
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not. 
The importance is what you do with the images, the statement it makes where it's pasted. 
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country. 
(Applause) This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally, and I pasted it in Southern Italy, where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground. 
In some ways, art can change the world. 
Art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions. 
Art can change the way we see the world. 
Art can create an analogy. 
Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables you to change the world. 
When I do my work, I have two kinds of reactions. 
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
They would be really useful." 
Or, "How can we help?" 
I presume that you belong to the second category, and that's good, because for that project, I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them. 
So now my wish is: (mock drum roll) (Laughter) I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project, and together we'll turn the world inside out. 
And this starts right now. 
Yes, everyone in the room. 
Everyone watching. 
I wanted that wish to actually start now. 
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for. 
Take the photos, the portraits, upload it -- I'll give you all the details -- and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world. 
The full data is on the website -- insideoutproject.net -- that is launching today. 
What we see changes who we are. 
When we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts. 
So I hope that, together, we'll create something that the world will remember. 
And this starts right now and depends on you. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

This is Revolution 2.0. 
No one was a hero. No one was a hero. 
Because everyone was a hero. 
Everyone has done something. 
We all use Wikipedia. 
If you think of the concept of Wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content, and at the end of the day you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world. 
From just an idea that sounded crazy, you have the largest encyclopedia in the world. 
And in the Egyptian revolution, the Revolution 2.0, everyone has contributed something, small or big. They contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions. 
It was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing. 
If you look at the scene, Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill -- going into a downhill. 
Everything was going bad. 
Everything was going wrong. 
We only ranked high when it comes to poverty, corruption, lack of freedom of speech, lack of political activism. 
Those were the achievements of our great regime. 
Yet, nothing was happening. 
And it's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated. 
In fact, people were extremely frustrated. 
But the reason why everyone was silent is what I call the psychological barrier of fear. 
Everyone was scared. 
Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians that I have to thank for being so brave -- going into protests as a couple of hundred, getting beaten up and arrested. 
But in fact, the majority were scared. 
Everyone did not want really to get in trouble. 
A dictator cannot live without the force. 
They want to make people live in fear. 
And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years, and here comes the Internet, technology, BlackBerry, SMS. 
It's helping all of us to connect. 
Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone. 
There are a lot of people who are frustrated." 
There are lots of people who are frustrated. 
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream. 
There are lots of people who care about their freedom. 
They probably have the best life in the world. 
They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas. 
They are happy. They don't have problems. 
But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian. 
A lot of us, we're not really happy when we see a video of an Egyptian man who's eating the trash while others are stealing billions of Egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country. 
The Internet has played a great role, helping these people to speak up their minds, to collaborate together, to start thinking together. 
It was an educational campaign. 
Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010. 
I still remember the photo. 
I still remember every single detail of that photo. 
The photo was horrible. 
He was tortured, brutally tortured to death. 
But then what was the answer of the regime? 
"He choked on a pile of hash" -- that was their answer: "He's a criminal. 
He's someone who escaped from all these bad things." 
But people did not relate to this. 
People did not believe this. 
Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth. 
And everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother." 
He was a middle-class guy. 
His photo was remembered by all of us. 
A page was created. 
An anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page, and there was no plan. 
"What are we going to do?" "I don't know." 
In a few days, tens of thousands of people there -- angry Egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs, "Enough. 
Get those who killed this guy. 
To just bring them to justice." 
But of course, they don't listen. 
It was an amazing story -- how everyone started feeling the ownership. 
Everyone was an owner in this page. 
People started contributing ideas. 
In fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas was, "Hey, let's have a silent stand. 
Let's get people to go in the street, face the sea, their back to the street, dressed in black, standing up silently for one hour, doing nothing and then just leaving, going back home." 
For some people, that was like, "Wow, silent stand. 
And next time it's going to be vibration." 
People were making fun of the idea. 
But actually when people went to the street -- the first time it was thousands of people in Alexandria -- it felt like -- it was amazing. It was great because it connected people from the virtual world, bringing them to the real world, sharing the same dream, the same frustration, the same anger, the same desire for freedom. 
And they were doing this thing. 
But did the regime learn anything? Not really. 
They were actually attacking them. 
They were actually abusing them, despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were -- they were not even protesting. 
And things had developed until the Tunisian revolution. 
This whole page was, again, managed by the people. 
In fact, the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas, help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing. 
People were taking shots and photos; people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt; people were suggesting ideas, they were actually voting on ideas, and then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos. 
Everything was done by the people to the people, and that's the power of the Internet. 
There was no leader. 
The leader was everyone on that page. 
The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying, inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way. 
Yes we can. We can do it. 
We have the same problems; we can just go in the streets. 
And when I saw the street on the 25th, I went back and said, "Egypt before the 25th is never going to be Egypt after the 25th. 
The revolution is happening. 
This is not the end, this is the beginning of the end." 
I was detained on the 27th night. 
Thank God I announced the locations and everything. 
But they detained me. 
And I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me. 
I was detained for 12 days, blindfolded, handcuffed. 
And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything. 
I was not allowed to speak with anyone. 
And I went out. 
The next day I was in Tahrir. 
Seriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square, I thought it was 12 years. 
I never had in my mind to see this Egyptian, the amazing Egyptian. 
The fear is no longer fear. 
It's actually strength -- it's power. 
People were so empowered. 
It was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights. 
Completely opposite. 
Extremism became tolerance. 
Who would [have] imagined before the 25th, if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them, and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them -- this is amazing. 
All the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media, are proven wrong. 
This whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman, how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream. 
When I saw that, I went back and I wrote on Facebook. 
And that was a personal belief, regardless of what's going on, regardless of the details. 
I said that, "We are going to win. 
We are going to win because we don't understand politics. 
We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games. 
We're going to win because we don't have an agenda. 
We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. 
We're going to win because we have dreams. 
We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams." 
And that's actually what happened. We won. 
And that's not because of anything, but because we believed in our dream. 
The winning here is not the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene. 
The winning is the winning of the dignity of every single Egyptian. 
Actually, I had this taxi driver telling me, "Listen, I am breathing freedom. 
I feel that I have dignity that I have lost for so many years." 
For me that's winning, regardless of all the details. 
My last word to you is a statement I believe in, which Egyptians have proven to be true, that the power of the people is much stronger than the people in power. 
Thanks a lot. 
(Applause) 

Well, this is about state budgets. 
This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning. 
But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic that we need to care about. 
State budgets are big, big money -- I'll show you the numbers -- and they get very little scrutiny. 
The understanding is very low. 
Many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are. 
And these budgets are the key for our future; they're the key for our kids. 
Most education funding -- whether it's K through 12, or the great universities or community colleges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets. 
But we have a problem. 
Here's the overall picture. 
U.S. economy is big -- 14.7 trillion. 
Now out of that pie, the government spends 36 percent. 
So this is combining the federal level, which is the largest, the state level and the local level. 
And it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on, because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries. 
But we're spending 36 percent. 
Well what are we taking in? 
Simple business question. 
Answer is 26 percent. 
Now this leaves 10 percent deficit, sort of a mind-blowing number. 
And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact that we've had an economic recession. 
Receipts go down, some spending programs go up, but most of it is not because of that. 
Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends, and that creates a huge challenge. 
In fact, this is the forecast picture. 
There are various things in here: I could say we might raise more revenue, or medical innovation will make the spending even higher. 
It is an increasingly difficult picture, even assuming the economy does quite well -- probably better than it will do. 
This is what you see at this overall level. 
Now how did we get here? 
How could you have a problem like this? 
After all, at least on paper, there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced. 
Only one state says they don't have to balance the budget. 
But what this means actually is that there's a pretense. 
There's no real, true balancing going on, and in a sense, the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges. 
When Jerry Brown was elected, this was the challenge that was put to him. 
That is, through various gimmicks and things, a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending. 
Now he's put together some thoughts: About half of that he'll cut, another half, perhaps in a very complex set of steps, taxes will be approved. 
But even so, as you go out into those future years, various pension costs, health costs go up enough, and the revenue does not go up enough. 
So you get a big squeeze. 
What were those things that allowed us to hide this? 
Well, some really nice little tricks. 
And these were somewhat noticed. 
The paper said, "It's not really balanced. 
It's got holes. 
It perpetuates deficit spending. 
It's riddled with gimmicks." 
And really when you get down to it, the guys at Enron never would have done this. 
This is so blatant, so extreme. 
Is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do? 
They borrow money. 
They're not supposed to, but they figure out a way. 
They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out. 
They sell off the assets. 
They defer the payments. 
They sell off the revenues from tobacco. 
And California's not unique. 
In fact, there's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don't face this big challenge. 
So it's systemic across the entire country. 
It really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations -- health care, where innovation makes it more expensive, early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you, and just generosity -- that these mis-accounting things allow to develop over time, that you've got a problem. 
This is the retiree health care benefits. 
Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability -- much worse than the car companies. 
And everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem. 
The forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from 26 percent of the budget to 42 percent. 
Well what's going to give? 
Well in order to accommodate that, you would have to cut education spending in half. 
It really is this young versus the old to some degree. 
If you don't change that revenue picture, if you don't solve what you're doing in health care, you're going to be deinvesting in the young. 
The great University of California university system, the great things that have gone on, won't happen. 
So far it's meant layoffs, increased class sizes. 
Within the education community there's this discussion of, "Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off, or the less good teachers who get laid off?" 
And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes, where do you do that? How much effect does that have? 
And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think, well maybe you think that's okay. 
In fact, no, education spending should not be cut. 
There's ways, if it's temporary, to minimize the impact, but it's a problem. 
It's also really a problem for where we need to go. 
Technology has a role to play. 
Well we need money to experiment with that, to get those tools in there. 
There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness, measuring them, giving them feedback, taking videos in the classroom. 
That's something I think is very, very important. 
Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay. 
In a situation where you have growth, you put the new money into this. 
Or even if you're flat, you might shift money into it. 
But with the type of cuts we're talking about, it will be far, far harder to get these incentives for excellence, or to move over to use technology in the new way. 
So what's going on? 
Where's the brain trust that's in error here? 
Well there really is no brain trust. 
(Laughter) It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up. 
Just look at this spending. 
California will spend over 100 billion, Microsoft, 38, Google, about 19. 
The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis, both inside Google and Microsoft and outside, with analysts and people of various opinions -- should they have spent on that? 
No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? -- it really is quite phenomenal. 
Everybody has an opinion. 
There's great feedback. 
And the numbers are used to make decisions. 
If you go over the education spending and the health care spending -- particularly these long-term trends -- you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity, in terms of learning. 
So what do we need to do? 
We need better tools. 
We can get some things out on the Internet. 
I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture. 
We need lots more. 
There's a few good books, one about school spending and where the money comes from -- how that's changed over time, and the challenge. 
We need better accounting. 
We need to take the fact that the current employees, the future liabilities they create, that should come out of the current budget. 
We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have. 
It should be more like private accounting. 
It's the gold standard. 
And finally, we need to really reward politicians. 
Whenever they say there's these long-term problems, we can't say, "Oh, you're the messenger with bad news? 
We just shot you." 
In fact, there are some like these: Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others, who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem. 
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off. 
In fact, the week afterwards, some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions. 
So we need these pieces. 
Now I think this is a solvable problem. 
It's a great country with lots of people. 
But we have to draw those people in, because this is about education. 
And just look at what happened with the tuitions with the University of California and project that out for another three, four, five years -- it's unaffordable. 
And that's the kind of thing -- the investment in the young -- that makes us great, allows us to contribute. 
It allows us to do the art, the biotechnology, the software and all those magic things. 
And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

There's actually a major health crisis today in terms of the shortage of organs. 
The fact is that we're living longer. 
Medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer, and the problem is, as we age, our organs tend to fail more, and so currently there are not enough organs to go around. 
In fact, in the last 10 years, the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled, while in the same time, the actual number of transplants has barely gone up. 
So this is now a public health crisis. 
So that's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine. 
It really involves many different areas. 
You can use, actually, scaffolds, biomaterials -- they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt -- but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate. 
Or we can use cells alone, either your very own cells or different stem cell populations. 
Or we can use both. 
We can use, actually, biomaterials and the cells together. 
And that's where the field is today. 
But it's actually not a new field. 
Interestingly, this is a book that was published back in 1938. 
It's titled "The Culture of Organs." 
The first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner. 
He actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels, and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today were actually designed by Alexis. 
But I want you to note his co-author: Charles Lindbergh. 
That's the same Charles Lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with Alexis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the area of the culture of organs. 
So if the field's been around for so long, why so few clinical advances? 
And that really has to do to many different challenges. 
But if I were to point to three challenges, the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time. 
And many advances now, we can do that fairly readily. 
The second challenge was cells. 
We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body. 
Over the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that. 
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells. 
Plus we have stem cells. 
But even now, 2011, there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient. 
Liver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells -- we still can't grow them even today. 
And the third challenge is vascularity, the actual supply of blood to allow those organs or tissues to survive once we regenerate them. 
So we can actually use biomaterials now. 
This is actually a biomaterial. 
We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here. 
This is actually like a cotton candy machine. 
You saw the spray going in. 
That was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure, this tubularized structure, which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so. 
And that's exactly what we did here. 
This is actually a patient who [was] presented with a deceased organ, and we then created one of these smart biomaterials, and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient's structure. 
What we did was we actually used the biomaterial as a bridge so that the cells in the organ could walk on that bridge, if you will, and help to bridge the gap to regenerate that tissue. 
And you see that patient now six months after with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue, which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope. 
We can also use cells alone. 
These are actually cells that we obtained. 
These are stem cells that we create from specific sources, and we can drive them to become heart cells, and they start beating in culture. 
So they know what to do. 
The cells genetically know what to do, and they start beating together. 
Now today, many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease. 
So that's actually now in patients. 
Or if we're going to use larger structures to replace larger structures, we can then use the patient's own cells, or some cell population, and the biomaterials, the scaffolds, together. 
So the concept here: so if you do have a deceased or injured organ, we take a very small piece of that tissue, less than half the size of a postage stamp. 
We then tease the cells apart, we grow the cells outside the body. 
We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial -- again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt -- we then shape that material, and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time -- very much like baking a layer cake, if you will. 
We then place it in an oven-like device, and we're able to create that structure and bring it out. 
This is actually a heart valve that we've engineered, and you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve and we've seeded that with cells, and then we exercise it. 
So you see the leaflets opening and closing -- of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies. 
Another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders. 
We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient -- less than half the size of a postage stamp. 
We then grow the cells outside the body, take the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells -- the patient's own cells, two different cell types. 
We then put it in this oven-like device. 
It has the same conditions as the human body -- 37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen. 
A few weeks later, you have your engineered organ that we're able to implant back into the patient. 
For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials. 
We use three-dimensional imagining analysis, but we actually created these biomaterials by hand. 
But we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells. 
We use now some type of technologies, where for solid organs, for example, like the liver, what we do is we take discard livers. 
As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used. 
So we can take these liver structures, which are not going to be used, and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away. 
Two weeks later, you have something that looks like a liver. 
You can hold it like a liver, but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver. 
And we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells, preserving the blood vessel tree. 
So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient's own blood vessel cells, and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells. 
And we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology. 
Another technology that we've used is actually that of printing. 
This is actually a desktop inkjet printer, but instead of using ink, we're using cells. 
And you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure, and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure. 
And there's a 3D elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through. 
And then finally you're able to get that structure out. 
You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it. 
And this is actually a piece of bone that I'm going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here. 
That was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques. 
Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now, our next generation of technologies, are more sophisticated printers. 
This particular printer we're designing now is actually one where we print right on the patient. 
So what you see here -- I know it sounds funny, but that's the way it works. 
Because in reality, what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound, and you have a scanner, basically like a flatbed scanner. 
That's what you see here on the right side. 
You see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves. 
This is how it actually works. 
Here's the scanner going through, scanning the wound. 
Once it's scanned, it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be. 
And now you're going to see here a demo of this actually being done in a representative wound. 
And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material. 
So once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be. 
And this is actually new technology still under development. 
We're also working on more sophisticated printers. 
Because in reality, our biggest challenge are the solid organs. 
I don't know if you realize this, but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney. 
Patients are dying every day because we don't have enough of those organs to go around. 
So this is more challenging -- large organ, vascular, a lot of blood vessel supply, a lot of cells present. 
So the strategy here is -- this is actually a CT scan, an X-ray -- and we go layer by layer, using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3D reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys. 
We then are able to actually image those, do 360 degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics, and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form. 
So we go layer by layer through the organ, analyzing each layer as we go through the organ, and we then are able to send that information, as you see here, through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient. 
This actually shows the actual printer. 
And this actually shows that printing. 
In fact, we actually have the printer right here. 
So while we've been talking today, you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage. 
That's actually the actual printer right now, and that's been printing this kidney structure that you see here. 
It takes about seven hours to print a kidney, so this is about three hours into it now. 
And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now, and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys that we printed a little bit earlier today. 
Put a pair of gloves here. 
Thank you. 
Go backwards. 
So, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is. 
You can actually see that kidney as it was printed earlier today. 
(Applause) Has a little bit of consistency to it. 
This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project, and part of our team. 
Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it. 
(Applause) So this is actually a new generation. 
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage. 
And this is actually a new technology we're working on now. 
In reality, we now have a long history of doing this. 
I'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while. 
And this is actually a very brief clip -- only about 30 seconds -- of a patient who actually received an organ. 
(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed. 
I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable. 
I couldn't go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like I was going to pass out when I got back inside. 
I felt so sick. 
I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis, and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like if I was on that. 
So after the surgery, life got a lot better for me. 
I was able to do more things. 
I was able to wrestle in high school. 
I became the captain of the team, and that was great. 
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends. 
And because they used my own cells to build this bladder, it's going to be with me. 
I've got it for life, so I'm all set. 
(Applause) Juan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work, and it's very cool when they do. 
Luke, come up please. 
(Applause) So Luke, before last night, when's the last time you saw Tony? 
LM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery -- and it's really great to see him. 
(Laughter) (Applause) JE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing. 
LM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut. 
I'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media, and basically trying to live life like a normal kid, which I always wanted growing up. 
But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working. 
I went through about 16 surgeries, and it seemed impossible to do that when I was in kidney failure when I was 10. 
And this surgery came along and basically made me who I am today and saved my life. 
(Applause) JE: And Tony's done hundreds of these? 
LM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff. 
I know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery. 
And when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was. 
I was a little kid, and I was like, "Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery." 
(Laughter) All I wanted to do was to get better, and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older and I see the amazing things that he's doing. 
JE: When you got this call out of the blue -- Tony's really shy, and it took a lot of convincing to get somebody as modest as Tony to allow us to bring Luke. 
So Luke, you go to your communications professors -- you're majoring in communications -- and you ask them for permission to come to TED, which might have a little bit to do with communications, and what was their reaction? 
LM: Most of my professors were all for it, and they said, "Bring pictures and show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you." 
There were a couple that were a little stubborn, but I had to talk to them. 
I pulled them aside. 
JE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you. 
Thank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.) JE: Thank you, Tony. 
(Applause) 

So I was born on the last day of the last year of the '70s. 
I was raised on "Free to be you and me" -- (cheering) hip-hop -- not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house. 
Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop -- and Anita Hill. 
(Cheering) My parents were radicals -- (Laughter) who became, well, grown-ups. 
My dad facetiously says, "We wanted to save the world, and instead we just got rich." 
We actually just got "middle class" in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but you get the picture. 
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy. 
At this ripe old age of 30, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible, beautiful time, and I've decided, for me, it's been a real journey and paradox. 
The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it. 
Feminism was the water I grew up in. 
When I was just a little girl, my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world. 
So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons, I was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women. 
You can see how this had an influence. 
But she was not the only feminist in the house. 
My dad actually resigned from the male-only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter. 
(Applause) He's actually here today. 
(Applause) The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet, not a businessman, but the intention was really good. 
(Laughter) In any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label, even though it was all around me, because I associated it with my mom's women's groups, her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads -- none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time. 
But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing, so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them -- never, of course, admitting that I was doing so. 
I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time. 
They were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta." 
So what very profound epiphany, you might ask, was responsible for my feminist click moment? 
Fishnet stockings. 
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them. 
I thought they were really hot. 
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label. 
Now I tell you this -- I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself, because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty, that fun do matter. 
There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness. 
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example? 
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's, but it looks very different. 
My mom says, "patriarchy." 
I say, "intersectionality." 
So race, class, gender, ability, all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman. 
Pay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue. 
But for me, so is immigration. (Applause) Thank you. 
My mom says, "Protest march." 
I say, "Online organizing." 
I co-edit, along with a collective of other super-smart, amazing women, a site called Feministing.com. 
We are the most widely read feminist publication ever, and I tell you this because I think it's really important to see that there's a continuum. 
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising. 
But we also have a straightforward political impact. 
Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart. 
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail fired from a Big Ten school. 
And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site. 
I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks." 
So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way. 
My mom says, "Gloria Steinem." 
I say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay, Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman, Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti, and on and on and on and on." 
We don't want one hero. 
We don't want one icon. 
We don't want one face. 
We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing, community organizing, changing institutions from the inside out -- all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Which brings me to the second paradox: sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once. 
Many in my generation -- because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education -- were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes -- (Laughter) who were going to go out and save the world. 
These are three words many of us were raised with. 
We walk across graduation stages, high on our overblown expectations, and when we float back down to earth, we realize we don't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway. 
The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic, and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed. 
And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair -- an environmental crisis, wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since 1928, and globally, a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity. 
Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls. 
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed. 
I experienced this firsthand myself when I graduated from Barnard College in 2002. 
I was fired up; I was ready to make a difference. 
I went out and I worked at a non-profit, I went to grad school, I phone-banked, I protested, I volunteered, and none of it seemed to matter. 
And on a particularly dark night of December of 2004, I sat down with my family, and I said that I had become very disillusioned. 
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy -- of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps. 
My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze, her eyes really welled with tears, and she looked right at me and she said, "I will not stand for your desperation." 
She said, "You are smarter, more creative and more resilient than that." 
Which brings me to my third paradox. 
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well. 
(Laughter) (Applause) There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer, and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed "between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves." 
You may have guessed by now, I did not light myself on fire. 
I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write. 
I wrote the book I needed to read. 
I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work. 
I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson, the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists, who's dedicating her life to environmental justice. 
I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do, but quickly learned, not only did she not like it, but she wasn't really good at it. 
Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films. 
So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact. 
I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, who joined the military so she could afford college. 
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co-organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network. 
What I learned from these people and others was that I couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals. 
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems -- the military, congress, the education system, etc. 
But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force. 
And at the end of the day, what could possibly be more important than that? 
Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure. 
But how good a failure is it?" 
This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams. 
It's to say we operate on two levels. 
On one, we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part. 
But on the other, we root our self-esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day more kind, more just, etc. 
So when I was a little girl, I had a couple of very strange habits. 
One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home, and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand. 
(Laughter) I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot. 
She was talking about board meetings, she was founding peace organizations, she was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity. 
And surely, at three and four years old, I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice, but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work. 
The activists I interviewed had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing, which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences. 
So often, particularly at a young age, we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life, and sometimes they're in our own kitchens, talking on the phone, making us dinner, doing all that keeps the world going around and around. 
My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory, or certainty, or security even. 
It's about embracing the paradox. 
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm. 
And it's about loving people really well. 
And at the end of the day, these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward. 
Thank you. 
(Applause)

Khan Academy is most known for its collection of videos, so before I go any further, let me show you a little bit of a montage. 
(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse is now going to be five. 
This animal's fossils are only found in this area of South America -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of Africa. 
We can integrate over the surface, and the notation usually is a capital sigma. 
National Assembly: They create the Committee of Public Safety, which sounds like a very nice committee. 
Notice, this is an aldehyde, and it's an alcohol. 
Start differentiating into effector and memory cells. 
A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy. Oh, look! There's another galaxy. 
And for dollars, is their 30 million, plus the 20 million dollars from the American manufacturer. 
If this does not blow your mind, then you have no emotion. 
(Laughter) (Applause) (Live) SK: We now have on the order of 2,200 videos, covering everything from basic arithmetic, all the way to vector calculus, and some of the stuff that you saw up there. 
We have a million students a month using the site, watching on the order of 100 to 200,000 videos a day. 
But what we're going to talk about in this is how we're going to the next level. 
But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about really just how I got started. 
And some of you all might know, about five years ago, I was an analyst at a hedge fund, and I was in Boston, and I was tutoring my cousins in New Orleans, remotely. 
And I started putting the first YouTube videos up, really just as a kind of nice-to-have, just kind of a supplement for my cousins, something that might give them a refresher or something. 
And as soon as I put those first YouTube videos up, something interesting happened. 
Actually, a bunch of interesting things happened. 
The first was the feedback from my cousins. 
They told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person. 
(Laughter) And once you get over the backhanded nature of that, there was actually something very profound there. 
They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin. 
At first it's very unintuitive, but when you think about it from their point of view, it makes a ton of sense. 
You have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin, without feeling like they're wasting my time. 
If they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago, or maybe a couple of years ago, they don't have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin. 
They can just watch those videos; if they're bored, they can go ahead. 
They can watch at their own time and pace. 
Probably the least-appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around a new concept, the very last thing you need is another human being saying, "Do you understand this?" 
And that's what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before, and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room. 
The other thing that happened is -- I put them on YouTube just -- I saw no reason to make it private, so I let other people watch it, and then people started stumbling on it, and I started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people around the world. 
These are just a few. 
This is actually from one of the original calculus videos. 
Someone wrote it on YouTube, it was a YouTube comment: "First time I smiled doing a derivative." 
(Laughter) Let's pause here. 
This person did a derivative, and then they smiled. 
(Laughter) In response to that same comment -- this is on the thread, you can go on YouTube and look at the comments -- someone else wrote: "Same thing here. 
I actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day, since I remember seeing all of this matrix text in class, and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'" (Laughter) We get a lot of feedback along those lines. 
This clearly was helping people. 
But then, as the viewership kept growing and kept growing, I started getting letters from people, and it was starting to become clear that it was more than just a nice-to-have. 
This is just an excerpt from one of those letters: "My 12 year-old son has autism, and has had a terrible time with math. 
We have tried everything, viewed everything, bought everything. 
We stumbled on your video on decimals, and it got through. 
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions. 
Again, he got it. 
He is so excited." 
And so you can imagine, here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund -- it was very strange for me to do something of social value. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But I was excited, so I kept going. 
And then a few other things started to dawn on me; that not only would it help my cousins right now, or these people who were sending letters, but that this content will never grow old, that it could help their kids or their grandkids. 
If Isaac Newton had done YouTube videos on calculus, I wouldn't have to. 
(Laughter) Assuming he was good. We don't know. 
(Laughter) The other thing that happened -- and even at this point, I said, "OK, maybe it's a good supplement. It's good for motivated students. 
It's good for maybe home-schoolers." 
But I didn't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom. 
Then I started getting letters from teachers, and the teachers would write, saying, "We've used your videos to flip the classroom. 
You've given the lectures, so now what we do --" And this could happen in every classroom in America tomorrow -- "what I do is I assign the lectures for homework, and what used to be homework, I now have the students doing in the classroom." 
And I want to pause here -- (Applause) I want to pause here, because there's a couple of interesting things. 
One, when those teachers are doing that, there's the obvious benefit -- the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did, they can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time. 
But the more interesting thing -- and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom -- by removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom, and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home, then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. 
They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience -- 30 kids with their fingers on their lips, not allowed to interact with each other. 
A teacher, no matter how good, has to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students -- blank faces, slightly antagonistic -- and now it's a human experience, now they're actually interacting with each other. 
So once the Khan Academy -- I quit my job, and we turned into a real organization -- we're a not-for-profit -- the question is, how do we take this to the next level? 
How do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion? 
And so, what I'm showing over here, these are actual exercises that I started writing for my cousins. 
The ones I started were much more primitive. 
This is a more competent version of it. 
But the paradigm here is, we'll generate as many questions as you need, until you get that concept, until you get 10 in a row. 
And the Khan Academy videos are there. 
You get hints, the actual steps for that problem, if you don't know how to do it. 
The paradigm here seems like a very simple thing: 10 in a row, you move on. 
But it's fundamentally different than what's happening in classrooms right now. 
In a traditional classroom, you have homework, lecture, homework, lecture, and then you have a snapshot exam. 
And that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent, a 90 percent or a 95 percent, the class moves on to the next topic. 
And even that 95 percent student -- what was the five percent they didn't know? 
Maybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zeroth power. 
Then you build on that in the next concept. 
That's analogous to -- imagine learning to ride a bicycle. 
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time, and I give you a bicycle for two weeks, then I come back after two weeks, and say, "Well, let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns. 
You can't quite stop. You're an 80 percent bicyclist." 
So I put a big "C" stamp on your forehead -- (Laughter) and then I say, "Here's a unicycle." 
(Laughter) But as ridiculous as that sounds, that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now. 
And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden, and start failing calculus all of the sudden, despite being smart, despite having good teachers, and it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation. 
So our model is: learn math the way you'd learn anything, like riding a bicycle. 
Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle. 
Do it as long as necessary, until you have mastery. 
The traditional model, it penalizes you for experimentation and failure, but it does not expect mastery. 
We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to fail. 
But we do expect mastery. 
This is just another one of the modules. 
This is shifting and reflecting functions. 
And they all fit together. 
We have about 90 of these right now. 
You can go to the site right now, it's all free, not trying to sell anything. 
But the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map. 
That top node right there, that's literally single-digit addition, it's like one plus one is equal to two. 
The paradigm is, once you get 10 in a row on that, it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules. 
Further down the knowledge map, we're getting into more advanced arithmetic. 
Further down, you start getting into pre-algebra and early algebra. 
Further down, you start getting into algebra one, algebra two, a little bit of precalculus. 
And the idea is, from this we can actually teach everything -- well, everything that can be taught in this type of a framework. 
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- from this knowledge map, you have logic, you have computer programming, you have grammar, you have genetics, all based off of that core of, if you know this and that, now you're ready for this next concept. 
Now that can work well for an individual learner, and I encourage you to do it with your kids, but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself. 
It'll change what happens at the dinner table. 
But what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about. 
And so what I'm showing you here, this is data from a pilot in the Los Altos school district, where they took two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes, and completely gutted their old math curriculum. 
These kids aren't using textbooks, or getting one-size-fits-all lectures. 
They're doing Khan Academy, that software, for roughly half of their math class. 
I want to be clear: we don't view this as a complete math education. 
What it does is -- this is what's happening in Los Altos -- it frees up time -- it's the blocking and tackling, making sure you know how to move through a system of equations, and it frees up time for the simulations, for the games, for the mechanics, for the robot-building, for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow. 
And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day, every kid works at their own pace -- this is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district -- and they look at this dashboard. 
Every row is a student. 
Every column is one of those concepts. 
Green means the student's already proficient. 
Blue means they're working on it -- no need to worry. 
Red means they're stuck. 
And what the teacher does is literally just say, "Let me intervene on the red kids." 
Or even better, "Let me get one of the green kids, who are already proficient in that concept, to be the first line of attack, and actually tutor their peer." 
(Applause) Now, I come from a very data-centric reality, so we don't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions: "What don't you understand? What do you understand?" and all the rest. 
So our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible -- data that, in any other field, is expected, in finance, marketing, manufacturing -- so the teachers can diagnose what's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible. 
Now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to, how long they've spent each day, what videos they've watched, when did they pause the videos, what did they stop watching, what exercises are they using, what have they focused on? 
The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on. 
The inner circle shows the videos they're focused on. 
The data gets pretty granular, so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong. 
Red is wrong, blue is right. 
The leftmost question is the first one the student attempted. 
They watched the video over there. 
It's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems. 
They also got faster -- the height is how long it took them. 
When you talk about self-paced learning, it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak, "differentiated learning" -- but it's kind of crazy, what happens when you see it in a classroom. 
Because every time we've done this, in every classroom we've done, over and over again, if you go five days into it, there's a group of kids who've raced ahead and a group who are a little bit slower. 
In a traditional model, in a snapshot assessment, you say, "These are the gifted kids, these are the slow kids. 
Maybe they should be tracked differently. 
Maybe we should put them in different classes." 
But when you let students work at their own pace -- we see it over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit extra time on one concept or the other, but once they get through that concept, they just race ahead. 
And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago, you now would think are gifted. 
And we're seeing it over and over again. 
It makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time. 
Now as valuable as something like this is in a district like Los Altos, our goal is to use technology to humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale, what's happening in education. 
And that brings up an interesting point. 
A lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios. 
In our mind, the relevant metric is: student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio. 
So in a traditional model, most of the teacher's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot. 
Maybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students and working with them. 
Now, 100 percent of their time is. 
So once again, using technology, not just flipping the classroom, you're humanizing the classroom, I'd argue, by a factor of five or 10. 
As valuable as that is in Los Altos, imagine what it does to the adult learner, who's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff they should have known before going back to college. 
Imagine what it does to a street kid in Calcutta, who has to help his family during the day, and that's the reason he or she can't go to school. 
Now they can spend two hours a day and remediate, or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don't know. 
Now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom. 
There's no reason why you can't have that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom. 
Imagine what happens if that student in Calcutta all of the sudden can tutor your son, or your son can tutor that kid in Calcutta. 
And I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom. 
And that's essentially what we're trying to build. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Bill Gates: I'll ask about two or three questions. 
(Applause continues) (Applause ends) BG: I've seen some things you're doing in the system, that have to do with motivation and feedback -- energy points, merit badges. 
Tell me what you're thinking there. 
SK: Oh yeah. No, we have an awesome team working on it. 
I have to be clear, it's not just me anymore. 
I'm still doing all the videos, but we have a rock-star team doing the software. 
We've put a bunch of game mechanics in there, where you get badges, we're going to start having leader boards by area, you get points. 
It's actually been pretty interesting. 
Just the wording of the badging, or how many points you get for doing something, we see on a system-wide basis, like tens of thousands of fifth-graders or sixth-graders going one direction or another, depending what badge you give them. 
(Laughter) BG: And the collaboration you're doing with Los Altos, how did that come about? 
SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy. 
Someone from their board came and said, "What would you do if you had carte Blanche in a classroom?" 
I said, "Well, every student would work at their own pace, on something like this, we'd give a dashboard." 
They said, "This is kind of radical. We have to think about it." 
Me and the rest of the team were like, "They're never going to want to do this." 
But literally the next day they were like, "Can you start in two weeks?" 
(Laughter) BG: So fifth-grade math is where that's going on right now? 
SK: It's two fifth-grade classes and two seventh-grade classes. 
They're doing it at the district level. 
I think what they're excited about is they can follow these kids, not only in school; on Christmas, we saw some of the kids were doing it. 
We can track everything, track them as they go through the entire district. 
Through the summers, as they go from one teacher to the next, you have this continuity of data that even at the district level, they can see. 
BG: So some of those views we saw were for the teacher to go in and track actually what's going on with those kids. 
So you're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need? 
SK: Oh yeah. Most of those were specs by the teachers. 
We made some of those for students so they could see their data, but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves. 
And they're saying, "Hey, this is nice, but --" Like that focus graph, a lot of the teachers said, "I have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic." 
So we made that focus diagram. 
So it's all been teacher-driven. It's been pretty crazy. 
BG: Is this ready for prime time? 
Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out? 
SK: Yeah, it's ready. 
We've got a million people on the site already, so we can handle a few more. 
(Laughter) No, no reason why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow. 
BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing. 
The idea there is, if I'm confused about a topic, somehow right in the user interface, I'd find people who are volunteering, maybe see their reputation, and I could schedule and connect up with those people? 
SK: Absolutely. And this is something I recommend everyone in this audience do. 
Those dashboards the teachers have, you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your kids, your nephews, your cousins, or maybe some kids at the Boys and Girls Club. 
And yeah, you can start becoming a mentor, a tutor, really immediately. 
But yeah, it's all there. 
BG: Well, it's amazing. 
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education. 
BG: Thank you. SK: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Mark Zuckerberg, a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed. 
And the journalist was asking him, "Why is this so important?" 
And Zuckerberg said, "A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa." 
And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like. 
So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine, the Internet meant something very different to me. 
It meant a connection to the world. 
It meant something that would connect us all together. 
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society. 
But there's this shift in how information is flowing online, and it's invisible. 
And if we don't pay attention to it, it could be a real problem. 
So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time -- my Facebook page. 
I'm progressive, politically -- big surprise -- but I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives. 
I like hearing what they're thinking about; I like seeing what they link to; I like learning a thing or two. 
And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed. 
And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on, and it was noticing that, actually, I was clicking more on my liberal friends' links than on my conservative friends' links. 
And without consulting me about it, it had edited them out. 
They disappeared. 
So Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible, algorithmic editing of the Web. 
Google's doing it too. 
If I search for something, and you search for something, even right now at the very same time, we may get very different search results. 
Even if you're logged out, one engineer told me, there are 57 signals that Google looks at -- everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located -- that it uses to personally tailor your query results. 
Think about it for a second: there is no standard Google anymore. 
And you know, the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see. 
You can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's. 
But a couple of weeks ago, I asked a bunch of friends to Google "Egypt" and to send me screen shots of what they got. 
So here's my friend Scott's screen shot. 
And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot. 
When you put them side-by-side, you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are. 
But when you do read the links, it's really quite remarkable. 
Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results. 
Scott's results were full of them. 
And this was the big story of the day at that time. 
That's how different these results are becoming. 
So it's not just Google and Facebook either. 
This is something that's sweeping the Web. 
There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization. 
Yahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet, is now personalized -- different people get different things. 
Huffington Post, the Washington Post, the New York Times -- all flirting with personalization in various ways. 
And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see. 
As Eric Schmidt said, "It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them." 
So I do think this is a problem. 
And I think, if you take all of these filters together, you take all these algorithms, you get what I call a filter bubble. 
And your filter bubble is your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online. 
And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are, and it depends on what you do. 
But the thing is that you don't decide what gets in. 
And more importantly, you don't actually see what gets edited out. 
So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix. 
And they were looking at the Netflix queues, and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed, which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses. 
They enter the queue, they just zip right out. 
So "Iron Man" zips right out, and "Waiting for Superman" can wait for a really long time. 
What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves. 
You know we all want to be someone who has watched "Rashomon," but right now we want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time. 
(Laughter) So the best editing gives us a bit of both. 
It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan. 
It gives us some information vegetables; it gives us some information dessert. 
And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters, these personalized filters, is that, because they're mainly looking at what you click on first, it can throw off that balance. 
And instead of a balanced information diet, you can end up surrounded by information junk food. 
What this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong. 
In a broadcast society -- this is how the founding mythology goes -- in a broadcast society, there were these gatekeepers, the editors, and they controlled the flows of information. 
And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way, and it allowed all of us to connect together, and it was awesome. 
But that's not actually what's happening right now. 
What we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones. 
And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did. 
So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us, if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see, then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance. 
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important -- this is what TED does -- other points of view. 
And the thing is, we've actually been here before as a society. 
In 1915, it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities. 
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important. 
That, in fact, you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information, that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter, and then journalistic ethics developed. 
It wasn't perfect, but it got us through the last century. 
And so now, we're kind of back in 1915 on the Web. 
And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing. 
I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google -- Larry and Sergey -- people who have helped build the Web as it is, and I'm grateful for that. 
But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life, a sense of civic responsibility. 
We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters. 
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't. 
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being. 
We need it to connect us all together. 
We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives. 
And it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Imagine if you could record your life -- everything you said, everything you did, available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips, so you could go back and find memorable moments and relive them, or sift through traces of time and discover patterns in your own life that previously had gone undiscovered. 
Well that's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago. 
This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal. 
And on this day, at this moment, we walked into the house with our first child, our beautiful baby boy. 
And we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system. 
(Video) Man: Okay. 
Deb Roy: This moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house, if you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone, and if you looked down, you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room. 
Here's our living room, the baby bedroom, kitchen, dining room and the rest of the house. 
And all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture. 
So here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening and, finally, lights out for the day. 
Over the course of three years, we recorded eight to 10 hours a day, amassing roughly a quarter-million hours of multi-track audio and video. 
So you're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made. 
(Laughter) And what this data represents for our family at a personal level, the impact has already been immense, and we're still learning its value. 
Countless moments of unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments, are captured there, and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them. 
But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project, which was to use this natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language -- that child being my son. 
And so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who was recorded in the data, we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set, trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition. 
So we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do. 
This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen, and as we move through space and through time, a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen. 
In order to convert this opaque, 90,000 hours of video into something that we could start to see, we use motion analysis to pull out, as we move through space and through time, what we call space-time worms. 
And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data, and with it, trace the pattern of, in particular, where my son moved throughout the home, so that we could focus our transcription efforts, all of the speech environment around my son -- all of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny, and over time, the words he began to produce. 
So with that technology and that data and the ability to, with machine assistance, transcribe speech, we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts. 
And with that, let me take you now for a first tour into the data. 
So you've all, I'm sure, seen time-lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time. 
I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form. 
My son, soon after his first birthday, would say "gaga" to mean water. 
And over the course of the next half-year, he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form, "water." 
So we're going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds. 
No video here, so you can focus on the sound, the acoustics, of a new kind of trajectory: gaga to water. 
(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga Gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water. 
DR: He sure nailed it, didn't he. 
(Applause) So he didn't just learn water. 
Over the course of the 24 months, the first two years that we really focused on, this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order. 
And because we have full transcripts, we've identified each of the 503 words that he learned to produce by his second birthday. 
He was an early talker. 
And so we started to analyze why. 
Why were certain words born before others? 
This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us. 
The way to interpret this apparently simple graph is, on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances. 
And the [horizontal] axis is time. 
And all of the data, we aligned based on the following idea: Every time my son would learn a word, we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word. 
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances. 
And what we found was this curious phenomena, that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum, making language as simple as possible, and then slowly ascend back up in complexity. 
And the amazing thing was that bounce, that dip, lined up almost precisely with when each word was born -- word after word, systematically. 
So it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself, my wife and our nanny -- were systematically and, I would think, subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language. 
And the implications of this -- there are many, but one I just want to point out, is that there must be amazing feedback loops. 
Of course, my son is learning from his linguistic environment, but the environment is learning from him. 
That environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now. 
But that's looking at the speech context. 
What about the visual context? 
We're not looking at -- think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house. 
We've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras, and we've done some optical correction, and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life. 
So welcome to my home. 
This is a moment, one moment captured across multiple cameras. 
The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine, where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe video-life into this system. 
What I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes, again, of just life in the living room. 
That's me and my son on the floor. 
And there's video analytics that are tracking our movements. 
My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink. 
We're now on the couch, looking out through the window at cars passing by. 
And finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself. 
Now we freeze the action, 30 minutes, we turn time into the vertical axis, and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we've just left behind. 
And we see these amazing structures -- these little knots of two colors of thread we call "social hot spots." 
The spiral thread we call a "solo hot spot." 
And we think that these affect the way language is learned. 
What we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned -- so in other words, the relationship between words and what they're about in the world. 
So here's how we're approaching this. 
In this video, again, my son is being traced out. 
He's leaving red ink behind. 
And there's our nanny by the door. 
(Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.) Nanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.) DR: She offers water, and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water. 
And what we've done is use the word "water" to tag that moment, that bit of activity. 
And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in, and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co-occurred with an instance of water. 
And what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape. 
We call these wordscapes. 
This is the wordscape for the word water, and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen. 
That's where those big peaks are over to the left. 
And just for contrast, we can do this with any word. 
We can take the word "bye" as in "good bye." 
And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house. 
And we look, and we find, as you would expect, a contrast in the landscape where the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way. 
So we're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition, and that's ongoing work now. 
In my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT -- this is at the media lab. 
This has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space. 
Three of the key people in this project, Philip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here. 
Philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you're seeing. 
And Michael Fleischman was another Ph.D. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis, and he made the following observation: that "just the way that we're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language, that same idea we can take out of your home, Deb, and we can apply it to the world of public media." 
And so our effort took an unexpected turn. 
Think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place. 
We've started analyzing television content using the same principles -- analyzing event structure of a TV signal -- episodes of shows, commercials, all of the components that make up the event structure. 
And we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States. 
And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people's conversations, you just tune into publicly available social media feeds. 
So we're pulling in about three billion comments a month, and then the magic happens. 
You have the event structure, the common ground that the words are about, coming out of the television feeds; you've got the conversations that are about those topics; and through semantic analysis -- and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data processing -- each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal. 
And the same idea now can be built up. 
And we get this wordscape, except now words are not assembled in my living room. 
Instead, the context, the common ground activities, are the content on television that's driving the conversations. 
And what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now, are commentary that are linked to content on television. 
Same concept, but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere. 
And so fundamentally, rather than, for example, measuring content based on how many people are watching, this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content. 
And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family, we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people. 
This is a subset of data from our database -- just 50,000 out of several million -- and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources. 
And if you put them on one plain, a second plain is where the content lives. 
So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials, and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph. 
And then the important third dimension. 
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content. 
And there are, again, now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content. 
And we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways. 
So if we, for example, trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it, and then we follow where that comment goes, and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content, a very interesting structure becomes visible. 
We call this a co-viewing clique, a virtual living room if you will. 
And there are fascinating dynamics at play. 
It's not one way. 
A piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk. 
They talk to other people. 
That drives tune-in behavior back into mass media, and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior. 
Another example -- very different -- another actual person in our database -- and we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these. 
We've given this person a name. 
This is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic who has this high fan-out rate. 
So a lot of people are following this person -- very influential -- and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV. 
So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together. 
One last example from this data: Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special. 
So if we go and look at this piece of content, President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago, and look at what we find in this same data set, at the same scale, the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable. 
A nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on the broadcast. 
And of course, through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language. 
We can X-ray and get a real-time pulse of a nation, real-time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content. 
So, to summarize, the idea is this: As our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they're saying it in, what's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen. 
It's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication. 
And I think the implications here are profound, whether it's for science, for commerce, for government, or perhaps most of all, for us as individuals. 
And so just to return to my son, when I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder, and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today, and I asked him for permission -- granted. 
And then I went on to reflect, "Isn't it amazing, this entire database, all these recordings, I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" -- who arrived two years later -- "and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never, with your biological memory, possibly remember the way you can now?" 
And he was quiet for a moment. 
And I thought, "What am I thinking? 
He's five years old. He's not going to understand this." 
And just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said, "So that when I grow up, I can show this to my kids?" 
And I thought, "Wow, this is powerful stuff." 
So I want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family. 
This is the first time our son took more than two steps at once -- captured on film. 
And I really want you to focus on something as I take you through. 
It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life. 
My mother's in the kitchen, cooking, and, of all places, in the hallway, I realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps. 
And so you hear me encouraging him, realizing what's happening, and then the magic happens. 
Listen very carefully. 
About three steps in, he realizes something magic is happening, and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in, and he takes a breath in, and he whispers "wow" and instinctively I echo back the same. 
And so let's fly back in time to that memorable moment. 
(Video) DR: Hey. 
Come here. 
Can you do it? 
Oh, boy. 
Can you do it? 
Baby: Yeah. 
DR: Ma, he's walking. 
(Laughter) (Applause) DR: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

This is a river. 
This is a stream. 
This is a river. 
This is happening all over the country. 
There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States. 
On this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts. 
Similar problems are emerging in the East as well. 
The reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details. 
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone. 
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife. 
They're the veins of the ecosystem, and they're often empty veins. 
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams, because it's an archetype for the larger story. 
This is Prickly Pear Creek. 
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena. 
It supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout. 
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years ... 
it looked like this in the summer. 
How did we get here? 
Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana. 
In short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people. 
But as more people showed up wanting water, the folks who were there first got a little concerned, and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law. 
It basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream. 
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream, and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers. 
There were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872, both involving Prickly Pear Creek. 
And in 1921, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first, or "senior water rights." 
These senior water rights are key. 
The problem is that all over the West now it looks like this. 
Some of these creeks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream. 
And the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right, they risk losing their water right -- along with the economic value that goes with it. 
So they have no incentive to conserve. 
So it's not just about the number of people; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it. 
So after decades of lawsuits and 140 years, now, of experience, we still have this. 
It's a broken system. 
There's a disincentive to conserve, because if you don't use your water right, you can lose your water right. 
And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities. 
OK, now I'm going to change gears here. 
Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free ... 
(Laughter) and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer. 
(Laughter) There's another thing happening around the country, which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint. 
They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water, they're trying to be really efficient with their water use, and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand. 
Well, it's a national problem, but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana ... 
and it involves beer. 
I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer. 
If you include all the drain, it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer. 
Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption, but they still use millions of gallons of water. 
I mean, there's water in beer. 
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem? 
These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers. 
After all, there's a strong correlation between water and fishing, and for some, there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer. 
(Laughter) So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned and they're looking for some way to address the problem. 
So how can they address this remaining water footprint? 
Remember Prickly Pear. 
Up until now, business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing, and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore. 
Remember Prickly Pear. 
It's a broken system. 
You've got a disincentive to conserve, because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right. 
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks. 
In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in the stream while legally protecting it from others, and maintaining their water right. 
After all, it is their water right, and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream, it's their right to do so. 
But they have no incentive to do so. 
So, working with local water trusts, we created an incentive to do so. 
We pay them to leave their water in stream. 
That's what's happening here. 
This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion, leaving the water in the stream. 
He doesn't lose the water right, he just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it, to the stream, instead of to the land. 
Because he's the senior water-rights holder, he can protect the water from other users in the stream. 
OK? 
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream. 
This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream. 
We then take the measured water, we divide it into thousand-gallon increments. 
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate, and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems. 
The brewers pay to restore water to the stream. 
It provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems, while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them. 
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams, a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved, we put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution -- a solution that does not require litigation. 
It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed, into these degraded ecosystems, while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used. 
These transactions create allies, not enemies. 
They connect people rather than dividing them. 
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities. 
And most importantly, it's working. 
We've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems. 
We've connected senior water-rights holders with brewers in Montana, with hotels and tea companies in Oregon, and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest. 
And when we make these connections, we can and we do turn this ... 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

When I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice, which was to interview three politicians every day. 
And from that much contact with politicians, I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another. 
They have what I called "logorrhea dementia," which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. 
(Laughter) But what they do have is incredible social skills. 
When you meet them, they lock into you, they look you in the eye, they invade your personal space, they massage the back of your head. 
I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal -- squeezing it. 
I once -- this was years ago -- I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate. 
And they were friends, and they hugged each other and they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart. 
And they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other. 
And I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this." 
But they have those social skills. 
Another case: Last election cycle, I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire, and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons: Bip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip. 
(Laughter) And he's going into a diner. 
And he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family and says, "What village are you from in New Hampshire?" 
And then he describes the home he owned in their village. 
And so he goes around the room, and then as he's leaving the diner, he first-names almost everybody he's just met. 
I was like, "Okay, that's social skill." 
But the paradox is, when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode, that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants. 
So in the course of my career, I have covered a series of failures. 
We sent economists in the Soviet Union with privatization plans when it broke up, and what they really lacked was social trust. 
We invaded Iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities. 
We had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn't do anything stupid. 
For 30 years, I've been covering school reform and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes -- charters, private schools, vouchers -- but we've had disappointing results year after year. 
And the fact is, people learn from people they love. 
And if you're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student, you're not talking about that reality. 
But that reality is expunged from our policy-making process. 
And so that's led to a question for me: Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy? 
And I came to the conclusion, this is a symptom of a larger problem. 
That, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that we're divided selves, that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions. 
And it's led to a view of human nature that we're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives, and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is. 
And it's produced a great amputation, a shallow view of human nature. 
We're really good at talking about material things, but we're really bad at talking about emotions. 
We're really good at talking about skills and safety and health; we're really bad at talking about character. 
Alasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher, said that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue, honor, goodness, but we no longer have a system by which to connect them." 
And so this has led to a shallow path in politics, but also in a whole range of human endeavors. 
You can see it in the way we raise our young kids. 
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out, and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks. 
If the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground. 
You see these cars that drive up -- usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos, because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car, so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy -- that's fine. 
They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms, who are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard. 
And you can usually tell the uber-moms because they actually weigh less than their own children. 
(Laughter) So at the moment of conception, they're doing little butt exercises. 
Babies flop out, they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things. 
Driving them home, and they want them to be enlightened, so they take them to Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream company with its own foreign policy. 
In one of my books, I joke that Ben &amp; Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste -- doesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave. 
It would be a big seller. 
(Laughter) And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula, and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International. 
(Laughter) They buy these seaweed-based snacks there called Veggie Booty with Kale, which is for kids who come home and say, "Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer." 
(Laughter) And so the kids are raised in a certain way, jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure -- SAT prep, oboe, soccer practice. 
They get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs, and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money. 
And sometimes you can see them at vacation places like Jackson Hole or Aspen. 
And they've become elegant and slender -- they don't really have thighs; they just have one elegant calve on top of another. 
(Laughter) They have kids of their own, and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people, so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein, their daughters looks like Halle Berry -- I don't know how they've done that. 
They get there and they realize it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights. 
So they've got these furry 160-pound dogs -- all look like velociraptors, all named after Jane Austen characters. 
And then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life, but they've decided, "I've been successful at everything; I'm just not going to die." 
And so they hire personal trainers; they're popping Cialis like breath mints. 
You see them on the mountains up there. 
They're cross-country skiing up the mountain with these grim expressions that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis. 
(Laughter) And as they whiz by you, it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet going up the hill. 
(Laughter) And so this is part of what life is, but it's not all of what life is. 
And over the past few years, I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are. 
And it's not based on theology or philosophy, it's in the study of the mind, across all these spheres of research, from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists, behavioral economists, psychologists, sociology, we're developing a revolution in consciousness. 
And when you synthesize it all, it's giving us a new view of human nature. 
And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature, it's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment. 
And I think when you synthesize this research, you start with three key insights. 
The first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species, the unconscious mind does most of the work. 
And so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute, of which it can be consciously aware of about 40. 
And this leads to oddities. 
One of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists, people named Lawrence become lawyers, because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar, which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks. 
(Laughter) Another finding is that the unconscious, far from being dumb and sexualized, is actually quite smart. 
So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture. 
It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house. 
And the way you should do that is study the furniture, let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself, and then a few days later, go with your gut, because unconsciously you've figured it out. 
The second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking. 
People with strokes and lesions in the emotion-processing parts of the brain are not super smart, they're actually sometimes quite helpless. 
And the "giant" in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning -- Antonio Damasio. 
And one of the things he's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason, but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to value. 
And so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom. 
Now I'm a middle-aged guy. 
I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions. 
One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys. 
They put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care -- and they had them watch a horror movie, and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives. 
And the brain scans were identical in both activities. 
It was just sheer terror. 
So me talking about emotion is like Gandhi talking about gluttony, but it is the central organizing process of the way we think. 
It tells us what to imprint. 
The brain is the record of the feelings of a life. 
And the third insight is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals. 
We're social animals, not rational animals. 
We emerge out of relationships, and we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another. 
And so when we see another person, we reenact in our own minds what we see in their minds. 
When we watch a car chase in a movie, it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase. 
When we watch pornography, it's a little like having sex, though probably not as good. 
And we see this when lovers walk down the street, when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion, the deep interpenetration. 
And this revolution in who we are gives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics, a different way, most importantly, of seeing human capital. 
We are now children of the French Enlightenment. 
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties. 
But I think this research shows that the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment, with David Hume, Adam Smith, actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong, and our sentiments are often trustworthy. 
And this work corrects that bias in our culture, that dehumanizing bias. 
It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life. 
When we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily -- things like grades, SAT's, degrees, the number of years in schooling. 
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life, are things that are deeper, things we don't really even have words for. 
And so let me list just a couple of the things I think this research points us toward trying to understand. 
The first gift, or talent, is mindsight -- the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer. 
Babies come with this ability. 
Meltzoff, who's at the University of Washington, leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old. 
He wagged his tongue at the baby. 
The baby wagged her tongue back. 
Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind and to download what they find -- their models of how to understand reality. 
In the United States, 55 percent of babies have a deep two-way conversation with Mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people. 
And those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life. 
Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study in which they could predict with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months, who was going to graduate from high school, based on who had good attachment with mom. 
Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships. 
They are what we call avoidantly attached. 
They have trouble relating to other people. 
They go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind -- wanting to get close to people, but not really having the models of how to do that. 
And so this is one skill of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another. 
A second skill is equipoise, the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind. 
So for example, we are overconfidence machines. 
Ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers. 
Ninety-six percent of college students say they have above-average social skills. 
Time magazine asked Americans, "Are you in the top one percent of earners?" 
Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners. 
(Laughter) This is a gender-linked trait, by the way. 
Men drown at twice the rate of women, because men think they can swim across that lake. 
But some people have the ability and awareness of their own biases, their own overconfidence. 
They have epistemological modesty. 
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity. 
They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence. 
They are curious. 
And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ. 
The third trait is metis, what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word. 
It's a sensitivity to the physical environment, the ability to pick out patterns in an environment -- derive a gist. 
One of my colleagues at the Times did a great story about soldiers in Iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street. 
They couldn't tell you how they did it, but they could feel cold, they felt a coldness, and they were more often right than wrong. 
The third is what you might call sympathy, the ability to work within groups. 
And that comes in tremendously handy, because groups are smarter than individuals. 
And face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically, because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal. 
And the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group; it's determined by how well they communicate, how often they take turns in conversation. 
Then you could talk about a trait like blending. 
Any child can say, "I'm a tiger," pretend to be a tiger. 
It seems so elementary. 
But in fact, it's phenomenally complicated to take a concept "I" and a concept "tiger" and blend them together. 
But this is the source of innovation. 
What Picasso did, for example, was take the concept "Western art" and the concept "African masks" and blend them together -- not only the geometry, but the moral systems entailed in them. 
And these are skills, again, we can't count and measure. 
And then the final thing I'll mention is something you might call limerence. 
And this is not an ability; it's a drive and a motivation. 
The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige. 
The unconscious mind hungers for those moments of transcendence, when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task -- when a craftsman feels lost in his craft, when a naturalist feels at one with nature, when a believer feels at one with God's love. 
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for. 
And many of us feel it in love when lovers feel fused. 
And one of the most beautiful descriptions I've come across in this research of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana. 
He was married to a woman named Carol, and they had a wonderful relationship. 
When their kids were five and two, Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly. 
And Hofstadter wrote a book called "I Am a Strange Loop." 
In the course of that book, he describes a moment -- just months after Carol has died -- he comes across her picture on the mantel, or on a bureau in his bedroom. 
And here's what he wrote: "I looked at her face, and I looked so deeply that I felt I was behind her eyes. 
And all at once I found myself saying as tears flowed, 'That's me. That's me.' And those simple words brought back many thoughts that I had had before, about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity, about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children, about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes, but were just one hope, one clear thing that defined us both, that welded us into a unit -- the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined before being married and having children. 
I realized that, though Carol had died, that core piece of her had not died at all, but had lived on very determinedly in my brain." 
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom. 
Through his suffering, Hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are. 
Through the policy failures of the last 30 years, we have come to acknowledge, I think, how shallow our view of human nature has been. 
And now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are, comes this revolution in consciousness -- these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted, this new humanism. 
And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious, it had a vast effect on the climate of the times. 
Now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious, of who we are deep inside, and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light. 
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes. 
The Sun burns our peripheral vision. 
We see light reflected off the Moon. 
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history. 
And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang. 
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent. 
I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum. 
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold. 
Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition. 
And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there. 
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like. 
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky. 
We can't see them directly. 
They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly. 
We can see them indirectly, because black holes wreak havoc on their environment. 
They destroy stars around them. 
They churn up debris in their surroundings. 
But they won't come to us directly through light. 
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet. 
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum. 
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much. 
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it. 
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe. 
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space. 
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity. 
Now even light will be bent by those paths. 
And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth. 
These are the natural curves in space. 
What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe. 
It wasn't Einstein who realized this, it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I -- joined the German army already an accomplished scientist, working on the Russian front. 
I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire, and then, in between, calculating Einstein's equations -- as you do in the trenches. 
And he was reading Einstein's recently published general theory of relativity, and he was thrilled by this theory. 
And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary: curves so strong that space would rain down into them, space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole. 
And even light could not escape this current. 
Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be, and all that would be left would be a shadow. 
Now he wrote to Einstein, and he said, "As you will see, the war has been kind to me enough. 
Despite the heavy gunfire, I've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas." 
And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution, and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist. 
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions. 
And he took Schwarzschild's idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week. 
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity. 
He did not believe they existed in nature. 
He thought nature would protect us from their formation. 
It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime. 
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole. 
It's actually not massive enough. 
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun. 
And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated. 
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole. 
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less. 
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth. 
But basically that's what we're talking about. 
We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan. 
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole. 
There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in. 
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth. 
It cannot hide behind the black hole. 
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us. 
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole. 
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole. 
They can see you. 
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy. 
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like. 
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes. 
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened. 
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape. 
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us. 
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole. 
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience. 
(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel. 
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen. 
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together. 
Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun. 
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across. 
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second. 
At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light. 
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time. 
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe. 
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light. 
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard. 
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem. 
This was one of the groups. 
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves. 
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves. 
They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day. 
If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space. 
You would literally hear the sound. 
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on. 
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict. 
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling. 
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole. 
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close. 
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet. 
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum. 
And we can predict what the sound will be. 
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder. 
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy. 
(Thumping) Then it's gone. 
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic. 
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic. 
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding. 
This is another sound from my group. 
No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves. 
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving. 
(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound. 
Both black holes are moving. 
Both black holes are getting closer together. 
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot. 
And then they're going to merge. 
(Thumping) Now it's gone. 
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end. 
Now that's our prediction for what we'll see. 
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California. 
And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged. 
And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us. 
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear. 
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers. 
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up. 
There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA. 
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun. 
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies. 
They look like they're frozen in some embrace. 
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core. 
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging. 
These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale. 
It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration. 
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together. 
And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang. 
When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?" 
But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang. 
It might make a sound. 
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside. 
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe. 
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang. 
It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically. 
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us. 
Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet. 
And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes. 
Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided. 
That song has been ringing through space for all that time. 
We weren't even here. 
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings. 
It's like hurry, build your instruments. 
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ... 
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space. 
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this. 
(Static) It's a terrible sound. 
It's literally the definition of noise. 
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing. 
But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe. 
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe. 
So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio. 
But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions. 
If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang? 
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before? 
Will it happen again? 
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever. 
But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history? 
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us? 
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures? 
Here's my multiverse creatures. 
Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins? 
And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood. 
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. 
Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. 
I remember my first fire. 
I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in. 
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be. 
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life. 
Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames. 
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let's call him Lex Luther -- (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. 
The dog! I was stunned with jealousy. 
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds. 
Well, I was next. 
The captain waved me over. 
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house. 
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes." 
(Laughter) I swear. 
So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went -- up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. 
Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero. 
(Laughter) I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door. 
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner, where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than did mine. 
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home. 
The act of kindness she noted above all others: someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. 
(Laughter) In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis. 
And you know what I've learned? 
They all matter. 
So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved, or are on their way to achieving, remarkable levels of success, I would offer this reminder: don't wait. 
Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life. 
If you have something to give, give it now. 
Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. 
Be a mentor. 
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. 
So get in the game. Save the shoes. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back. 
(Applause) Mark Bezos: Thank you. 

One winter morning, a couple of years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a haze hanging over the city. 
I make that drive on most days, so it was unusual that I hadn't noticed this before. 
Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, which I could barely see that morning. 
It didn't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud of air pollution. 
The contrast between the scenic environment I knew and this smog-covered skyline stirred up something within me. 
I was appalled by the possibility of this city of bright and vivid sunsets being overrun by a dull haze. 
At that moment, I felt an urge to do something about it, but I didn't know what. 
All I knew was I couldn't just stand idly by. 
The main challenge was, I didn't know much about environmental science air-quality management or atmospheric chemistry. 
I am a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't code my way out of this air pollution problem. 
(Laughter) Who was I to do anything about this issue? 
I was but a citizen. 
In the following years, I learned a very important lesson, a lesson we all need to take to heart if we are to work towards a better future. 
Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain, your outside expertise may hold the key to solving big problems within that domain. 
Sometimes the unique perspective you have can result in unconventional thinking that can move the needle, but you need to be bold enough to try. 
That's the only way you'll ever know. 
What I knew back then was that if I was even going to try to make a difference, I had to get smart about air pollution first, and so I became a student again. 
I did a bit of basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk. 
Data from the World Health Organization shows that almost 14 percent of all deaths worldwide in 2012 were attributable to household and ambient air pollution, with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries. 
Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria and HIV/AIDS. 
In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation or childhood malnutrition pale in comparison to deaths due to air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
Now, in my work, I explore new frontiers for artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine can find a beneficial footing and help us to make better decisions. 
As I thought about the air pollution problem, it became clear that we needed to find a way to make better decisions about how we manage air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it was necessary to do it in a collaborative way. 
So I decided I'd better get to know some people working within the field. 
I started to speak to officials from the City of Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I engaged the local scientific community, and I also made a few cold calls. 
The process of engagement I embarked upon helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the problem. 
It also helped me to avoid the trap people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate, where we are quick to apply a technology before we've firmly grasped the problem at hand. 
I began to develop an idea about what I could do to improve the situation. 
I started by simply asking myself how I could bring together in some meaningful way my skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the expertise of the people I'd reached out to. 
I wanted to create an online air-quality management platform that would uncover trends in pollution and project into the future to determine what outcomes can be expected. 
I was determined to see my idea translate into a practical solution, but I faced uncertainty and had no guarantee of success. 
What I had was a very particular set of engineering skills, skills I'd acquired over my career (Laughter) that were new to people who had been working on the air pollution problem for so many years. 
What I have come to realize is that sometimes just one fresh perspective, one new skill set, can make the conditions right for something remarkable to happen. 
Our willpower and imagination are a guiding light, enabling us to chart new paths and navigate through obstacles. 
Armed with a firmer understanding of the air pollution problem, and having managed to source over a decade's worth of data on air pollutant levels and the meteorological conditions for in and around Johannesburg, my colleagues from South Africa and China and myself created an air-quality decision support system that lives in the cloud. 
This software system analyzes historical and real-time data to uncover the spatial-temporal trends in pollution. 
We then used new machine learning technology to predict future levels of pollution for several different pollutants days in advance. 
This means that citizens can make better decisions about their daily movements and about where to settle their families. 
We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time, identify heavy polluters, and they can be ordered by the relevant authorities to scale back their operations. 
Through assisted scenario planning, city planners can also make better decisions about how to extend infrastructure, such as human settlements or industrial zones. 
We completed a pilot of our technology that was run over a period of 120 days, covering all of South Africa. 
Our results were confirmed when we demonstrated a tight correlation between the forecasting data and the data we were getting on the ground. 
Through our leadership, we have brought cutting-edge, world-leading assets that can perform air-quality forecasting at an unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city that I drove into one winter morning not very long ago, and thought to myself, "Something is wrong here. I wonder what can be done?" 
So here is the point: What if I'd not investigated the problem of air pollution further? 
What if I'd not shown some concern for the state of the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was taking care of the matter? 
What I have learned is that, when embarking on a challenging endeavor that advances a cause that we firmly believe in, it is important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequence of not acting. 
We should not get distracted by resistance and opposition, but this should motivate us further. 
So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find that there's some natural curiosity you have that is being piqued, and it's about something you care about, and you have some crazy or bold ideas, and perhaps it's outside the realm of your expertise, ask yourself this: Why not? 
Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can, in your own way? 
You may be pleasantly surprised. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says, "Light creates ambiance, light makes the feel of a space, and light is also the expression of structure." 
Well, that was not by me. 
That was, of course, by Le Corbusier, the famous architect. 
And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings -- the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut De Ronchamp -- where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark. 
And I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness. 
So this is how we normally would light our offices. 
We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much Lux and of great uniformity. 
This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps. 
And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier. 
If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome, it would never have looked like this, because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building. 
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort." 
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal, but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people. 
He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun. 
And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky, and where you can experience the sun, that give us a better life in the built environment, just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows. 
And what it all boils down to is, of course, the sun. 
And this image of the Sun may suggest that the Sun is something evil and aggressive, but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the Sun, and light is only a manifestation of that energy. 
The sun is for dynamics, for color changes. 
The sun is for beauty in our environment, like in this building -- the High Museum in Atlanta, which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy, together with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers, who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space, responding to what the sun does outside, just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof. 
So in an indirect way, you can see the sun. 
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum. 
They created this shade that you can see here, which actually covers the sun, but opens up to the good light from the sky. 
And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models, with quantitative as well as qualitative methods, to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture. 
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way. 
As you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor, but they could easily figure out where that comes from. 
And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun, the good part of the sun. 
And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways, of course. 
It can be just like this, or maybe like this, which is rather peculiar, but this is in 1963 -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States. 
And it's just a bit bright up there, so these people have found a very intriguing solution. 
This is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say -- that the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building, creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives. 
And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness, of course, because otherwise you don't see these dynamics. 
As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk, this is a well-known office, which is the Weidt Group. 
They are in green energy consulting, or something like that. 
And they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all. 
It has only, on one side, this big, big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range. 
So it can be very dim over there, and you do your work, and it can be very bright over there, and you do your work. 
But actually, the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull, and therefore helps us to enhance our lives. 
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you. 
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago, which is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year. 
In the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design. 
And he coined three terms, which are "focal glow," "ambient luminescence" and "play of the brilliants" -- three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience. 
So to begin with, focal glow. 
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around. 
Or something like this, which is the lighting design he did for General Motors, for the car showroom. 
And you enter that space, and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive," just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle. 
To me, it is something from theater, and I will get back to that a little bit later. 
It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus. 
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land, highlighting it compared to the dim environment. 
Or it can be in today's retail, in the shopping environment -- lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around. 
Ambient luminescence is something very different. 
Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite, something without any focus, something where all details actually dissolve in infinity. 
And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate. 
It could also be something like this: the National Museum of Science in London, where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture. 
And then finally, Kelly's play of brilliants added to that really some play, I think, of the skyline of Hong Kong, or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house, or in the theater here, which is the decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful, something that is just an addition to the architectural environment, I would say. 
These three distinct elements, together, make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better. 
And we can only create these out of darkness. 
And I will explain that further. 
And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left, was explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe. 
And behind them, you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design. 
Those times, there were some early attempts also for light therapy already. 
You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine, where people are put in the sun to get better. 
It's a little bit of a different story, this health aspect of light, than what I'm telling you today. 
In today's modern medicine, there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way. 
And there is the idea that, when we look at things, it is the yellow light that helps us the most, that we are the most sensitive for. 
But our circadian rhythms, which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on, they are much more triggered by blue light. 
And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment, we can help people to relax, or to be alert, to fall asleep, or to stay awake. 
And that is how, maybe in the near future, light can help hospitals to make people better sooner, recover them quicker. 
Maybe in the airplane, we can overcome jet lag like that. 
Perhaps in school, we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work. 
And you can imagine a lot more applications. 
But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life. 
So light is, of course, for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us. 
It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other. 
And it is all about this planet. 
But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this. 
And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today. 
Because all this light here goes up to the sky. 
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for. 
It never is to the benefit of people. 
It only spoils the darkness. 
So at a global scale, it looks like this. 
And, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground. 
Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be, it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything. 
The world is changing though, and urbanization is a big driver of everything. 
I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou, and I realized that 10 years ago, there was nothing like this, of these buildings. 
It was just a much smaller city, and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous. 
And we have to understand these main questions: How do people move through these new urban spaces? 
How do they share their culture? 
How do we tackle things like mobility? 
And how can light help there? 
Because the new technologies, they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments. 
It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps. 
And of course, we had the metal-halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that. 
Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is. 
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity, because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it. 
And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness. 
So that is a really interesting proposition, I think, and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind. 
The problem is, though, that I wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but I can have four of these on my finger, so you would not be able to really see them. 
So I asked our laboratory to do something about it, and they said, "Well, we can do something." 
They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam. 
So here it is. 
It's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger. 
So just to explain. 
Now, every LED that is made these days gives blue light. 
Now, this is not very pleasant and comfortable. 
And for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap. 
And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant. 
And then when you add the lens to that, you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else. 
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light. 
I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) We can go further. 
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities. 
We have to think again about light as a default solution. 
Why are all these motorways permanently lit? 
Is it really needed? 
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness? 
Can we be much more gentle with light? 
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create, so they really want to connect with it, like here? 
Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around? 
And can we preserve the darkness? 
Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very, very challenging. 
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult. 
Even in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being. 
And it's known that migrating birds, for example, get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms. 
And we discovered that when we make those lights green, the birds, they actually go the right way. 
And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here. 
In all of these examples, I think, we should start making the light out of darkness, and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do, like Edward Hopper in this painting. 
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting. 
I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people? 
Where have they come from? Where are they going? 
What just happened? 
What will be happening in the next five minutes? 
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light. 
Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark. 
And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments. 
We can do that in commercial spaces like this. 
And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe, which is, of course, the universe itself. 
So I give you this wonderful, informative image of the sky, ranging from the inner city, where you may see one or two stars and nothing else, all the way to the rural environments, where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars. 
In architecture, it works just the same. 
By appreciating the darkness when you design the light, you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives. 
This is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. 
But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals, where light and dark, in very gentle combinations, alter each other to define the space. 
Or Richard MacCormac's Southwark tube station in London, where you can really see the sky, even though you are under the ground. 
And finally, I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater. 
And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks. 
It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater. 
And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Good morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic being here over these past few days. 
And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people, these amazing talks that we've had. 
I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways, to some of the things that I've heard. 
I came directly here from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador, where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses, where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies, and keep the roads, out of their forests. 
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated, a world that isn't polluted. 
And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED, is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest, was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down. 
The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries, they were able to store a lot of electricity. 
So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses in this little community -- could have light for, I think it was about half an hour each evening. 
And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer. 
(Laughter) And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back, and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man 50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers, and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. 
We want to know about health care. 
We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it. 
And we want to learn other languages. 
We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese, and we're good at languages." 
So there he is with his little laptop computer, but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador -- fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. 
And so, coming directly from there to here. 
But, of course, my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can't really call it a civilization. 
A different way of life, a different being. 
We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings; there are also other animal beings. 
And I propose to bring into this TED conference, as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom. 
Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film, but these beings have voices that mean something. 
And so, I want to give you a greeting, as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania -- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
(Applause) I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960. 
During that time, there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work. 
For example, for the first time, a few years ago, by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done -- so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant. 
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society. 
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research. 
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI -- to determine the range of the chimps. 
And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff -- but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area. 
And of course, there's developments in infrared, so you can watch animals at night, and equipment for recording by video, and tape recording is getting lighter and better. 
So in many, many ways, we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in 1960. 
Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals with large brains, are studied in captivity, modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals. 
So that we know today, they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began. 
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. 
She loves her computer -- she'll leave her big group, and her running water, and her trees and everything. 
And she'll come in to sit at this computer -- it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked. 
She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. 
She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them, but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes. 
If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good, she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can't see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go. 
And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again, just for the satisfaction of having done it better. 
And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward, like one raisin for a correct response -- but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand. 
So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer. 
Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language. 
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday -- the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars. 
It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard -- and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific. 
Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest. 
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making. 
The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time, it was thought that humans, and only humans, used and made tools. 
When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker. 
So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news, he said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,' or accept chimpanzees as humans." 
(Laughter) We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. 
Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa, wherever chimps have been studied, there are completely different tool-using behaviors. 
And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture. 
What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals with complex brains and social systems, we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. 
It's a very wuzzy line. 
It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human. 
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood, five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother, and then another three, four or five years of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born. 
The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible -- and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society. 
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother, with the brothers and sisters, and which can last through a lifetime, which may be up to 60 years. 
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity, so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far. 
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism. 
We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich -- they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances, but they also use touch, posture, gesture, and what do they do? 
They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands. 
They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist -- the kind of things that we do, and they do them in the same kind of context. 
They have very sophisticated cooperation. 
Sometimes they hunt -- not that often, but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation, and they share the prey. 
We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair. 
They know mental as well as physical suffering. 
And I don't have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you, save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities, studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals. 
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- "self" as opposed to "other." 
They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives. 
But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest, but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet. 
Once we're prepared to admit that after all, we're not the only beings with personalities, minds and above all feelings, and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet, it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me. 
So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees -- who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility -- are in the wild, disappearing very fast. 
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. 
The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land. 
They're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear-cutting. 
They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads -- as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched -- to take out oil or timber. 
And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world, to what is known as the bush-meat trade. 
This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns. 
They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it. 
And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it. 
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred. 
And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who've lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted. 
They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money. 
Their culture is being destroyed, along with the animals upon whom they depend. 
So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left. 
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity, and I've seen it happening with my own eyes. 
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa, and what do we see in Africa? 
We see deforestation; we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support, and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere. 
Were the people that we heard about yesterday, on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid? 
Didn't they know what was happening? 
Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn't a question of "Let's leave the tree for tomorrow." 
"How am I going to feed my family today? 
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer, and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end." 
So, this is a pretty grim picture. 
The one thing we have, which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures, is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here. 
We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future, discuss ideas with each other, so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group. 
We can do it by talking to each other; we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word. 
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards, and we're destroying the world. 
In the developed world, in a way, it's worse, because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing. 
Do you know, we're bringing little babies into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them? 
And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them. 
And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere. 
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago? 
And so many of these diseases, like asthma and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped. 
We're harming ourselves around the world, as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself -- Mother Nature, that brought us into being; Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time, where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. 
And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature, because they're growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality, with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun, or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above. 
As I was traveling around the world, you know, I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be. 
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because, finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now, I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. 
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight, the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected, and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world, and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense, hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense. 
How can we do it? 
Somebody said that yesterday. 
And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope. 
They were feeling despair, they were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do; eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. 
Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media." 
And then I met some who were angry, and anger that can turn to violence, and we're all familiar with that. 
And I have three little grandchildren, and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university, they'd say, "We're angry," or "We're filled with despair, because we feel you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it." 
And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren, and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age. 
I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania, I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots. 
There's little brochures all around outside, and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future, I beg that you pick up that brochure. 
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope. 
Roots make a firm foundation. 
Shoots seem tiny, but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. 
See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet. 
Then, you see, it is a message of hope. 
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through, and can make this a better world. 
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference. 
Every individual has a role to play. 
Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday, and you scientists know that you can't actually -- even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo, and things like that -- you're making a difference in the world. 
So, the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects. 
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. 
One project to show care and concern for your own human community. 
One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say, I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty, who was my childhood companion. 
And the third kind of project: something for the local environment. 
So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they -- and we go now from pre-school right through university. 
It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural. 
It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished. 
It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in. 
We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York. 
It's going to depend on which country they're in -- and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. 
Why? 
Because they're buying into it, and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do. 
It isn't something that their parents tell them, or their teachers tell them. 
That's effective, but if they decide themselves, "We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there. 
We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. 
We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. 
We want to go and work in a dog shelter. 
We want to learn about animals. We want ... " You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me. 
As I travel around the world 300 days a year, everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages. 
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying, "Look at the difference we've made." 
And now comes the technology into it, because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world. 
And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement. 
But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair, to say, "We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?" 
And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel, saying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it." 
The philosophy is very simple. 
We do not believe in violence. 
No violence, no bombs, no guns. 
That's not the way to solve problems. 
Violence leads to violence, at least in my view. 
So how do we solve? 
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. 
Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture. 
Hard work and persistence --don't give up -- and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. 
How many more minutes? Two, one? 
Chris Anderson: One -- one to two. 
Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two. 
(Laughter) Are you going to come and drag me off? 
(Laughter) Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives. 
It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to. 
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact, not just because you can share technology with us, but because so many of you have children. 
And if you take this program out, and give it to your children, they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good, because they've got parents like you. 
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place. 
It's very encouraging. 
But the kids do ask me -- and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise -- the kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future? 
You travel, you see all these horrible things happening." 
Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that. 
Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems. 
And we've talked a lot about that. 
Secondly, the resilience of nature. 
We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life. 
We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help. 
And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last, talked about the indomitable human spirit. 
We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. 
Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years, and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath. 
Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage, so much love and so much compassion. 
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more, in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them, somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi, "If you look back through human history, you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good." 
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell, and I want to end on this note. 
She said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this. 
This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine, from the killing fields of Pol Pot -- one of the most evil regimes in human history -- where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled. 
So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope? 
Is it out there with the politicians? 
It's in our hands. 
It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children. 
It's really up to us. 
We're the ones who can make a difference. 
If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints, if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not, we can change the world overnight. 
Thank you. 

This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer's Hill where I used to go and spend hours going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?" 
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ... 
who I've got over. 
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill." 
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan, actually, for me. 
Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby, thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you. 
Thank you very much. 
♫ Do you remember when we used to go ♫ ♫ up to Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫ ♫ Those summer nights, so still ♫ ♫ with all of the city beneath us ♫ ♫ and all of our lives ahead ♫ ♫ before cruel and foolish words ♫ ♫ were cruelly and foolishly said ♫ ♫ Some nights I think of you ♫ ♫ and then I go up ♫ ♫ on Kiteflyer's Hill ♫ ♫ wrapped up against the winter chill ♫ ♫ And somewhere in the city beneath me ♫ ♫ you lie asleep in your bed ♫ ♫ and I wonder if ever just briefly ♫ ♫ do I creep in your dreams now and then ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ My wild summer love ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Have the years been kind? ♫ ♫ And do you think of me sometimes ♫ ♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫ ♫ Oh, I pray you one day will ♫ ♫ We won't say a word ♫ ♫ We won't need them ♫ ♫ Sometimes silence is best ♫ ♫ We'll just stand in the still of the evening ♫ ♫ and whisper farewell to loneliness ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ My wild summer love ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Do you think of me sometimes? ♫ ♫ And do you ever make that climb? ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ My wild summer love ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Have the years been kind? ♫ ♫ And do you ever make that climb ♫ ♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill?

If I should have a daughter, instead of "Mom," she's going to call me "Point B," because that way she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me. 
And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say, "Oh, I know that like the back of my hand." 
And she's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face, wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach. 
But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. 
There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by Band-Aids or poetry. 
So the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming, I'll make sure she knows she doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself, because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers, your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. 
Believe me, I've tried. 
"And, baby," I'll tell her, don't keep your nose up in the air like that. 
I know that trick; I've done it a million times. 
You're just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house, so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. 
Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place, to see if you can change him. 
But I know she will anyway, so instead I'll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby, because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix. 
Okay, there's a few that chocolate can't fix. 
But that's what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything, if you let it. 
I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass-bottom boat, to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind, because that's the way my mom taught me. 
That there'll be days like this. 
(Singing) There'll be days like this, my momma said. 
When you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises; when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape; when your boots will fill with rain, and you'll be up to your knees in disappointment. 
And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you. 
Because there's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline, no matter how many times it's sent away. 
You will put the wind in win some, lose some. 
You will put the star in starting over, and over. 
And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute, be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life. 
And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting, I am pretty damn naive. 
But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. 
It can crumble so easily, but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it. 
"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember, your momma is a worrier, and your poppa is a warrior, and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more." 
Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things. 
Always apologize when you've done something wrong, but don't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining. 
Your voice is small, but don't ever stop singing. 
And when they finally hand you heartache, when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street-corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) All right, so I want you to take a moment, and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true. 
They can be about whatever you want -- technology, entertainment, design, your family, what you had for breakfast. 
The only rule is don't think too hard. 
Okay, ready? Go. 
Okay. 
So here are three things I know to be true. 
I know that Jean-Luc Godard was right when he said that, "A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end, although not necessarily in that order." 
I know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here, which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool. 
(Laughter) And I know that I have been waiting all week to tell this joke. 
(Laughter) Why was the scarecrow invited to TED? 
Because he was out standing in his field. 
(Laughter) I'm sorry. 
Okay, so these are three things I know to be true. 
But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding. 
So I write poems to figure things out. 
Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem. 
Sometimes I get to the end of the poem, look back and go, "Oh, that's what this is all about," and sometimes I get to the end of the poem and haven't solved anything, but at least I have a new poem out of it. 
Spoken-word poetry is the art of performance poetry. 
I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper, that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person. 
When I was a freshman in high school, I was a live wire of nervous hormones. 
And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable. 
And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long, I was fascinated by the idea of spoken-word poetry. 
I felt that my two secret loves, poetry and theater, had come together, had a baby, a baby I needed to get to know. 
My first spoken-word poem, packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old, was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine. 
The poem was very indignant, and mainly exaggerated, but the only spoken-word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant, so I thought that's what was expected of me. 
The first time that I performed, the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy, and when I came off the stage, I was shaking. 
I felt this tap on my shoulder, and I turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd. 
She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand, but instead she just nodded at me and said, "Hey, I really felt that. Thanks." 
And lightning struck. 
I discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic, and my bewildered, but supportive, parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could. 
I was the youngest by at least a decade, but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about. 
In fact, they welcomed me. 
And it was here, listening to these poets share their stories, that I learned that spoken-word poetry didn't have to be indignant, it could be fun or painful or serious or silly. 
The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home, and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well. 
Never mind the fact that I was 14. 
They told me, "Write about being 14." 
So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant, grown-up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me, "Hey, I really felt that too." 
Now I can divide my spoken-word journey into three steps. 
Step one was the moment I said, "I can. I can do this." 
And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie. 
Step two was the moment I said, "I will. I will continue. 
I love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week." 
And step three began when I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems, if that's not what I was. 
There were things that were specific to me, and the more that I focused on those things, the weirder my poetry got, but the more that it felt like mine. 
It's not just the adage "Write what you know." 
It's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience you've collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don't know. 
I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand, but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been. 
When I got to university, I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken-word poetry. 
And actually, Phil Kaye and I coincidentally also share the same last name. 
When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E. 
as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me. 
But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E., this time changing the mission to using spoken-word poetry as a way to entertain, educate and inspire. 
We stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled, performing and teaching nine-year-olds to MFA candidates, from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus. 
And we saw over and over the way that spoken-word poetry cracks open locks. 
But it turns out sometimes, poetry can be really scary. 
Turns out sometimes, you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry. 
So I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists. 
And the first list that I assign is "10 Things I Know to be True." 
And here's what happens, you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud. 
At a certain point, you would realize that someone has the exact same thing, or one thing very similar, to something on your list. 
And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours. 
Third, someone has something you've never even heard of before. 
Fourth, someone has something you thought you knew everything about, but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it. 
And I tell people that this is where great stories start from -- these four intersections of what you're passionate about and what others might be invested in. 
And most people respond really well to this exercise. 
But one of my students, a freshman named Charlotte, was not convinced. 
Charlotte was very good at writing lists, but she refused to write any poems. 
"Miss," she'd say, "I'm just not interesting. 
I don't have anything interesting to say." 
So I assigned her list after list, and one day I assigned the list "10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now." 
Number three on Charlotte's list was, "I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age." 
I asked her what that meant, and she said, "Miss, it's kind of a long story." 
And I said, "Charlotte, it sounds pretty interesting to me." 
And so she wrote her first poem, a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before. 
And the poem began, "Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man." 
(Laughter) "Did you see him on 60 Minutes, racing Michael Phelps in a pool -- nothing but swim trunks on -- diving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion? 
After the race, he tossed his wet, cloud-white hair and said, 'You're a god.' No, Anderson, you're the god." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, I know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed, to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you. 
Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this. 
You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up. 
But I try to walk through life like this. 
And yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt, but it also means that when beautiful, amazing things just fall out of the sky, I'm ready to catch them. 
I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder, to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and, instead, actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them, so that they can reinterpret and create something from it. 
It's not that I think that spoken-word poetry is the ideal art form. 
I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story. 
I write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems. 
But I teach spoken-word poetry because it's accessible. 
Not everyone can read music or owns a camera, but everyone can communicate in some way, and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from. 
Plus, spoken-word poetry allows for immediate connection. 
It's not uncommon to feel like you're alone or that nobody understands you, but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions, you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers, or your community, who will listen. 
And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what you've shared. 
And that is an amazing realization to have, especially when you're 14. 
Plus, now with YouTube, that connection's not even limited to the room we're in. 
I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students. 
It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to. 
Once you've figured this out, it is tempting to keep writing the same poem, or keep telling the same story, over and over, once you've figured out that it will gain you applause. 
It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself. 
You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself. 
And that is step three: infusing the work you're doing with the specific things that make you you, even while those things are always changing. 
Because step three never ends. 
But you don't get to start on step three, until you take step one first: "I can." 
I travel a lot while I'm teaching, and I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three, but I was very lucky with Charlotte, that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did. 
I watched her realize that, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing, she can create poems that only Charlotte can write, about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer. 
And I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell -- like this story. 
I spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story, and I wondered if the best way was going to be a PowerPoint, a short film -- And where exactly was the beginning, the middle or the end? 
I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out, or not. 
And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club, but it's possible that it was much earlier. 
In preparing for TED, I discovered this diary page in an old journal. 
I think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th. 
It's clear that when I was a child, I definitely walked through life like this. 
I think that we all did. 
I would like to help others rediscover that wonder -- to want to engage with it, to want to learn, to want to share what they've learned, what they've figured out to be true and what they're still figuring out. 
So I'd like to close with this poem. 
When they bombed Hiroshima, the explosion formed a mini-supernova, so every living animal, human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash. 
And what was left of the city soon followed. 
The long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder. 
When I was born, my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said, "This? I've done this before." 
She says I have old eyes. 
When my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old, but I took my mom by the hand and told her, "Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby." 
And yet, for someone who's apparently done this already, I still haven't figured anything out yet. 
My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage. 
My self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry, and it still always tastes funny in my mouth. 
But in Hiroshima, some people were wiped clean away, leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page. 
So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets, I keep trying, hoping that one day I'll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed. 
My parents named me Sarah, which is a biblical name. 
In the original story, God told Sarah she could do something impossible, and -- she laughed, because the first Sarah, she didn't know what to do with impossible. 
And me? 
Well, neither do I, but I see the impossible every day. 
Impossible is trying to connect in this world, trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you, knowing that while you're speaking, they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk -- they hear you. 
They feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it. 
It's what I strive for every time I open my mouth -- that impossible connection. 
There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation. 
But on the front step, a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone. 
The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light. 
After the A-bomb, specialists said it would take 75 years for the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again. 
But that spring, there were new buds popping up from the earth. 
When I meet you, in that moment, I'm no longer a part of your future. 
I start quickly becoming part of your past. 
But in that instant, I get to share your present. 
And you, you get to share mine. 
And that is the greatest present of all. 
So if you tell me I can do the impossible -- I'll probably laugh at you. 
I don't know if I can change the world yet, because I don't know that much about it -- and I don't know that much about reincarnation either, but if you make me laugh hard enough, sometimes I forget what century I'm in. 
This isn't my first time here. This isn't my last time here. 
These aren't the last words I'll share. 
But just in case, I'm trying my hardest to get it right this time around. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

You may know this feeling: you wake up to multiple unread notifications on your mobile phone. 
Your calendar is already packed with meetings, sometimes double- or triple-booked. 
You feel engaged, you feel busy. 
In fact, you feel productive. 
But at the end of it all, something still feels missing. 
You try to figure out what it is. 
But before you do, the next day starts all over again. 
That was how I felt two years ago. 
I felt stressed; I felt anxious. 
I felt a bit trapped. 
The world around me was moving very quickly. 
And I didn't know what to do. 
I started wondering to myself: How do I keep up with all this? 
How do we find fulfillment in a world that's literally changing as fast as we can think, or maybe even faster? 
I started looking for answers. 
I spoke to many people, I spoke to my friends, I spoke to my family. 
I even read many self-help books. 
But I couldn't find anything satisfactory. 
In fact, the more self-help books I read, the more stressed and anxious I became. 
(Laughter) It was like I was feeding my mind with junk food, and I was becoming mentally obese. 
(Laughter) I was about to give up, until one day, I found this. 
"The Tao Te Ching: The Book of the Way and Its Virtue." 
This is an ancient Chinese philosophy classic that was written more than 2,600 years ago. 
And it was by far the thinnest and the smallest book on the bookshelf. 
It only had 81 pages. 
And each page had a short poem. 
I remember I flipped to one particular poem. 
Here it is. 
It's beautiful, isn't it? 
(Laughter) Let me read it out to you. 
"The supreme goodness is like water. 
It benefits all things without contention. 
In dwelling, it stays grounded. 
In being, it flows to depths. 
In expression, it is honest. 
In confrontation, it stays gentle. 
In governance, it does not control. 
In action, it aligns to timing. 
It is content with its nature and therefore cannot be faulted." 
Wow! I remember when I first read this passage. 
I felt the biggest chills down my spine. 
I still feel that today, reading it to you guys. 
My anxiety and stress just suddenly disappeared. 
Ever since that day, I've been trying to apply the concepts in this passage to my day-to-day life. 
And today, I'd like to share with you three lessons I learned so far from this philosophy of water -- three lessons that I believe have helped me find greater fulfillment in almost everything that I do. 
The first lesson is about humility. 
If we think about water flowing in a river, it is always staying low. 
It helps all the plants grow and keeps all the animals alive. 
It doesn't actually draw any attention to itself, nor does it need any reward or recognition. 
It is humble. 
But without water's humble contribution, life as we know it may not exist. 
Water's humility taught me a few important things. 
It taught me that instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, "I don't know. 
I want to learn more, and I need your help." 
It also taught me that, instead of promoting my glory and success, it is so much more satisfying to promote the success and glory of others. 
It taught me that, instead of doing things where I can get ahead, it so much more fulfilling and meaningful to help other people overcome their challenges so they can succeed. 
With a humble mindset, I was able to form a lot richer connections with the people around me. 
I became genuinely interested in the stories and experiences that make them unique and magical. 
Life became a lot more fun, because every day I'd discover new quirks, new ideas and new solutions to problems I didn't know before, all thanks to the ideas and help from others. 
All streams eventually flow to the ocean because it is lower than them. 
Humility gives water its power. 
But I think it gives us the capacity to remain grounded, to be present, to learn from and be transformed by the stories of the people around us. 
The second lesson I learned is about harmony. 
If we think about water flowing towards a rock, it will just flow around it. 
It doesn't get upset, it doesn't get angry, it doesn't get agitated. 
In fact, it doesn't feel much at all. 
When faced with an obstacle, somehow water finds a solution, without force, without conflict. 
When I was thinking through this, I began to understand why I was feeling stressed out in the first place. 
Instead of working in harmony with my environment, I was working against it. 
I was forcing things to change because I was consumed by the need to succeed or to prove myself. 
In the end, nothing did. 
And I got more frustrated. 
By simply shifting my focus from trying to achieve more success to trying to achieve more harmony, I was immediately able to feel calm and focused again. 
I started asking questions like: Will this action bring me greater harmony and bring more harmony to my environment? 
Does this align with my nature? 
I became more comfortable simply being who I am, rather than who I'm supposed to be or expected to be. 
Work actually became easier, because I stopped focusing on things that I cannot control and only on the things that I can. 
I stopped fighting with myself, and I learned to work with my environment to solve its problems. 
Nature does not hurry. 
Yet, everything is accomplished. 
That's Tao Te Ching's way of describing the power of harmony. 
Just as water is able to find a solution without force or conflict, I believe we can find a greater sense of fulfillment in our endeavors by shifting focus from achieving more success to achieving more harmony. 
The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. 
Water is open to change. 
Depending on the temperature, it can be a liquid, solid or gas. 
Depending on the medium it's in, it can be a teapot, a cup or a flower vase. 
In fact, it's water's ability to adapt and change and remain flexible that made it so enduring through the ages, despite all the changes in the environment. 
We also live in a world today of constant change. 
We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. 
We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant. 
In our organization, we host a lot of hackathons, where small groups or individuals come together to solve a business problem in a compressed time frame. 
And what's interesting to me is that the teams that usually win are not the ones with the most experienced team members, but the ones with members who are open to learn, who are open to unlearn and who are open to helping each other navigate through the changing circumstances. 
Life is like a hackathon in some way. 
It's calling to each and every one of us to step up, to open up and cause a ripple effect. 
Now, we can stay behind closed doors and continue to be paralyzed by our self-limiting beliefs, such as: "I will never be able to talk about Chinese philosophy in front of a huge audience." 
(Laughter) Or we can just open up and enjoy the ride. 
It can only be an amazing experience. 
So humility, harmony and openness. 
Those are the three lessons I learned from the philosophy of water so far. 
They nicely abbreviate to H-H-O, or H2O. 
(Laughter) And they have become my guiding principles in life. 
So nowadays, whenever I feel stressed, unfulfilled, anxious or just not sure what to do, I simply ask the question: What would water do? 
(Laughter) This simple and powerful question inspired by a book written long before the days of bitcoin, fintech and digital technology has changed my life for the better. 
Try it, and let me know how it works for you. 
I would love to hear from you. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life. 
That was a great day for my mother. 
My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine, and the first day it was going to be used, even Grandma was invited to see the machine. 
(Laughter) And Grandma was even more excited. 
Throughout her life, she had been heating water with firewood, and she had hand-washed laundry for seven children. 
And now, she was going to watch electricity do that work. 
My mother carefully opened the door, and she loaded the laundry into the machine, like this. 
And then, when she closed the door, Grandma said, "No, no, no, no! 
Let me! Let me push the button!" 
(Laughter) And Grandma pushed the button, and she said, "Oh, fantastic! 
I want to see this! Give me a chair! Give me a chair! I want to see it," and she sat down in front of the machine, and she watched the entire washing program. 
(Laughter) She was mesmerized. 
To my grandmother, the washing machine was a miracle. 
Today, in Sweden and other rich countries, people are using so many different machines. 
Look -- the homes are full of machines. 
I can't even name them all. 
And they also, when they want to travel, they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations. 
And yet, in the world, there are so many people who still heat the water on fire, and they cook their food on fire. 
Sometimes they don't even have enough food. 
And they live below the poverty line. 
There are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day. 
And the richest people over there -- there's one billion people, and they live above what I call the "air line" -- (Laughter) because they spend more than 80 dollars a day on their consumption. 
But this is just one, two, three billion people, and obviously, there are seven billion people in the world, so there must be one, two, three, four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line. 
They have electricity, but the question is: How many have washing machines? 
I've done the scrutiny of market data, and I've found that, indeed, the washing machine has penetrated below the air line, and today, there's an additional one billion people out there who live above the "wash line." 
(Laughter) And they consume for more than 40 dollars per day. 
So two billion have access to washing machines. 
And the remaining five billion -- how do they wash? 
Or, to be more precise, how do most of the women in the world wash? 
Because it remains the hard work for women to wash. 
They wash like this: by hand. 
It's hard, time-consuming labor, which they have to do for hours every week. 
And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home, or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off. 
And they want the washing machine. 
They don't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity. 
And there's nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma. 
Look here, two generations ago in Sweden -- picking water from the stream, heating with firewood and washing like that. 
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way. 
But when I lecture to environmentally concerned students, they tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines." 
How can we tell this woman that she isn't going to have a washing machine? 
And then I ask my students -- over the last two years, I've asked -- "How many of you don't use a car?" 
And some of them proudly raise their hand and say, "I don't use a car." 
And then I put the really tough question: "How many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bedsheets?" 
And no one raised their hand. 
Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines. 
(Laughter) So how come [this is] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it? 
What is special with this? 
Here we are. 
Look here. You see the seven billion people up there? 
The air people, the wash people, the bulb people and the fire people. 
One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel -- oil, coal or gas. 
That's what most of the electricity and the energy in the world is. 
And it's 12 units used in the entire world, and the richest one billion, they use six of them. 
Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world population. 
And these ones, who have washing machines but not a house full of other machines, they use two. 
This group uses three, one each. 
And they also have electricity. 
That makes 12 of them. 
But the main concern for the environmentally interested students -- and they are right -- is about the future. 
What are the trends? 
If we just prolong the trends, without any real advanced analysis, to 2050, there are two things that can increase the energy use: first, population growth; second, economic growth. 
Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here, because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman. 
And that will get you two extra, but that won't change the energy use very much. 
The best of here in the emerging economies -- I call them "the New East" -- they will jump the air line. 
"Wopp!" they will say. 
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already. 
(Laughter) And these people, they want the washing machine. 
I told you. They'll go there. 
And they will double their energy use. 
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light. 
And they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth. 
But the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units. 
And these 22 units -- still, the richest people use most of them. 
So what needs to be done? 
Because the risk, the high probability of climate change is real. 
It's real. 
Of course, they must be more energy efficient. 
They must change their behavior in some way. 
They must also start to produce green energy, much more green energy. 
But until they have the same energy consumption per person, they shouldn't give advice to others -- what to do and what not to do. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Here, we can get more green energy all over. 
This is what we hope might happen. 
But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio, she wants a washing machine. 
She's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone -- so happy that she even voted for her. 
And she became Dilma Rousseff, the president-elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world, moving from minister of energy to president. 
If you have democracy, people will vote for washing machines. 
They love them! 
(Laughter) And what's the magic with them? 
My mother explained the magic with this machine the very, very first day. 
She said, "Now, Hans. 
We have loaded the laundry. 
And now we can go to the library." 
Because this is the magic: you load the laundry, and what do you get out of the machine? 
You get books out of the machines, children's books. 
And mother got time to read for me. 
She loved this. 
I got the "ABC's" -- this is why I started my career as a professor, when my mother had time to read for me. 
And she also got books for herself. 
She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language. 
And she read so many novels, so many different novels here. 
And we really, we really loved this machine. 
(Laughter) And what we said, my mother and me, "Thank you, industrialization. 
Thank you, steel mill. 
Thank you, power station. 
And thank you, chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books." 
Thank you very much. 
(Laughter) (Applause) 

I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival. 
It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business. 
And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco. 
(Laughter) Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins. 
This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo. 
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative. 
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago. 
Now, chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression. 
(Laughter) But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution. 
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin. 
While chimpanzees are dominated by big, scary guys, bonobo society is run by empowered females. 
These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet. 
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes. 
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them. 
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War. 
Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival. 
Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we're not even sure of that to be honest. 
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees. 
Who are these cousins? 
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. 
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems -- since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra. 
Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives. 
Play is not just child's games. 
For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance. 
It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game. 
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it's all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections. 
And when you watch bonobo play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual. 
Play is the glue that binds us together. 
Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild. 
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style -- and I do not mean football. 
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game. 
Have a look what she's doing. 
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "she's got him by the balls." 
(Laughter) Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right? 
Yeah. 
(Laughter) So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans. 
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun. 
But play's a shapeshifter. 
(Laughter) Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew. 
And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water. 
I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds. 
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity. 
So these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present. 
But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation. 
The secret is that play is the key to these capacities. 
In other words, play is our adaptive wildcard. 
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play. 
But will we make the most of our playfulness? 
Play is not frivolous. 
Play's essential. 
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just red in tooth and claw. 
In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urgent. 
And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we rediscover creativity, fellowship and wonder. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Today I want to talk about design, but not design as we usually think about it. 
I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific, biotechnological culture, where, for really the first time in history, we have the power to design bodies, to design animal bodies, to design human bodies. 
In the history of our planet, there have been three great waves of evolution. 
The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution. 
So, as you all know, species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments, and the pressures of those environments selected which changes, through random mutation in species, were going to be preserved. 
Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution, which was we changed the environment in which we evolved. 
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization. 
And that has been the second great -- couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years -- flow of our evolution. 
By changing our environment, we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve. 
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities, all the way through modern medicine, we have changed our own evolution. 
Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history, which has been called many things: "intentional evolution," "evolution by design" -- very different than intelligent design -- whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet. 
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species, as well as our cultures, because of this change. 
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time. 
We started selectively breeding animals many, many thousands of years ago. 
And if you think of dogs for example, dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures. 
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature. 
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like. 
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them. 
We don't have to do it that way anymore. 
This is a beefalo. 
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid. 
And they are now making them, and someday, perhaps pretty soon, you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket. 
This is a geep, a goat-sheep hybrid. 
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards. 
I think they said it tasted like chicken. 
This is a cama. 
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid, created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama. 
And they are now using these in certain cultures. 
Then there's the liger. 
This is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid. 
It's bigger than a tiger. 
And in the case of the liger, there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild. 
But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology. 
And then finally, everybody's favorite, the zorse. 
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures. 
And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement, or genetic manipulation, of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics. 
And if that were all this was about, then it would be an interesting thing. 
But something much, much more powerful is happening now. 
These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish. 
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow. 
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene, and put it into mammal cells. 
These are normal cells. 
And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light. 
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms. 
So they did it with mouse pups, kittens. 
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral, while this is from jellyfish. 
They did it with pigs. 
They did it with puppies. 
And, in fact, they did it with monkeys. 
And if you can do it with monkeys -- though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes -- if they can do it in monkeys, they can probably figure out how to do it in apes, which means they can do it in human beings. 
In other words, it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. 
Be easier to find us at night. 
And in fact, right now in many states, you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets. 
These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver. 
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow, green, red, and they are actually available now in certain states. 
Other states have banned them. 
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures. 
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA -- that controls genetically-engineered pets. 
And so some states have decided to allow them, some states have decided to ban them. 
Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon. 
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon, using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat, to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed. 
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish -- it'll be sold in the stores. 
And before you get too worried about it, here in the United States, the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it. 
So even as we worry about it, we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe -- without any regulation, and even without any identification on the package. 
These are all the first cloned animals of their type. 
So in the lower right here, you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep -- now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh; Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat; CC the cat, for cloned cat; Snuppy, the first cloned dog -- Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy -- created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not. 
He actually was the first person to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do, because dog genomes are very plastic. 
This is Prometea, the first cloned horse. 
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy, a real "gold ring" of cloning, because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings. 
In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed. 
But if you can clone that horse, you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud. 
These were the first cloned calves, the first cloned grey wolves, and then, finally, the first cloned piglets: Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom. 
(Laughter) In addition, we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species. 
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create. 
So with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create. 
And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs, from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea, are pigs that they are going to use, in fact, to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them, instead of producing them in an industrial way. 
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species. 
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate. 
A somatic cell, a body cell, was taken from its body, gestated in the ovum of a cow, and then that cow gave birth to a guar. 
Same thing happened with the mouflon, where it's an endangered species of sheep. 
It was gestated in a regular sheep body, which actually raises an interesting biological problem. 
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies. 
We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA, but we also have DNA in our mitochondria, which are the energy packets of the cell. 
That DNA is passed down through our mothers. 
So really, what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon, but a guar with cow mitochondria, and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA, and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA. 
These are really hybrids, not pure animals. 
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve. 
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach. 
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball. 
And now, using a joystick, they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right, forwards or backwards. 
They've created a kind of insect bot, or bugbot. 
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that. 
This actually is one of DARPA's very important -- DARPA is the Defense Research Agency -- one of their projects. 
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings. 
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs, and they can fly these creatures around the lab. 
They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off. 
They can't actually make them land. 
They put them about one inch above the ground, and then they shut everything off and they go pfft. 
But it's the closest they can get to a landing. 
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired. 
The wires are already in its body, and they can just hook it up to their technology, and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance. 
They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones. 
It's not just insects. 
This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate. 
Again, it's got technology -- it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres; it's got a camera on top of its head. 
The scientists can make this creature go left, right. 
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going. 
They've now created an organic robot. 
The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar's lab said, "Is this ethical? 
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal." 
I'll get back to that in a minute. 
There's also been work done with monkeys. 
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke. 
He took owl monkeys, wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved, especially looking at the movement of their right arm. 
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways. 
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm, which you see here in the picture, put the arm in another room. 
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves, to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did. 
Then he put a video monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm, and the monkey got fascinated. 
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm, this prosthetic arm would do. 
And eventually she was moving it and moving it, and eventually stopped moving her right arm and, staring at the screen, could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves -- which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms. 
And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals. 
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida. 
He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip. 
They self-aggregated into a network, became an integrated chip. 
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator. 
So now we have organic computer chips made out of living, self-aggregating neurons. 
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact, independent lamprey eel brain. 
This is a brain from a lamprey eel. 
It is living -- fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides, attached photosensitive sensors to the brain, put it into a cart -- here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart, when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart, the cart moves toward the light; when you turn it off, it moves away. 
It's photophilic. 
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain. 
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts, sitting there in its nutrient medium? 
I don't know, but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding. 
So, we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes. 
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts. 
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin, put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being. 
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation. 
This is where we are in this process. 
Finally, not that long ago, Craig Venter created the first artificial cell, where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer, which is a machine, created an artificial genome, put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell. 
In other words, that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent. 
And so, asks The Economist: "The first artificial organism and its consequences." 
So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that. 
(Laughter) But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like. 
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like. 
This is a DNA synthesizer, and here at the bottom are just bottles of A, T, C and G -- the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain. 
And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions. 
For the first time in the history of this planet, we are able to directly design organisms. 
We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power, and it confers on us a responsibility. 
Is everything okay? 
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want? 
Do we have free reign to design animals? 
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog. 
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund, the body of a retriever, maybe some pink fur, and let's make it glow in the dark"? 
Does industry get to create creatures who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva and other bodily fluids, create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines? 
Do we get to create organic robots, where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings? 
And then the final step of this, once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings, what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then? 
It's already happening. It's not science fiction. 
We are not only already using these things in animals, some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies. 
We are now taking control of our own evolution. 
We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet. 
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now. 
It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities, or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again. 
We at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons. 
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning, and it will give you extra strength, and it will further enhance your speed, and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance. 
It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine. 
But not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there. 
This is just not some blue sky thinking. 
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier, that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs, and they are being asked to carry more equipment. 
Obviously, this is resulting in some major complications -- back injuries, 30 percent of them -- chronic back injuries. 
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue. 
So let me now introduce to you HULC -- or the Human Universal Load Carrier. 
Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton, I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours. 
Its flexible design allows for deep squats, crawls and high-agility movements. 
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go, and then augments my strength and endurance. 
Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device, this new exoskeleton this year. 
So this is for real. 
Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users, something that I'm particularly passionate about. 
There are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide. 
This is about one percent of the total population. 
And that's actually a conservative estimate. 
We are talking here about, oftentimes, very young individuals with spinal cord injuries, that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair's the only option. 
But it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers. 
And the only option, pretty much -- when it's stroke or other complications -- is the wheelchair. 
And that is actually for the last 500 years, since its very successful introduction, I must say. 
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility. 
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now. 
(Applause) Amanda Boxtel: Thank you. 
(Applause) EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. 
It has sensors. 
It's completely non-invasive, sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back. 
There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips, as well as her knee joints, that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait. 
AB: I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me. 
In a split second, I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis. 
Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again." 
And that was 19 yeas ago. 
He robbed every ounce of hope from my being. 
Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again, to rock climb and even handcycle. 
But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk, until now. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you. 
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers, or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users, but for everyone. 
AB: Thanks. 
(Applause) 

(Singing) (Singing ends) (Applause) Pep Rosenfeld: Folks, you've just met Claron McFadden. 
She is a world-class soprano singer who studied in Rochester, New York. 
Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied. 
In August 2007, Claron was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts, winning praise for her brilliance, her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality. 
Please welcome Claron McFadden. 
(Applause) Claron McFadden: The human voice: mysterious, spontaneous, primal. 
For me, the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- except, perhaps, jealousy. 
And the breath, the breath is the captain of that vessel. 
A child is born, takes its first breath -- (Inhales) Whah! 
And we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression -- mysterious, spontaneous and primal. 
A few years ago, I did a meditation retreat in Thailand. 
I wanted a place where I would have total silence and total solitude. 
I spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut -- no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature, trying to find the essence of concentration, being in the moment. 
On my last day, the woman who looked after the place, she came and we spoke for a minute, and then she said to me, "Would you sing something for me?" 
And I thought, but this is a place of total quiet and silence. 
I can't make noise. 
She said, "Please, sing for me." 
So I closed my eyes, I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was "Summertime," Porgy and Bess. 
(Singing) Summertime and the livin' is easy. 
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high. 
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'. 
So hush little baby, don't you cry. 
And I opened my eyes, and I saw that she had her eyes closed. 
And after a moment, she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said, "It's like meditation." 
And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for, to search for, I had it already in my singing -- the calm, but alertness, the focus, but awareness, and being totally in the moment. 
When you're totally in the moment -- when I'm totally in the moment, the vessel of expression is open. 
The emotions can flow from me to you and back. 
It's an extremely profound experience. 
There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage. 
It's called "Aria." 
It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian. 
And the thing about this piece that's so special -- if you see it behind me -- it's not notated in any way. 
No notes, no flats, no sharps. 
But it's a kind of structure. 
And the singer, within this structure, has total freedom to be creative, spontaneous. 
For example, there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop, country and western, opera, jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color. 
You see there are different lines. 
You choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line, but you must respect it, more or less. 
And these little dots, these represent a sort of sound that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way of expressing the voice. 
Using the body -- it could be sneezing, it could be coughing, animals -- (Audience member coughs) Exactly. (Laughter) Clapping, whatever. 
And there's different text. 
There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian. 
So within this structure, one is free. 
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice, because it's mysterious, as we can see. 
It's quite spontaneous. 
And it's primal. 
So I would like to share this piece with you, It's "Aria," of John Cage. 
(Singing in various languages) Hampart-zoum Dirouhi Di questa Terra Naprasno Conscience et (Barks) (Singing) Arise Tsk, tsk, tsk.

I know what you're thinking. 
You think I've lost my way, and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat. 
(Applause) I get that all the time in Dubai. 
"Here on holiday are you, dear?" 
(Laughter) "Come to visit the children? 
How long are you staying?" 
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet. 
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years. 
(Applause) And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes. 
Now that statistic is quite shocking. 
And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English. 
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi. 
And one fine day, she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary. 
But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses -- medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal. 
How did those students get all that knowledge? 
Of course, from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents. 
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations. 
But sadly, today, languages are dying at an unprecedented rate. 
A language dies every 14 days. 
Now, at the same time, English is the undisputed global language. 
Could there be a connection? 
Well I don't know. 
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. 
When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post. 
Actually, not that long ago. 
That is a little bit too early. 
But nevertheless, I was recruited by the British Council, along with about 25 other teachers. 
And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait. 
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education. 
And of course, the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth. 
Okay. 
Now this is the major change that I've seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. 
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum, and no longer the sole domain of mother England, it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth. 
And why not? 
After all, the best education -- according to the latest World University Rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S. 
So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally. 
But if you're not a native speaker, you have to pass a test. 
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone? 
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius. 
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example? 
Well, I don't think so. 
We English teachers reject them all the time. 
We put a stop sign, and we stop them in their tracks. 
They can't pursue their dream any longer, 'til they get English. 
Now let me put it this way: if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer, would I stop him from entering my British University? 
I don't think so. 
But indeed, that is exactly what we do. 
We English teachers are the gatekeepers. 
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough. 
Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society. 
Maybe the barrier would be too universal. 
Okay. 
"But," I hear you say, "what about the research? 
It's all in English." 
So the books are in English, the journals are done in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
It feeds the English requirement. 
And so it goes on. 
I ask you, what happened to translation? 
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age, there was lots of translation then. 
They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic, into Persian, and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages. 
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe. 
Now don't get me wrong; I am not against teaching English, all you English teachers out there. 
I love it that we have a global language. 
We need one today more than ever. 
But I am against using it as a barrier. 
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese? 
We need more than that. Where do we draw the line? 
This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English, which is quite arbitrary. 
(Applause) And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English, they didn't have to pass an English test. 
Case in point, Einstein. 
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic. 
But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test. 
Because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English. 
Now it's exploded. 
There are lots and lots of tests of English. 
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. 
Now you might think, you and me, "Those fees aren't bad, they're okay," but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. 
So immediately, we're rejecting them. 
(Applause) It brings to mind a headline I saw recently: "Education: The Great Divide." 
Now I get it, I understand why people would want to focus on English. 
They want to give their children the best chance in life. 
And to do that, they need a Western education. 
Because, of course, the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities, that I put on earlier. 
It's a circular thing. 
Okay. 
Let me tell you a story about two scientists, two English scientists. 
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. 
But they couldn't get the results they wanted. 
They really didn't know what to do, until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb, whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German. 
So bingo, problem solved. 
If you can't think a thought, you are stuck. 
But if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more. 
My daughter came to England from Kuwait. 
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic. 
It's an Arabic-medium school. 
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school. 
And she was the best in the class at those subjects. 
Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad, we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know, and they know it in their own language. 
When a language dies, we don't know what we lose with that language. 
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently -- they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village, like all the village children, because the kerosene lamp, it had smoke and it damaged his eyes. 
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you? 
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp. 
And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home. 
(Applause) When he received his award, he said these lovely words: "The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent." 
A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences. 
People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know. 
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark. 
Let us celebrate diversity. 
Mind your language. 
Use it to spread great ideas. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple. 
We don't want Iran to get the bomb. 
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. 
The gray boxes that you see, these are real-time control systems. 
Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves, we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge. 
The gray boxes don't run Windows software; they are a completely different technology. 
But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box, then we are in business. 
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. 
So we start with a Windows dropper. 
The payload goes onto the gray box, damages the centrifuge, and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished. 
That's easy, huh? 
I want to tell you how we found that out. 
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. 
The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part, used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities. 
And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems. 
So that got our attention, and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out. 
And then some very funny things happened. 
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese -- sniffed, but didn't want to eat. 
Didn't make sense to me. 
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese, I realized, well, this is a directed attack. 
It's completely directed. 
The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found, and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target. 
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing. 
So that really got my attention, and we started to work on this nearly around the clock, because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is. 
It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany. 
So we better find out what the target is soon." 
So we extracted and decompiled the attack code, and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one. 
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. 
They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack. 
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator. 
So they know everything. 
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you this: the payload is rocket science. 
It's way above everything that we have ever seen before. 
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code. 
We are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code. 
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language. 
And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code. 
So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls, because we know what they do. 
And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets. 
So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. 
In order to get target theories, we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage, it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran, because that's where most of the infections had been reported. 
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. 
It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. 
So I told my assistant, "Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base." 
And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data. 
And that worked pretty well. 
So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control. 
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see. 
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor, you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode. 
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy, that they would not be able to figure this out quickly. 
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures. 
So for example, the number 164 really stands out in that code; you can't overlook it. 
I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade, and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges. 
So that made sense, that was a match. 
And it even got better. 
These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages. 
And guess what we found in the attack code? 
An almost identical structure. 
So again, that was a real good match. 
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. 
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this. 
These results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor. 
And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover. 
Anyway, so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target, but from different angles. 
The small warhead is taking one cascade, and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down, and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves. 
So in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is. 
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz. 
So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet. 
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off. 
Down there is the gray box, and on the top you see the centrifuges. 
Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code, which is still running during the attack, with fake input data. 
And as a matter of fact, this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet. 
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist, the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. 
That's cool, huh? 
The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room. 
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. 
The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. 
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough. 
So for example, in a power plant, when your big steam turbine gets too over speed, you must open relief valves within a millisecond. 
Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator. 
So this is where we need digital safety systems. 
And when they are compromised, then real bad things can happen. 
Your plant can blow up. 
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it. 
That's scary. 
But it gets worse. 
And this is very important, what I'm going to say. 
Think about this: this attack is generic. 
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment. 
So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory. 
It is generic. 
And you don't have -- as an attacker -- you don't have to deliver this payload by a USB stick, as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet. 
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. 
Just spread it as wide as possible. 
And if you do that, what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction. 
That's the consequence that we have to face. 
So unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East. 
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. 
So all of the green areas, these are your target-rich environments. 
We have to face the consequences, and we better start to prepare right now. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: I've got a question. 
Ralph, it's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this. 
Is that your opinion? 
Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that? 
Yeah. Okay. 
My opinion is that the Mossad is involved, but that the leading force is not Israel. 
So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower. 
There is only one, and that's the United States -- fortunately, fortunately. 
Because otherwise, our problems would even be bigger. 
CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph. 
(Applause) 

Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. 
Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena. 
AK: The ancestor of the horse. 
Okay, we'll do something with it. 
(Laughter) Hahahaha. 
The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called "Faustus in Africa," a Handspring Production from 1995, where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy. 
This production was directed by South African artist and theater director, William Kentridge. 
So it needed a very articulate front paw. 
But, like all puppets, it has other attributes. 
BJ: One of them is breath, and it kind of breathes. 
AK: Haa haa haaa. 
BJ: Breath is really important for us. 
It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage. 
It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- AK: Oops. 
BJ: From an actor. 
Puppets always have to try to be alive. 
It's their kind of ur-story onstage, that desperation to live. 
AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see, and it only lives because you make it. 
An actor struggles to die onstage, but a puppet has to struggle to live. 
And in a way that's a metaphor for life. 
BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle. 
So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- (Laughter) to turn nouns into verbs. 
AK: Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life. 
BJ: Okay so. 
AK: It has ears that move passively when the head goes. 
BJ: And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood, covered with fabric -- curiously similar, in fact, to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. 
AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa. 
BJ: His mother was a puppeteer. 
And when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971, I hated puppets. 
I really thought they were so beneath me. 
I wanted to become an avant-garde artist -- and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go. 
And, in fact, it took about 10 years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form. 
AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company. 
And 20 years later, miraculously, we collaborated with a company from Mali, the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako, where we made a piece about a tall giraffe. 
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe. 
BJ: And here again, you see the same structure. 
The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane, but it's ultimately the same structure. 
It's got two people inside it on stilts, which give them the height, and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. 
AK: The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism, just a bit bigger. 
And he's controlling the ear movement. 
BJ: So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London. 
And just around that time, his mother had said, "Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'?" 
AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse. 
The horse is sold to the First World War, and he joins up to find his horse. 
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said, "Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre?" 
AK: It seemed a lovely idea. 
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider. 
AK: It had to have a rider, and it had to participate in cavalry charges. 
(Laughter) A play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London. 
But they agreed to go along with it for a while. 
So we began with a test. 
BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander, who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse, and our next-door neighbor Katherine, riding on a ladder. 
The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. 
AK: And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell, we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden. 
So we made a model. 
This is a cardboard model, a little bit smaller than the hyena. 
You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there. 
BJ: And the two manipulators are inside. 
But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator, because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time. 
AK: We started work on the prototype after the model was approved, and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated. 
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones. 
And we had a crate built for it. 
It had to be shipped to London. 
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town, and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. 
BJ: So we got a camera, and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances. 
And we sent it off to the National Theatre, hoping that they believed that we created something that worked. 
(Laughter) AK: A month later, we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. 
BJ: About 40 people. 
AK: We were terrified. 
We opened the lid, we took the horse out, and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden. 
Here I have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype. 
This is in the National Theatre studio, the place where they cook new ideas. 
It had by no means got the green light yet. 
The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick, invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse, which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs, grew up into the big horse. 
And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre, saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself. 
And so the show was given the green light. 
And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely. 
Here is the plan. 
(Laughter) And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses. 
You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there. 
The horses are completely handmade. 
There is very little 20th century technology in them. 
We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces. 
But because they have to be light and flexible, and each one of them is different, they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately. 
So here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in London. 
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey. 
Joey boy, you there? 
Joey. 
(Applause) (Applause) Joey. 
Joey, come here. 
No, no, I haven't got it. 
He's got it; it's in his pocket. 
BJ: Joey. 
AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey. 
Come here. Stand here where people can see you. 
Move around. Come on. 
I'd just like to describe -- I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated. 
Here, Craig is working the head. 
He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand. 
Each one of them operates either an ear, separately, or the head, up and down. 
But he also controls the head directly by using his hand. 
The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse. 
When they point right back, the horse is fearful or angry, depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him. 
Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down and the ears listen, either side. 
Horses' hearing is very important. 
It's almost more important than their eyesight. 
Over here, Tommy's got what you call the heart position. 
He's working the leg. 
You see the string tendon from the hyena, the hyena's front leg, automatically pulls the hoop up. 
(Laughter) Horses are so unpredictable. 
(Laughter) The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action. 
The hind legs have got the same action. 
BJ: And Mikey also has, in his fingers, the ability to move the tail from left to right, and up and down with the other hand. 
And together, there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression. 
AK: You want to say something about the breathing? 
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing. 
Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest. 
But we realized that, if that were to be happening, you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath. 
So he made a channel in here, and the chest moves up and down in that channel. 
So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement, but it feels like breath. 
And it's very, very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees. 
AK: Other emotional stuff. 
If I were to touch the horse here on his skin, the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver. 
You'll notice, of course, that the puppet is made out of cane lines. 
And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice, that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space. 
But of course, it was the cane is light, the cane is flexible, the cane is durable and the cane is moldable. 
And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. 
The skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh, which, if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear, she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike. 
You see the skeletal structure of it. 
Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid. 
Again, that was a practical consideration. 
The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out. 
They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production. 
And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in. 
It's three heads making one character. 
But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces. 
And plant. 
(Whinny) Thank you. 
And now just -- (Applause) All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. 
(Applause) (Applause) (Music) So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. 
BJ: Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd. 
The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer, carries on with a second person and ends with a third. 
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire. 
(Applause) Mikey Brett, Craig, Leo, Zem Joaquin and Basil and me. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

It was October 13, 2012, a day that I will never forget. 
I was on my bike, pushing up what seemed like a never-ending barren hill. 
And it wasn't just any hill: it was a 15-mile climb up to a town called Hawi on the Big Island of Hawaii. 
And it wasn't just any ride: it was at the Ironman World Championship. 
I can still feel my muscles burning. 
I was struggling, tired and dehydrated, as I could feel the heat emanating from the asphalt, measuring almost 98 degrees. 
I was near the halfway point of the bike portion of one of the most prestigious, longest, single-day endurance race events in the world. 
Every year, during my childhood, I watched this very race on TV in our family living room. 
I sat next to my dad on our 1970s-style orange and brown sofa, and I remember being in utter awe at how these athletes pushed themselves to their limit in this grueling race. 
And just so you don't get the wrong idea, my family members weren't just spectators. 
They were incredibly athletic, and I always participated from the sidelines, cheering on my three siblings or handing out water at local races. 
I remember wanting so badly to be able to compete, but I couldn't. 
Even though I couldn't play sports, I decided to be active in my community. 
I volunteered at the local hospital in high school. 
In college, I interned at the White House, studied abroad in Spain and backpacked through Europe all by myself with my leg braces and crutches. 
Upon graduating, I moved to New York City for a job in management consulting, earned an MBA, got married and now have a daughter. 
(Applause) At age 28, I was introduced to the sport of hand-cycling, and then triathlon, and by luck, I met Jason Fowler, an Ironman World Champion, at a camp for athletes with disabilities. 
And like me, he competed in a wheelchair. 
And with his encouragement, at age 34, I decided to go after Kona. 
The Kona, or Hawaii Ironman is the oldest Iron-distance race in the sport, and if you're not familiar, it's like the Super Bowl of triathlon. 
And the Ironman, for a wheelchair athlete like me, consists of a 2.4-mile open-water swim in the Pacific Ocean, a 112-mile hand cycle ride in lava fields -- now, that sounds exotic, but it's not as scenic as it sounds, and it's pretty desolate -- and then you top it off with a marathon, or a 26.2-mile run in 90-degree heat using a racing wheelchair. 
That's right, it's a total distance of 140.6 miles using just your arms in less than 17 hours. 
No female wheelchair athlete had ever completed the race because of the strict, seemingly impossible cutoff times. 
And so there I was, putting it all out on the line. 
And when I finally reached the top of that 15-mile climb, I was discouraged. 
There was no way I was going to make that swim in my time limit of 10 and a half hours, because I was almost two hours off pace. 
I had to make the agonizing decision to quit. 
I removed my timing chip, and I handed it over to a race official. 
My day was done. 
My best friend Shannon and my husband Shawn were waiting at the top of Hawi to drive me back to town. 
And on my way back to town, I began to cry. 
I had failed. 
My dream of completing the Ironman World Championship was crushed. 
I was embarrassed. 
I felt like I'd messed up. 
I worried about what my friends, my family and people at work would think of me. 
What was I going to put on Facebook? 
(Laughter) How was I going to explain to everyone that things didn't go the way I had assumed or planned? 
A few weeks later I was talking to Shannon about the Kona "disaster," and she said this to me: "Minda, big dreams and goals can only be realized when you're ready to fail." 
I knew I had to put that failure behind me in order to move forward, and it wouldn't be the first time that I had faced insurmountable odds. 
I was born in Bombay, India, and just before my first birthday, I contracted polio, which left me paralyzed from the hips down. 
Unable to care for me, my birth mother left me at an orphanage. 
Fortunately, I was adopted by an American family, and I moved to Spokane, Washington just shortly after my third birthday. 
Over the next few years, I underwent a series of surgeries on my hips, my legs and my back that allowed me to walk with leg braces and crutches. 
As a child, I struggled with my disability. 
I felt like I didn't fit in. 
People stared at me all the time, and I was embarrassed about wearing a back brace and leg braces, and I always hid my chicken legs under my pants. 
As a young girl, I thought thick, heavy braces on my legs did not look pretty or feminine. 
Among my generation, I am one of the very few individuals in the US who are living with paralysis by polio today. 
Many people who contract polio in developing countries do not have access to the same medical care, education, or opportunities like I have had in America. 
Many do not even live to reach adulthood. 
I have the humbling knowledge that, had I not been adopted, I most certainly wouldn't be in front of you today. 
I may not even be alive. 
All of us, in our own lives, may face seemingly insurmountable goals. 
I want to share with you what I learned when I tried again. 
One year after my first attempt, on a sunny Saturday morning, my husband Shawn dumped me into the ocean at the Kona Pier and, with 2,500 of my closest friends and competitors, we started swimming as that cannon went off promptly at 7am. 
I focused on one stroke at a time, staying in between bodies, counting my strokes -- one, two, three, four -- and lifting my head to sight every so often just so I wouldn't get too off track. 
And when I finally reached the shoreline, Shawn picked me up, and he carried me out of the water. 
I was so stunned and thrilled when Shawn had told me I had managed a one-hour-and-43-minute swim time. 
On to the bike segment. 
I had eight hours and 45 minutes to complete the 112-mile bike course. 
I broke up the course in seven- to 10-mile segments in my mind just to reduce the enormity of the race. 
The first 40 miles, they clipped by as we benefited from a little tail wind. 
By 4pm, I had made it to mile 94, and I did the math and I realized I was in serious time jeopardy because I had 18 miles to go and less than 90 minutes, and that included a few sizable hill climbs. 
I was stressed out, and I was scared that I wasn't going to make that time cutoff again. 
At this point, I pushed my internal voice aside that said, "This hurts. Quit." 
And I told myself, "Minda, you better focus. 
Focus on what you can control, and that is your attitude and your effort." 
I resolved to be OK being uncomfortable, and I told myself, "Push harder, forget about the pain, and keep that laser focus." 
For the next 90 minutes, I cranked as though my life depended on it. 
And when I rolled into town, I heard on the loudspeaker, "Minda Dentler is one of the last competitors to make the bike cutoff." 
I did it! 
(Applause) By only three minutes. 
(Laughter) It was 5:27pm, and I had been racing for 10-and-a-half hours. 
The first 10 miles of the run went pretty quickly, as I was so excited to finally pass people with my three wheels to their two feet. 
The sun quickly went down, and I found myself pulling up to the bottom of Palani hill, looking straight into a half-mile hill that looked like Mt. Everest at mile 124 of the race. 
My friends and family were ready at their stations to talk me up that hill. 
I was struggling, tired, desperately gripping those rims just so I wouldn't tip backwards. 
When I finally reached the top of that hill, I turned left onto a very lonely 15-mile stretch onto the Queen K Highway, totally exhausted. 
I pressed on, focusing on one push at a time. 
By 9:30pm, I made that final right-hand turn onto Ali'i Drive. 
I heard the crowd's roar, and I was overcome with emotion. 
I crossed that finish line. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) And my final time was 14 hours and 39 minutes. 
For the first time in the 35-year history, a female wheelchair athlete completed the Ironman World Championship. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) And it wasn't just any female athlete. 
It was me. 
(Laughter) A paralyzed orphan from India. 
Against all odds, I achieved my dream, and through this very personal commitment to myself, I slowly realized that completing the Ironman was about more than conquering Kona. 
It was about conquering polio and other disabling but preventable diseases, not only for myself, but for the millions of children who have been and still will be afflicted by vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Today, we are closer than ever to eliminating one of those diseases everywhere in the world. 
In the mid-1980s, polio once paralyzed more than 350,000 children a year in more than 125 countries. 
That amounted to a staggering 40 cases an hour. 
By contrast, so far this year, the last endemic countries have reported a total of only 12 cases. 
Since 1988, more than 2.5 billion children have been immunized against polio, and an estimated 16 million children, who otherwise would have been paralyzed like me, are walking. 
Despite this incredible progress, we know that until it's eradicated, polio remains a very real threat, especially to children in the poorest communities of the world. 
It can reemerge in some of the most remote and dangerous places, and from there, it can spread. 
And so this is my new Ironman: to end polio. 
And I am reminded every day, when I look at my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Maya. 
She is able to climb a ladder in the park, push her scooter or kick a ball across the grass. 
Almost everything that I see her do at her age reminds me of what I could not do at that age. 
And when she was two months old, I took her to get her first polio vaccine. 
And when the doctor came in the room to prepare the shot, I asked him if I could take a picture to document the moment. 
When we left the room, I could feel my eyes welling up with tears. 
I cried the entire way home. 
It was in that moment that I realized that my daughter's life would be very different from mine. 
She will never be faced with the crippling disability of polio, because a vaccine was available, and I chose to get her immunized. 
She can do anything she wants, as can each of you. 
(Laughter) Now I'd like to leave you all with one question: what is your Ironman? 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

In 1996, I was commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum to execute a large body of work called "Uses of Evidence." 
It was a cube -- a very well large cube, at that. 
Each side had a window in order for the spectators to view the interior of the structure. 
The exterior of the structure was a collage of Africa and Africans as portrayed in the Western media and literature. 
A look through the windows revealed a sharp contrast: within the cubes are tranquil, civilized, domestic images of African family members, friends and Nigerian professionals, ranging from writers, poets, fashion designers, etc. 
The thing is, both the exterior and the interior images are quite true. 
But the images captured by Western media overwhelmingly depict Africans as basically primitive at best, or barely distinguishable from the African animals. 
Not much has changed, I'm afraid, since 1996, when I executed this work. 
I began my professional photography practice in 1994, but my passion and enthusiasm for photography goes back to childhood, when my parents arranged for us to be photographed by a professional photographer on almost a monthly basis. 
It was also an opportunity for my siblings to dress up in our latest gear, made by our tailor. 
Later, when I was in boarding school, my friends and I bought Polaroid cameras, and then I began to experiment with self-portraiture, or what I would call "proto-selfie auto-portraits." 
(Laughter) "Cover Girl 1994" was my first major work that was critically well received in the US and Europe and quite instantly became a part of the school anthologies at universities and colleges. 
With the "Cover Girl" series, I wanted to reimagine the magazine cover with imagery totally unexpected, yet profoundly reasonable. 
The "Cover Girl" series proposed a different way the African can be represented in a more complex manner. 
Like "Cover Girl," the "Sartorial Anarchy" series is made up of self-portraits. 
It is an ongoing body of work, started in 2010. 
In each image, I married disparate costumes from widely diverse traditions, countries and time frames. 
And in mixing eras, cultures, I was able to bring harmony, as it were, to their similarly irreconcilable differences. 
These differences became a source of inspired artistic celebration. 
For example, in "Sartorial Anarchy #4," I mixed a boater hat, inspired by the traditional Eton-Oxford College Boat Race, with a green Afghan traditional coat and an American Boy Scout shirt -- a culture clash that works. 
In "Sartorial Anarchy #5," I wore a macaroni wig, inspired by eighteenth-century macaroni headgear from England. 
This was paired with a British Norfolk jacket, Yoruba Nigerian trousers, and, improbably, a South African Zulu fighting stick. 
All harmoniously coexist on one body. 
And with "Sartorial Anarchy," I began to invest more into the organization of my pictures. 
I also began to investigate the vast possibilities of color: its emotional values, psychological impulse, poetic allure and a boundless capacity beyond the realm of meaning and logic. 
Now, enter Nollywood. 
In October of 2014, I returned to Lagos, Nigeria, after over three decades away and took photographs of 64 Nollywood personalities. 
I captured a cross section of the industry, as well as the next generation of rising stars. 
Nollywood is the first time that you have a school of African filmmakers truly, truly, profoundly in charge of telling African stories. 
In their varied movies -- from romantic movies, horror films, gangster movies to action movies -- one sees Nigerians portrayed with many layers of complexities. 
All the Nigerian, or "Naija," archetypes, if you allow, are there -- from the divvers, the "Shakara," the coquette, the gangsters, the rich, the corrupt politicians, the whore, the pimp -- all in their swagger. 
And of course, you have the lowlifes and the losers, too, all vividly portrayed. 
Nollywood is Africa's mirror par excellence. 
Typically, I direct all of my portraits, from the way my subject conducts his or her head, the way the neck is tilted, the expression of the fingers, the gestures of the hands, to the gaze and overall bearing and countenance. 
Let me describe some of the photographs for you. 
Genevieve Nnaji. 
She is the reigning queen of Nollywood. 
Here, I was quoting from the grand, Pharaonic African cultures of the Nile Valley civilizations; namely, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, so as to imbue her with a stately, ironic, calm grandeur. 
Taiwo Ajai-Lycett is the grande dame of Nollywood. 
Every aspect of her being commands attention. 
So I posed her with her back to the audience. 
Her face turned to meet us with a redoubtable gaze. 
She doesn't need to seek our approval. 
She's all that. 
Sadiq Daba. 
There was an unspoken authoritarian and imperial bearing that Sadiq Daba exudes upon meeting him. 
In this portrait, he simply sat and allowed his massive, massive Nigerian caftan to signal his status. 
Quite an accomplishment. 
Belinda Effah. 
Belinda Effah's portrait allowed me to indulge my passion for color, dressed in a long, fitted blue dress that emphasizes her curves, seated on an upholstered green velvet bench. 
I gamely employed the multicolored carpet and a vibrant color, in order to evoke the splendor of the multicolored painted bunting bird. 
Everything was designed to harmonize the figure of Belinda within the frame. 
Monalisa Chinda is, shall we say, the epitome of the luxe existence and lifestyle. 
Her picture, or portrait, pretty much speaks for itself. 
Alexx Ekubo is a sharp study in simplified elegance and dignity and a harmony in blue and white, as well. 
Enyinna Nwigwe is a Nollywood matinee idol. 
There is whiff of the rake about him, and that gives him an enchanting edge. 
That's what I felt when I designed and organized the portrait. 
Now, Nollywood is a new phase of Africa. 
It is modern, post-modern, meta-modern, bold sexy, shrewd and with a contagious attitude worth catching. 
As the finale of the project, I assembled the Nollywood stars into a group grand portrait of 64 subjects, called "The School of Nollywood," which was inspired by Rafael's "School of Athens," that was done circa 1509. 
It is at the Vatican. 
This grand group portrait is the exact same size as Rafael's "School of Athens." 
It measures roughly 27 feet in width by six and a half feet in height. 
Nollywood also exemplifies a type of modernity never before seen in Africa. 
Think of it: there has never been anything so ubiquitous with such iconic optics to come out of Africa since the Nile Valley civilizations of Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia. 
Outside of Nollywood, the image of Africa remains frozen in the old "National Geographic" mode and safari perspective. 
But as Africans continue to step and see themselves portrayed by Nollywood in their varied and fantastic complexities, they will, in turn, propagate and perpetuate the positive image of themselves. 
This is what Hollywood did and continues to do for the West. 
As shocking as this may be, it is almost a taboo in the art world to show Africans in a modern framework -- that is to say, as polished, dry-cleaned, manicured, pedicured and coiffed. 
(Applause) Part of my job is to keep beautifying Africa for the world, one portrait at a time. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

As a boy, I loved cars. 
When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident. 
Like this. 
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. 
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. 
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert. 
And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere. 
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car. 
We built the hardware and the software. 
We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert. 
And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars. 
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. 
Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California. 
We've driven 140,000 miles. 
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. 
It's the perfect driving mechanism. 
We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here. 
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1. 
We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself. 
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice. 
Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco. 
(Laughter) Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts. 
(Video) Man: Oh, my God. 
What? 
Second Man: It's driving itself. 
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died. 
Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people? 
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines? 
Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways? 
Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time on your daily commute? 
You could regain this time. 
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone. 
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. 
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I wanted to be a rock star. 
I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of. 
To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star. 
This was in the late '80s. 
And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran. 
They wouldn't have me. 
I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines. 
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada. 
And I was certain that's what my life would be. 
And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas when I was 18, I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101, or even a degree program for that interest. 
And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir. 
And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great." 
And I left the room and said, "No way." 
The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky, and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people. 
And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said, "Listen, you've got to join choir. 
At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico, all expenses paid. 
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls." 
And so I figured for Mexico and babes, I could do just about anything. 
And I went to my first day in choir, and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing. 
They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the "Requiem" by Mozart. 
In my entire life I had seen in black and white, and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor. 
The most transformative experience I've ever had -- in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing, people together, the shared vision. 
And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself. 
And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out. 
I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life. 
I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music. 
And that piece was published, and then I wrote another piece, and that got published. 
And then I started conducting, and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School. 
And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor. 
Well a couple of years ago, a friend of mine emailed me a link, a YouTube link, and said, "You have got to see this." 
And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me, singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called "Sleep." 
(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre. 
My name is Britlin Losee, and this is a video that I'd like to make for you. 
Here's me singing "Sleep." 
I'm a little nervous, just to let you know. 
♫ If there are noises ♫ ♫ in the night ♫ Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck. 
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet, and her voice was so pure. 
And I even loved seeing behind her; I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room. 
Such an intimate video. 
And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing, sing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube, we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir. 
So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG." 
I actually wrote, "OMG," hopefully for the last time in public ever. 
(Laughter) And I sent out this call to singers. 
And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold." 
And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos. 
Now I should say, before that, what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting. 
And it's in complete silence when I filmed it, because I was only hearing the music in my head, imagining the choir that would one day come to be. 
Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to. 
And then as the videos started to come in ... 
(Singing) This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore. 
(Singing) This is Evangelina Etienne (Singing) from Massachusetts. 
(Singing) Stephen Hanson from Sweden. 
(Singing) This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas. 
(Singing) There was even a little soprano solo in the piece, and so I had auditions. 
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts. 
I was told later, and also by lots of singers who were involved in this, that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it. 
Here's our winner of the soprano solo. 
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee. 
(Singing) I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note -- like, "No problem, everything's fine." 
(Laughter) And from the crowd emerged this young man, Scott Haines. 
And he said, "Listen, this is the project I've been looking for my whole life. 
I'd like to be the person to edit this all together." 
I said, "Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me." 
And Scott aggregated all of the videos. 
He scrubbed the audio. 
He made sure that everything lined up. 
And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago. 
This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir. 
(Singing) I'll stop it there in the interest of time. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
So there's more. There's more. 
Thank you so much. 
And I had the same reaction you did. 
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it. 
I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it -- these souls all on their own desert island, sending electronic messages in bottles to each other. 
And the video went viral. 
We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it. 
And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying, "All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?" 
And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, "Sleep," which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 -- poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri. 
And again, I posted a conductor video, and we started accepting submissions. 
This time we got some more mature members. 
(Singing) And some younger members. 
(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine. 
Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen? 
Someone did all eight videos -- a bass even singing the soprano parts. 
This is Beau Awtin. 
(Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody. 
And there were 900 people involved in that. 
So I told the singers, "That's our goal. 
That's the number for us to beat." 
And we just closed submissions January 10th, and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand. 
And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials, what it was like for them, their experience singing it. 
And I've just chosen a few of them here. 
"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly. 
Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling. 
It's so wonderful to sing together again!" 
I love the idea that she's singing with her sister. 
"Aside from the beautiful music, it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before, but who are connected anyway." 
And my personal favorite, "When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this, he told me that I did not have the voice for it." 
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too. 
Me too. 
"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears, but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words. 
It is a dream come true to be part of this choir, as I've never been part of one. 
When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map, I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live. 
As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush, satellite is my connection to the world." 
So two things struck me deeply about this. 
The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other. 
It doesn't matter the technology. 
And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection. 
It wasn't a virtual choir. 
There are people now online that are friends; they've never met. 
But, I know myself too, I feel this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them. 
I feel a closeness to this choir -- almost like a family. 
What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0. 
This will be a premiere today. 
We're not finished with the video yet. 
You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious. 
But we do have the first three minutes. 
And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first. 
You're the very first people to see this. 
This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir. 
(Video) Virtual Choir: ♫ The evening hangs ♫ ♫ beneath the moon ♫ ♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫ ♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫ ♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫ ♫ Upon my pillow, ♫ ♫ safe in bed, ♫ ♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫ ♫ I cannot sleep ♫ ♫ my mind's aflight ♫ ♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫ ♫ If there are noises in the night ♫ Eric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much. Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm a huge believer in hands-on education. 
But you have to have the right tools. 
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron. 
And similarly, she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands. 
So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of: Play-Doh. 
And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes. 
And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play-dough -- pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen. 
We have two favorite recipes -- one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt. 
And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these. 
But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together. 
You see that really salty Play-Doh? 
Well, it conducts electricity. 
And this is nothing new. 
It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years. 
But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh. 
And that sugar dough? 
Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. 
So what does that mean? 
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own. 
(Applause) And so I want to do a little demo for you. 
So if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in -- it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up. 
But if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit. 
If I push these together, the light turns off. 
Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED. 
If I separate them again, I have some light. 
Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. 
It's like a wall to the electricity. 
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light. 
In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures. 
If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning. 
(Applause) And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit. 
We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids. 
I plug in again the power to it. 
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits. 
I can start plugging in lots of lights. 
And we can start talking about things like electrical load. 
What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor? 
It'll dim. 
We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done. 
You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this. 
So this is all in your home kitchen. 
We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab. 
We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes. 
We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves. 
And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone. 
We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids, to a science researcher in the U.K., and curriculum developers in Hawaii. 
So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing. 
We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should. 
Have fun. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning, I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before. 
We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early. 
You do some routine refresher training, and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you. 
And you put on the T-10 parachute. 
And you're very careful how you put the straps, particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs. 
And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack. 
And then a jumpmaster comes, and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations. 
He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed, your shoulders are crushed down, and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well. 
Then you sit down, and you wait a little while, because this is the Army. 
Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on, and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people, and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft. 
And you wait a little bit longer, because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait. 
Then you take off. 
And it's painful enough now -- and I think it's designed this way -- it's painful enough so you want to jump. 
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out. 
So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along, and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands. 
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning. 
You sit there, OK. 
Then they give you 10 minutes. 
And of course, you're responding with all of these. 
And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared. 
Then they give you, "Get ready." 
Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up." 
If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up. 
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up. 
And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line. 
And at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what? 
I'm probably going to jump. 
There's no way to get out of this at this point." 
You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door. 
And this was that Tuesday morning in September, and it was pretty nice outside. 
So nice air comes flowing in. 
The jumpmasters start to check the door. 
And then when it's time to go, a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go." 
The first guy goes, and you're just in line, and you just kind of lumber to the door. 
Jump is a misnomer; you fall. 
You fall outside the door, you're caught in the slipstream. 
The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position -- head down in your chest, your arms extended, put over your reserve parachute. 
You do that because, 27 years before, an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that. 
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong. 
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open. 
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute -- you've got a whole new problem set. 
But typically you do; typically it opens. 
And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right, at that point you get another little thrill. 
Boom. 
So then you look around, you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good." 
Now you prepare for the inevitable. 
You are going to hit the ground. 
You can't delay that much. 
And you really can't decide where you hit very much, because they pretend you can steer, but you're being delivered. 
So you look around, where you're going to land, you try to make yourself ready. 
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line, so that it's not on you when you land, and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall. 
Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet, your calves, your thighs, your buttocks and your push-up muscles. 
It's this elegant little land, twist and roll. 
And that's not going to hurt. 
In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one. 
(Laughter) I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window. 
(Laughter) And as soon as I hit, the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed. 
I'd shake my head, and I'd ask myself the eternal question: "Why didn't I go into banking?" 
(Laughter) And I'd look around, and then I'd see another paratrooper, a young guy or girl, and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine and they'd be picking up their equipment. 
They'd be doing everything that we had taught them. 
And I realized that, if they had to go into combat, they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders. 
And I realized that, if they came out of combat, it would be because we led them well. 
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did. 
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump, but it's not any jump -- that was September 11th, 2001. 
And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace. 
When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed. 
And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very, very real -- and leadership seemed important. 
But things had changed; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general. 
I'd been successful, but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes, and on that morning, I didn't know it. 
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership: Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg. 
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership. 
This was my father in Vietnam. 
And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful; they didn't lie, cheat, steal or abandon their comrades. 
And I still believe real leaders are like that. 
But in my first 25 years of career, I had a bunch of different experiences. 
One of my first battalion commanders, I worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march, and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds. 
And I'm not sure that was real interaction. 
But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander, I went out to the National Training Center. 
And we did an operation, and my company did a dawn attack -- you know, the classic dawn attack: you prepare all night, move to the line of departure. 
And I had an armored organization at that point. 
We move forward, and we get wiped out -- I mean, wiped out immediately. 
The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it. 
And after the battle, they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review" to teach you what you've done wrong. 
Sort of leadership by humiliation. 
They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything: "and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc." 
I walked out feeling as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut. 
And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down. 
And I went up to apologize to him, and he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great." 
And in one sentence, he lifted me, put me back on my feet, and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure. 
When 9/11 came, 46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world. 
First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with: the environment changed -- the speed, the scrutiny, the sensitivity of everything now is so fast, sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it. 
But everything we do is in a different context. 
More importantly, the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries. 
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them, I'm now leading a force that's dispersed, and I've got to use other techniques. 
I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat, I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls -- I've got to use everything I can, not just for communication, but for leadership. 
A 22-year-old individual operating alone, thousands of miles from me, has got to communicate to me with confidence. 
I have to have trust in them and vice versa. 
And I also have to build their faith. 
And that's a new kind of leadership for me. 
We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations. 
An emerging opportunity came -- didn't have time to get everybody together. 
So we had to get complex intelligence together, we had to line up the ability to act. 
It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command, convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium. 
We failed. 
The mission didn't work. 
And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force, rebuild their confidence -- me and them, and them and me, and our seniors and us as a force -- all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder. 
Entirely new requirement. 
Also, the people had changed. 
You probably think that the force that I led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons. 
In reality, much of the force I led looked exactly like you. 
It was men, women, young, old -- not just from military; from different organizations, many of them detailed to us just from a handshake. 
And so instead of giving orders, you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose. 
Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference, the ages, had changed so much. 
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan, and on that operation, a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team. 
We talked about the operation, and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that. 
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?" 
And one young Ranger in the back -- his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind -- he said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade." 
And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness, and yet he has different experiences, in many cases a different vocabulary, a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders. 
And yet, we need to have that shared sense. 
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise, because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot, that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore. 
So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing? 
And it's a brand new leadership challenge. 
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent, a lot more willing to listen, a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower. 
And yet, again, you're not all in one room. 
Then another thing. 
There's an effect on you and on your leaders. 
There's an impact, it's cumulative. 
You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time. 
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces. 
And I remembered his son was in our force. 
And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?" 
And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking." 
I said, "Where is he now?" 
And he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight." 
Think about watching your brother, father, daughter, son, wife in a firefight in real time and you can't do anything about it. 
Think about knowing that over time. 
And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders. 
And you have to watch and take care of each other. 
I probably learned the most about relationships. 
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together. 
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment. 
And every morning in the Ranger regiment, every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them -- says a six-stanza Ranger creed. 
You may know one line of it, it says, "I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy." 
And it's not a mindless mantra, and it's not a poem. 
It's a promise. 
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger, "No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me, if you need me, I'm coming." 
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger. 
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful. 
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows. 
And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power. 
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing. 
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever. 
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007, and an old friend of mine, that I had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note, just in an envelope, that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot, that you would come, if alive." 
And having that kind of relationship, for me, turned out to be critical at many points in my career. 
And I learned that you have to give that in this environment, because it's tough. 
That was my journey. 
I hope it's not over. 
I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right; they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust. 
This isn't easy stuff. 
It's not like that electronic abs machine where, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs. 
(Laughter) And it isn't always fair. 
You can get knocked down, and it hurts and it leaves scars. 
But if you're a leader, the people you've counted on will help you up. 
And if you're a leader, the people who count on you need you on your feet. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So what does the happiest man in the world look like? 
He certainly doesn't look like me. 
He looks like this. 
His name is Matthieu Ricard. 
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world? 
Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain. 
And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI, versus the right prefrontal cortex. 
And Matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts. 
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. 
Which leads us to a question: What was he thinking when he was being measured? 
Perhaps something very naughty. 
(Laughter) Actually, he was meditating on compassion. 
Matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever. 
Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life. 
My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime -- and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale. 
And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work. 
Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore. 
Compassion is something that creates happiness. 
Compassion is fun. 
And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game. 
Because if compassion was a chore, nobody's going to do it, except maybe the Dalai Lama or something. 
But if compassion was fun, everybody's going to do it. 
Therefore, to create the conditions for global compassion, all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun. 
But fun is not enough. 
What if compassion is also profitable? 
What if compassion is also good for business? 
Then, every boss, every manager in the world, will want to have compassion -- like this. 
That would create the conditions for world peace. 
So, I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting. 
Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far. 
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in Google, my company. 
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world, but Google is the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for 10 years, so I'll use Google as the case study. 
Google is a company born of idealism. 
It's a company that thrives on idealism. 
And maybe because of that, compassion is organic and widespread company-wide. 
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern. 
It's sort of a funny pattern. 
It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something. 
And they don't usually ask for permission; they just go ahead and do it, and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger. 
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official. 
So in other words, it almost always starts from the bottom up. 
And let me give you some examples. 
The first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official, because it just became too big. 
Another example, three Googlers -- a chef, an engineer and, most funny, a massage therapist -- three of them, they learned about a region in India where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility. 
So what do they do? 
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser. 
And they raise enough money to build this hospital -- the first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people. 
During the Haiti earthquake, a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones. 
And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices. 
In China for example, one mid-level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China, involving more than 1,000 schools in China, working on issues such as education, poverty, health care and the environment. 
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. 
And this idea, again, came from the grassroots, from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job. 
And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy. 
It was two persons saying, "Let's do this," and the company said, "Yes." 
So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company, because Googlers found compassion to be fun. 
But again, fun is not enough. 
There are also real business benefits. 
So what are they? 
The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders. 
What does that mean? 
There are three components of compassion. 
There is the affective component, which is, "I feel for you." 
There is the cognitive component, which is, "I understand you." 
And there is a motivational component, which is, "I want to help you." 
So what has this got to do with business leadership? 
According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins, and documented in the book "Good to Great," it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness. 
And he calls them "Level 5 leaders." 
These are leaders who, in addition to being highly capable, possess two important qualities, and they are humility and ambition. 
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good. 
And because they're ambitious for a greater good, they feel no need to inflate their own egos. 
And they, according to the research, make the best business leaders. 
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion, we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits, tones down, what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us, therefore creating the conditions for humility. 
The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good. 
In other words, compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders. 
And this is the first compelling business benefit. 
The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce. 
Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good. 
It creates a vibrant, energetic community where people admire and respect each other. 
I mean, you come to work in the morning, and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India. 
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers? 
So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration, initiative and creativity. 
It makes us a highly effective company. 
So, having said all that, what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting? 
In our experience, there are three ingredients. 
The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good. 
So always think: how is your company and your job serving the greater good? 
Or, how can you further serve the greater good? 
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in. 
That's one. 
The second ingredient is autonomy. 
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy. 
And one of our most popular managers jokes that, this is what he says, "Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum." 
And he considers himself one of the inmates. 
If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free, they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way. 
The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth. 
Leadership training in Google, for example, places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities, such as self-awareness, self-mastery, empathy and compassion, because we believe that leadership begins with character. 
We even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence, which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself." 
It's less naughty than it sounds. 
So I'm an engineer by training, but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course, which I find kind of funny, because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence. 
What a company. 
(Laughter) So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work? 
It works in three steps. 
The first step is attention training. 
Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. 
Therefore, any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training. 
The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. 
And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence. 
The second step follows the first step. 
The second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery. 
So using the supercharged attention from step one, we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes. 
What does that mean? 
It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity, objectivity and from a third-person perspective. 
And once you can do that, you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery. 
The third step, following the second step, is to create new mental habits. 
What does that mean? Imagine this. 
Imagine whenever you meet any other person, any time you meet a person, your habitual, instinctive first thought is, "I want you to be happy. 
I want you to be happy." 
Imagine you can do that. 
Having this habit, this mental habit, changes everything at work. 
Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people, and it creates trust, and trust creates a lot of good working relationships. 
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace. 
Someday, we hope to open-source "Search Inside Yourself" so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference. 
And in closing, I want to end the same place I started, with happiness. 
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy -- the Dalai Lama, who said, "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. 
If you want to be happy, practice compassion." 
I found this to be true, both on the individual level and at a corporate level. 
And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous. 
I went to prison -- difficult. 
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous. 
I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous. 
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning, little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end. 
In fact, most of my career, I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting, that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience. 
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, I knew I would want to do something a little different. 
So as some of you may or may not have heard, a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay. 
I sent out some Facebook messages, some Twitter messages, and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 TED Talk. 
(Laughter) That's right, some lucky individual, corporation, for-profit or non-profit, was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again -- (Laughter) to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now, that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be. 
So what you were getting was this: Your name here presents: My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face, especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it. 
But that being said, it's a very good media opportunity. 
(Laughter) You know how many people watch these TED Talks? 
It's a lot. 
That's just a working title, by the way. 
(Laughter) So even with that caveat, I knew that someone would buy the naming rights. 
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty. 
But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film, we examine the world of marketing, advertising. 
And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. 
(Laughter) You see, I had this idea for a movie. 
(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film all about product placement, marketing and advertising, where the entire film is funded by product placement, marketing and advertising. 
So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." 
So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold," is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish, is branded from beginning to end -- from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie, which is brand X. 
Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium, the Staples Center ... 
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever. 
And so the film explores this whole idea -- (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.) It's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever? 
I'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.) That was more for emphasis. 
It was, "In perpetuity. Forever." 
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. 
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ... 
the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold," the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." 
Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is, beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life, but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.) MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work. 
The goal of this whole film is transparency. 
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie. 
So that's the whole concept, the whole film, start to finish. 
And I would love for CEG to help make it happen. 
Robert Friedman: You know it's funny, because when I first hear it, it is the ultimate respect for an audience. 
Guy: I don't know how receptive people are going to be to it, though. 
XK: Do you have a perspective -- I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.) David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this? 
MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.) John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them, but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big, really obvious brands. 
XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out, we look like a bunch of blithering idiots. 
MS: What do you think the response is going to be? 
Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no." 
MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me? 
JK: Both. 
MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic. 
So, sir, can you help me? I need help. 
MK: I can help you. 
MS: Okay. (MK: Good.) Awesome. 
MK: We've gotta figure out which brands. 
MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.) When you look at the people you deal with .. 
MK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.) Turn the camera off. 
MS: I thought "Turn the camera off" meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation." 
Turns out it really means, "We want nothing to do with your movie." 
MS: And just like that, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared. 
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. 
I was amazed. 
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project. 
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible. 
Especially in today's world, this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape, isn't the idea to get that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses? 
No, that's what I thought. 
But the problem was, you see, my idea had one fatal flaw, and that flaw was this. 
Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever. 
That wouldn't have been a problem at all. 
This would have been fine. 
But what this image represents was the problem. 
See, when you do a Google image search for transparency, this is --- (Laughter) (Applause) This is one of the first images that comes up. 
So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No. 
(Laughter) This is was the problem: transparency -- free from pretense or deceit; easily detected or seen through; readily understood; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information, especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem. 
You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days. 
Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our CEO's say it. 
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes. 
But why? Well, transparency is scary -- (Roar) like that odd, still-screaming bear. 
(Laughter) It's unpredictable -- (Music) (Laughter) like this odd country road. 
And it's also very risky. 
(Laughter) What else is risky? 
Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip. 
(Laughter) That's very risky. 
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story. 
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story." 
See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story. 
There's your story, there's my story and there's the real story." 
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story. 
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me -- and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team. 
So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem. 
(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films, and I have friends who make little independent films like I make. 
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have. 
And then my friends who make small independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies?" 
And the movie is called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." 
So how specifically will we see Ban in the film? 
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet, you will see Ban deodorant. 
While anytime I do an interview with someone, I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview? 
Are you ready? You look a little nervous. 
I want to help you calm down. 
So maybe you should put some one before the interview." 
So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents. 
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds," they'll have their chance. 
We will have them geared for both male or female -- solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be. 
That's the two-cent tour. 
So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour. 
Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand. 
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie, we're very much a challenger brand. 
So we don't have the budgets that other brands have. 
So doing things like this -- you know, remind people about Ban -- is kind of why were interested in it. 
MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban? 
Ban is blank. 
KF: That's a great question. 
(Laughter) Woman: Superior technology. 
MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit. 
Man: We talk about bold, fresh. 
I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive, versus "fights odor and wetness." 
It keeps you fresh. 
How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness, more freshness, three times fresher. 
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit. 
MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation. 
What about me? What about a regular guy? 
I need to go talk to the man on the street, the people who are like me, the regular Joes. 
They need to tell me about my brand. 
(Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand? 
Man: Um, my brand? 
I don't know. 
I like really nice clothes. 
Woman: 80's revival meets skater-punk, unless it's laundry day. 
MS: All right, what is brand Gerry? 
Gerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.) Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I am would be like dark glamor. 
I like a lot of black colors, a lot of grays and stuff like that. 
But usually I have an accessory, like sunglasses, or I like crystal and things like that too. 
Woman: If Dan were a brand, he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz. 
Man 2: The brand that I am is, I would call it casual fly. 
Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi, part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know. 
Man 3: I'm the pet guy. 
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world. 
So I guess that's my brand. 
In my warped little industry, that's my brand. 
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods. 
Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand. 
Is that something? 
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand. 
Tom: I'm Tom. 
MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly. 
(Laughter) And what I realized is I needed an expert. 
I needed somebody who could get inside my head, somebody who could really help me understand what they call your "brand personality." 
And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg. 
They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark discover that brand personality. 
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me. 
(Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right? 
MS: I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family. 
A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are. 
MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world. 
A: Tell me about this world. 
MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the job you do. 
All those things stemmed and started from one place, and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia. 
A: What's the next one you want to talk about? 
MS: The next one: This was the best day ever. 
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are? 
MS: It's like, who do I want to be? 
I like things that are different. 
I like things that are weird. I like weird things. 
A: Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us? 
What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now? 
Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent? 
Tell me a little bit about that part. 
... A little more about you that is not who you are. 
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had? 
... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on? 
MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you. 
A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.) A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right. 
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this. 
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there. 
Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct, but complementary sides to your brand personality -- the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand. 
Those are juxtaposed very nicely together. 
And I think there's almost a paradox with those. 
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both. 
Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature -- to avoid things that they're not sure of, avoid fear, those elements, and you really embrace those, and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see. 
What other brands are like that? 
The first on here is the classic, Apple. 
And you can see here too, Target, Wii, Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue. 
Now there's playful brands and mindful brands, those things that have come and gone, but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing. 
MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand? 
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality, what would you be? 
Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing? 
Or are you more of a down attribute? 
Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative? 
Up attributes are things like being playful, being fresh like the Fresh Prince, contemporary, adventurous, edgy or daring like Errol Flynn, nimble or agile, profane, domineering, magical or mystical like Gandalf. 
Or are you more of a down attribute? 
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007? 
Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective, empathetic like the Oprah? 
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, safe, secure, sacred, contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda? 
Over the course of this film, we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project. 
They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product. 
But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control, who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind. 
They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing. 
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising. 
In the entire city for the past five years, there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing. 
(Applause) And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across America. 
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of, or I've had the most success in, are ones where I've interacted with things directly. 
And that's what these brands did. 
They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies and said, "Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind. 
I'm going to deal directly with the artist. 
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world." 
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful? 
Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look. 
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January, and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing -- we've had 900 million media impressions for this film. 
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period. 
That's only online -- no print, no TV. 
The film hasn't even been distributed yet. 
It's not even online. It's not even streaming. 
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet. 
So ultimately, this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum. 
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part. 
What I always believe is that if you take chances, if you take risks, that in those risks will come opportunity. 
I believe that when you push people away from that, you're pushing them more towards failure. 
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse, then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged. 
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks. 
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them. 
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to embrace fear. 
We've got to put that bear in a cage. 
(Laughter) Embrace fear. Embrace risk. 
One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk. 
And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency. 
Today, more than ever, a little honesty is going to go a long way. 
And that being said, through honesty and transparency, my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency," has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC, who for $7,100 bought the naming rights on eBay. 
(Applause) EMC: Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world. 
EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency." 
Thank you very much, guys. 
(Applause) June Cohen: So, Morgan, in the name of transparency, what exactly happened to that $7,100? 
MS: That is a fantastic question. 
I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization, the Sapling Foundation -- a check for $7,100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED. 
(Laughter) (Applause) 

I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. 
But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy. 
This guy's name is TEMPT. 
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s. 
And he came up home from a run one day and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling." 
And that was the onset of ALS. 
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. 
He only has use of his eyes. 
I was exposed to him. 
I have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. 
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, TEMPT, and his cause. 
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money. 
What are you going to do with it?" 
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. 
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me." 
And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking -- don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices?" 
And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance, you can't actually do that. 
These devices aren't accessible to people." 
And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?" 
Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?" 
That's how they communicate -- so run their finger along. 
I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?" 
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash. 
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- I'm like, "All right, here's the deal: Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again. 
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it." 
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that. 
I met these guys called GRL, Graffiti Research Lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it, and it just registers the negative space. 
So they go around and do art installations like this. 
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle. 
First it starts with the sexual organs, then it starts with cuss words, then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art. 
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations. 
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome." 
So that started the journey. 
And about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around, we'd accomplished a couple things. 
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine. 
(Applause) Which was awesome. 
And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing." 
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house. 
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage, and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house. 
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls. 
But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this. 
This is called the EyeWriter, and you can see the description. 
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk, some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack. 
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open, mounted it to an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- you build this yourself, we publish the code for free, you download the software for free. 
And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations. 
There's no insurance company that can say "No." 
There's no hospital that can say "No." 
Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
Thank you guys very much. That was awesome. 
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TEMPT's room. 
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room and that's his room. 
So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling. 
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, carb-fest and all-night sessions, Tony drew again for the first time in seven years. 
And this is an amazing picture, because this is his life support system, and he's looking over his life support system. 
We kicked his bed so that he could see out. 
And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital. 
And he drew again for the first time, in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was. 
The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too, so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too. 
(Laughter) So at the end of this, he sent us an email, and this is what the email said: "That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years. 
I feel like I had been held underwater, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe." 
Isn't that awesome? 
(Applause) So that's kind of our battle cry. 
That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing. 
And we've got such a long way to go with this. 
This is an amazing device, but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. 
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more. 
So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better, faster, stronger. 
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment. 
We've won a bunch of awards. 
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing. 
It's all coming out of our own pockets. 
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic." 
Armstrong Twittered about us, and then in December, Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool. 
(Applause) The coolest thing about this -- and this is what's completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year, at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets." 
And "Art of the Streets" is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene -- Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS -- all of these guys will be there. 
TEMPT's going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome. 
(Applause) So basically this is my point: If you see something that's not possible, make it possible. 
Everything in this room wasn't possible -- this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter -- wasn't possible at one point. 
Make it possible, everyone in this room. 
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen. 
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done: if not now, then when? And if not me, then who? 
Thank you guys. 
(Applause) 

Can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were 17? 
Do you know what I wanted to be? 
I wanted to be a biker chick. 
(Laughter) I wanted to race cars, and I wanted to be a cowgirl, and I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book." 
Because they were all about being free, the wind in your hair -- just to be free. 
And on my seventeenth birthday, my parents, knowing how much I loved speed, gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday. 
Not that we could have afforded I drive, but to give me the dream of driving. 
And on my seventeenth birthday, I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence, as I always had all my life -- my visually impaired sister -- to go to see an eye specialist. 
Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters. 
And my little sister wanted to be a pilot -- God help her. 
So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun. 
And on my seventeenth birthday, after my fake eye exam, the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday. 
And he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?" 
And I took that driving lesson, and I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive." 
And then there was a silence -- one of those awful silences when you know something's wrong. 
And he turned to my mother, and he said, "You haven't told her yet?" 
On my seventeenth birthday, as Janis Ian would best say, I learned the truth at 17. 
I am, and have been since birth, legally blind. 
And you know, how on earth did I get to 17 and not know that? 
Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful, let me tell you this: I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song, "A Boy Named Sue." 
I'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971. 
And very shortly after my birth, my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism. 
And what the hell does that mean to you? 
So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this? 
I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing, so holy God, woohoo! (Laughter) I might buy some more time. 
But more importantly, let me tell you -- I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat. 
Hey. 
See this hand? 
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline. 
Every man in this room, even you, Steve, is George Clooney. 
(Laughter) And every woman, you are so beautiful. 
And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror, and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting I've done all my life from all the dark lights. 
The really strange part is that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school, my parents made a bizarre, unusual and incredibly brave decision. 
No special needs schools. 
No labels. 
No limitations. 
My ability and my potential. 
And they decided to tell me that I could see. 
So just like Johnny Cash's Sue, a boy given a girl's name, I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive, when they were no longer there to protect me, or just take it all away. 
But more significantly, they gave me the ability to believe, totally, to believe that I could. 
And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things, a big fat "no," everybody imagines I was devastated. 
And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it -- aside from the fact that I thought he was insane -- I got that thump in my chest, just that "huh?" 
But very quickly I recovered. It was like that. 
The first thing I thought about was my mom, who was crying over beside me. 
And I swear to God, I walked out of his office, "I will drive. I will drive. 
You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive." 
And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child -- he taught me how to sail, knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore, and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination. 
But he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face. 
And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive. 
And for the next 11 years, I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see, because I didn't want to be a failure, and I didn't want to be weak. 
And I believed I could do it. 
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do. 
And I was an archeologist, and then I broke things. 
And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things. 
And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener. 
And then I went to business school. 
And you know, disabled people are hugely educated. 
And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture. 
And they didn't even know. 
And it's extraordinary how far belief can take you. 
In 1999, two and a half years into that job, something happened. 
Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough. 
And temporarily, very unexpectedly, they dropped. 
And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world, where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best. 
And two years in, I really could see very little. 
And I found myself in front of an HR manager in 1999, saying something I never imagined that I would say. 
I was 28 years old. 
I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do. 
And I simply said, "I'm sorry. 
I can't see, and I need help." 
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult. 
And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that. 
We all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure. 
And it's frightening, isn't it? 
But all that belief had fueled me so long. 
And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see, it's kind of difficult -- it really is. 
Can I tell you, airports are a disaster. 
Oh, for the love of God. 
And please, any designers out there? 
OK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you. 
I always end up in the gents' toilets. 
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell. 
But can I just tell you, the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle. 
Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes? 
It's such a small thing, right? 
And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you're not, or to be somebody that you aren't? 
And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR, they sent me off to an eye specialist. 
And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life. 
But before I got to him, I was so lost. 
I had no idea who I was anymore. 
And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes. 
God no, it was therapy. 
And he asked me several questions, of which many were, "Why? 
Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself? 
And do you love what you do, Caroline?" 
And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm, they put a chip in your head, and you're like, "I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture. 
I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter) To leave would be failure. 
And he said, "Do you love it?" 
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up. 
I just was so -- how do I tell him? 
And then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?" 
Now listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes." 
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time. 
He thought I was mad enough anyway. 
And as I left his office, he called me back and he said, "I think it's time. 
I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different." 
And that door closed. 
And that silence just outside a doctor's office, that many of us know. 
And my chest ached. 
And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea. 
But I did know the game was up. 
And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much, I thought, "I'll go out for a run." 
Really not a very sensible thing to do. 
And I went on a run that I know so well. 
I know this run so well, by the back of my hand. 
I always run it perfectly fine. 
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with. 
And there was a rock that I always missed. 
And I'd never fallen on it, never. 
And there I was crying away, and smash, bash on my rock. 
Broken, fallen over on this rock in the middle of March in 2000, typical Irish weather on a Wednesday -- gray, snot, tears everywhere, ridiculously self-pitying. 
And I was floored, and I was broken, and I was angry. 
And I didn't know what to do. 
And I sat there for quite some time going, "How am I going to get off this rock and go home? 
Because who am I going to be? 
What am I going to be?" 
And I thought about my dad, and I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now." 
And I kept thinking over and over in my mind, what had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand? 
And you know, the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers. 
I had lost my belief. 
Look where my belief had brought me to. 
And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see. 
I was crumpled. 
And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be? 
What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do? 
Do something different. What do you want to be? 
Do something different. What do you want to be?" 
And really slowly, slowly, slowly, it happened. 
And it did happen this way. 
And then the minute it came, it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart -- something different. 
"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'? 
You don't get more different than that." 
And the moment, and I mean the moment, the moment that hit me, I swear to God, it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in. 
And nobody can tell me no. 
Yes, you can say I can't be an archeologist. 
But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what? 
Nobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it. 
And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot. 
And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home. 
And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash. 
And I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time, "Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand -- I don't know if any of you know it. 
And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch going, "I know what I'm going to do. 
I know how to be Mowgli. 
I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant. 
I'm going to be an elephant handler." 
And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler. 
From global management consultant to elephant handler. 
I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant. 
I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue. 
But I knew I would. 
Because, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place, God, that universe makes it happen for you. 
Nine months later, after that day on snot rock, I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi. 
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India. 
(Applause) The most powerful thing of all, it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did. 
But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing. 
Because I wasn't believing in me, really me, all the bits of me -- all the bits of all of us. 
Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not? 
And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you, it's extraordinary what happens. 
And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers, it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations. 
Six thousand people got to see because of that. 
When I came home off that elephant, do you know what the most amazing part was? 
I chucked in my job at Accenture. 
I left, and I became a social entrepreneur, and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family, which deals with Asian elephant conservation. 
And I set up Kanchi, because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant, because disability is like the elephant in the room. 
And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way -- no charity, no pity. 
But I wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible. 
It was extraordinary. 
That's what I wanted to do. 
And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing, or any of that kind of nothing. 
It just seemed that it was possible. 
And you know, the oddest part is, when I was on my way traveling here to TED, I'll be honest, I was petrified. 
And I speak, but this is an amazing audience, and what am I doing here? 
But as I was traveling here, you'll be very happy to know, I did use my white symbol stick cane, because it's really good to skip queues in the airport. 
And I got my way here being happily proud that I couldn't see. 
And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine, he texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared. 
Even though I present confident, I was scared. 
He said, "Be you." 
And so here I am. 
This is me, all of me. 
(Applause) And I have learned, you know what, cars and motorbikes and elephants, that's not freedom. 
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom. 
And I never needed eyes to see -- never. 
I simply needed vision and belief. 
And if you truly believe -- and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart -- you can make change happen. 
And we need to make it happen, because every single one of us -- woman, man, gay, straight, disabled, perfect, normal, whatever -- everyone of us must be the very best of ourselves. 
I no longer want anybody to be invisible. 
We all have to be included. 
And stop with the labels, the limiting. 
Losing of labels, because we are not jam jars. 
We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

(Applause) Thank you.

First, a video. 
Yes, it is a scrambled egg. 
But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy. 
Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself. 
And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated. 
And now they're going to be poured back into the egg. 
And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works. 
A scrambled egg is mush -- tasty mush -- but it's mush. 
An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things, such as chickens. 
And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity. 
In fact, this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics, the second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy. 
What that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order, lack of structure -- in fact, to mush. 
And that's why that video feels a bit strange. 
And yet, look around us. 
What we see around us is staggering complexity. 
Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone, there are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded. 
That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth. 
And they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals, who are linked by trade, travel, and the Internet into a global system of stupendous complexity. 
So here's a great puzzle: in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics, how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described, the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center? 
Well, the answer seems to be, the universe can create complexity, but with great difficulty. 
In pockets, there appear what my colleague, Fred Spier, calls "Goldilocks conditions" -- not too hot, not too cold, just right for the creation of complexity. 
And slightly more complex things appear. 
And where you have slightly more complex things, you can get slightly more complex things. 
And in this way, complexity builds stage by stage. 
Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe. 
We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments. 
And at each threshold, the going gets tougher. 
The complex things get more fragile, more vulnerable; the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent, and it's more difficult to create complexity. 
Now, we, as extremely complex creatures, desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law, and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility. 
And that's the story that we tell in big history. 
But to do it, you have do something that may, at first sight, seem completely impossible. 
You have to survey the whole history of the universe. 
So let's do it. 
(Laughter) Let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years, to the beginning of time. 
Around us, there's nothing. 
There's not even time or space. 
Imagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are. 
And then suddenly, bang! 
And we've crossed our first threshold. 
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom. 
It's incredibly hot. 
It contains everything that's in today's universe, so you can imagine, it's busting. 
And it's expanding at incredible speed. 
And at first, it's just a blur, but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur. 
Within the first second, energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity. 
And energy does something else quite magical: it congeals to form matter -- quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons. 
And all of that happens in the first second. 
Now we move forward 380,000 years. 
That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet. 
And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium. 
Now I want to pause for a moment, 380,000 years after the origins of the universe, because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage. 
We know above all that it was extremely simple. 
It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms, and they have no structure. 
They're really a sort of cosmic mush. 
But that's not completely true. 
Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that, in fact, there are just tiny differences in that background. 
What you see here, the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas. 
These are tiny differences, but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity. 
And this is how it works. 
Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff. 
So where you get slightly denser areas, gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms. 
So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds. 
And each cloud is compacted, gravity gets more powerful as density increases, the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud, and then, at the center, the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees, protons start to fuse, there's a huge release of energy, and -- bam! 
From about 200 million years after the Big Bang, stars begin to appear all through the universe, billions of them. 
And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex. 
Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds. 
When very large stars die, they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations, to form all the elements of the periodic table. 
If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring, it was forged in a supernova explosion. 
So now the universe is chemically more complex. 
And in a chemically more complex universe, it's possible to make more things. 
And what starts happening is that, around young suns, young stars, all these elements combine, they swirl around, the energy of the star stirs them around, they form particles, they form snowflakes, they form little dust motes, they form rocks, they form asteroids, and eventually, they form planets and moons. 
And that is how our solar system was formed, four and a half billion years ago. 
Rocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials. 
So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity. 
Now, the going gets tougher. 
The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile, significantly more vulnerable, but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity. 
I'm talking, of course, about living organisms. 
Living organisms are created by chemistry. 
We are huge packages of chemicals. 
So, chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force. 
That operates over smaller scales than gravity, which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets. 
Now, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry? 
What are the Goldilocks conditions? 
Well, first, you need energy, but not too much. 
In the center of a star, there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again. 
But not too little. 
In intergalactic space, there's so little energy that atoms can't combine. 
What you want is just the right amount, and planets, it turns out, are just right, because they're close to stars, but not too close. 
You also need a great diversity of chemical elements, and you need liquids, such as water. 
Why? 
Well, in gases, atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up. 
In solids, atoms are stuck together, they can't move. 
In liquids, they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules. 
Now, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions? 
Well, planets are great, and our early Earth was almost perfect. 
It was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water. 
And deep beneath those oceans, at cracks in the Earth's crust, you've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth, and you've got a great diversity of elements. 
So at those deep oceanic vents, fantastic chemistry began to happen, and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations. 
But of course, life is more than just exotic chemistry. 
How do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable? 
Well, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick. 
You don't stabilize the individual; you stabilize the template, the thing that carries information, and you allow the template to copy itself. 
And DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule that contains that information. 
You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA. 
Each rung contains information. 
So, DNA contains information about how to make living organisms. 
And DNA also copies itself. 
So, it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean. 
So the information spreads. 
The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections. 
As it copies itself, once in every billion rungs, there tends to be an error. 
And what that means is that DNA is, in effect, learning. 
It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work. 
So DNA's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity. 
And we can see this happening over the last four billion years. 
For most of that time of life on Earth, living organisms have been relatively simple -- single cells. 
But they had great diversity, and, inside, great complexity. 
Then from about 600 to 800 million years ago, multi-celled organisms appear. 
You get fungi, you get fish, you get plants, you get amphibia, you get reptiles, and then, of course, you get the dinosaurs. 
And occasionally, there are disasters. 
Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula, creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war, and the dinosaurs were wiped out. 
Terrible news for the dinosaurs, but great news for our mammalian ancestors, who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs. 
And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid. 
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago. 
And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story. 
Let me explain why. 
We've seen that DNA learns in a sense, it accumulates information. 
But it is so slow. 
DNA accumulates information through random errors, some of which just happen to work. 
But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning: it had produced organisms with brains, and those organisms can learn in real time. 
They accumulate information, they learn. 
The sad thing is, when they die, the information dies with them. 
Now what makes humans different is human language. 
We are blessed with a language, a system of communication, so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory. 
And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information, and it can accumulate from generation to generation. 
And that's why, as a species, we're so creative and so powerful, and that's why we have a history. 
We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift. 
I call this ability collective learning. 
It's what makes us different. 
We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history. 
We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa, but then you see humans migrating into new environments, into desert lands, into jungles, into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia -- tough, tough environment -- into the Americas, into Australasia. 
Each migration involved learning -- learning new ways of exploiting the environment, new ways of dealing with their surroundings. 
Then 10,000 years ago, exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age, humans learned to farm. 
Farming was an energy bonanza. 
And exploiting that energy, human populations multiplied. 
Human societies got larger, denser, more interconnected. 
And then from about 500 years ago, humans began to link up globally through shipping, through trains, through telegraph, through the Internet, until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals. 
And in the last 200 years, something else has happened. 
We've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels. 
So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us. 
So -- Here we are, back at the convention center. 
We've been on a journey, a return journey, of 13.7 billion years. 
I hope you agree this is a powerful story. 
And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role. 
But it also contains warnings. 
Collective learning is a very, very powerful force, and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it. 
I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England, living through the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
For a few days, the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction. 
And the same weapons are still here, and they are still armed. 
If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us. 
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years. 
So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power with collective learning. 
And now, finally -- this is what I want. 
I want my grandson, Daniel, and his friends and his generation, throughout the world, to know the story of big history, and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us. 
And that's why a group of us are building a free, online syllabus in big history for high-school students throughout the world. 
We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them, as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet. 
I thank you for your attention. 
(Applause) 

How often do we hear that people just don't care? 
How many times have you been told that real, substantial change isn't possible because most people are too selfish, too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community? 
I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist; but rather, that people do care, but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way. 
I'll give you some examples of what I mean. 
Let's start with city hall. 
You ever see one of these before? 
It's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what's happening. 
As you can see, it's impossible to read. 
You need to get halfway down to even find out which address they're talking about, and then further down, in tiny 10-point font, to find out how to actually get involved. 
Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way -- if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes -- (Laughter) And put an ad in the paper like that. 
(Applause) Now, that would never happen. 
You'll never see an ad like that, because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes, whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process, otherwise their ads would look something like this, with all the information laid out clearly. 
As long as the city's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged, then of course people aren't going to be engaged. 
But that's not apathy; that's intentional exclusion. 
Public space. 
(Applause) The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change, because we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression. 
Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice, dominating the visual and mental environment. 
The problem with this model is there are some amazing messages that need to be said, that aren't profitable to say. 
So you're never going to see them on a billboard. 
The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change, mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals, but even when they do talk about important political issues, they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement. 
I'll give you an example. 
The "Now" magazine from last week: progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto. 
This is the cover story. 
It's an article about a theater performance, and it starts with basic information about where it is, in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article -- where, the time, the website. 
Same with this -- it's a movie review. 
An art review. 
A book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go. 
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it, maybe you want to go there. 
So they tell you where it is, the prices, the address, the phone number, etc. 
Then you get to their political articles. 
Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening. 
It talks about the candidates, written very well, but no information, no follow-up, no websites for the campaigns, no information about when the debates are, where the campaign offices are. 
Here's another good article, about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit, without any contact information for the campaign. 
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat, maybe read a book, maybe see a movie, but not be engaged in their community. 
You might think this is a small thing, but I think it's important, because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport. 
Heroes: How do we view leadership? 
Look at these 10 movies. What do they have in common? 
Anyone? 
They all have heroes who were chosen. 
There's a prophecy. You have to save the world." 
And then they go off and save the world because they've been told to, with a few people tagging along. 
This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders -- because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about. 
A heroic effort is a collective effort, number one. 
Number two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous, and doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end. 
It's an ongoing process your whole life. 
But most importantly, it's voluntary. 
It's voluntary. 
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead, or someone tells you you're part of a prophecy, they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership, which is that it comes from within. 
It's about following your own dreams, uninvited, and then working with others to make those dreams come true. 
Political parties: oh, boy. 
Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics. 
Instead, they've become, sadly, uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing, pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas. 
And people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism. 
(Applause) Charitable status. 
Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy. 
This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change, because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced, especially during election time. 
Which leads us to the last one, which is: our elections. 
As you may have noticed, our elections in Canada are a complete joke. 
We use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results. 
Canada's currently led by a party that most Canadians didn't actually want. 
How can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don't count in Canada? 
You add all this up together, and of course people are apathetic. 
It's like trying to run into a brick wall. 
Now, I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what's in our way. 
Quite the opposite -- I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care, but that, as I said, we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way. 
As long as we believe that people, our own neighbors, are selfish, stupid or lazy, then there's no hope. 
But we can change all those things I mentioned. 
We can open up city hall. 
We can democratize our public spaces. 
My main message is: if we can redefine apathy, not as some kind of internal syndrome, but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement, and if we can clearly define, clearly identify what those obstacles are, and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles, then anything is possible. 
(Applause) 

There's a question I've been puzzling over and writing about for pretty much all of my adult life. 
Why do some large-scale crises jolt us awake and inspire us to change and evolve while others might jolt us a bit, but then it's back to sleep? 
Now, the kind of shocks I'm talking about are big -- a cataclysmic market crash, rising fascism, an industrial accident that poisons on a massive scale. 
Now, events like this can act like a collective alarm bell. 
Suddenly, we see a threat, we get organized. 
We discover strength and resolve that was previously unimaginable. 
It's as if we're no longer walking, but leaping. 
Except, our collective alarm seems to be busted. 
Faced with a crisis, we often fall apart, regress and that becomes a window for antidemocratic forces to push societies backwards, to become more unequal and more unstable. 
Ten years ago, I wrote about this backwards process and I called it the "Shock Doctrine." 
So what determines which road we navigate through crisis? 
Whether we grow up fast and find those strengths or whether we get knocked back. 
And I'd say this is a pressing question these days. 
Because things are pretty shocking out there. 
Record-breaking storms, drowning cities, record-breaking fires threatening to devour them, thousands of migrants disappearing beneath the waves. 
And openly supremacist movements rising, in many of our countries there are torches in the streets. 
And now there's no shortage of people who are sounding the alarm. 
But as a society, I don't think we can honestly say that we're responding with anything like the urgency that these overlapping crises demand from us. 
And yet, we know from history that it is possible for crisis to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap. 
And one of the most striking examples of this progressive power of crisis is the Great Crash of 1929. 
There was the shock of the sudden market collapse followed by all of the aftershocks, the millions who lost everything thrown onto breadlines. 
And this was taken by many as a message that the system itself was broken. 
And many people listened and they leapt into action. 
In the United States and elsewhere, governments began to weave a safety net so that the next time there was a crash there would be programs like social security to catch people. 
There were huge job-creating public investments in housing, electrification and transit. 
And there was a wave of aggressive regulation to reign in the banks. 
Now, these reforms were far from perfect. 
In the US, African American workers, immigrants and women were largely excluded. 
But the Depression period, along with the transformation of allied nations and economies during the World War II effort, show us that it is possible for complex societies to rapidly transform themselves in the face of a collective threat. 
Now, when we tell this story of the 1929 Crash, that's usually the formula that it follows -- that there was a shock and it induced a wake-up call and that produced a leap to a safer place. 
Now, if that's really what it took, then why isn't it working anymore? 
Why do today's non-stop shocks -- why don't they spur us into action? 
Why don't they produce leaps? 
Especially when it comes to climate change. 
So I want to talk to you today about what I think is a much more complete recipe for deep transformation catalyzed by shocking events. 
And I'm going to focus on two key ingredients that usually get left out of the history books. 
One has to do with imagination, the other with organization. 
Because it's in the interplay between the two where revolutionary power lies. 
So let's start with imagination. 
The victories of the New Deal didn't happen just because suddenly everybody understood the brutalities of laissez-faire. 
This was a time, let's remember, of tremendous ideological ferment, when many different ideas about how to organize societies did battle with one another in the public square. 
A time when humanity dared to dream big about different kinds of futures, many of them organized along radically egalitarian lines. 
Now, not all of these ideas were good but this was an era of explosive imagining. 
This meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against -- crushing poverty, widening inequality -- but just as important, they knew what they were for. 
They had their "no" and they had their "yes," too. 
They also had very different models of political organization than we do today. 
For decades, social and labor movements had been building up their membership bases, linking their causes together and increasing their strength. 
Which meant that by the time the Crash happened, there was already a movement that was large and broad enough to, for instance, stage strikes that didn't just shut down factories, but shut down entire cities. 
The big policy wins of the New Deal were actually offered as compromises. 
Because the alternative seemed to be revolution. 
So, let's adjust that equation from earlier. 
A shocking event plus utopian imagination plus movement muscle, that's how we get a real leap. 
So how does our present moment measure up? 
We are living, once again, at a time of extraordinary political engagements. 
Politics is a mass obsession. 
Progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage. 
And yet, we know from history that "no" is not enough. 
Now, there are some "yeses" out there that are emerging. 
And they're actually getting a lot bolder quickly. 
Where climate activists used to talk about changing light bulbs, now we're pushing for 100 percent of our energy to come from the sun, wind and waves, and to do it fast. 
Movements catalyzed by police violence against black bodies are calling for an end to militarized police, mass incarceration and even for reparations for slavery. 
Students are not just opposing tuition increases, but from Chile to Canada to the UK, they are calling for free tuition and debt cancellation. 
And yet, this still doesn't add up to the kind of holistic and universalist vision of a different world than our predecessors had. 
So why is that? 
Well, very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days. 
Environment in one box, inequality in another, racial and gender justice in a couple of other boxes, education over here, health over there. 
And within each compartment, there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGOs, each competing with one another for credit, name recognition and of course, resources. 
In other words, we act a lot like corporate brands. 
Now, this is often referred to as the problem of silos. 
Now, silos are understandable. 
They carve up our complex world into manageable chunks. 
They help us feel less overwhelmed. 
But in the process, they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue comes up and when somebody else's issue needs our help and support. 
And they also keep us from seeing glaring connections between our issues. 
So for instance, the people fighting poverty and inequality rarely talk about climate change. 
Even though we see time and again that it's the poorest of people who are the most vulnerable to extreme weather. 
The climate change people rarely talk about war and occupation. 
Even though we know that the thirst for fossil fuels has been a major driver of conflict. 
The environmental movement has gotten better at pointing out that the nations that are getting hit hardest by climate change are populated overwhelmingly by black and brown people. 
But when black lives are treated as disposable in prisons, in schools and on the streets, these connections are too rarely made. 
The walls between our silos also means that our solutions, when they emerge, are also disconnected from each other. 
So progressives now have this long list of demands that I was mentioning earlier, those "yeses." 
But what we're still missing is that coherent picture of the world we're fighting for. 
What it looks like, what it feels like, and most of all, what its core values are. 
And that really matters. 
Because when large-scale crises hit us and we are confronted with the need to leap somewhere safer, there isn't any agreement on what that place is. 
And leaping without a destination looks a lot like jumping up and down. 
(Laughter) Fortunately, there are all kinds of conversations and experiments going on to try to overcome these divisions that are holding us back. 
And I want to finish by talking about one of them. 
A couple of years ago, a group of us in Canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish in our various silos. 
So we locked ourselves in a room for two days, and we tried to figure out what bound us together. 
In that room were people who rarely get face to face. 
There were indigenous elders with hipsters working on transit. 
There was the head of Greenpeace with a union leader representing oil workers and loggers. 
There were faith leaders and feminist icons and many more. 
And we gave ourselves a pretty ambitious assignment: agreeing on a short statement describing the world after we win. 
The world after we've already made the transition to a clean economy and a much fairer society. 
In other words, instead of trying to scare people about what will happen if we don't act, we decided to try to inspire them with what could happen if we did act. 
Sensible people are always telling us that change needs to come in small increments. 
That politics is the art of the possible and that we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
Well, we rejected all of that. 
We wrote a manifesto, and we called it "The Leap." 
I have to tell you that agreeing on our common "yes" across such diversity of experiences and against a backdrop of a lot of painful history was not easy work. 
But it was also pretty thrilling. 
Because as soon as we gave ourselves permission to dream, those threads connecting much of our work became self-evident. 
We realized, for instance, that the bottomless quest for profits that is forcing so many people to work more than 50 hours a week, without security, and that is fueling this epidemic of despair is the same quest for bottomless profits and endless growth that is at the heart of our ecological crisis and is destabilizing our planet. 
It also became clear what we need to do. 
We need to create a culture of care-taking. 
In which no one and nowhere is thrown away. 
In which the inherent value of all people and every ecosystem is foundational. 
So we came up with this people's platform, and don't worry, I'm not going to read the whole thing to you out loud -- if you're interested, you can read it at theleap.org. 
But I will give you a taste of what we came up with. 
So we call for that 100 percent renewable economy in a hurry, but we went further. 
Calls for new kinds of trade deals, a robust debate on a guaranteed annual income, full rights for immigrant workers, getting corporate money out of politics, free universal day care, electoral reform and more. 
What we discovered is that a great many of us are looking for permission to act less like brands and more like movements. 
Because movements don't care about credit. 
They want good ideas to spread far and wide. 
What I love about The Leap is that it rejects the idea that there is this hierarchy of crisis, and it doesn't ask anyone to prioritize one struggle over another or wait their turn. 
And though it was birthed in Canada, we've discovered that it travels well. 
Since we launched, The Leap has been picked up around the world with similar platforms, being written from Nunavut to Australia, to Norway to the UK and the US, where it's gaining a lot of traction in cities like Los Angeles, where it's being localized. 
And also in rural communities that are traditionally very conservative, but where politics is failing the vast majority of people. 
Here's what I've learned from studying shocks and disasters for two decades. 
Crises test us. 
We either fall apart or we grow up fast. 
Finding new reserves of strength and capacity that we never knew we had. 
The shocking events that fill us with dread today can transform us, and they can transform the world for the better. 
But first we need to picture the world that we're fighting for. 
And we have to dream it up together. 
Right now, every alarm in our house is going off simultaneously. 
It's time to listen. 
It's time to leap. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I am a vicar in the Church of England. 
I've been a priest in the Church for 20 years. 
For most of that time, I've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of God. Who is God? 
And I'm very aware that when you say the word "God," many people will turn off immediately. 
And most people, both within and outside the organized church, still have a picture of a celestial controller, a rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything, and causes everything to happen. 
He will protect his own people, and answer the prayers of the faithful. 
And in the worship of my church, the most frequently used adjective about God is "almighty." 
But I have a problem with that. 
I have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the years. 
Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years? 
Of course, there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at God. 
Exploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity. 
Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness, rather than power. 
Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition. 
Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning. 
These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles, but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them, for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities, for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers. 
I have chosen not to rock the boat. 
Then, on December 26th last year, just two months ago, that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami. 
And two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January, I found myself standing in front of my congregation -- intelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people -- and I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions. 
I had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role, and something needed to be said. 
And this is what I said. 
Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article written by the Archbishop of Canterbury -- fine title -- about the tragedy in Southern Asia. 
The essence of what he said was this: the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen. 
He wrote, "If some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense, would we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?" 
If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers, holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now, there are no words that we could say to him. 
A verbal response would not be appropriate. 
The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help. 
It isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology; it's a time for tears. 
This is true. And yet here we are, my church in Oxford, semi-detached from events that happened a long way away, but with our faith bruised. 
And we want an explanation from God. 
We demand an explanation from God. 
Some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain. 
In some way, God must feel the anguish, and grief, and physical pain that we feel. 
In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within. 
And if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit, as well. 
We want a God who can weep with those who weep, and rejoice with those who rejoice. 
This seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement of Christian belief about God. 
For hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth, was that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness. 
Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me. 
And the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold, unfeeling God. 
The slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask, "Where is God in all this? 
Who is God in all this?" 
And the answer was, "God is in this with us, or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore." 
If God is a bystander, observing but not involved, then God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him. 
Many Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know. 
And I am among them. 
So we have a suffering God -- a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul. 
I very much relate to this idea of God. 
But it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions, and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well, some of you. 
Over the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate, a bit dodgy. 
We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children. 
And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs, "The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock." 
Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this: "The foolish man built his house upon the sand / And the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash." 
Then in the same week, at a funeral, we sang the familiar hymn "We Plow the Fields and Scatter," a very English hymn. 
In the second verse comes the line, "The wind and waves obey Him." 
Do they? I don't feel we can sing that song again in church, after what's happened. 
So the first big question is about control. 
Does God have a plan for each of us? Is God in control? 
Does God order each moment? Does the wind and the waves obey Him? 
From time to time, one hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them, so that everything worked out all right -- some difficulty overcome, some illness cured, some trouble averted, a parking space found at a crucial time. 
I can remember someone saying this to me, with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God. 
But if God can or will do these things -- intervene to change the flow of events -- then surely he could have stopped the tsunami. 
Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces, but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves? 
That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians, and we must acknowledge it. 
Either God is responsible for the tsunami, or God is not in control. 
After the tragedy, survival stories began to emerge. 
You probably heard some of them: the man who surfed the wave, the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school. 
Then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the hills. 
The preacher delivered an extra long sermon, so that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck. 
Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them. 
So the next question is about partiality. 
Can we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him? 
Does God demand loyalty, like any medieval tyrant? 
A God who looks after His own, so that Christians are OK, while everyone else perishes? 
A cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism? 
That would be appalling, and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership. 
Such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity. 
So who is God, if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector? 
Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen, so that heroism and compassion can be shown. 
Perhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith. 
Perhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out OK in the end. 
Perhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything, the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign. 
We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz. 
In his great novel, "The Brothers Karamazov," Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan, addressed to his naive and devout younger brother, Alyosha: "If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth, then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price. 
We cannot afford to pay so much for admission. 
It is not God that I do not accept. 
I merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket." 
Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever, so that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course. 
This seems more acceptable, but it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility. 
Is God a cold, unfeeling spectator? 
Or a powerless lover, watching with infinite compassion things God is unable to control or change? 
Is God intimately involved in our suffering, so that He feels it in His own being? 
If we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely, take our leave of the almighty controller, abandon traditional models. 
We must think again about God. 
Maybe God doesn't do things at all. 
Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents. 
Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person, doing things all over the place. 
Beating up the Egyptians, drowning them in the Red Sea, wasting cities, getting angry. 
The people knew their God by His mighty acts. 
But what if God doesn't act? What if God doesn't do things at all? 
What if God is in things? 
The loving soul of the universe. 
An in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things. 
What if God is in things? 
In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life. 
In the natural cycle of life and death, the creation and destruction that must happen continuously. 
In the process of evolution. 
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world. 
In the collective unconscious, the soul of the human race. 
In you, in me, mind and body and spirit. 
In the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things. 
In presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity. 
In change and development and growth. 
How does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work? 
It's hard to conceive, and begs more questions. 
Is God just another name for the universe, with no independent existence at all? 
I don't know. 
To what extent can we ascribe personality to God? 
I don't know. 
In the end, we have to say, "I don't know." 
If we knew, God would not be God. 
To have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe, and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements. 
Isn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe in an infinite, unknowable being then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines? 
How could one practice such a faith? 
By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness. 
In silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations. 
In awareness of the inner conversation. 
And how would we live such a faith? How would I live such a faith? 
By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness. 
The kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep. 
If God is in all people, then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter. 
There is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know: "Namaste," accompanied by a respectful bow, which, roughly translated means, "That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you." 
Namaste. 
And how would one deepen such a faith? 
By seeking the inwardness which is in all things. 
In music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life, there is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary. 
It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting, a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own. 
When I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami, I had no answers to offer them. 
No neat packages of faith, with Bible references to prove them. 
Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty. 
I had some suggestions to make -- possible new ways of thinking about God. 
Ways that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road. 
But in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, "I don't know," and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all. 
Thank you. 

I am the daughter of a forger, not just any forger ... 
When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary." 
You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures." 
My father is no such man. 
For 30 years of his life, he made false papers -- never for himself, always for other people, and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed. 
Let me introduce him. 
Here is my father at age 19. 
It all began for him during World War II, when at age 17 he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop. 
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance. 
And it's not a banal story -- after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the '70s. 
When I was a child I knew nothing about this, of course. 
This is me in the middle making faces. 
I grew up in the Paris suburbs and I was the youngest of three children. 
I had a "normal" dad like everybody else, apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ... 
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather. 
Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator, and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly. 
And, of course, he never talked about his past life when he was a forger. 
There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about, that perhaps could have led me suspect something. 
I was in high school and got a bad grade, a rare event for me, so I decided to hide it from my parents. 
In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature. 
I started working on my mother's signature, because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge. 
So, I got working. I took some sheets of paper and started practicing, practicing, practicing, until I reached what I thought was a steady hand, and went into action. 
Later, while checking my school bag, my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged. 
She yelled at me like she never had before. 
I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets, and then I waited for my father to come back from work with, one could say, much apprehension. 
I heard him come in. 
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room, sat on the corner of the bed, and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head, and when he saw me he started laughing. 
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand. 
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?" 
Indeed, it's rather small. 
I was born in Algeria. 
There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid" and that means "fighter." 
Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations, and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life, especially that he had "done" World War II, that he had "done" the Algerian war. 
And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier. 
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent, I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun. 
And indeed, I was very far from the mark. 
One day, while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality, I happened to see some documents that caught my attention. 
These are real! 
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean. 
But the document I happened to see that would help us build a case for the authorities was a document from the army that thanked my father for his work on behalf of the secret services. 
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!" 
My father, a secret agent? 
It was very James Bond. 
I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer. 
And later, I told myself that one day I would have to question him. 
And then I became a mother and had a son, and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us. 
I had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday, and suddenly I was very, very afraid. 
I feared he'd go and take his silences with him, and take his secrets with him. 
I managed to convince him that it was important for us, but possibly also for other people that he shared his story. 
He decided to tell it to me and I made a book, from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later. 
So, his story. My father was born in Argentina. 
His parents were of Russian descent. 
The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s. 
His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor. 
So at the age of 14 my father had to work. 
And with his only diploma, his primary education certificate, he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner. 
That's where he discovered something totally magical, and when he talks about it, it's fascinating -- it's the magic of dyeing chemistry. 
During that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15. 
This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness. 
All day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge, and at night, when no one was looking, he'd put his experience to practice. 
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching. 
All this to tell you that if my father became a forger, actually, it was almost by accident. 
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded. 
Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers. 
Well, they were out, but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers. 
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents. 
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law that although he was being persecuted, he'd never thought of false papers. 
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance. 
In those times documents had hard covers, they were filled in by hand, and they stated your job. 
In order to survive, he needed to be working. He asked the man to write "dyer." 
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested. 
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks? 
Of course he knew. 
And suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem: even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible," the "Waterman" blue ink. 
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly how to bleach it. 
Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17 who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him. 
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case: the so-called "correction pen." 
(Applause) But it was only the beginning. 
That's my father. 
As soon as he got to the lab, even though he was the youngest, he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents. 
All the movements stopped at falsifying. 
But demand was ever-growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents. 
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch. 
He started a press. He started photoengraving. 
He started making rubber stamps. 
He started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel. 
Anyway, he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output. 
He had made a simple calculation: In one hour he could make 30 forged documents. 
If he slept one hour, 30 people would die. 
This sense of responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 -- and also his guilt for being a survivor, since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not -- stayed with him all his life. 
And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years, he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices. 
I'd like to talk about those sacrifices, because there were many. 
There were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid. 
To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary. 
If he had accepted payment, he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no" depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause. 
So he was a photographer by day, and a forger by night for 30 years. 
He was broke all of the time. 
Then there were the emotional sacrifices: How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets? 
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night? 
Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that I understood much later. 
One day my father introduced me to my sister. 
He also explained to me that I had a brother, too, and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four, and they were 30 years older than me. 
They are both in their sixties now. 
In order to write the book, I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was, who was the father she had known. 
She explained that the father that she'd had would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk. 
They would get all dressed up and wait for him, but he would almost never come. 
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call. 
And then he would not come. 
Then one day he totally disappeared. 
Time passed, and they thought he had surely forgotten them, at first. 
Then as time passed, at the end of almost two years, they thought, "Well, perhaps our father has died." 
And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful. 
And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned, orphaned, my father was making false papers. 
And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them. 
After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel. 
And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist, he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war. 
After the Algerian war, at the heart of the international resistance movements, his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door. 
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola. 
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party. 
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans. 
There was also Latin America. 
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico. 
Then there was the Vietnam War. 
My father made false papers for the American deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese. 
Europe was not spared either. 
My father made false papers for the dissidents against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece, and even in France. 
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968. 
My father watched, benevolently, of course, the demonstrations of the month of May, but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve. 
Once, though, he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize. 
(Laughter) He was much younger in those days, and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting. 
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life. 
But, he agreed to do it, even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger, just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities, and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders -- and that ideas have no borders. 
All my childhood, while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales, my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles. 
And those heroes did not need an army behind them. 
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them, except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage. 
I understood much later that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep. 
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make, he ever had any regrets. 
He said no. 
He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything. 
He was persuaded, and he's still convinced that another world is possible -- a world where no one would ever need a forger. 
He's still dreaming about it. 
My father is here in the room today. 
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up. 
(Applause) Thank you. 

Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice. 
This is Alex, the best computer voice I've been able to find, which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh. 
For most of my life, I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak. 
It was like breathing. 
In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise. 
After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak, eat or drink, I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me. 
For several days now, we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED. 
I used to be able to talk like that. 
Maybe I wasn't as smart, but I was at least as talkative. 
I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. 
However, I've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous. 
So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me. 
I will start with my wife, Chaz. 
Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. 
Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006, I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show, 'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.' I had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation. 
The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. 
My tongue, larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected. 
(Laughter) (Laughter) CE: I was optimistic, and all was right with the world. 
The first surgery was a great success. 
I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good. 
Two weeks later, I was ready to return home. 
I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song 'I'm Your Man' for my doctors and nurses. 
Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding. 
My carotid artery had ruptured. 
Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there. 
Chaz told me that if that song hadn't played for so long, I might have already been in the car, on the way home, and would have died right there and then. 
So thank you, Leonard Cohen, for saving my life. 
(Applause) There was a second surgery -- which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart. 
And then a third attempt, which also patched me back together pretty well, until it failed. 
A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. 
And before I left the hospital, after a year of being hospitalized, I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery. 
There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again; it just sort of became obvious. 
Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system. 
We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. 
Therefore, the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air. 
Because I had lost my jaw, I could no longer form a seal, and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless. 
Dean Ornish: At first for a long time, I wrote messages in notebooks. 
Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice. 
This was faster, and nobody had to try to read my handwriting. 
I tried out various computer voices that were available online, and for several months I had a British accent, which Chaz called Sir Lawrence." 
(Laughter) "It was the clearest I could find. 
Then Apple released the Alex voice, which was the best I'd heard. 
It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. 
When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air. 
There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices, and I've experimented with them. 
For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow. 
When I find myself in a conversational situation, I need to type fast and to jump right in. 
People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase. 
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice? 
How does that affect who you are as a person? 
When people hear Alex speaking my words, do they experience a disconnect? 
Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next? 
How did I feel not being able to speak? 
I felt, and I still feel, a lot of distance from the human mainstream. 
I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop. 
Even then, I'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties. 
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years. 
At first I was against it. 
I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer. 
There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. 
But I decided then to just give it a try. 
So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. 
They'd never made one from previously-recorded materials. 
All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. 
But they were willing to give it a try. 
So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice, including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs. 
And it sounded like me, it really did. 
There was a reason for that; it was me. 
But it wasn't that simple. 
The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved -- movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me -- (Laughter) and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough. 
I'll let you hear a sample of that voice. 
These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program. 
And here's the voice we call Roger Jr. 
or Roger 2.0. 
Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show. 
We have been talking for a long time, and now here we are again. 
This is the first version of my computer voice. 
It still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL 9000. 
When I heard it the first time, it sent chills down my spine. 
When I type anything, this voice will speak whatever I type. 
When I read something, it will read in my voice. 
I have typed these words in advance, as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. 
The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. 
It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on "Casablanca" and "Citizen Kane." 
This is the first voice they've created for an individual. 
There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else, while this voice sounds like me. 
I plan to use it on television, radio and the Internet. 
People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems. 
Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves. 
But I've got to say, in first grade, they said I talked too much, and now I still can. 
(Laughter) Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down. 
The flow isn't natural. 
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice, and I'm optimistic about it. 
But so far, the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard. 
I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex. 
He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice. 
A very large sample is needed. 
John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth. 
Now I have spoken my last words, and I don't even remember for sure what they were. 
I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream." 
On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe. 
For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on Earth at all. 
For almost all the years of life on Earth, there was no intelligent life. 
Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next, did civilization become possible. 
In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago. 
Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool, the computer. 
That has mostly happened in my lifetime. 
Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana, the birthplace of HAL 9000. 
When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday, about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world, I had a flashback. 
It was about 1960. 
As a local newspaper reporter still in high school, I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO. 
The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. 
This was a computer-assisted instruction system, which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC. 
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. 
I doubt, on that day 50 years ago, they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished. 
But that's not the point. 
The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago, an instant in time. 
It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers, until only five years ago. 
I have learned from Wikipedia that, starting with that humble beginning, PLATO established forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing and multiple-player games. 
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana, it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today. 
But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce. 
(Laughter) I'm here as a man who wants to communicate. 
All of this has happened in my lifetime. 
I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun-Times. 
I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model 100's. 
And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections, they didn't know what I was talking about. 
When I bought my first desktop, it was a DEC Rainbow. 
Does anybody remember that?" 
(Applause) "The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble. 
I joined CompuServe when it had fewer numbers than I currently have followers on Twitter. 
(Laughter) CE: All of this has happened in the blink of an eye. 
It is unimaginable what will happen next. 
It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history. 
Indeed, I am lucky to live in history at all, because without intelligence and memory there is no history. 
For billions of years, the universe evolved completely without notice. 
Now we live in the age of the Internet, which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. 
And because of it, I can communicate as well as I ever could. 
We are born into a box of time and space. 
We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others. 
For me, the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence. 
I cannot speak; I can only type so fast. 
Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated, but with my computer, I can communicate more widely than ever before. 
I feel as if my blog, my email, Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation. 
They aren't an improvement, but they're the best I can do. 
They give me a way to speak. 
Not everybody has the patience of my wife, Chaz. 
But online, everybody speaks at the same speed. 
This whole adventure has been a learning experience. 
Every time there was a surgery that failed, I was left with a little less flesh and bone. 
Now I have no jaw left at all. 
While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders, the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily. 
Ironic that my legs are fine, and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk. 
When you see me today, I look like the Phantom of the Opera. 
But no you don't. 
(Laughter) (Applause) It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles. 
People -- (Applause) People talk loudly -- I'm so sorry. 
Excuse me. 
(Applause) People talk loudly and slowly to me. 
Sometimes they assume I am deaf. 
There are people who don't want to make eye contact. 
Believe me, he didn't mean this as -- anyway, let me just read it. 
(Laughter) You should never let your wife read something like this. 
(Laughter) It is human nature to look away from illness. 
We don't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality. 
That's why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me. 
My ability to think and write have not been affected. 
And on the Web, my real voice finds expression. 
I have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way. 
One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes. 
One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple. 
(Laughter) Google him and he will make you laugh. 
All of these people are saying, in one way or another, that what you see is not all you get. 
So I have not come here to complain. 
I have much to make me happy and relieved. 
I seem, for the time being, to be cancer-free. 
I am writing as well as ever. 
I am productive. 
If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago, I would be as isolated as a hermit. 
I would be trapped inside my head. 
Because of the rush of human knowledge, because of the digital revolution, I have a voice, and I do not need to scream. 
RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add. 
A guy goes into a psychiatrist. 
The psychiatrist says, "You're crazy." 
The guy says, "I want a second opinion." 
The psychiatrist says, "All right, you're ugly." 
(Laughter) You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test. 
A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer. 
If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human, the machine has passed the test. 
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test. 
If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman, then that's the voice I want. 
(Applause) 

Hi, my name is Marcin -- farmer, technologist. 
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S. 
I started a group called Open Source Ecology. 
We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers. 
Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. 
We call this the Global Village Construction Set. 
So let me tell you a story. 
So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless. 
I had no practical skills. 
The world presented me with options, and I took them. 
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. 
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming. 
I bought a tractor -- then it broke. 
I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again. 
Then pretty soon, I was broke too. 
I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. 
I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low-cost, made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for obsolescence. 
I found that I would have to build them myself. 
So I did just that. 
And I tested them. 
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. 
So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki. 
Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. 
So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines. 
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. 
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. 
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. 
We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. 
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. 
That's not only in the developing world. 
Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker. 
We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. 
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear, so complete, that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit. 
I've planted a hundred trees in a day. 
I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days. 
From what I've seen, this is only the beginning. 
If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant. 
A greater distribution of the means of production, environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity. 
We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm a radio glaciologist. 
That means that I use radar to study glaciers and ice sheets. 
And like most glaciologists right now, I'm working on the problem of estimating how much the ice is going to contribute to sea level rise in the future. 
So today, I want to talk to you about why it's so hard to put good numbers on sea level rise, and why I believe that by changing the way we think about radar technology and earth-science education, we can get much better at it. 
When most scientists talk about sea level rise, they show a plot like this. 
This is produced using ice sheet and climate models. 
On the right, you can see the range of sea level predicted by these models over the next 100 years. 
For context, this is current sea level, and this is the sea level above which more than 4 million people could be vulnerable to displacement. 
So in terms of planning, the uncertainty in this plot is already large. 
However, beyond that, this plot comes with the asterisk and the caveat, "... unless the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapses." 
And in that case, we would be talking about dramatically higher numbers. 
They'd literally be off the chart. 
And the reason we should take that possibility seriously is that we know from the geologic history of the Earth that there were periods in its history when sea level rose much more quickly than today. 
And right now, we cannot rule out the possibility of that happening in the future. 
So why can't we say with confidence whether or not a significant portion of a continent-scale ice sheet will or will not collapse? 
Well, in order to do that, we need models that we know include all of the processes, conditions and physics that would be involved in a collapse like that. 
And that's hard to know, because those processes and conditions are taking place beneath kilometers of ice, and satellites, like the one that produced this image, are blind to observe them. 
In fact, we have much more comprehensive observations of the surface of Mars than we do of what's beneath the Antarctic ice sheet. 
And this is even more challenging in that we need these observations at a gigantic scale in both space and time. 
In terms of space, this is a continent. 
And in the same way that in North America, the Rocky Mountains, Everglades and Great Lakes regions are very distinct, so are the subsurface regions of Antarctica. 
And in terms of time, we now know that ice sheets not only evolve over the timescale of millennia and centuries, but they're also changing over the scale of years and days. 
So what we want is observations beneath kilometers of ice at the scale of a continent, and we want them all the time. 
So how do we do this? 
Well, we're not totally blind to the subsurface. 
I said in the beginning that I was a radio glaciologist, and the reason that that's a thing is that airborne ice-penetrating radar is the main tool we have to see inside of ice sheets. 
So most of the data used by my group is collected by airplanes like this World War II-era DC-3, that actually fought in the Battle of the Bulge. 
You can see the antennas underneath the wing. 
These are used to transmit radar signals down into the ice. 
And the echos that come back contain information about what's happening inside and beneath the ice sheet. 
While this is happening, scientists and engineers are on the airplane for eight hours at a stretch, making sure that the radar's working. 
And I think this is actually a misconception about this type of fieldwork, where people imagine scientists peering out the window, contemplating the landscape, its geologic context and the fate of the ice sheets. 
We actually had a guy from the BBC's "Frozen Planet" on one of these flights. 
And he spent, like, hours videotaping us turn knobs. 
(Laughter) And I was actually watching the series years later with my wife, and a scene like this came up, and I commented on how beautiful it was. 
And she said, "Weren't you on that flight?" 
(Laughter) I said, "Yeah, but I was looking at a computer screen." 
(Laughter) So when you think about this type of fieldwork, don't think about images like this. 
Think about images like this. 
(Laughter) This is a radargram, which is a vertical profile through the ice sheet, kind of like a slice of cake. 
The bright layer on the top is the surface of the ice sheet, the bright layer on the bottom is the bedrock of the continent itself, and the layers in between are kind of like tree rings, in that they contain information about the history of the ice sheet. 
And it's amazing that this works this well. 
The ground-penetrating radars that are used to investigate infrastructures of roads or detect land mines struggle to get through a few meters of earth. 
And here we're peering through three kilometers of ice. 
And there are sophisticated, interesting, electromagnetic reasons for that, but let's say for now that ice is basically the perfect target for radar, and radar is basically the perfect tool to study ice sheets. 
These are the flight lines of most of the modern airborne radar-sounding profiles collected over Antarctica. 
This is the result of heroic efforts over decades by teams from a variety of countries and international collaborations. 
And when you put those together, you get an image like this, which is what the continent of Antarctica would look like without all the ice on top. 
And you can really see the diversity of the continent in an image like this. 
The red features are volcanoes or mountains; the areas that are blue would be open ocean if the ice sheet was removed. 
This is that giant spatial scale. 
However, all of this that took decades to produce is just one snapshot of the subsurface. 
It does not give us any indication of how the ice sheet is changing in time. 
Now, we're working on that, because it turns out that the very first radar observations of Antarctica were collected using 35 millimeter optical film. 
And there were thousands of reels of this film in the archives of the museum of the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge. 
So last summer, I took a state-of-the-art film scanner that was developed for digitizing Hollywood films and remastering them, and two art historians, and we went over to England, put on some gloves and archived and digitized all of that film. 
So that produced two million high-resolution images that my group is now working on analyzing and processing for comparing with contemporary conditions in the ice sheet. 
And, actually, that scanner -- I found out about it from an archivist at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
So I'd like to thank the Academy -- (Laughter) for making this possible. 
(Laughter) And as amazing as it is that we can look at what was happening under the ice sheet 50 years ago, this is still just one more snapshot. 
It doesn't give us observations of the variation at the annual or seasonal scale, that we know matters. 
There's some progress here, too. 
There are these recent ground-based radar systems that stay in one spot. 
So you take these radars and put them on the ice sheet and you bury a cache of car batteries. 
And you leave them out there for months or years at a time, and they send a pulse down into the ice sheet every so many minutes or hours. 
So this gives you continuous observation in time -- but at one spot. 
So if you compare that imaging to the 2-D pictures provided by the airplane, this is just one vertical line. 
And this is pretty much where we are as a field right now. 
We can choose between good spatial coverage with airborne radar sounding and good temporal coverage in one spot with ground-based sounding. 
But neither gives us what we really want: both at the same time. 
And if we're going to do that, we're going to need totally new ways of observing the ice sheet. 
And ideally, those should be extremely low-cost so that we can take lots of measurements from lots of sensors. 
Well, for existing radar systems, the biggest driver of cost is the power required to transmit the radar signal itself. 
So it’d be great if we were able to use existing radio systems or radio signals that are in the environment. 
And fortunately, the entire field of radio astronomy is built on the fact that there are bright radio signals in the sky. 
And a really bright one is our sun. 
So, actually, one of the most exciting things my group is doing right now is trying to use the radio emissions from the sun as a type of radar signal. 
This is one of our field tests at Big Sur. 
That PVC pipe ziggurat is an antenna stand some undergrads in my lab built. 
And the idea here is that we stay out at Big Sur, and we watch the sunset in radio frequencies, and we try and detect the reflection of the sun off the surface of the ocean. 
Now, I know you're thinking, "There are no glaciers at Big Sur." 
(Laughter) And that's true. 
(Laughter) But it turns out that detecting the reflection of the sun off the surface of the ocean and detecting the reflection off the bottom of an ice sheet are extremely geophysically similar. 
And if this works, we should be able to apply the same measurement principle in Antarctica. 
And this is not as far-fetched as it seems. 
The seismic industry has gone through a similar technique-development exercise, where they were able to move from detonating dynamite as a source, to using ambient seismic noise in the environment. 
And defense radars use TV signals and radio signals all the time, so they don't have to transmit a signal of radar and give away their position. 
So what I'm saying is, this might really work. 
And if it does, we're going to need extremely low-cost sensors so we can deploy networks of hundreds or thousands of these on an ice sheet to do imaging. 
And that's where the technological stars have really aligned to help us. 
Those earlier radar systems I talked about were developed by experienced engineers over the course of years at national facilities with expensive specialized equipment. 
But the recent developments in software-defined radio, rapid fabrication and the maker movement, make it so that it's possible for a team of teenagers working in my lab over the course of a handful of months to build a prototype radar. 
OK, they're not any teenagers, they’re Stanford undergrads, but the point holds -- (Laughter) that these enabling technologies are letting us break down the barrier between engineers who build instruments and scientists that use them. 
And by teaching engineering students to think like earth scientists and earth-science students who can think like engineers, my lab is building an environment in which we can build custom radar sensors for each problem at hand, that are optimized for low cost and high performance for that problem. 
And that's going to totally change the way we observe ice sheets. 
Look, the sea level problem and the role of the cryosphere in sea level rise is extremely important and will affect the entire world. 
But that is not why I work on it. 
I work on it for the opportunity to teach and mentor extremely brilliant students, because I deeply believe that teams of hypertalented, hyperdriven, hyperpassionate young people can solve most of the challenges facing the world, and that providing the observations required to estimate sea level rise is just one of the many such problems they can and will solve. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers: Thomas Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967, and Sir Roy Calne, who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K. 
in the following year. 
I returned to Singapore and, in 1990, performed Asia's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure, but against all odds. 
Now when I look back, the transplant was actually the easiest part. 
Next, raising the money to fund the procedure. 
But perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators -- a matter which was debated in the parliament -- that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country. 
But 20 years on, my patient, Surinder, is Asia's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date. 
(Applause) And perhaps more important, I am the proud godmother to her 14 year-old son. 
(Applause) But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate. 
The truth is, there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around. 
As the demand for donor organs continues to rise, in large part due to the aging population, the supply has remained relatively constant. 
In the United States alone, 100,000 men, women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs, and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs. 
The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation. 
And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living, related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ, like a split liver graft, to a relative or loved one. 
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs, the gift of life was then extended from living, related donors to now living, unrelated donors. 
And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy. 
How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from, for example, a submissive spouse, an in-law, a servant, a slave, an employee? 
Where and how can we draw the line? 
In my part of the world, too many people live below the poverty line. 
And in some areas, the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living, unrelated donors. 
Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant, I received my next assignment, and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners. 
I was also pregnant at the time. 
Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life. 
But my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts -- thoughts of walking through the prison's high-security death row, as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room. 
And at each time, I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me. 
And for two years, I struggled with the dilemma of waking up at 4:30 am on a Friday morning, driving to the prison, getting down, gloved and scrubbed, ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner, remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon. 
No doubt, I was informed, the consent had been obtained. 
But, in my life, the one fulfilling skill that I had was now invoking feelings of conflict -- conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk. 
In my team, the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience. 
Some of us may have been sublimated, but really none of us remained the same. 
I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos. 
And in my mind, I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence. 
It made me wonder if there could be a better way -- a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide. 
Now just about that time, the practice of surgery evolved from big to small, from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures, tiny incisions. 
And in transplantation, concepts shifted from whole organs to cells. 
In 1988, at the University of Minnesota, I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants. 
I witnessed the technical difficulty. 
And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. 
I thought to myself, why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas -- the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes -- and transplant these cells? -- technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ. 
And at that time, stem cell research had gained momentum, following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s. 
The observation that stem cells, as master cells, could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types -- heart cells, liver cells, pancreatic islet cells -- captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public. 
I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology, and this inspired a shift in my mindset, from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells. 
And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants. 
Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells. 
Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage, chiefly because of their pluripotency -- that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types. 
But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells -- the fact that these cells are derived from five-day old human embryos -- has encouraged research into other types of stem cells. 
Now to the ridicule of my colleagues, I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non-controversial source of stem cells, adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat -- nowadays available in abundant supply -- you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway. 
Fat-derived stem cells are adult stem cells. 
And adult stem cells are found in you and me -- in our blood, in our bone marrow, in our fat, our skin and other organs. 
And as it turns out, fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells. 
But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells. 
And here is the limitation: adult stem cells are mature cells, and, like mature human beings, these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types, as embryonic stem cells [can]. 
But in 2007, two remarkable individuals, Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States, made an astounding discovery. 
They discovered that adult cells, taken from you and me, could be reprogrammed back into embryonic-like cells, which they termed IPS cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells. 
And so guess what, scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells. 
And in our lab, we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells -- cells that we may use to then form other, more specialized, cells, which one day may be used as cell transplants. 
If this research is successful, it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos. 
Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions. 
Heart disease, stroke, diabetes, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy, retinal eye diseases -- are any of these conditions relevant, personally, to you? 
In May 2006, something horrible happened to me. 
I was about to start a robotic operation, but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room, I realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness. 
Earlier that week, I had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing -- yes, I fell. 
And I started to see floaters and stars, which I casually dismissed as too much high-altitude sun exposure. 
What happened to me might have been catastrophic, if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access. 
And I had my vision restored, but not before a prolonged period of convalescence -- three months -- in a head down position. 
This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients, and especially those with retinal diseases. 
37 million people worldwide are blind, and 127 million more suffer from impaired vision. 
Stem cell-derived retinal transplants, now in a research phase, may one day restore vision, or part vision, to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide. 
Indeed, we live in both challenging as well as exciting times. 
As the world population ages, scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells. 
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured, our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation. 
And these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue. 
Stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body, or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver. 
As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases. 
What lies ahead? 
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. 
1.1 million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly. 
4.8 million suffer cardiac failure. 
Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function. 
There are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease. 
While still in a research phase, stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology. 
Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings -- small, incremental steps, cells rather than organs, repair rather than replacement. 
Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs. 
Powerful new technologies always present enigmas. 
As we speak, the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval. 
And in the U.K., neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial. 
The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers. 
Each one has his story. 
My story has been about my journey from organs to cells -- a journey through controversy, inspired by hope -- hope that, as we age, you and I may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life. 
Thank you. 

My students often ask me, "What is sociology?" 
And I tell them it's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don't see. 
And they say, "So, how can I be a sociologist? 
How can I understand those invisible forces?" 
And I say, "Empathy. 
Start with empathy. 
It all begins with empathy. 
Take yourself out of your shoes, put yourself into the shoes of another person." 
Here, I'll give you an example. 
So I imagine my life if, a hundred years ago, China had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the United States in search of coal. 
And they found it, and, in fact, they found lots of it right here. 
And pretty soon, they began shipping that coal, ton by ton, railcar by railcar, boatload by boatload, back to China and elsewhere around the world. 
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so. 
And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal. 
And back here in the United States, we saw economic despair, deprivation. 
This is what I saw. 
I saw people struggling to get by, not knowing what was what and what was next. 
And I asked myself the question: How is it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States, because coal is such a wealthy resource; it's so much money? 
And I realize: because the Chinese ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the United States, who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves. 
And the rest of us, the vast majority of us, struggle to get by. 
And the Chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out against this relationship. 
Does this sound familiar? 
And they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal. 
And everywhere, there were symbols of the Chinese -- everywhere, a constant reminder. 
And back in China, what do they say in China? 
Nothing! They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal. 
If you ask them, they'll say, "Well, you know, we need the coal. 
I mean, come on, I'm not going to turn down my thermostat. 
You can't expect that." 
And so, I get angry, and I get pissed, as do lots of average people. 
And we fight back, and it gets really ugly. 
And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way. 
And before we know it, they send in the tanks and they send in the troops. 
And lots of people are dying. 
And it's a very, very difficult situation. 
Can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes? 
Can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there, or a truck full of soldiers? 
Just imagine what you would feel, because you know why they're here; you know what they're doing here. 
If you can, that's empathy. That's empathy. 
You've left your shoes, and you've stood in mine. 
And you've got to feel that. 
OK, so that's the warm-up. 
Now we're going to have the real radical experiment. 
So, for the remainder of my talk, what I want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim living in the Middle East -- in particular, in Iraq. 
And so to help you, perhaps you're a member of this middle-class family in Baghdad. 
What you want is the best for your kids. 
You want your kids to have a better life. 
And you watch the news, you pay attention. 
You read the newspaper, you go down to the coffee shop with your friends, you read the newspapers from around the world. 
Sometimes you even watch satellite, CNN, from the United States. 
You have a sense of what the Americans are thinking. 
But really, you just want a better life for yourself. 
That's what you want. 
You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq. 
You want a better life for yourself. 
So here, let me help you. 
Let me help you with some things that you might be thinking. 
Number one: this incursion into your land these past 20 years and before -- the reason anyone is interested in your land, and particularly the United States, is oil. 
It's all about oil; you know that, everybody knows that. 
People back in the United States know it's about oil. 
It's because somebody else has a design for your resource. 
It's your resource -- it's not somebody else's. 
It's your land; it's your resource. 
Somebody else has a design for it. 
And you know why they have a design? 
You know why they have their eyes set on it? 
Because they have an entire economic system that's dependent on that oil -- foreign oil, oil from other parts of the world that they don't own. 
And what else do you think about these people? 
The Americans, they're rich. 
Come on, they live in big houses, they have big cars. 
They all have blond hair, blue eyes. They're happy. 
You think that. It's not true, of course, but that's the media impression. 
And that's what you get. 
And they have big cities, and the cities are all dependent on oil. 
And back home, what do you see? 
Poverty, despair, struggle. 
I mean -- this is Iraq. 
This is what you see. 
You see people struggling to get by. 
It's not easy; you see a lot of poverty. 
These people have designs for your resource, and this is what you see? 
Something else you see that you talk about -- Americans don't talk about this, but you do -- there's this thing, this militarization of the world, and it's centered right in the United States. 
And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending. 
Four percent of the world's population! 
It's part of your life. 
And you talk about it with your friends. 
You read about it. 
And back when Saddam Hussein was in power, the Americans didn't care about his crimes. 
When he was gassing the Kurds and gassing Iran, they didn't care about it. 
When oil was at stake, somehow, suddenly, things mattered. 
And what you see, something else: the United States, the hub of democracy around the world -- they don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world. 
There are a lot of countries, oil-producing countries, that aren't very democratic, but supported by the United States. 
That's odd. 
Oh -- these incursions, these two wars, the 10 years of sanctions, the eight years of occupation, the insurgency that's been unleashed on your people, the tens of thousands, the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths? 
All because of oil. 
You can't help but think that. 
You talk about it. 
It's in the forefront of your mind, always. 
You say, "How is that possible?" 
And this man, he's everyman -- your grandfather, your uncle, your father, your son, your neighbor, your professor, your student. 
Once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly, pain and sorrow. 
Everyone in your country has been touched by the violence, the bloodshed, the pain, the horror -- everybody. 
Not a single person in your country has not been touched. 
But there's something else. 
There's something else about these people, these Americans who are there. 
There's something else about them that you see that they don't see themselves. 
And what do you see? They're Christians! 
They're Christians. 
They worship the Christian God, they have crosses, they carry Bibles. 
Their Bibles have a little insignia that says "US Army" on them. 
And their leaders, their leaders: before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off, they go to a Christian church, and they pray to their Christian God, and they ask for protection and guidance from that god. 
Why? 
Well, obviously, when people die in the war, they are Muslims, they are Iraqis -- they're not Americans. 
You don't want Americans to die -- "Protect Our Troops." 
And you feel something about that -- of course you do. 
And they do wonderful things. 
You read about it, you hear about it. 
They're there to build schools and help people. 
That's what they want to do. 
They do wonderful things, but they also do the bad things, and you can't tell the difference. 
And this guy, you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin. 
Here's a guy who says that your god is a false god. 
Your god's an idol; his god is the true god. 
The solution to the problem in the Middle East, according to him, is to convert you all to Christianity -- just get rid of your religion. 
And you know that. Americans don't read about this guy. 
You pass it around. You pass his words around. 
He was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq. 
And you're thinking, "My God, if this guy is saying that, then all the soldiers must be saying that." 
And this word here -- George Bush called this war a crusade. 
Man, the Americans, they're just like, "Ah, crusade. 
Whatever. I don't know what that means." 
You know what it means -- it's a holy war against Muslims. 
Look, invade, subdue them, take their resources. 
If they won't submit, kill them. 
That's what this is about. 
This is frightening. 
You feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened. 
And this man, Terry Jones: I mean here's a guy who wants to burn Qurans, right? 
And the Americans: "Ah, he's a knucklehead. 
He's a former hotel manager; he's got three dozen members of his church ..." 
They laugh him off. 
You don't laugh him off, because in the context of everything else, all the pieces fit. 
Of course this is how Americans think. 
So people all over the Middle East, not just in your country, are protesting. 
"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book. 
These Christians -- who are these Christians? 
They're so evil, they're so mean -- this is what they're about?" 
This is what you're thinking as an Arab Muslim, as an Iraqi. 
And then your cousin says, "Hey coz, check out this website. 
You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp. 
These Christians are nuts! 
They're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus. 
They take little kids and run them through these things till they teach them how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!' and things like 'grenade toss' and 'weapons care and maintenance.' And go to the website -- it says 'US Army' right on it. 
I mean, these Christians, they're nuts. 
How can they do this to their little kids?" 
And you're reading this website. 
And of course, Christians in the United States, or anybody, says, "This is some little church in the middle of nowhere." 
You don't know that. 
It's all over the Web: "Bible Boot Camp." 
And look at this. 
They even teach their kids -- they train them in the same way the US Marines train. 
Isn't that interesting. 
And it scares you, and it frightens you. 
So these guys, you see them. 
You see, I, Sam Richards -- I know who these guys are. 
They're my students, my friends; I know what they're thinking. 
You don't know. 
When you see them, they're something else. 
They're something else. 
We don't see it that way in the United States, but you see it that way. 
So here. 
Of course, you've got it wrong. 
You're generalizing. It's wrong. 
You don't understand the Americans. 
It's not a Christian invasion. 
We're not just there for oil; we're there for lots of reasons. 
You have it wrong. You've missed it. 
And of course, most of you don't support the insurgency; you don't support killing Americans; you don't support the terrorists. 
Of course you don't. Very few people do. 
But -- some of you do. 
And this is a perspective. 
OK. So now, here's what we're going to do. 
Step outside of your shoes that you're in right now, and step back into your normal shoes. 
So everyone's back in the room. OK? 
Now here comes the radical experiment. 
So we're all back home. 
This photo: this woman -- man, I feel her. 
I feel her. 
She's my sister, my wife, my cousin, my neighbor. 
She's anybody to me. 
These guys standing there, everybody in the photo -- I feel this photo, man. 
So here's what I want you to do. 
Let's go back to my first example, of the Chinese. 
I want you to go there. 
It's all about coal, and the Chinese are here in the United States. 
What I want you to do is picture her as a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag because her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising. 
And the soldiers are Chinese, and everybody else is Chinese. 
As an American, how do you feel about this picture? 
What do you think about that scene? 
OK, try this. Bring it back. 
This is the scene here. 
It's an American, American soldiers, American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East, in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
Now, put yourself in the shoes, go back to the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq. 
What are you feeling and thinking about this photo, about this woman? 
OK, now follow me on this, because I'm taking a big risk here. 
And so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me. 
These gentlemen here, they're insurgents. 
They were caught by the American soldiers, trying to kill Americans. 
And maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded. 
Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them. 
Can you feel the rage? 
Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks? 
Can you go there? 
It shouldn't be that difficult. 
You just -- oh, man. 
Now, put yourself in their shoes. 
Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders? 
Can you feel their anger, their fear, their rage at what has happened in their country? 
Can you imagine that maybe one of them, in the morning, bent down to their child and hugged their child and said, "Dear, I'll be back later. 
I'm going out to defend your freedom, your lives. 
I'm going out to look out for us, the future of our country." 
Can you imagine saying that? 
Can you go there? 
What do you think they're feeling? 
You see, that's empathy. 
[understand] Now, you might ask, "OK, Sam, so why do you do this sort of thing? 
Why would you use this example of all examples?" 
You're allowed to hate these people. 
You're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being. 
And if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch -- one tiny inch -- then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life. 
You can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person's driving 40 miles per hour in the passing lane; or your teenage son; or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings. 
Whatever it is, you can go so far. 
And this is what I tell my students: step outside of your tiny, little world. 
Step inside of the tiny, little world of somebody else. 
And then do it again and do it again and do it again. 
And suddenly, all these tiny, little worlds, they come together in this complex web. 
And they build a big, complex world. 
And suddenly, without realizing it, you're seeing the world differently. 
Everything has changed. 
Everything in your life has changed. 
And that's, of course, what this is about. 
Attend to other lives, other visions. 
Listen to other people, enlighten ourselves. 
I'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq. 
But as a sociologist, what I am saying is: I understand. 
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do, too. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So it's 1995, I'm in college, and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence, Rhode Island to Portland, Oregon. 
And you know, we're young and unemployed, so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests -- basically the longest route we can possibly take. 
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota, I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles. 
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?" 
My friend looks at me totally blankly. 
There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look. 
(Laughter) And I'm like, "You know, all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them." 
She just stares at me for a few moments, and then she cracks up, because she figures out what I'm talking about. 
And what I'm talking about is this. 
(Laughter) Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area. 
(Laughter) I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us, and how we behave when that happens, and what all of this can tell us about human nature. 
In other words, as you heard Chris say, I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong. 
This might strike you as a strange career move, but it actually has one great advantage: no job competition. 
(Laughter) In fact, most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong, or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong. 
We get it in the abstract. 
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes. 
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine. 
But when it comes down to me, right now, to all the beliefs I hold, here in the present tense, suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window -- and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about. 
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live. 
We go to meetings in the present tense; we go on family vacations in the present tense; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense. 
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life, trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything. 
I think this is a problem. 
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals, in our personal and professional lives, and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture. 
So what I want to do today is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right. 
And second, why it's such a problem. 
And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make. 
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right? 
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong. 
So let me ask you guys something -- or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here: How does it feel -- emotionally -- how does it feel to be wrong? 
Dreadful. Thumbs down. 
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great. 
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing -- thank you, these are great answers, but they're answers to a different question. 
You guys are answering the question: How does it feel to realize you're wrong? 
(Laughter) Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right? 
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake. 
But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything. 
I'll give you an analogy. 
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner? 
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon, there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff, which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly. 
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him. 
And what's funny -- at least if you're six years old -- is that the coyote's totally fine too. 
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid-air. 
That's when he falls. 
When we're wrong about something -- not when we realize it, but before that -- we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down. 
You know, we're already wrong, we're already in trouble, but we feel like we're on solid ground. 
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago. 
It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right. 
(Laughter) So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness. 
I call this error blindness. 
Most of the time, we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something, until it's too late. 
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural. 
Think back for a moment to elementary school. 
You're sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this. 
This is not mine, by the way. 
(Laughter) So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper. 
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker, the one who never does his homework. 
So by the time you are nine years old, you've already learned, first of all, that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all, that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes. 
We learn these really bad lessons really well. 
And a lot of us -- and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room -- deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers. 
Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner? 
(Laughter) You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out. 
Okay, so fine. 
Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong. 
Because according to this, getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us. 
So we just insist that we're right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe. 
So let me tell you a story. 
A couple of years ago, a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery. 
Beth Israel's in Boston. 
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard -- one of the best hospitals in the country. 
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room. 
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room. 
Everything seems to have gone fine. 
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?" 
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one. 
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident, he said something very interesting. 
He said, "For whatever reason, the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient." 
(Laughter) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous. 
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world. 
And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy. 
So this is a huge practical problem. 
But it's also a huge social problem. 
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right. 
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality. 
And when you feel that way, you've got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you? 
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions. 
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant. 
They don't have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they're going to see the light and come on over to our team. 
When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots. 
(Laughter) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly. 
And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. 
So this is a catastrophe. 
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly. 
But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human. 
It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds. 
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing. 
That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring. 
The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is. 
It's that you can see the world as it isn't. 
We can remember the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place. 
And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this. 
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong. 
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about "I think therefore I am," this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" -- "I err therefore I am." 
Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome. 
It's totally fundamental to who we are. 
Because, unlike God, we don't really know what's going on out there. 
And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out. 
To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity. 
Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life. 
And so I'm listening and I'm listening, and at some point, I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong. 
And my first thought was, "I've lost it. 
I've become the crazy wrongness lady. 
I just imagined it everywhere," which has happened. 
But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show. 
And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, "No actually, that's true. 
In fact," he says, "as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme. 
And the crypto-theme is: 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this. 
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work." 
And for the rest of us, audience members, as listeners, as readers, we eat this stuff up. 
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings. 
When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong. 
But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this. 
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead. 
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East. 
And something else happened instead. 
And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son. 
And something else happened instead. 
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together. 
And something else happened instead. 
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize. 
And something else happened instead. 
(Laughter) I mean, this is life. 
For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us. 
No offense, but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong. 
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements? 
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- TED 1998 -- eh. 
(Laughter) Didn't really work out that way, did it? 
(Laughter) Where's my jet pack, Chris? 
(Laughter) (Applause) So here we are again. 
And that's how it goes. 
We come up with another idea. 
We tell another story. 
We hold another conference. 
The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder. 
And to me, if you really want to rediscover wonder, you need to step outside of that tiny, terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say, "Wow, I don't know. 
Maybe I'm wrong." 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you guys. 
(Applause) 

I'm very fortunate to be here. 
I feel so fortunate. 
I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me. 
I called my wife Leslie, and I said, "You know, there's so many good people trying to do so much good. 
It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels." 
It's a true feeling. 
But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running. 
I'm a public school teacher, and I just want to share a story of my superintendent. 
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County, Virginia, the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. 
And she's a very high-tech superintendent. 
She uses smart boards, she blogs, she Tweets, she does Facebook, she does all this sort of high-tech stuff. 
She's a technology leader and instructional leader. 
But in her office, there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table -- peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety. 
And I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person. 
Why is this old table in your office?" 
And she told me, she said, "You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia, in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia, and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen. 
And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working, and we'd sit around that table every night. 
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table. 
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him. 
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes." 
The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game, and essentially it is also an empty space. 
And I'd like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table, really. 
It all started back in 1977. 
I was a young man, and I had been dropping in and out of college. 
And my parents were very patient, but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest. 
And I remember the last time I came back from India -- in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses -- and I said to my father, "Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment." 
He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find." 
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job." 
(Laughter) And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something. 
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education. 
It was an experimental education program. 
It could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it, and so that's what I had to go for. 
And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city, bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention -- kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the '70s -- and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview. 
And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro, said I had the job teaching gifted children. 
And I was so shocked, so stunned, I got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?" 
(Laughter) Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much. 
There weren't really many materials or things to use. 
And I said, "What do I do?" 
And her answer shocked me. It stunned me. 
Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that. 
She said, "What do you want to do?" 
And that question cleared the space. 
There was no program directive, no manual to follow, no standards in gifted education in that way. 
And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students, an empty space, whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding. 
So this happened in 1978, and I was teaching many years later, and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker. 
His name is Chris Farina. 
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost. 
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you -- a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film. 
(Applause) This film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements." 
He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title. 
He proposed the film to me, and I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV, and we can say hi to our friends." 
But the film has really gone places. 
Now it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice, to get this film out. 
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me, more than a story about one teacher. 
It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers. 
And it's a beautiful thing. 
And the strange thing is, when I watch the film -- I have the eerie sensation of seeing it -- I saw myself literally disappear. 
What I saw was my teachers coming through me. 
I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's wry smile under his handlebar mustache. 
That's the smile I use -- that's his smile. 
I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes. 
And they weren't flashing in anger, they were flashing in love, intense love for her students. 
And I have that kind of flash sometimes. 
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day. 
And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare. 
You know the one. 
(Laughter) "And I'm not even talking about you behind me, because I've got eyes in the back of my head." 
(Laughter) You know that teacher? 
I didn't use that stare very often, but I do have it in my repertoire. 
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me. 
And then I saw my own parents, my first teachers. 
My father, very inventive, spatial thinker. 
That's my brother Malcolm there on the right. 
And my mother, who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia, who was my inspiration. 
And really, I feel as though, when I see the film -- I have a gesture she does, like this -- I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture. 
I am one of her teaching gestures. 
And the beautiful thing was, I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline. 
And so that gesture of my mother's continues through many generations. 
It's an amazing feeling to have that lineage. 
And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people. 
I'm not here alone. 
There are many people on this stage right now. 
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about. 
It started out like this: it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school, 1978. 
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa. 
We put all the problems of the world there, and I thought, let's let them solve it. 
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading. 
I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies. 
So I thought, well they like to play games. 
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive; we didn't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive. 
And so we made the game, and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure. 
And it has four Plexiglass layers. 
There's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining. 
There's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces, a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it -- even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining. 
There are four countries around the board. 
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor. 
They have different assets, commercial and military. 
And each country has a cabinet. 
There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense and a CFO, or Comptroller. 
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them. 
I offer them the job, they can turn it down, and then they choose their own cabinet. 
There's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations. 
There's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather. 
(Laughter) That's not all. 
And then there's a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems. 
So that, if one thing changes, everything else changes. 
I throw them into this complex matrix, and they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together. 
And so with all these crises, we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions; we have chemical and nuclear spills, nuclear proliferation. 
There's oil spills, environmental disasters, water rights disputes, breakaway republics, famine, endangered species and global warming. 
If Al Gore is here, I'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And they've done it several times too. 
(Laughter) So I also have in the game a saboteur -- some child -- it's basically a troublemaker -- and I have my troublemaker put to use because they, on the surface, are trying to save the world and their position in the game. 
But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game. 
And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies, trying to cause everyone to think more deeply. 
The saboteur is there, and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War." 
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old -- and they handle that and use that to understand how to, not follow -- at first they do -- the paths to power and destruction, the path to war. 
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking, to think in a long-term, more consequential way. 
Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force. 
And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force. 
I'm just a clock watcher. 
I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator. 
The students run the game. 
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing. 
So I'll just share with you ... 
(Video) Boy: The World Peace Game is serious. 
You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world. 
See, Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot, and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem. 
John Hunter: I offered them a -- (Applause) Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer. 
And I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know. 
And because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer. 
And so I apologize to them as well. 
I say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls, but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape, and we hope you can fix it for us, and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it." 
It's a sincere apology, and they take it very seriously. 
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like. 
Well when we have the game start, here's what you see. 
(Video) JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go. 
(Chatter) JH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom? 
It's a serious question: who is really in charge? 
I've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time. 
There's a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don't have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher: control every conversation and response in the classroom. 
It's impossible. Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine, and I admit it to them openly. 
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened. 
In this game we had a little girl, and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation. 
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth. 
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor. 
Without provocation, suddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders, the next-door neighbor's oil fields. 
She marched into the oil field reserves, surrounded it, without firing a shot, and secured it and held it. 
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up. 
We were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this? 
This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?" 
(Laughter) This was a little girl and, at nine years old, she held her pieces and said, "I know what I'm doing." 
To her girlfriends she said that. 
That's a breach there. 
And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks. 
(Laughter) They are the toughest opponents. 
And we were very upset. 
I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this? 
But come to find out, a few game days later -- and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team -- actually there's a negotiation period with all teams, and each team takes a turn, then we go back in negotiation, around and around, so each turn around is one game day. 
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world. 
Had they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it. 
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game. 
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war, so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right, conditional good, or not right. 
That's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations. 
I could not have designed that in teaching it. 
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom. 
(Applause) Another example, a beautiful thing happened. 
We have a letter in the game. 
If you're a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them, I put in a letter. 
You have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences. 
So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat. 
And so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually, at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County -- and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter, let's ask -- there's a parent over there." 
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room. 
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter. 
It'll be more realer if she reads it." 
So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter. 
"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence. 
She read two sentences. 
By the third sentence, she was in tears. 
I was in tears. 
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating. 
We all lose. 
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding. 
I'll show you what my friend David says about this. 
He's been in many battles. 
(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking. 
I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time. 
But now I'm feeling really weird because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week. 
One week he said, "Those who go into battle and win will want to go back, and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win." 
And so I've been winning battles, so I'm going into battles, more battles. 
And I think it's sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said. 
JH: I get chills every time I see that. 
That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen. 
And I can't design that, I can't plan that, and I can't even test that. 
But it's self-evident assessment. 
We know that's an authentic assessment of learning. 
We have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on. 
So I'll just share a third story. 
This is about my friend Brennan. 
We had played the game one session after school for many weeks, about seven weeks, and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises. 
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country's asset value has to be increased above its starting point. 
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions. 
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time. 
He says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away." 
But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him. 
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer. 
There was no way they could win. 
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room. 
I thought, I'm failing as a teacher. 
I should have gotten it so they could have won. 
They shouldn't be failing like this. 
I've failed them. 
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected. 
And suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets, and he ran back to his seat, rang the bell. 
Everybody ran to his chair: there was screaming; there was yelling, waving of their dossiers. 
They get these dossiers full of secret documents. 
They were gesticulating; they were running around. 
I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom. 
Principal walks in, I'm out of a job. 
The parents were looking in the window. 
And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat. 
He rings the bell again. He says, "We have" -- and there's 12 seconds left on the clock -- "we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together. 
And we've got 600 billion dollars. 
We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country. 
And if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game. 
Will you accept it?" 
And there are three seconds left on the clock. 
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country, and he says, "Yes." 
And the game is won. 
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for, that was unexpected and unpredictable. 
Every game we play is different. 
Some games are more about social issues, some are more about economic issues. 
Some games are more about warfare. 
But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human. 
I allow them to go there and, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way, how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing. 
And they find out what is right their own way, their own selves. 
And so in this game, I've learned so much from it, but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world, they may save us all. 
If only. 
And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I'm standing, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon, which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it. 
My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it, began rather accidentally. 
I had bought a copy of this book, "The Universe and Dr. Einstein" -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle. 
A few years after that, in Bangalore, I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night, and I picked up this book, thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes. 
And as it happened, I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot. 
And I was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do. 
And that feeling hasn't left me yet. 
That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that I could partake in the joy of science, and also the joy of communicating it to others. 
And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts, to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes, detectors, instruments that people are building, or have built, in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail. 
So it took me from places like Chile -- the Atacama Desert in Chile -- to Siberia, to underground mines in the Japanese Alps, in Northern America, all the way to Antarctica and even to the South Pole. 
And today I would like to share with you some images, some stories of these trips. 
I have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting, literally at times, their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe. 
And I first begin with a pie chart -- and I promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation -- but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos. 
All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we're all made of -- and that's four percent of the universe. 
Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe, which makes up 23 percent of the universe, and something called dark energy, which permeates the fabric of space-time, that makes up another 73 percent. 
So if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe, at this point in our exploration of it, is unknown or not well understood. 
And most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see are in some way addressing this question, these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. 
I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter. 
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors. 
And the reason why they have to go underground is that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth, the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays, ambient radio activity, even our own bodies. You might not believe it, but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment. 
So they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector. 
And I went to see one of these experiments, and this is actually -- you can barely see it, and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there -- this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in 1960. 
And physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s. 
And the miners in the early part of the last century worked, literally, in candlelight. 
And today, you would see this inside the mine, half a mile underground. 
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world. 
And, among other things, they're looking for dark matter. 
There is another way to search for dark matter, which is indirectly. 
If dark matter exists in our universe, in our galaxy, then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neutrinos. 
And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules. 
When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light, a flash of blue light, and by looking for this blue light, you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino. 
But you need very, very large volumes of water in order to do this. 
You need something like tens of megatons of water -- almost a gigaton of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino. 
And where in the world would you find such water? 
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard. 
This is Lake Baikal. 
It is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long. 
It's about 40 to 50 km wide in most places, and one to two kilometers deep. 
And what the Russians are doing is they're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light. 
And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there. 
This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter. 
The lake is entirely frozen. 
And the line of black dots that you see in the background, that's the ice camp where the physicists are working. 
The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring, which, if they did that, they would need ships and submersibles to do their work. 
So they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work. 
So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter. 
They have to drill holes in the ice, dive down into the water -- cold, cold water -- to get hold of the instrument, bring it up, do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do, put it back and get out before the ice melts. 
Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it's full of cracks. 
And you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake underneath, moving. 
I still don't understand this one Russian man working in his bare chest, but that tells you how hard he was working. 
And these people, a handful of people, have been working for 20 years, looking for particles that may or may not exist. 
And they have dedicated their lives to it. 
And just to give you an idea, they have spent 20 million over 20 years. 
It's very harsh conditions. 
They work on a shoestring budget. 
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack. 
And it's that basic, but they do this every year. 
From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile, to see something called The Very Large Telescope. 
The Very Large Telescope is one of these things that astronomers do -- they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively. 
I can tell you for a fact, that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope. 
(Laughter) And you wouldn't believe it, but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. 
But nonetheless, it's an extraordinary piece of engineering. 
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes. 
And these telescopes, among other things, they're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time. 
And the more you understand that, the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about. 
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror. 
Each mirror, there are four of them, is made of a single piece of glass, a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic, that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is [to] imagine a city like Paris, with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower, if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy, you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high. 
And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured. 
An extraordinary set of telescopes. 
Here's another view of the same. 
The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert. 
The dry air is really good for telescopes, and also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about 300 days of clear skies. 
Finally, I want to take you to Antarctica. 
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world. 
This is cosmology's final frontier. 
Some of the most amazing experiments, some of the most extreme experiments, are being done in Antarctica. 
I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight, which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere, the upper stratosphere, 40 km up. 
And that's where they do their experiments, and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down. 
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. 
That's an American C-17 cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to McMurdo in Antarctica. 
And here we are about to board our bus. 
And I don't know if you can read the lettering, but it says, "Ivan the Terribus." 
And that's taking us to McMurdo. 
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo. 
And you barely might be able to make out this hut here. 
This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole. 
Because it's so cold, the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it, with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there. 
It's an extraordinary place. 
This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer, and about 200 in winter when it's completely dark for six months. 
I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument. 
This is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km. 
What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight. 
So you're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km. 
And the engineers, the technicians, the physicists have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf, because Antarctica -- I won't go into the reasons why -- but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches, except for the weather. 
The weather, as you can imagine, this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice. 
And there's a volcano behind, which has glaciers at the very top. 
And what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon -- the fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with helium. 
And that process takes about two hours. 
And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly. 
For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind, which is eventually going to be filled up with helium. 
Those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium. 
Now, in case the weather changes before the launch, they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station. 
And this particular balloon, because it has to launch two tons of weight, is an extremely huge balloon. 
The fabric alone weighs two tons. 
In order to minimize the weight, it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper. 
And if they have to pack it back, they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except, when they did it first, it would have been done in Texas. 
Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing, so they have to take their shoes off, get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold, and do that kind of work. 
That's the kind of dedication these people have. 
Here's the balloon being filled up with helium, and you can see it's a gorgeous sight. 
Here's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end. 
So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side, and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute, and then the parachute is then connected to the payload. 
And remember, all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures. 
They're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff, but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that. 
And I would like to share with you a launch. 
(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon, release the balloon, release the balloon. 
Anil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images. 
This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India. 
And the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right-hand side. 
And on the far left there is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery. 
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery. 
And I was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has. 
One is exploring the cosmos on the outside, and the other one is exploring our interior being. 
And both require silence of some sort. 
And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes, the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence, whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever. 
And it was very obvious that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth, we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards, because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

That splendid music, the coming-in music, "The Elephant March" from "Aida," is the music I've chosen for my funeral. 
(Laughter) And you can see why. It's triumphal. 
I won't feel anything, but if I could, I would feel triumphal at having lived at all, and at having lived on this splendid planet, and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why I was here in the first place, before not being here. 
Can you understand my quaint English accent? 
(Laughter) Like everybody else, I was entranced yesterday by the animal session. 
Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others; the beauty of the things that they showed. 
The only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang, "the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth." 
Now of course, we know that he didn't really mean that, but in this country at the moment, you can't be too careful. 
(Laughter) I'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. 
In professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted. 
In non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored. 
But in non-professional circles within America, it arouses so much hostility -- (Laughter) it's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war. 
The war is so worrying at present, with court cases coming up in one state after another, that I felt I had to say something about it. 
If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself, I'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books, which you won't find in the bookstore outside. 
(Laughter) Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism, called "Intelligent Design," or ID. 
Don't be fooled. There's nothing new about ID. 
It's just creationism under another name, rechristened -- I choose the word advisedly -- (Laughter) for tactical, political reasons. 
The arguments of so-called ID theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again, since Darwin down to the present day. 
There is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science, and I try to do all I can to help them, but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists. 
They see us as rocking the boat, and you can understand why. 
Creationists, lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case, fall back on the popular phobia against atheism: Teach your children evolution in biology class, and they'll soon move on to drugs, grand larceny and sexual "pre-version." 
(Laughter) In fact, of course, educated theologians from the Pope down are firm in their support of evolution. 
This book, "Finding Darwin's God," by Kenneth Miller, is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know and it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout Christian. 
People like Kenneth Miller could be called a "godsend" to the evolution lobby, (Laughter) because they expose the lie that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact, tantamount to atheism. 
People like me, on the other hand, rock the boat. 
But here, I want to say something nice about creationists. 
It's not a thing I often do, so listen carefully. 
(Laughter) I think they're right about one thing. 
I think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion. 
I've already said that many individual evolutionists, like the Pope, are also religious, but I think they're deluding themselves. 
I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith. 
Now, it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism, and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do. 
In an audience as sophisticated as this one, that would be preaching to the choir. 
No, what I want to urge upon you -- (Laughter) Instead, what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But that's putting it too negatively. 
If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith, I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science, and indeed science generally, but evolution in particular, to inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic. 
Now, the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things. 
Statistical improbability in the direction of good design -- "complexity" is another word for this. 
The standard creationist argument -- there is only one; they're all reduced to this one -- takes off from a statistical improbability. 
Living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance; therefore, they must have had a designer. 
This argument of course, shoots itself in the foot. 
Any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself, and that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do, like forgive sins, bless marriages, listen to prayers -- favor our side in a war -- (Laughter) disapprove of our sex lives, and so on. 
(Laughter) Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve, and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex, thereby simply compounding the problem. 
Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity. 
Essentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual, step-by-step increment. 
But here, I only want to make the point that the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion, precisely because it is so elegant, so parsimonious, so powerful, so economically powerful. 
The God theory is not just a bad theory. 
It turns out to be -- in principle -- incapable of doing the job required of it. 
So, returning to tactics and the evolution lobby, I want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do. 
My approach to attacking creationism is -- unlike the evolution lobby -- my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole. 
And at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion, and I'm going to do so in the words of the late Douglas Adams, a dear friend who, if he never came to TED, certainly should have been invited. 
(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.) Richard Dawkins: He was. Good. I thought he must have been. 
He begins this speech, which was tape recorded in Cambridge shortly before he died -- he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof, and then he goes on. 
I quote, "Religion doesn't seem to work like that. 
It has certain ideas at the heart of it, which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.' What it means is: here is an idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about. 
You're just not. Why not? Because you're not." 
(Laughter) "Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the Republicans or Democrats, this model of economics versus that, Macintosh instead of Windows, but to have an opinion about how the universe began, about who created the universe -- no, that's holy. 
So, we're used to not challenging religious ideas, and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it." -- He meant me, not that one. 
"Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it, because you're not allowed to say these things. 
Yet when you look at it rationally, there's no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other, except that we've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn't be." 
In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science. 
It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations, and blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations that we have within our grasp. 
It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith, instead of always insisting on evidence. 
There's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture from his book, "Last Chance to See." 
Now, there's a typical scientific journal, The Quarterly Review of Biology. 
And I'm going to put together, as guest editor, a special issue on the question, "Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?" 
And the first paper is a standard scientific paper, presenting evidence, "Iridium layer at the K-T boundary, and potassium argon dated crater in Yucatan, indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs." 
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper. 
Now, the next one. 
"The President of the Royal Society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs." 
(Laughter) "It has been privately revealed to Professor Huxtane that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs." 
(Laughter) "Professor Hordley was brought up to have total and unquestioning faith" -- (Laughter) -- "that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs." 
"Professor Hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal Hawkinsians that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs." 
(Laughter) That's inconceivable, of course. 
But suppose -- [Supporters of the Asteroid Theory cannot be patriotic citizens] (Laughter) (Applause) In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr. 
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists. 
Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous. 
"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. 
This is one nation under God." 
Bush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake, blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted. 
He stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal. 
He really meant it. 
Democrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected. 
Both parties invoke "one nation under God." 
What would Thomas Jefferson have said? 
[In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty] Incidentally, I'm not usually very proud of being British, but you can't help making the comparison. 
(Applause) In practice, what is an atheist? 
An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf. 
As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. 
Some of us just go one god further. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen. 
Nevertheless, it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub. 
And that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird, way-out minority. 
Natalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker, saying how lonely she felt as an atheist. 
She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority. 
But actually, how do American atheists stack up numerically? 
The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading. 
Christianity, of course, takes a massive lion's share of the population, with nearly 160 million. 
But what would you think was the second largest group, convincingly outnumbering Jews with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million, Hindus, Buddhists and all other religions put together? 
The second largest group, with nearly 30 million, is the one described as non-religious or secular. 
You can't help wondering why vote-seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of, for example, the Jewish lobby -- the state of Israel seems to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote -- while at the same time, consigning the non-religious to political oblivion. 
This secular non-religious vote, if properly mobilized, is nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote. 
Why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle? 
Well, so much for quantity. How about quality? 
Is there any correlation, positive or negative, between intelligence and tendency to be religious? 
[Them folks misunderestimated me] (Laughter) The survey that I quoted, which is the ARIS survey, didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education, IQ or anything else. 
But a recent article by Paul G. Bell in the Mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind. 
Mensa, as you know, is an international organization for people with very high IQ. 
And from a meta-analysis of the literature, Bell concludes that, I quote -- "Of 43 studies carried out since 1927 on the relationship between religious belief, and one's intelligence or educational level, all but four found an inverse connection. 
That is, the higher one's intelligence or educational level, the less one is likely to be religious." 
Well, I haven't seen the original 42 studies, and I can't comment on that meta-analysis, but I would like to see more studies done along those lines. 
And I know that there are -- if I could put a little plug here -- there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question, and I put the suggestion up, for what it's worth. 
But let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed, on one special group -- namely, top scientists. 
In 1998, Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists, those who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences, and among this select group, belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent. 
About 20 percent are agnostic; the rest could fairly be called atheists. 
Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality. 
Among biological scientists, the figure is even lower: 5.5 percent, only, believe in God. 
Physical scientists, it's 7.5 percent. 
I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields, such as history or philosophy, but I'd be surprised if they were different. 
So, we've reached a truly remarkable situation, a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate. 
A philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe, which is held by the vast majority of top American scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally, is so abhorrent to the American electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public. 
If I'm right, this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it -- the intelligentsia -- unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs. 
To put it bluntly: American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I'm not a citizen of this country, so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming if I suggest that something needs to be done. 
(Laughter) And I've already hinted what that something is. 
From what I've seen of TED, I think this may be the ideal place to launch it. 
Again, I fear it will cost money. 
We need a consciousness-raising, coming-out campaign for American atheists. 
(Laughter) This could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago, although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will. 
In most cases, people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists. 
On the contrary, they'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people who could serve as decent role models for your children, the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product, the kinds of people who are sitting in this room. 
There should be a snowball effect, a positive feedback, such that the more names we have, the more we get. 
There could be non-linearities, threshold effects. 
When a critical mass has been obtained, there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment. 
And again, it will need money. 
I suspect that the word "atheist" itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means, and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves. 
So, what other words might be used to smooth the path, oil the wheels, sugar the pill? 
Darwin himself preferred "agnostic" -- and not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley, who coined the term. 
Darwin said, "I have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a God. 
I think that generally an 'agnostic' would be the most correct description of my state of mind." 
He even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling. 
Aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade Darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism -- incidentally, giving rise to a fascinating myth that Karl Marx tried to dedicate "Das Kapital" to Darwin, which he didn't, it was actually Edward Aveling. 
What happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter, and when both Darwin and Marx were dead, Marx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers, and a letter from Darwin saying, "My dear sir, thank you very much but I don't want you to dedicate your book to me," was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx, and that gave rise to this whole myth, which you've probably heard. 
It's a sort of urban myth, that Marx tried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin. 
Anyway, it was Aveling, and when they met, Darwin challenged Aveling. 
"Why do you call yourselves atheists?" 
"'Agnostic, '" retorted Aveling, "was simply 'atheist' writ respectable, and 'atheist' was simply 'agnostic' writ aggressive." 
Darwin complained, "But why should you be so aggressive?" 
Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia, but that ordinary people were not, quote, "ripe for it." 
Which is, of course, our old friend, the "don't rock the boat" argument. 
It's not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse. 
(Laughter) But in any case, that was more than 100 years ago. 
You'd think we might have grown up since then. 
Now, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew, who, incidentally, observes the Sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity, describes himself as a "tooth-fairy agnostic." 
He won't call himself an atheist because it's, in principle, impossible to prove a negative, but "agnostic" on its own might suggest that God's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence. 
So, my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy, but it isn't very likely, is it? 
Like God. 
Hence the phrase, "tooth-fairy agnostic." 
Bertrand Russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars. 
You would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars, but that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non-existence. 
The list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots; it's infinite. 
If you want to believe one particular one of them -- unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh -- the onus is on you to say why. 
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not. 
We, who are atheists, are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists. 
(Laughter) But we don't bother to say so. 
And this is why my friend uses "tooth-fairy agnostic" as a label for what most people would call atheist. 
Nonetheless, if we want to attract deep-down atheists to come out publicly, we're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than "tooth-fairy" or "teapot agnostic." 
So, how about "humanist"? 
This has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations and journals and things already in place. 
My problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism. 
One of the things we've learned from Darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins, some close, some distant. 
And there are other possibilities, like "naturalist," but that also has problems of confusion, because Darwin would have thought naturalist -- "Naturalist" means, of course, as opposed to "supernaturalist" -- and it is used sometimes -- Darwin would have been confused by the other sense of "naturalist," which he was, of course, and I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with "nudism". 
(Laughter) Such people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob, which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile. 
(Laughter) I think the best of the available alternatives for "atheist" is simply "non-theist." 
It lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God, and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics. 
It's completely compatible with the God of the physicists. 
When atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word "God," they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep, mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand. 
"Non-theist" will do for all that, yet unlike "atheist," it doesn't have the same phobic, hysterical responses. 
But I think, actually, the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word "atheism" itself, precisely because it is a taboo word, carrying frissons of hysterical phobia. 
Critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word "atheist" than with the word "non-theist," or some other non-confrontational word. 
But if we did achieve it with that dread word "atheist" itself, the political impact would be even greater. 
Now, I said that if I were religious, I'd be very afraid of evolution -- I'd go further: I would fear science in general, if properly understood. 
And this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting, more poetic, more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination. 
As Carl Sagan, another recently dead hero, put it, "How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, 'This is better than we thought! 
The universe is much bigger than our prophet said, grander, more subtle, more elegant'? 
Instead they say, 'No, no, no! 
My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.' A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths." 
Now, this is an elite audience, and I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious. 
Many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion. 
But I also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as I do. 
(Laughter) If you're one of them, and of course many of you may not be, but if you are one of them, I'm asking you to stop being polite, come out, and say so. 
And if you happen to be rich, give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference. 
The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations -- to say nothing of all the tax benefits -- by foundations, such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute. 
We need an anti-Templeton to step forward. 
If my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books, instead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself. 
People are always going on about, "How did September the 11th change you?" 
Well, here's how it changed me. 
Let's all stop being so damned respectful. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft. 
Imagine a plane full of smoke. 
Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack. 
It sounds scary. 
Well, I had a unique seat that day. 
I was sitting in 1D. 
So I looked at them right away, and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds." 
The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far. 
You could see Manhattan. 
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time. 
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River. 
That's usually not the route. 
(Laughter) He turns off the engines. 
Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound. 
And then he says three words. 
He says, "Brace for impact." 
I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. 
(Laughter) I could see in her eyes, it was terror. 
Life was over. 
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day. 
I learned that it all changes in an instant. 
We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did. 
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, "I collect bad wines." 
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it. 
I no longer want to postpone anything in life. 
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life. 
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot -- (Laughter) I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret. 
I've lived a good life. 
In my own humanity and mistakes, I've tried to get better at everything I tried. 
But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in. 
And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter. 
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people. 
And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. 
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better. 
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. 
It feels great. 
I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy. 
The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13." 
You can see the water coming. 
I'm saying, "Please blow up." 
I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries. 
And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary. 
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives. 
But it was very sad. 
I didn't want to go; I love my life. 
And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing. 
I only wish I could see my kids grow up. 
About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter -- first-grader, not much artistic talent -- (Laughter) Yet! 
(Laughter) And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid. 
And it made all the sense in the world to me. 
I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad. 
Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad. 
I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day. 
I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently. 
I challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don't -- but imagine, and how would you change? 
What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever? 
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them? 
And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can? 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

How would you like to be better than you are? 
Suppose I said that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could get a better memory -- more precise, more accurate and quicker. 
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger, with more stamina. 
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident? 
How about living longer with good health? 
Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity. 
Which one would you like the most? 
Which would you like, if you could have just one? 
(Audience Member: Creativity.) Creativity. 
How many people would choose creativity? 
Raise your hands. Let me see. 
A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here. 
(Laughter) That's very good. 
How many would opt for memory? 
Quite a few more. 
How about fitness? 
A few less. 
What about longevity? 
Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor. 
If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world. 
Is it just imaginary? 
Or, is it, perhaps, possible? 
Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject. 
The great 20th-century geneticist, T.G. Dobzhansky, who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an essay that he titled "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution." 
Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device -- I give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. 
(Laughter) But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future? 
Does it apply to others, or does it apply to us? 
This is another look at the tree of life. 
In this picture, I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions, because if you look at the edges of the tree of life, every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms: it has survived; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment. 
The human part of this branch, way out on one end, is, of course, the one that we are most interested in. 
We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago. 
In the interval, there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids. 
Some have come and gone. 
We have been here for about 130,000 years. 
It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, for the most part, the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same. 
Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics? 
This is not like human insulin; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas. 
And speaking of bacteria, do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body? 
Maybe 10 times more. 
I mean think of it, when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image, do you think about the bacteria? 
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria. 
It's warm, it's dark, it's moist, it's very cozy. 
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part. 
It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria, with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit. 
But otherwise, you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria, just as they are essential to your life. 
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients, and they protect you against certain diseases. 
But what will come in the future? 
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species? 
Or, are we destined to become something different -- something, perhaps, even better adapted to the environment? 
Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago -- the Earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto-life, maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi-celled organisms, perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species, finally emerging in the last 130,000 years. 
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief measure; the animal kingdom, like a single measure; and human life, a small grace note. 
That was us. 
That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk, so I hope you enjoyed it. 
(Laughter) Now when I was a freshman in college, I took my first biology class. 
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology. 
I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. 
But at the time multi-celled organisms come online, things start to change. 
Sexual reproduction enters the picture. 
And very importantly, with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome, the rest of the body becomes expendable. 
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction. 
Now I have to confess, when I was a college undergraduate, I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doubts. 
I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns, who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s. 
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door. 
He answers the door. 
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl. 
She looks at him and says, "I'm here for super sex." 
"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup." 
(Laughter) I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory, just different. 
I was trying to preserve the body. 
I wanted to keep us healthy. 
I wanted to restore health from disease. 
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives. 
Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving through generation after generation. 
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea. 
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. 
I want to achieve it through not dying." 
(Laughter) Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived. 
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest, and not even the smartest. 
Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. 
That is the sole test of survival and success. 
At the bottom of the ocean, bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce, if fish were there, sous-vide cooked fish, nevertheless, have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them. 
So what does this mean, as we look back at what has happened in evolution, and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution, and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase, I would say that there are a number of possibilities. 
The first is that we will not evolve. 
We have reached a kind of equipoise. 
And the reasoning behind that would be, first, we have, through medicine, managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population. 
And secondly, we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it. 
And by the way, we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place. 
A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind, natural, imposed by the forces of nature. 
And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly, but they are inexorable. 
And as far as isolation goes, when we as a species do colonize distant planets, there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way. 
But there's a third possibility, an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. 
I call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make. 
Now how could this come about? 
How could it be possible that we would do this? 
Consider, first, the reality that people today, in some cultures, are making choices about their offspring. 
They're, in some cultures, choosing to have more males than females. 
It's not necessarily good for the society, but it's what the individual and the family are choosing. 
Think also, if it were possible ever for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child, but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases. 
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke? 
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes? 
If we look ahead, these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible. 
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and it took 13 years. 
It cost 2.7 billion dollars. 
The year after it was finished in 2004, you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months. 
Today, you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week. 
It won't be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome, and it will be increasingly available for everyone. 
Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution." 
A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating just four genes, he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body. 
These changes are coming. 
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves, but induce immunity against other viruses. 
Believe it or not, there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant. 
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco? 
These are all reality today, and [in] the future, will be evermore possible. 
Imagine then just two other little changes. 
You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your offspring? 
What if you could change the sperm and the ova, or change the newly fertilized egg, and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia, reduce the risk of cancer? 
Who doesn't want healthier children? 
And then, that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease, will also enable us to adopt super-attributes, hyper-capacities -- that better memory. 
Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine? 
Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer? 
Why not live longer? 
These will be irresistible. 
And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution. 
We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years, and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years. 
These are choices that your grandchildren, or their grandchildren, are going to have before them. 
Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, that is more successful, that is kinder? 
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us? 
Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform, or more robust and more versatile? 
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face. 
And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom, and to inherit the wisdom, that we'll need to make these choices wisely? 
For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So, security is two different things: it's a feeling, and it's a reality. 
And they're different. 
You could feel secure even if you're not. 
And you can be secure even if you don't feel it. 
Really, we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word. 
And what I want to do in this talk is to split them apart -- figuring out when they diverge and how they converge. 
And language is actually a problem here. 
There aren't a lot of good words for the concepts we're going to talk about. 
So if you look at security from economic terms, it's a trade-off. 
Every time you get some security, you're always trading off something. 
Whether this is a personal decision -- whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home -- or a national decision, where you're going to invade a foreign country -- you're going to trade off something: money or time, convenience, capabilities, maybe fundamental liberties. 
And the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer, but whether it's worth the trade-off. 
You've heard in the past several years, the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is not in power. 
The question is: Was it worth it? 
And you can make your own decision, and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it. 
That's how you think about security: in terms of the trade-off. 
Now, there's often no right or wrong here. 
Some of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us don't. 
And it'll depend on where we live, whether we live alone or have a family, how much cool stuff we have, how much we're willing to accept the risk of theft. 
In politics also, there are different opinions. 
A lot of times, these trade-offs are about more than just security, and I think that's really important. 
Now, people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs. 
We make them every day. 
Last night in my hotel room, when I decided to double-lock the door, or you in your car when you drove here; when we go eat lunch and decide the food's not poison and we'll eat it. 
We make these trade-offs again and again, multiple times a day. 
They're just part of being alive; we all do it. 
Imagine a rabbit in a field, eating grass. 
And the rabbit sees a fox. 
That rabbit will make a security trade-off: "Should I stay, or should I flee?" 
And if you think about it, the rabbits that are good at making that trade-off will tend to live and reproduce, and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve. 
So you'd think that us, as a successful species on the planet -- you, me, everybody -- would be really good at making these trade-offs. 
Yet it seems, again and again, that we're hopelessly bad at it. 
And I think that's a fundamentally interesting question. 
I'll give you the short answer. 
The answer is, we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality. 
Now, most of the time, that works. 
Most of the time, feeling and reality are the same. 
Certainly that's true for most of human prehistory. 
We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense. 
One way to think of it is that we're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the East African Highlands in 100,000 BC. 
2010 New York, not so much. 
Now, there are several biases in risk perception. 
A lot of good experiments in this. 
And you can see certain biases that come up again and again. 
I'll give you four. 
We tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks -- so, flying versus driving. 
The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar. 
One example would be: people fear kidnapping by strangers, when the data supports that kidnapping by relatives is much more common. 
This is for children. 
Third, personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks. 
So, Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name. 
And the fourth is: people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don't control. 
So once you take up skydiving or smoking, you downplay the risks. 
If a risk is thrust upon you -- terrorism is a good example -- you'll overplay it, because you don't feel like it's in your control. 
There are a bunch of other of these cognitive biases, that affect our risk decisions. 
There's the availability heuristic, which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind. 
So you can imagine how that works. 
If you hear a lot about tiger attacks, there must be a lot of tigers around. 
You don't hear about lion attacks, there aren't a lot of lions around. 
This works, until you invent newspapers, because what newspapers do is repeat again and again rare risks. 
I tell people: if it's in the news, don't worry about it, because by definition, news is something that almost never happens. 
(Laughter) When something is so common, it's no longer news. 
Car crashes, domestic violence -- those are the risks you worry about. 
We're also a species of storytellers. 
We respond to stories more than data. 
And there's some basic innumeracy going on. 
I mean, the joke "One, two, three, many" is kind of right. 
We're really good at small numbers. 
One mango, two mangoes, three mangoes, 10,000 mangoes, 100,000 mangoes -- it's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot. 
So one half, one quarter, one fifth -- we're good at that. 
One in a million, one in a billion -- they're both almost never. 
So we have trouble with the risks that aren't very common. 
And what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality. 
And the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack, they get different. 
Now, you either have a feeling -- you feel more secure than you are, there's a false sense of security. 
Or the other way, and that's a false sense of insecurity. 
I write a lot about "security theater," which are products that make people feel secure, but don't actually do anything. 
There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure, but doesn't make us feel secure. 
So back to economics. 
If economics, if the market, drives security, and if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security, then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives is to make people feel secure. 
And there are two ways to do this. 
One, you can make people actually secure and hope they notice. 
Or two, you can make people just feel secure and hope they don't notice. 
So what makes people notice? 
Well, a couple of things: understanding of the security, of the risks, the threats, the countermeasures, how they work. 
But if you know stuff, you're more likely to have your feelings match reality. 
Enough real-world examples helps. 
We all know the crime rate in our neighborhood, because we live there, and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality. 
Security theater is exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly. 
OK. So what makes people not notice? 
Well, a poor understanding. 
If you don't understand the risks, you don't understand the costs, you're likely to get the trade-off wrong, and your feeling doesn't match reality. 
Not enough examples. 
There's an inherent problem with low-probability events. 
If, for example, terrorism almost never happens, it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures. 
This is why you keep sacrificing virgins, and why your unicorn defenses are working just great. 
There aren't enough examples of failures. 
Also, feelings that cloud the issues -- the cognitive biases I talked about earlier: fears, folk beliefs -- basically, an inadequate model of reality. 
So let me complicate things. 
I have feeling and reality. 
I want to add a third element. I want to add "model." 
Feeling and model are in our head, reality is the outside world; it doesn't change, it's real. 
Feeling is based on our intuition, model is based on reason. 
In a primitive and simple world, there's really no reason for a model, because feeling is close to reality. 
You don't need a model. 
But in a modern and complex world, you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face. 
There's no feeling about germs. 
You need a model to understand them. 
This model is an intelligent representation of reality. 
It's, of course, limited by science, by technology. 
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them. 
It's limited by our cognitive biases. 
But it has the ability to override our feelings. 
Where do we get these models? We get them from others. 
We get them from religion, from culture, teachers, elders. 
A couple years ago, I was in South Africa on safari. 
The tracker I was with grew up in Kruger National Park. 
He had some very complex models of how to survive. 
And it depended on if you were attacked by a lion, leopard, rhino, or elephant -- and when you had to run away, when you couldn't run away, when you had to climb a tree, when you could never climb a tree. 
But he was born there, and he understood how to survive. 
I was born in New York City. 
(Laughter) Because we had different models based on our different experiences. 
Models can come from the media, from our elected officials ... 
Think of models of terrorism, child kidnapping, airline safety, car safety. 
Models can come from industry. 
The two I'm following are surveillance cameras, ID cards, quite a lot of our computer security models come from there. 
A lot of models come from science. 
Health models are a great example. 
Think of cancer, bird flu, swine flu, SARS. 
All of our feelings of security about those diseases come from models given to us, really, by science filtered through the media. 
So models can change. 
Models are not static. 
As we become more comfortable in our environments, our model can move closer to our feelings. 
So an example might be, if you go back 100 years ago, when electricity was first becoming common, there were a lot of fears about it. 
There were people who were afraid to push doorbells, because there was electricity in there, and that was dangerous. 
For us, we're very facile around electricity. 
We change light bulbs without even thinking about it. 
Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into. 
It hasn't changed as we were growing up. 
And we're good at it. 
Or think of the risks on the Internet across generations -- how your parents approach Internet security, versus how you do, versus how our kids will. 
Models eventually fade into the background. 
"Intuitive" is just another word for familiar. 
So as your model is close to reality and it converges with feelings, you often don't even know it's there. 
A nice example of this came from last year and swine flu. 
When swine flu first appeared, the initial news caused a lot of overreaction. 
Now, it had a name, which made it scarier than the regular flu, even though it was more deadly. 
And people thought doctors should be able to deal with it. 
So there was that feeling of lack of control. 
And those two things made the risk more than it was. 
As the novelty wore off and the months went by, there was some amount of tolerance; people got used to it. 
There was no new data, but there was less fear. 
By autumn, people thought the doctors should have solved this already. 
And there's kind of a bifurcation: people had to choose between fear and acceptance -- actually, fear and indifference -- and they kind of chose suspicion. 
And when the vaccine appeared last winter, there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it. 
And it's a nice example of how people's feelings of security change, how their model changes, sort of wildly, with no new information, with no new input. 
This kind of thing happens a lot. 
I'm going to give one more complication. 
We have feeling, model, reality. 
I have a very relativistic view of security. 
I think it depends on the observer. 
And most security decisions have a variety of people involved. 
And stakeholders with specific trade-offs will try to influence the decision. 
And I call that their agenda. 
And you see agenda -- this is marketing, this is politics -- trying to convince you to have one model versus another, trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings, marginalizing people with models you don't like. 
This is not uncommon. 
An example, a great example, is the risk of smoking. 
In the history of the past 50 years, the smoking risk shows how a model changes, and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like. 
Compare that to the secondhand smoke debate -- probably about 20 years behind. 
Think about seat belts. 
When I was a kid, no one wore a seat belt. 
Nowadays, no kid will let you drive if you're not wearing a seat belt. 
Compare that to the airbag debate, probably about 30 years behind. 
All examples of models changing. 
What we learn is that changing models is hard. 
Models are hard to dislodge. 
If they equal your feelings, you don't even know you have a model. 
And there's another cognitive bias I'll call confirmation bias, where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs. 
So evidence against our model, we're likely to ignore, even if it's compelling. 
It has to get very compelling before we'll pay attention. 
New models that extend long periods of time are hard. 
Global warming is a great example. 
We're terrible at models that span 80 years. 
We can do "to the next harvest." 
We can often do "until our kids grow up." 
But "80 years," we're just not good at. 
So it's a very hard model to accept. 
We can have both models in our head simultaneously -- that kind of problem where we're holding both beliefs together, the cognitive dissonance. 
Eventually, the new model will replace the old model. 
Strong feelings can create a model. 
September 11 created a security model in a lot of people's heads. 
Also, personal experiences with crime can do it, personal health scare, a health scare in the news. 
You'll see these called "flashbulb events" by psychiatrists. 
They can create a model instantaneously, because they're very emotive. 
So in the technological world, we don't have experience to judge models. 
And we rely on others. We rely on proxies. 
And this works, as long as it's the correct others. 
We rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe. 
I flew here yesterday. 
I didn't check the airplane. 
I relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly. 
We're here, none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us, not because we checked, but because we're pretty sure the building codes here are good. 
It's a model we just accept pretty much by faith. 
Now, what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models, have it reflected in their feelings, to allow them to make security trade-offs. 
When these go out of whack, you have two options. 
One, you can fix people's feelings, directly appeal to feelings. 
It's manipulation, but it can work. 
The second, more honest way is to actually fix the model. 
Change happens slowly. 
The smoking debate took 40 years -- and that was an easy one. 
Some of this stuff is hard. 
Really, though, information seems like our best hope. 
And I lied. 
Remember I said feeling, model, reality; reality doesn't change? 
It actually does. 
We live in a technological world; reality changes all the time. 
So we might have, for the first time in our species: feeling chases model, model chases reality, reality's moving -- they might never catch up. 
We don't know. 
But in the long term, both feeling and reality are important. 
And I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this. 
1982 -- I don't know if people will remember this -- there was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings in the United States. 
It's a horrific story. 
Someone took a bottle of Tylenol, put poison in it, closed it up, put it back on the shelf, someone else bought it and died. 
There were a couple of copycat attacks. 
There wasn't any real risk, but people were scared. 
And this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented. 
Those tamper-proof caps? That came from this. 
It's complete security theater. 
As a homework assignment, think of 10 ways to get around it. 
I'll give you one: a syringe. 
But it made people feel better. 
It made their feeling of security more match the reality. 
Last story: a few years ago, a friend of mine gave birth. 
I visit her in the hospital. 
It turns out, when a baby's born now, they put an RFID bracelet on the baby, a corresponding one on the mother, so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward, an alarm goes off. 
I wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals." 
I go home, I look it up. 
It basically never happens. 
(Laughter) But if you think about it, if you are a hospital, and you need to take a baby away from its mother, out of the room to run some tests, you better have some good security theater, or she's going to rip your arm off. 
(Laughter) So it's important for us, those of us who design security, who look at security policy -- or even look at public policy in ways that affect security. 
It's not just reality; it's feeling and reality. 
What's important is that they be about the same. 
It's important that, if our feelings match reality, we make better security trade-offs. 
Thank you. 

We have all probably wondered how great minds achieved what they achieved, right? 
And the more astonishing their achievements are, the more we call them geniuses, perhaps aliens coming from a different planet, definitely not someone like us. 
But is that true? 
So let me start with an example. 
You all know the story of Newton's apple, right? OK. 
Is that true? Probably not. 
Still, it's difficult to think that no apple at all was there. 
I mean some stepping stone, some specific conditions that made universal gravitation not impossible to conceive. 
And definitely this was not impossible, at least for Newton. 
It was possible, and for some reason, it was also there, available at some point, easy to pick as an apple. 
Here is the apple. 
And what about Einstein? 
Was relativity theory another big leap in the history of ideas no one else could even conceive? 
Or rather, was it again something adjacent and possible, to Einstein of course, and he got there by small steps and his very peculiar scientific path? 
Of course we cannot conceive this path, but this doesn't mean that the path was not there. 
So all of this seems very evocative, but I would say hardly concrete if we really want to grasp the origin of great ideas and more generally the way in which the new enters our lives. 
As a physicist, as a scientist, I have learned that posing the right questions is half of the solution. 
But I think now we start having a great conceptual framework to conceive and address the right questions. 
So let me drive you to the edge of what is known, or at least, what I know, and let me show you that what is known could be a powerful and fascinating starting point to grasp the deep meaning of words like novelty, innovation, creativity perhaps. 
So we are discussing the "new," and of course, the science behind it. 
The new can enter our lives in many different ways, can be very personal, like I meet a new person, I read a new book, or I listen to a new song. 
Or it could be global, I mean, something we call innovation. 
It could be a new theory, a new technology, but it could also be a new book if you're the writer, or it could be a new song if you're the composer. 
In all of these global cases, the new is for everyone, but experiencing the new can be also frightening, so the new can also frighten us. 
But still, experiencing the new means exploring a very peculiar space, the space of what could be, the space of the possible, the space of possibilities. 
It's a very weird space, so I'll try to get you through this space. 
So it could be a physical space. 
So in this case, for instance, novelty could be climbing Machu Picchu for the first time, as I did in 2016. 
It could be a conceptual space, so acquiring new information, making sense of it, in a word, learning. 
It could be a biological space. 
I mean, think about the never-ending fight of viruses and bacteria with our immune system. 
And now comes the bad news. 
We are very, very bad at grasping this space. 
Think of it. Let's make an experiment. 
Try to think about all the possible things you could do in the next, say, 24 hours. 
Here the key word is "all." 
Of course you can conceive a few options, like having a drink, writing a letter, also sleeping during this boring talk, if you can. 
But not all of them. 
So think about an alien invasion, now, here, in Milan, or me -- I stopped thinking for 15 minutes. 
So it's very difficult to conceive this space, but actually we have an excuse. 
So it's not so easy to conceive this space because we are trying to conceive the occurrence of something brand new, so something that never occurred before, so we don't have clues. 
A typical solution could be looking at the future with the eyes of the past, so relying on all the time series of past events and hoping that this is enough to predict the future. 
But we know this is not working. 
For instance, this was the first attempt for weather forecasts, and it failed. 
And it failed because of the great complexity of the underlying phenomenon. 
So now we know that predictions had to be based on modeling, which means creating a synthetic model of the system, simulating this model and then projecting the system into the future through this model. 
And now we can do this in a lot of cases with the help of a lot of data. 
Looking at the future with the eye of the past could be misleading also for machines. 
Think about it. 
Now picture yourself for a second in the middle of the Australian Outback. 
You stand there under the sun. 
So you see something weird happening. 
The car suddenly stops very, very far from a kangaroo crossing the street. 
You look closer and you realize that the car has no driver. 
It is not restarting, even after the kangaroo is not there anymore. 
So for some reasons, the algorithms driving the car cannot make sense of this strange beast jumping here and there on the street. 
So it just stops. 
Now, I should tell you, this is a true story. 
It happened a few months ago to Volvo's self-driving cars in the middle of the Australian Outback. 
(Laughter) It is a general problem, and I guess this will affect more and more in the near future artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
It's also a very old problem, I would say 17th century, but I guess now we have new tools and new clues to start solving it. 
So let me take a step back, five years back. 
Italy. Rome. Winter. 
So the winter of 2012 was very special in Rome. 
Rome witnessed one of the greatest snowfalls of its history. 
That winter was special also for me and my colleagues, because we had an insight about the possible mathematical scheme -- again, possible, possible mathematical scheme, to conceive the occurrence of the new. 
I remember that day because it was snowing, so due to the snowfall, we were blocked, stuck in my department, and we couldn't go home, so we got another coffee, we relaxed and we kept discussing. 
But at some point -- maybe not that date, precisely -- at some point we made the connection between the problem of the new and a beautiful concept proposed years before by Stuart Kauffman, the adjacent possible. 
So the adjacent possible consists of all those things. 
It could be ideas, it could be molecules, it could be technological products that are one step away from what actually exists, and you can achieve them through incremental modifications and recombinations of the existing material. 
So for instance, if I speak about the space of my friends, my adjacent possible would be the set of all friends of my friends not already my friends. 
I hope that's clear. 
But now if I meet a new person, say Briar, all her friends would immediately enter my adjacent possible, pushing its boundaries further. 
So if you really want to look from the mathematical point of view -- I'm sure you want -- you can actually look at this picture. 
So suppose now this is your universe. 
I know I'm asking a lot. 
I mean, this is your universe. Now you are the red spot. 
And the green spot is the adjacent possible for you, so something you've never touched before. 
So you do your normal life. 
You move. You move in the space. 
You have a drink. You meet friends. You read a book. 
At some point, you end up on the green spot, so you meet Briar for the first time. 
And what happens? 
So what happens is there is a new part, a brand new part of the space, becoming possible for you in this very moment, even without any possibility for you to foresee this before touching that point. 
And behind this there will be a huge set of points that could become possible at some later stages. 
So you see the space of the possible is very peculiar, because it's not predefined. 
It's not something we can predefine. 
It's something that gets continuously shaped and reshaped by our actions and our choices. 
So we were so fascinated by these connections we made -- scientists are like this. 
And based on this, we conceived our mathematical formulation for the adjacent possible, 20 years after the original Kauffman proposals. 
In our theory -- this is a key point -- I mean, it's crucially based on a complex interplay between the way in which this space of possibilities expands and gets restructured, and the way in which we explore it. 
After the epiphany of 2012, we got back to work, real work, because we had to work out this theory, and we came up with a certain number of predictions to be tested in real life. 
Of course, we need a testable framework to study innovation. 
So let me drive you across a few predictions we made. 
The first one concerns the pace of innovation, so the rate at which you observe novelties in very different systems. 
So our theory predicts that the rate of innovation should follow a universal curve, like this one. 
This is the rate of innovation versus time in very different conditions. 
And somehow, we predict that the rate of innovation should decrease steadily over time. 
So somehow, innovation is predicted to become more difficult as your progress over time. 
It's neat. It's interesting. It's beautiful. We were happy. 
But the question is, is that true? 
Of course we should check with reality. 
So we went back to reality and we collected a lot of data, terabytes of data, tracking innovation in Wikipedia, Twitter, the way in which we write free software, even the way we listen to music. 
I cannot tell you, we were so amazed and pleased and thrilled to discover that the same predictions we made in the theory were actually satisfied in real systems, many different real systems. 
We were so excited. 
Of course, apparently, we were on the right track, but of course, we couldn't stop, so we didn't stop. 
So we kept going on, and at some point we made another discovery that we dubbed "correlated novelties." 
It's very simple. 
So I guess we all experience this. 
So you listen to "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen, and this experience triggers your passion for Cohen so that you start frantically listening to his whole production. 
And then you realize that Fabrizio De André here recorded an Italian version of "Suzanne," and so on and so forth. 
So somehow for some reason, the very notion of adjacent possible is already encoding the common belief that one thing leads to another in many different systems. 
But the reason why we were thrilled is because actually we could give, for the first time, a scientific substance to this intuition and start making predictions about the way in which we experience the new. 
So novelties are correlated. 
They are not occurring randomly. 
And this is good news, because it implies that impossible missions might not be so impossible after all, if we are guided by our intuition, somehow leading us to trigger a positive chain reaction. 
But there is a third consequence of the existence of the adjacent possible that we named "waves of novelties." 
So just to make this simple, so in music, without waves of novelties, we would still be listening all the time to Mozart or Beethoven, which is great, but we don't do this all the time. 
We also listen to the Pet Shop Boys or Justin Bieber -- well, some of us do. 
(Laughter) So we could see very clearly all of these patterns in the huge amounts of data we collected and analyzed. 
For instance, we discovered that popular hits in music are continuously born, you know that, and then they disappear, still leaving room for evergreens. 
So somehow waves of novelties ebb and flow while the tides always hold the classics. 
There is this coexistence between evergreens and new hits. 
Not only our theory predicts these waves of novelties. 
This would be trivial. 
But it also explains why they are there, and they are there for a specific reason, because we as humans display different strategies in the space of the possible. 
So some of us tend to retrace already known paths. 
So we say they exploit. 
Some of us always launch into new adventures. 
We say they explore. 
And what we discovered is all the systems we investigated are right at the edge between these two strategies, something like 80 percent exploiting, 20 percent exploring, something like blade runners of innovation. 
So it seems that the wise balance, you could also say a conservative balance, between past and future, between exploitation and exploration, is already in place and perhaps needed in our system. 
But again the good news is now we have scientific tools to investigate this equilibrium, perhaps pushing it further in the near future. 
So as you can imagine, I was really fascinated by all this. 
Our mathematical scheme is already providing cues and hints to investigate the space of possibilities and the way in which all of us create it and explore it. 
But there is more. 
This, I guess, is a starting point of something that has the potential to become a wonderful journey for a scientific investigation of the new, but also I would say a personal investigation of the new. 
And I guess this can have a lot of consequences and a huge impact in key activities like learning, education, research, business. 
So for instance, if you think about artificial intelligence, I am sure -- I mean, artificial intelligence, we need to rely in the near future more and more on the structure of the adjacent possible, to restructure it, to change it, but also to cope with the unknowns of the future. 
In parallel, we have a lot of tools, new tools now, to investigate how creativity works and what triggers innovation. 
And the aim of all this is to raise a generation of people able to come up with new ideas to face the challenges in front of us. 
We all know. 
I think it's a long way to go, but the questions, and the tools, are now there, adjacent and possible. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I thought I'd talk a little bit about how nature makes materials. 
I brought along with me an abalone shell. 
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein. 
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart. 
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells, like chalk. 
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials, and there's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job. 
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure, but they're formed at the nano scale. 
They're formed at the nano scale, and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures. 
So something I think is very fascinating is: What if you could give life to non-living structures, like batteries and like solar cells? 
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did, in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure, using nontoxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment? 
So that's kind of the vision that I've been thinking about. 
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish? 
Or what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so in an environmentally friendly way? 
And so, going back to this abalone shell, besides being nanostructured, one thing that's fascinating is, when a male and female abalone get together, they pass on the genetic information that says, "This is how to build an exquisite material. 
Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure, using nontoxic materials." 
Same with diatoms, which are shown right here, which are glasseous structures. 
Every time the diatoms replicate, they give the genetic information that says, "Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nanostructured." 
And you can do it the same, over and over again." 
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery? 
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old. 
But anyone who's ever had or knows small children knows, they're incredibly complex organisms. 
If you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do, it's very difficult. 
So when we think about future technologies, we actually think of using bacteria and viruses -- simple organisms. 
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so they can build a structure that will be important to me? 
Also, when we think about future technologies, we start with the beginning of Earth. 
Basically, it took a billion years to have life on Earth. 
And very rapidly, they became multi-cellular, they could replicate, they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source. 
But it wasn't until about 500 million years ago -- during the Cambrian geologic time period -- that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials. 
Before that, they were all soft, fluffy structures. 
It was during this time that there was increased calcium, iron and silicon in the environment, and organisms learned how to make hard materials. 
So that's what I would like to be able to do, convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table. 
Now, if you look at biology, there's many structures like DNA, antibodies, proteins and ribosomes you've heard about, that are nanostructured -- nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nano scale. 
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV? 
What if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us? 
Here are some examples. 
Natural shells, natural biological materials. 
The abalone shell here. 
If you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nanostructured. 
There's diatoms made out of SiO2, and there are magnetotactic bacteria that make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation. 
What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nano scale, and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures. 
Now, going back to the abalone shell, the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins. 
These proteins are very negatively charged. 
They can pull calcium out of the environment, and put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate. 
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids which says, "This is how to build the structure. 
Here's the DNA sequence, here's the protein sequence in order to do it." 
So an interesting idea is, what if you could take any material you wanted, or any element on the periodic table, and find its corresponding DNA sequence, then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure, but not build an abalone shell -- build something that nature has never had the opportunity to work with yet. 
And so here's the periodic table. 
I absolutely love the periodic table. 
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT, I have a periodic table made that says, "Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element." 
(Laughter) And you flip it over, and it's the amino acids with the pH at which they have different charges. 
And so I give this out to thousands of people. 
And I know it says MIT and this is Caltech, but I have a couple extra if people want it. 
I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT, and I really wanted to give him a periodic table. 
So I stayed up at night and talked to my husband, "How do I give President Obama a periodic table? 
What if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,' or, 'I've already memorized it?'" (Laughter) So he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit. 
And then afterward, I said, "Sir, I want to give you the periodic table, in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight." 
(Laughter) I thought "molecular weight" sounded much less nerdy than "molar mass." 
(Laughter) And he looked at it and said, "Thank you. I'll look at it periodically." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy, he pulled it out and said, "And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables." So ... 
So basically what I didn't tell you is that about 500 million years ago, the organisms started making materials, but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it -- 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell. 
And that's a hard sell to a graduate student: "I have this great project ... 50 million years ..." 
So we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly. 
And so we use a nontoxic virus called M13 bacteriophage, whose job is to infect bacteria. 
Well, it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it, and by doing that, it allows the virus to express random protein sequences. 
This is pretty easy biotechnology, and you could basically do this a billion times. 
So you can have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical, but they differ from each other based on their tips, on one sequence, that codes for one protein. 
Now if you take all billion viruses, and put them in one drop of liquid, you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table. 
And through a process of selection evolution, you can pull one of a billion that does something you'd like it to do, like grow a battery or a solar cell. 
Once you find that one out of a billion, you infect it into a bacteria, and make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence. 
The other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales. 
These viruses are long and skinny, and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries. 
Now, this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab. 
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes. 
One part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube, the other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery, and then it wires itself to the current collector. 
And so through a process of selection evolution, we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature, basically at the benchtop. 
That battery went to the White House for a press conference, and I brought it here. 
Now if we could scale this, you could actually use it to run your Prius, which is kind of my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car. 
(Laughter) But basically you can pull one out of a billion, and make lots of amplifications to it. 
Basically, you make an amplification in the lab, and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery. 
We're able to do this also with catalysis. 
This is the example of a photocatalytic splitting of water. 
And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna, and you get an energy transfer across the virus. 
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, that can be used for clean fuels. 
I brought an example of that with me today. 
My students promised me it would work. 
These are virus-assembled nanowires. 
When you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling. 
In this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out. 
(Applause) Basically, by controlling the genes, you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance. 
The last example are solar cells. 
We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them, and use it as a way of getting electrons through the device. 
And what we've found is through genetic engineering, we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems. 
And I brought one of those as well, that you can play around with outside afterward. 
So this is a virus-based solar cell. 
Through evolution and selection, we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell. 
So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great, interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials, and about taking it the next step, to see if you can force or take advantage of how nature makes materials, to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making. 
Thank you. 

I grew up in a family of social scientists, but I was the weird child who drew. 
(Laughter) From making sketches of the models in my mom's Sears catalog ... 
to a bedroom so full of my craft projects that it was like my own personal art gallery, I lived to make. 
I don't think anyone in my family was surprised when I became an architect. 
But to be honest with you, the real foundation of the architect I became was not laid in that bedroom art gallery but by the conversations around my family's dinner table. 
There were stories of how people lived and connected to one another, from the impact of urban migration on a village in Zambia to the complex health care needs of the homeless in the streets of San Francisco. 
Now, it would be fair if you're looking over at your seatmate and wondering, "What the hell does that have to do with architecture?" 
Well, all of these stories involved space and how it did or didn't accommodate us. 
The fact is, we share some of our deepest connections in physical space. 
And our stories play out, even in this crazy age of texting and tweeting, in physical space. 
Unfortunately, architecture hasn't done a great job of telling all of our stories equally. 
Too often, we see the building of monuments like the Gherkin or even Trump Tower ... 
(Laughter) that tell the story of the haves rather than the have-nots. 
Throughout my career, I've actively resisted the practice of building monuments to certain peoples' stories -- usually white, male, rich -- and bulldozing other peoples' stories -- usually people of color from low-income communities. 
I've tried to create a practice that is rooted in elevating the stories of those who have most often been silenced. 
That work -- it's been a mission in spatial justice. 
(Applause) Now, spatial justice means that we understand that justice has a geography, and that the equitable distribution of resources, services and access is a basic human right. 
So what does spatial justice look like? 
Well, I'd like to share a story with you. 
For years, I've been working in the historically African-American neighborhood of Bayview Hunters Point in San Francisco, on a plot of land that once held a power plant. 
Back in the '90s, a community group led by mothers who lived in the public housing on the hill above the plant fought for its closure. 
They won. 
The utility company finally tore it down, cleaned the soil and capped most of the site with asphalt so that the clean soil wouldn't blow away. 
Sounds like a success story, right? 
Well, not so fast. 
You see, because of various issues like land entitlements, lease agreements, etc., the land actually couldn't be redeveloped for at least five to 10 years. 
What that meant is that this community that had been living near a power plant for decades, now had 30 acres of asphalt in their backyard. 
To put that in context for you, 30 acres is equal to about 30 football fields. 
Now, the utility company didn't want to be the bad guy here. 
Recognizing that they owed the community, they actually put out a call for designers to propose temporary uses for this site, hoping to turn it into a community benefit rather than blight. 
I'm part of the diverse team of designers that responded to that call, and for the last four years, we've been collaborating with those mothers and other residents, as well as local organizations and the utility company. 
We've been experimenting with all types of events to try and address issues of spatial justice. 
Everything from job training workshops to an annual circus to even a beautiful, new shoreline trail. 
In the four years that we've been operational, over 12,000 people have come and done something on this site that we hope has transformed their relationship to it. 
But lately, I'm starting to realize that events are not enough. 
A few months ago, there was a community meeting in this neighborhood. 
The utility company was finally ready to talk concretely about long-term redevelopment. 
That meeting was kind of a disaster. 
There was a lot of yelling and anger. 
People asked things like, "If you're going to sell it to a developer, wouldn't they just build luxury condos like everyone else?" 
And "Where has the city been?" 
"Why aren't there more jobs and resources in this neighborhood?" 
It was not that our events had failed to bring joy. 
But in spite of that, there was still pain here. 
Pain from a history of environmental injustice that left many industrial uses in this neighborhood, leaving residents living near toxic waste and, literally, shit. 
There's pain from the fact that this zip code still has one of the lowest per capita income, highest unemployment and highest incarceration rates in a city which tech giants like Twitter, Airbnb and Uber call home. 
And those tech companies -- hm -- they've actually helped to trigger a gentrification push that is rapidly redefining this neighborhood, both in terms of identity and population. 
Now let me pause for a moment to talk about gentrification. 
I suspect for a lot of us, it's kind of like a dirty word. 
It's become synonymous with the displacement of poor residents from their neighborhood by wealthier newcomers. 
If you've ever been displaced, then you know the agony of losing a place that held your story. 
And if you haven't experienced this, then I'm going to ask you to try and imagine your way into it right now. 
Think about what it would be like to find your favorite local spot, a place where you often went and hung out with the old-timers or your friends, had vanished. 
And then you get home, and you find a letter from your landlord, saying that your rent's been doubled. 
The choice to stay -- it's not yours to make. 
You no longer belong in your home. 
And know that this feeling you're feeling right now, it would be the same regardless of whether or not the person who harmed you meant to do so. 
Developer Majora Carter once said to me, "Poor people don't hate gentrification. 
They just hate that they rarely get to hang around long enough to enjoy its benefits." 
Why is it that we treat culture erasure and economic displacement as inevitable? 
We could approach development with an acknowledgment of past injustices -- find value not only in those new stories but the old ones, too. 
And make a commitment to build people's capacity to stay -- to stay in their homes, to stay in their communities, to stay where they feel whole. 
But to do this rethink, it requires looking at those past injustices and the pain and grief that is interwoven into them. 
And as I started to reflect on my own work, I realized that pain and grief have been recurring themes. 
I heard it early on in the Bayview Hunters Point project when a man named Daryl said, "We've always been set aside like an island -- a no-man's-land." 
I also heard it in Houston, when I was working on a project with day laborers. 
And as Juan told me stories of being robbed of his wages many times on the corner in which he stood every day to earn a living to support his family, he asked, "Why can't anyone see the sacredness of this site?" 
You know, you've seen the pain, too. 
From campaigns around statue removals in Charlottesville and New Orleans ... 
to towns that have lost their industrial lifeblood and are now dying, like Lorain, Ohio and Bolton, England. 
We often rush to remake these places, thinking that we can ease their pain. 
But in our boundless desire to do good, to get past all of our mistakes, to build places that hold possibility, we often maintain a blissful ignorance of a landscape filled with a very long trail of broken promises and squelched dreams. 
We are building on top of brokenness. 
Is it any wonder that the foundations cannot hold? 
Holding space for pain and grief was never part of my job description as an architect -- after all, it's not expedient, focused on beauty, and hell, even requested by my clients. 
But I've seen what happens when there's space for pain. 
It can be transformational. 
Returning to our story, when we first started working in the neighborhood, one of the first things we did was go out and interview the activists who had led the fight to close the plant. 
We consistently heard and felt from them a sense of impending loss. 
The neighborhood was already changing, even back then. 
People were leaving or dying of old age, and with those departures, stories were being lost. 
To those activists, no one was going to know the amazing things that had happened in this community, because to everyone on the outside, it was the ghetto. 
At worst, a place of violence; at best, a blank slate. 
Neither was true, of course. 
So my colleagues and I, we reached out to StoryCorps. 
And with their support, and that of the utility company, we built a listening booth on our site. 
And we invited the residents to come and have their stories recorded for posterity. 
After a few days of recording, we held a listening party where we played clips, much like what you hear on NPR every Friday morning. 
That party -- it was one of the most amazing community meetings I've ever been a part of. 
In part because we didn't just talk about joy but also pain. 
Two stories that I remember well -- AJ talked about what it was like to grow up in the neighborhood. 
There was always a kid to play with. 
But he also spoke with sadness of what it was like to first be stopped and questioned by a police officer when he was 11. 
GL also talked about the kids, and the ups and downs of the experience of living in this neighborhood, but he also spoke with pride of some of the organizations that had sprung up to provide support and empowerment. 
He wanted to see more of that. 
By holding space to first express pain and grief, we were then able to brainstorm ideas for a site -- amazing ideas that then became the seeds of what we did over the next four years. 
So why the radically different meeting now? 
Well ... 
the pain and grief woven into these spaces was not created in a day. 
Healing also takes time. 
After all, who here thinks you can go to therapy just once and be cured? 
(Laughter) Anyone? 
I didn't think so. 
In retrospect, I wish that we had held more listening sessions, not just joyful events. 
My work's taken me all over the world, and I have yet to set foot in a place where pain didn't exist and the potential for healing was absent. 
So while I've spent my career honing my skills as an architect, I realize that I'm now also a healer. 
I suppose this is the point in the talk where I should be telling you those five steps to healing, but I don't have the solution -- yet. 
Just a path. 
That being said, there are a few things I have learned along the way. 
First -- we cannot create cities for everyone unless we're first willing to listen to everyone. 
Not just about what they hope to see built in the future but also about what has been lost or unfulfilled. 
Second -- healing is not just for "those people." 
For those of us with privilege, we have to have a reckoning with our own guilt, discomfort and complicity. 
As non-profit leader Anne Marks once observed, "Hurt people hurt people; healed people heal people." 
And third -- healing is not about the erasure of pain. 
We often have a tendency to want to put a clean slate over our pain, much like that asphalt on the soil in Bayview Hunters Point. 
But it doesn't work that way. 
Healing is about acknowledging pain and making peace with it. 
One of my favorite quotes says that healing renews our faith in the process of becoming. 
I stand here before you as an architect-healer because I'm ready to see what I can become, what my community and those that I work with can become, and what this country, and frankly, this world can become. 
And I was not meant to take that journey alone. 
I believe that many of you are unhappy with the way that things are now. 
Believe that it can be different. 
I believe that you all are far more resilient than you think. 
But the first step requires courage. 
The courage to see each other's pain, and to be willing to stay in the presence of it, even when it gets uncomfortable. 
Just imagine the change that we can make together if we all committed to that. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book. 
It's called "Our Choice" and the author is Al Gore. 
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. 
The book starts like this. This is the cover. 
As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. 
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom. 
And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up. 
And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. 
And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. 
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open. 
(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. 
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. 
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map. 
Zoom into it and see where it was taken. 
And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. 
So you can open this one. 
(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... 
MM: It starts playing immediately. 
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing. 
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing. 
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. 
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States. 
But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is. 
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. 
This is one of my favorites. 
So this shows ... 
(Laughter) (Applause) When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. 
And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out. 
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad. 
It also runs on the iPhone. 
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. 
And it works the exact same way. 
You can pinch into any page. 
Open it up. 
So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's "Our Choice." 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: That's spectacular. 
Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser? 
What is the business here? 
Is this something that other people can do? 
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. 
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text. 
CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.) All right. Mike, thanks so much. 
MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.) (Applause) 

My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker. 
I've been making toys for the last 30 years. 
The early '70s, I was in college. 
It was a very revolutionary time. 
It was a political ferment, so to say -- students out in the streets of Paris, revolting against authority. 
America was jolted by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement. 
In India, we had the Naxalite movement, the [unclear] movement. 
But you know, when there is a political churning of society, it unleashes a lot of energy. 
The National Movement of India was testimony to that. 
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement. 
Now in the early '70s, one of the great programs in India was to revitalize primary science in village schools. 
There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech and returned back as a molecular biologist in India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR. 
At 31, he was not able to relate the kind of [unclear] research, which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people. 
So he designed and went and started a village science program. 
Many people were inspired by this. 
The slogan of the early '70s was "Go to the people. 
Live with them; love them. 
Start from what they know. Build on what they have." 
This was kind of the defining slogan. 
Well I took one year. 
I joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune. 
I worked there for two years, and I realized that I was not born to make trucks. 
Often one doesn't know what one wants to do, but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do. 
So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program. 
And it was a turning point. 
It was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats. 
So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here." 
So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside. 
And one thing which I found was this black rubber. 
This is called a cycle valve tube. 
When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this. 
And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint. 
It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles -- an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle. 
It's like its own little coupling. 
If you have three of them, and you loop them together, well you make a triangle. 
With four, you make a square, you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon, you make all these kind of polygons. 
And they have some wonderful properties. 
If you look at the hexagon, for instance, it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile. 
You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle. 
You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram. 
But this is very shaky. 
Look at the pentagon, for instance, pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium. 
Push it and it becomes house shaped. 
This becomes an isosceles triangle -- again, very shaky. 
This square might look very square and prim. 
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus. 
It becomes kite-shaped. 
But give a child a triangle, he can't do a thing to it. 
Why use triangles? 
Because triangles are the only rigid structures. 
We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come, it would start doing a jig. 
Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India, they might not have gone to engineering college, but no one makes a roof placed like this. 
Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash. 
They always make a triangular roof. 
Now this is people science. 
And if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick, you'll get a T joint. 
And if I were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle, I would make a tetrahedron. 
So you make all these 3D shapes. 
You make a tetrahedron like this. 
And once you make these, you make a little house. 
Put this on top. 
You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six. 
You just need a ton. 
Now this was -- you make a joint of six, you make an icosahedron. 
You can play around with it. 
This makes an igloo. 
Now this is in 1978. 
I was a 24-year-old young engineer. 
And I thought this was so much better than making trucks. 
(Applause) If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside, you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4. 
Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron, which means the little carbon atom. 
Well since then, I just thought that I've been really privileged to go to over 2,000 schools in my country -- village schools, government schools, municipal schools, Ivy League schools -- I've been invited by most of them. 
And every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children. 
I see hope. I see happiness in their faces. 
Children want to make things. Children want to do things. 
Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps. 
Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon. 
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon. 
And we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it. 
So all you do is -- it's a very kind of provocative statement -- this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear] This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube. 
And this is how you make a valve. 
You put a little sticky tape. 
This is one-way traffic. 
Well we make lots and lots of pumps. 
And this is the other one -- that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-cuts. 
Now this is what you do, is you bend both these legs into a triangle, and you just wrap some tape around. 
And this is the pump. 
And now, if you have this pump, it's like a great, great sprinkler. 
It's like a centrifuge. 
If you spin something, it tends to fly out. 
(Applause) Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh, you would make this with the palmyra leaf. 
Many of our folk toys have great science principles. 
If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out. 
If I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man. 
Right. 
This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing. 
There are four pictures. 
You see insects, you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies, frogs, snakes, eagles. 
Here's a paper which you could [unclear] -- designed by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928, Arthur Stone, documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books. 
But this is great fun for children. 
They all study about the food chain. 
The insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes; the snakes are eaten by the eagles. 
And this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper -- A4 size paper -- you could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school -- a paper, a scale and a pencil -- no glue, no scissors. 
In three minutes, you just fold this up. 
And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination. 
If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon. 
With a bigger one, you make a bigger one. 
Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here. 
And you put a little fan here. 
And this is a hundred-year-old toy. 
There have been six major research papers on this. 
There's some grooves over here, you can see. 
And if I take a reed -- if I rub this, something very amazing happens. 
Six major research papers on this. 
As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this. 
He wrote a paper on this. 
And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider for doing this. (Laughter) (Applause) This is there for every child, and every child can enjoy this. 
If you want to put a colored disk, well all these seven colors coalesce. 
And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back, that white light's made of seven colors, just by spinning this around. 
This is a straw. 
What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape, nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner, so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here. 
This is a kind of a blowing straw. 
I just put this inside this. 
There's a hole here, and I shut this. 
And this costs very little money to make -- great fun for children to do. 
What we do is make a very simple electric motor. 
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth. 
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this. 
If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it. 
This is an old bicycle tube, which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins. 
This is a permanent magnet. 
Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet. 
It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin. 
We made 30,000. 
Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years, they just muck up the definition and they spit it out. 
When teachers make it, children make it. 
You can see a gleam in their eye. 
They get a thrill of what science is all about. 
And this science is not a rich man's game. 
In a democratic country, science must reach to our most oppressed, to the most marginalized children. 
This program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools. 
Over 100,000 children learn science this way. 
And we're just trying to see possibilities. 
Look, this is the tetrapak -- awful materials from the point of view of the environment. 
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic, aluminum -- which are are sealed together. 
They are fused together, so you can't separate them. 
Now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron. 
So something which is trash, which is choking all the seabirds, you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous -- all the platonic solids can be made with things like this. 
This is a little straw, and what you do is you just nip two corners here, and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth. 
You put this in your mouth, and you blow. 
(Honk) It's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say. 
You're not able to see how the sound is produced, because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth. 
I'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air. 
(Honk) So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations. 
The other is that you keep blowing at it, keep making the sound, and you keep cutting it. 
And something very, very nice happens. 
(Honk) (Applause) And when you get a very small one -- (Honk) This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this. 
Well before I go any further, this is something worth sharing. 
This is a touching slate meant for blind children. 
This is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate, and this is my drawing pen, which is basically a film box. 
It's basically like a fisherman's line, a fishing line. 
And this is wool over here. 
If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside. 
And what a blind child can do is to just draw this. 
Wool sticks on Velcro. 
There are 12 million blind children in our country -- (Applause) who live in a world of darkness. 
And this has come as a great boon to them. 
There's a factory out there making our children blind, not able to provide them with food, not able to provide them with vitamin A. 
But this has come as a great boon for them. 
There are no patents. Anyone can make it. 
This is very, very simple. 
You can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator. 
These are two magnets. 
This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs. 
Small pulley and two strong magnets. 
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED. 
If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster. 
There will be a spinning magnetic field. 
Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated. 
And you can see, this LED is going to glow. 
So this is a small crank generator. 
Well, this is, again, it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts. 
And what you can do is just, if you give it a twirl, well they just keep going on. 
And imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on. 
And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this. 
Well in the end, what we can also do: we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps. 
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar. 
It's a great cricket cap. (Laughter) (Applause) When first you see Nehru and Gandhi, this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper. 
We make lots of toys with newspapers, and this is one of them. 
And this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird. 
All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares. 
And if you have one of these birds -- children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years. 
And you can see, this is a little fantail bird. 
Well in the end, I'll just end with a story. 
This is called "The Captain's Hat Story." 
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship. 
It goes very slowly. 
And there were lots of passengers on the ship, and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck. 
"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance, and I'll provide you with good food and drinks." 
And the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia. 
The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap, like a captain's cap. 
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping, he would give it one more fold, and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap -- with a little shoot just like a designer cap, because it protects the spinal cord. 
And the second night, he would take the same cap and give it another fold. 
And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap -- just like an adventurer's cap. 
And the third night, he would give it two more folds -- and this is a very, very famous cap. 
If you've seen any of our Bollywood films, this is what the policeman wears, it's called a zapalu cap. 
It's been catapulted to international glory. 
And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship. 
So that's a ship. 
And now the end: everyone was enjoying the journey very much. 
They were singing and dancing. 
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves. 
And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves. 
A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down. 
And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down. 
And there's a third one over here. 
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down. 
And the ship sinks, and the captain has lost everything, but for a life jacket. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship. 
And it is. 
And yet, it feels natural to us now. 
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001. 
We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later. 
At the time, we knew that it was political. 
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family. 
And when I saw it -- and yet, through the shock, the terrible shock, and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful. 
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly. 
Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families. 
When I saw Aicha in the media, coming over when her son was indicted, and I thought, "What a brave woman. 
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger." 
I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength. 
I knew I would find her someday, or we would find each other. 
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy. 
But when people learned what her son was accused of, she didn't get that sympathy. 
But her suffering is equal to mine. 
So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. 
(Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui. 
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. 
So they introduced me to five families. 
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her. 
She was the only mother in the group. 
The others were brothers, sisters. 
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me. 
I suffered a lot as a mother. 
I was married when I was 14. 
I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16. 
So the story with Zacarias was too much really. 
And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive. 
I know she really cried for her son. 
But she knows where he is. 
My son, I don't know where he is. 
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured. 
I don't know what happened to him. 
So that's why I decided to tell my story, so that my suffering is something positive for other women. 
For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change. 
It's up to us women, because we are women, because we love our children. 
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together. 
It's not against women, it's for us, for us women, for our children. 
I talk against violence, against terrorism. 
I go to schools to talk to young, Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young. 
So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good. 
This is why I'm here in front of you. 
PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members. 
But we were all so nervous. 
"Why does she want to meet us?" 
And then she was nervous. 
"Why did we want to meet her?" 
What did we want from each other? 
Before we knew each others' names, or anything, we had embraced and wept. 
Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. 
And Aicha started, and she said, "I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families. 
I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished." 
But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker. 
And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings. 
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. 
Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had. 
I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. 
And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much. 
And I think it's all about being afraid of the other, but making that step and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard. 
Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?" 
So, Aicha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion? 
Because our time is up. 
(Laughter) (Translator) AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other. 
You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous. 
You must be tolerant. 
You have to fight against violence. 
And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other. 
This is what I wanted to say. 
(Applause) 

There is a pastor in Baltimore. 
His name is Michael Phillips, he is the pastor of Kingdom Life Church, and he often talks about how problems show up in our lives so arrogantly, with so much confidence, as if there is just nothing we can do about them. 
And the murder rate in Baltimore had been doing that. 
Year after year, it just kept showing up as this big thing that there was nothing any of us could do anything about. 
But the thing about Baltimore is that it has never been the one to just be defeated. 
So the story about the Baltimore Ceasefire is that Baltimore looked the murder rate in the eye and said, "What you're not going to do is snatch our greatness." 
So two years ago, I'm at a 300 Man March meeting. 
At the time, I was a leader in that movement. 
And this guy named Ogun -- he's like a godfather of hip-hop in Baltimore -- he came over to me and he said, "Yo, I have this idea about calling a ceasefire in Baltimore, and I feel like you are somebody I should talk to about that." 
And I was like, "I'm absolutely somebody you should talk to about that, because that's something we should do." 
And so we played phone tag and meeting tag, and two years went by and we never really sat down and talked about it. 
So now we're in May of 2017. 
My son Paul, he's 19 years old, he's driving me home from work one day, and he says, "Ma, did you know that the murder rate in Baltimore is higher than it's ever been?" 
And I said, "What you mean it's higher than it's ever been? 
How is that possible? 
Like, I mean, what about people who say they have connections to the streets? 
Why won't they use those connections and call a cease-fire or something?" 
And on and on I went from my own feelings of helplessness about what other people weren't doing. 
The next morning I woke up and I realized that what I was really angry about wasn't about what other people weren't doing, it was that I had heard this message years ago, and I hadn't moved on it. 
So it was about what I was supposed to be doing. 
So I got up and I'm going, "OK, if we could just have three days where everybody in the city was committing, nobody is going to kill anybody, and we're going to celebrate life instead, when can we do that?" 
So it's May, I look at my calendar, all right, I've got some free time the first weekend in August, we'll do it August 4th through August 6th, right? 
So I'm all excited, I start driving to work, and the more I drive, the scareder I get. 
And so I start going, "Never mind ... 
(Laughter) I won't say this thing out loud. 
Nobody will ever know I was thinking it if I don't say it." 
But it wouldn't let me go, because God loves to show up as us, and because I look broken and I'm always called to stand in my wholeness, there was a call on my life to say this thing out loud. 
And because my city looks broken and is always yearning to show up in its wholeness, there were hearts that morning calling all through my chest that people around this city wanted to do something great together. 
And people who had already been killed in my city were calling to me up through my gut and my chest, as a knot in my throat, "Yo, E, you cannot just let us be dead in vain when you know how to say this thing out loud." 
And I responded to them with my fear. 
"But somebody might get killed anyway that weekend." 
And that was the moment where I had to accept that maybe while we're out spreading this message -- "Hey, nobody's going to kill anybody. We're going to celebrate life!" -- maybe somebody will be plotting to take a life right then and there, but now they would have a rumbling in their spirit. 
And so I knew it was time for my city to have a collective rumbling in our spirit. 
So I got on the phone, got around to Ogun, and I said, "Yo, you said you wanted to do a cease-fire? 
What is it? I'm ready." 
So he said, "You know, when I hear about the Israelis and Palestinians at war, I'm like, that's too bad, they should stop that, but when I hear the word 'cease-fire,' that makes me pause and stop and really research what's going on." 
And he wanted Baltimore to get that same kind of attention from the outside, but introspection from the inside about what was going on with us. 
And we talked about how it couldn't belong to one person. 
Not one person or one organization should call a cease-fire. 
The whole city had to own it and do it together. 
So we had our first meeting in May. 
About 12 or 15 people show up, and this is where it gets named the Baltimore Ceasefire, because you know what that means when you hear the word "cease-fire." 
Just don't kill nobody. 
And this is where the Baltimore Peace Challenge was born. 
Because it's not just about not being violent. 
It is about being purposefully peaceful. 
What is going on in your thoughts? 
What kind of petty things are you not saying out of your mouth? 
How are you responding in your behaviors to conflict? 
I grabbed up five people who I trusted, and the six of us became the organizing squad. 
So let's give them props real quick. 
On the count of three, I want you to yell "squad." 
One, two, three: squad! Audience: Squad! 
And it's Shellers's birthday. Happy birthday, Shellers. 
Audience: Happy birthday! 
And so we put out a press release, and the media told us, this is not really a story yet, we will get with you on August 7th to see how the cease-fire went. 
So we went, "Oh, word? Oh, all right then." 
And Baltimore got to work, and not only did people send money to the PayPal account so we could buy flyers and posters, people came and got the flyers and posters and they put them all around the city, and people were having conversations with each other. 
What kind of resources do you need? What are you going through? 
What has happened to you? 
Because we understand the root causes of violence in this country. 
People who said it wouldn't work still ended their sentence with "but please keep trying. Somebody needs to do something anyway." 
Teenagers who would tell us about the stuff they were doing in the streets all day asked, "But can I have a poster to put it on my wall at night so I can see it on my way to bed?" 
Gangsters were calling, saying, "I can tell you where violence is not going to come from, because we're committing to the Peace Challenge." 
And they kept their word. 
When people said, "It's not going to work, because somebody's going to kill over West or over East," we said, "That doesn't matter. It's about self-determination, yo. 
You telling me you can't keep this three- or six-block radius safe?" 
And they would say, "Don't get it twisted. 
It's going to stay safe around here." And they kept their promise. 
(Applause) Four songs -- and I know it looks like I'm holding up five fingers, but I have four fingers, so this is four for me -- four songs got made about the Baltimore Ceasefire, and the one that most exemplifies it, where a bunch of artists came together and made a song, that one is currently nominated for a Grammy out here. Right? 
And so now what was happening was from the most beautiful corners of crack houses to the grimiest corners of politicians' offices, everybody -- (Laughter) was talking about this thing Baltimore was doing together. Right? 
And then, the weekend came: events all over the city, people yelling "Happy Ceasefire Day!" 
Over 200 people got their records expunged and got jobs, and people went into drug recovery programs because of what was happening in our city that weekend. 
People were going, "But the air feels different in Baltimore. 
Nobody's mother got that phone call last night. 
I didn't hear any gunshots." 
And on Saturday, Trey went to go get a job and was excited about it. 
At 24 hours of no killing, we were singing Kendrick Lamar. "We gon' be alright. We gon' be alright." 
And then at 4:59 on Saturday, we get a message that somebody was killed. 
We didn't know his name, but it turned out to be Trey. 
So we rushed over to Sargeant Street, and we held hands in a circle and we looked at the pavement, and we said, "This is sacred ground because we make it so, because everywhere in our city where people lose their lives to violence needs to be sacred ground." 
And it wasn't just about upholding Trey and his transition and sending love to his family. 
It was about us pausing to really think about what must it feel like 20 minutes after you kill somebody? 
Can't we pour love into that? 
Because until we do, we will not heal this epidemic. 
Later on in the day, we get another call. 
Dante is murdered. 
So by the end of this day, we were shook. 
In real life, we were shook, because we had opened up our hearts together and changed the atmosphere of this city, and now our hearts were broken together. 
And we had to be honest about the fact that last weekend, when we lost six people to violence, it didn't feel the way it felt this weekend when we lost these two, because now we were paying attention. 
Now we were all hoping together that nobody got killed. 
And so we had to make a vow with ourselves not to be numb anymore when we lose people in our city. 
These two lives were going to remind us to vibrate higher and to move forward. 
So as we move forward into Baltimore Ceasefire 365, because there's work that needs to be done all year, and there's another cease-fire happening next weekend, November 3rd through 5th. Mark your calendar. 
(Applause) Right? And we expect the same thing. 
It was news media from all around the world, Australia and Norway and China. 
Everybody wanted to come get this work from Baltimore, and y'all could come get it. Right? 
So as we push forward, we don't need to keep asking now "What can we do?" 
We have seen the power of collective consciousness. 
Y'all were the ones who misunderstood Baltimore. 
Y'all thought Baltimore was just "The Wire." 
When we lost Freddie Gray, y'all saw the Baltimore uprising, and people around this world mischaracterized it and misunderstood it. 
What you failed to realize is Baltimore is the power to rise up, and that is what we continue to do. 
(Applause) And so as we move forward, we see you, America, with your systems of violent oppression trying to beat us into the ground, and still, we rise. 
We rise and stand with cities all over this country just like us who are handed, through no fault of their own, criminal conditions in which to live, and then they get labeled savages for how they live. 
We stand with them. 
We remind them we are an example of what you can do when you say, "No, I don't have to accept these conditions that you are trying to hand me. 
I get to decide what the greatest vision of myself looks like. 
And so the next time you are faced with a dilemma, with a problem, you can say, "Let me be like Baltimore, let me look it in the face, let me tell it." 
But what you're not going to do is snatch my greatness. 
Please believe it. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Good afternoon, everybody. 
I've got something to show you. 
(Laughter) Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel. 
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design. 
Let me tell you a bit about it. 
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally, and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades. 
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race, you take a budget, and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car. 
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race. 
Now today, if you want to win the race, actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time, has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car, transmitting this information into the system, and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected. 
This is what, in engineering terms, you would call a real time control system. 
And basically, it's a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actuating component. 
What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives. 
Our cities, over the past few years, just have been blanketed with networks, electronics. 
They're becoming like computers in open air. 
And, as computers in open air, they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated. 
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal. 
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention, cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust, but they are 50 percent of the world's population. 
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions. 
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal. 
Beyond cities, all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects. 
That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year, during the summer. 
It's called "Talk to Me." 
Well our objects, our environment is starting to talk back to us. 
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator. 
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there. 
In a certain sense, it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ... 
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses, at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said, shouted, "Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?" 
Well today, for the first time, our environment is starting to talk back to us. 
And I'll show just a few examples -- again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it. 
Let's starting with sensing. 
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab. 
It was four and a half years ago in Italy. 
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that's a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network, that's collected anyway by the operator, in order to understand how the city works. 
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006. 
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup. 
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing, and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt. 
And anyway, Italy won at the end. 
(Laughter) Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network. 
Here you see the city. 
You see the Colosseum in the middle, the river Tiber. 
It's morning, before the match. 
You see the timeline on the top. 
Early afternoon, people here and there, making calls and moving. 
The match begins -- silence. 
France scores. Italy scores. 
Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom. 
Second half. End of normal time. 
First overtime, second. 
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment. 
Italy wins. Yeah. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center. 
You saw the big peak. 
The following day, again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time. 
And then everybody moved down. 
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo, where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate, to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day. 
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago. 
Another quick example about sensing: it's not about people, but about things we use and consume. 
Well today, we know everything about where our objects come from. 
This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together. 
But we know very little about where things go. 
So in this project, we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system. 
So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle, just over a year ago, to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things, as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway. 
Then we put a little chip, little tag, onto the trash and then started following it. 
Here are the results we just obtained. 
(Music) From Seattle ... 
after one week. 
With this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system. 
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy. 
This data was not available before. 
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening. 
But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear, it's still somewhere on the planet. 
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there. 
And if we show that to people, then we can also promote some behavioral change. 
So that was the reason for the project. 
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman, he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing, but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning, and that's actuating our environment. 
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain. 
It started with a question by the mayor of the city, who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture. 
And the question was: How could technology, new technology, be added to that? 
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves, solenoid valves, taps, opening and closing. 
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water. 
If those pixels fall, you can write on it, you can show patterns, images, text. 
And even you can approach it, and it will open up to let you jump through, as you see in this image. 
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch. 
He liked it very much. 
And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo. 
We called it Digital Water Pavilion. 
The whole building is made of water. 
There's no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in. 
(Music) The roof also is covered with water. 
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof. 
Or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappear, like in this case. 
You know, these days, you always get images during the winter, when they take the roof down, of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building." 
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down, the architecture almost disappears. 
Here's the building working. 
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside. 
And here was myself trying not to get wet, testing the sensors that open the water. 
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working. 
But actually that night, it was even more fun. 
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building, because the way of engaging with the building became something different. 
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in, but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water, and you had to jump without getting wet. 
(Video) (Crowd Noise) And that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architects, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design. 
But then reality's always unpredictable. 
And that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people. 
Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water, and then projections on them. 
And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now. 
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying. 
Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air, and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space. 
Here is the video. 
(Music) So imagine one helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others, in synchrony. 
So you can have this cloud. 
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions. 
Or in regular, but in three dimensions, where the thing that changes is the light, not the pixels' position. 
You can play with a different type. 
Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes, different types of resolution. 
But then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many, many directions. 
Here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before. 
When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before. 
And imagine each of them then controlled by people. 
You can have each pixel having an input that comes from people, from people's movement, or so and so. 
I want to show you something here for the first time. 
We've been working with Roberto Bolle, one of today's top ballet dancers -- the étoile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire. 
And here you can see Roberto dancing. 
You see on the left the pixels, the different resolutions being captured. 
It's both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture. 
So you can reconstruct a whole movement. 
You can go all the way through. 
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation. 
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for Flyfire. 
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on. 
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics. 
It's called The Cloud. 
And the idea here is, imagine, again, we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising, but with a cloud. 
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel. 
And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that, over the past couple of decades, we went from the physical world to the digital one. 
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge, and making that accessible through the Internet. 
Now today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world, from the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical one. 
This can be, in our case, we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol. 
That means something built in a city. 
But tomorrow it can be, in order to tackle today's pressing challenges -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one. 
So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together, collectively. 
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels, in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles. 
And those particles are water, where our cloud is a cloud of pixels. 
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels. 
You can move inside, have different types of experiences. 
You can actually see from underneath, sharing the main moments for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond, and really using it as a way to connect with the community. 
So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top [of], like London's new mountaintop. 
You can enter inside it. 
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night -- but most importantly, a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So as a fashion designer, I've always tended to think of materials something like this, or this, or maybe this. 
But then I met a biologist, and now I think of materials like this -- green tea, sugar, a few microbes and a little time. 
I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe, which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms, which spin cellulose in a fermentation process. 
Over time, these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface. 
So we start by brewing the tea. 
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time, and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar. 
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath. 
We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C. 
And then we're ready to add the living organism. 
And along with that, some acetic acid. 
And once you get this process going, you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid. 
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth. 
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it. 
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside. 
So this is my mini fabric farm. 
After about three days, the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid. 
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing. 
And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid. 
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose. 
And they're sticking together, forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface. 
After about two to three weeks, we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness. 
So the bath on the left is after five days, and on the right, after 10. 
And this is a static culture. 
You don't have to do anything to it; you just literally watch it grow. 
It doesn't need light. 
And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold, soapy water. 
At this point, it's really heavy. 
It's over 90 percent water, so we need to let that evaporate. 
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet. 
Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air. 
And as it's drying, it's compressing, so what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really light-weight, transparent paper, or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather. 
And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally, or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape. 
And as it evaporates, it will knit itself together, forming seams. 
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea. 
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin, which intrigues me. 
Since it's organic, I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals. 
I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation. 
Using fruit and vegetable staining, create organic patterning. 
And using indigo, make it anti-microbial. 
And in fact, cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark. 
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose, it just takes one, and a really short one at that. 
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant. 
So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today, I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water. 
The dress would get really heavy, and eventually the seams would probably fall apart -- leaving me feeling rather naked. 
Possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear. 
What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need. 
So what I want to do is say to a future bug, "Spin me a thread. 
Align it in this direction. 
Make it hydrophobic. 
And while you're at it, just form it around this 3D shape." 
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing, and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels, possibly even replacement bone tissue. 
But with synthetic biology, we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire. 
Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting because then I start to think, wow, we could actually imagine growing consumable products. 
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency. 
So we only grow what we need. 
There's no waste. 
And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example, a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant. 
Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings. 
What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton, leather or other textile materials. 
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources. 
Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact. 
We could, for example, imagine growing a lamp, a chair, a car or maybe even a house. 
So I guess what my question to you is: in the future, what would you choose to grow? 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.) This is one of the jackets you grew? 
SL: Yes, it is. 
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes. 
(Laughter) It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it. 
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it. 
Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.) (Applause) 

The universe is really big. 
We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy. 
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. 
And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky, and you just keep the shutter open, as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope, it will see something like this. 
Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way -- a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs. 
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. 
100 billion is the only number you need to know. 
The age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang, is a hundred billion in dog years. 
(Laughter) Which tells you something about our place in the universe. 
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it. 
It's extremely beautiful. 
I've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn't have any. 
But we would also like to understand it. 
As a cosmologist, I want to ask, why is the universe like this? 
One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time. 
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity, it would be moving away from you. 
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away, it would be moving away faster. 
So we say the universe is expanding. 
What that means, of course, is that, in the past, things were closer together. 
In the past, the universe was more dense, and it was also hotter. 
If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up. 
That kind of makes sense to us. 
The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much is that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang, was also very, very smooth. 
You might think that that's not a surprise. 
The air in this room is very smooth. 
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out." 
But the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different than the conditions of the air in this room. 
In particular, things were a lot denser. 
The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the Big Bang. 
What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies, a hundred billion stars each. 
At early times, those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big -- literally -- at early times. 
And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections, without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else. 
Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole. 
Keeping the universe very, very smooth at early times is not easy; it's a delicate arrangement. 
It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly. 
There is something that made it that way. 
We would like to know what. 
So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann, an Austrian physicist in the 19th century. 
And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy. 
You've heard of entropy. 
It's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems. 
Boltzmann gave us a formula -- engraved on his tombstone now -- that really quantifies what entropy is. 
And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice, so that macroscopically it looks the same. 
If you have the air in this room, you don't notice each individual atom. 
A low entropy configuration is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way. 
A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way. 
This is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics -- the law that says that entropy increases in the universe, or in some isolated bit of the universe. 
The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy. 
That's a wonderful insight, but it leaves something out. 
This insight that entropy increases, by the way, is what's behind what we call the arrow of time, the difference between the past and the future. 
Every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing -- the fact that you can remember the past, but not the future. 
The fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die, always in that order, that's because entropy is increasing. 
Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy, it's very natural for it to increase because there's more ways to be high entropy. 
What he didn't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place. 
The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very, very smooth. 
We'd like to understand that. 
That's our job as cosmologists. 
Unfortunately, it's actually not a problem that we've been giving enough attention to. 
It's not one of the first things people would say, if you asked a modern cosmologist, "What are the problems we're trying to address?" 
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman. 
50 years ago, he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures. 
He gave the popular lectures that became "The Character of Physical Law." 
He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads that became "The Feynman Lectures on Physics." 
He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation." 
In every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures, he emphasized this puzzle: Why did the early universe have such a small entropy? 
So he says -- I'm not going to do the accent -- he says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time, had a very low entropy for its energy content, and since then the entropy has increased. 
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding." 
So that's our job. 
We want to know -- this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking, "we've figured it out by now." 
It's not true that we've figured it out by now. 
The reason the problem has gotten worse, rather than better, is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before. 
We learned that it's accelerating. 
The universe is not only expanding. 
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away. 
If you come back a billion years later and look at it again, it will be moving away faster. 
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating. 
Unlike the low entropy of the early universe, even though we don't know the answer for this, we at least have a good theory that can explain it, if that theory is right, and that's the theory of dark energy. 
It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy. 
In every little cubic centimeter of space, whether or not there's stuff, whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever, there's still energy, even in the space itself. 
And this energy, according to Einstein, exerts a push on the universe. 
It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other. 
Because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation, does not dilute away as the universe expands. 
The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same, even as the universe gets bigger and bigger. 
This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future. 
For one thing, the universe will expand forever. 
Back when I was your age, we didn't know what the universe was going to do. 
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future. 
Einstein was fond of this idea. 
But if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away, the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever. 
14 billion years in the past, 100 billion dog years, but an infinite number of years into the future. 
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes, space looks finite to us. 
Space may be finite or infinite, but because the universe is accelerating, there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see. 
There's a finite region of space that we have access to, surrounded by a horizon. 
So even though time goes on forever, space is limited to us. 
Finally, empty space has a temperature. 
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole, even though you think it's black, it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics. 
The curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation, and the black hole radiates. 
A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space, then the whole universe radiates. 
The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations. 
And so even though the universe will last forever, and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away, there will always be some radiation, some thermal fluctuations, even in empty space. 
So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever. 
Well what is the implication of that? 
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century. 
He said, well, entropy increases because there are many, many more ways for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy. 
But that's a probabilistic statement. 
It will probably increase, and the probability is enormously huge. 
It's not something you have to worry about -- the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us. 
It's very, very unlikely. 
Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever, that would happen. 
Everything that is allowed, every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room, would eventually be obtained. 
So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium. 
He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe. 
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton -- they were absolute; they just stuck there forever. 
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere -- the everything molecules. 
But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough, the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations. 
And then, of course, in the natural course of things, they will expand back. 
So it's not that entropy must always increase -- you can get fluctuations into lower entropy, more organized situations. 
Well if that's true, Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas -- the multiverse and the anthropic principle. 
He says, the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can't live there. 
Remember, life itself depends on the arrow of time. 
We would not be able to process information, metabolize, walk and talk, if we lived in thermal equilibrium. 
So if you imagine a very, very big universe, an infinitely big universe, with randomly bumping into each other particles, there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states, and then they relax back. 
But there will also be large fluctuations. 
Occasionally, you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies. 
So Boltzmann says, we will only live in the part of the multiverse, in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles, where life is possible. 
That's the region where entropy is low. 
Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. 
Now your homework assignment is to really think about this, to contemplate what it means. 
Carl Sagan once famously said that "in order to make an apple pie, you must first invent the universe." 
But he was not right. 
In Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie, you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie. 
That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven, and then making you an apple pie. 
So this scenario makes predictions. 
And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal. 
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are, and we have, not only our memories, but our impression that outside there's something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy, it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy. 
The good news is that, therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right. 
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation. 
Even if you left our galaxy out, you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies. 
And Feynman also understood this. 
Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation, all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before, we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at -- high entropy. 
If our order were due to a fluctuation, we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it. 
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation." 
So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer? 
If the universe is not a fluctuation, why did the early universe have a low entropy? 
And I would love to tell you the answer, but I'm running out of time. 
(Laughter) Here is the universe that we tell you about, versus the universe that really exists. 
I just showed you this picture. 
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so. 
It's cooling off. 
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more. 
If the dark energy remains around, the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel, they will stop burning. 
They will fall into black holes. 
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes. 
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years -- a lot longer than our little universe has lived. 
The future is much longer than the past. 
But even black holes don't last forever. 
They will evaporate, and we will be left with nothing but empty space. 
That empty space lasts essentially forever. 
However, you notice, since empty space gives off radiation, there's actually thermal fluctuations, and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space. 
So even though the universe lasts forever, there's only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe. 
They all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years. 
So here's two questions for you. 
Number one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years, why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it, in the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang? 
Why aren't we in empty space? 
You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living," but that's not right. 
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness. 
Why aren't you? 
More homework assignment for you. 
So like I said, I don't actually know the answer. 
I'm going to give you my favorite scenario. 
Either it's just like that. There is no explanation. 
This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions. 
Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. 
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration, and yet, when we open our refrigerator, we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator." 
That's because an egg is not a closed system; it comes out of a chicken. 
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. 
Maybe there is something that naturally, through the growth of the laws of physics, gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations. 
If that's true, it would happen more than once; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse. 
That's my favorite scenario. 
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation. 
My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history. 
And 50 years from now, all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities. 
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse. 
And even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations. 
This is a prediction. I might be wrong. 
But we've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like, why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years. 
It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I just want to say, over the last few years I've been -- had the opportunity to do this closing conference. 
And I've had some incredible warm-up acts. 
About eight years ago, Billy Graham opened for me. 
And I thought that there was -- (Laughter) I thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that. 
But I just wanted to say -- and I mean this without irony -- I think I can speak for everybody in the audience when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States. 
(Applause) OK, this is the title of my talk today. 
(Laughter) I just want to give you a quick overview. 
First of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct, and I mean everything with great affection. 
If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy, now is the time to check your Blackberry. 
(Laughter) Just to review, this is my TEDTalk. 
We're going to do some jokes, some gags, some little skits -- and then we're going to talk about the L1 point. 
(Laughter) So, one of the questions I ask myself is, was this the most distressing TED ever? 
Let's try and sum things up, shall we? 
Images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox: 21 percent of the conference. 
(Laughter) Mentions of polar bears drowning: four percent. 
Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu: 64 percent. 
(Laughter) And David Pogue singing show tunes. 
(Applause) Because this is the most distressing TED ever, I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag. 
And if the -- if the conference is anywhere near this distressing, then we're going to have a scream bag next year. 
(Laughter) It's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course. 
(Laughter) So you're going to be able to go like this. 
(Laughter) Bring it over here and open it up. Aaaah! 
(Laughter) Meanwhile, back at TED University, this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips. 
(Laughter) So Robert Wright -- I don't know, I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to, it might have been him. 
I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels. 
(Laughter) He was talking about morality. 
Economy class morality is, we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age. 
Business class morality is, don't bomb Japan -- they built my car. 
And first-class morality is, don't bomb Mexico -- they clean my house. 
(Laughter) Yes, it is politically incorrect. 
All right, now I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ... 
(Laughter) All right, now these are the wha -- I'd say, [mumble, mumble -- mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble] -- ahh! 
(Laughter) So I wanted to show you guys -- I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you -- as a completely natural user interface. 
(Laughter) And you can -- you can use really natural hand gestures to like, go like this. 
(Applause) Now we had a Harvard professor here -- she was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and -- and she was actually a professor from Harvard. 
And she was talking about seven-dimensional, inverted universes. 
With, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain. 
There's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain, which is too -- too -- absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about. 
(Laughter) Now -- (Laughter) one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for. 
And that's why I went out and I picked up a best-selling business book. 
You know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology. 
And it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren, and it's called "The Porpoise Driven Life." 
(Laughter) And Rick is as a pagan god, which I thought was kind of appropriate, in a certain way. 
And now we're going to have kind of a little more visualization about Rick Warren. 
OK. 
(Laughter) All right. 
Now, red is Rick Warren, and green is Daniel Dennett, OK? 
(Laughter) The scales here are religiosity from zero percent, or atheist, to 100 percent, Bible literally true. 
And then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale. 
(Laughter) 30,000, 300,000, three million, 30 million, 300 million. 
OK, now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out. 
(Laughter) And Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead. 
Yup, and his installed base is getting a little bigger. 
(Laughter) But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back. 
Let me turn the trails on, so you can see that a little bit better. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now, one of the things that's very important is, Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per -- I'm sorry -- (Laughter) about One Laptop Per Child. 
Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device. 
I'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters, and then I'll show it to you in person. 
First of all, it needs to be small. 
It needs to be flat, so it's transportable. 
Lightweight. Portable. 
Uses very, very little power. 
Very, very high resolution. 
Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere. 
And broadly applicable across many platforms. 
Now, we've actually done some research -- Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market. 
They did some research; we came back; and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for. 
And here it is, the $100 computer. 
(Laughter) OK, OK, OK, OK -- excellent, excellent. 
Now, I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks. 
And he and his team of junior-high school students were doing real science. 
So we're trying to check and trying to douse here, and see who uses marijuana. 
(Laughter) See who uses marijuana. 
Are we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young? 
Only if we open enough locker doors. 
(Laughter) OK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness. 
We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox. 
I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox. 
We start. This is day one. 
(Laughter) Day two. 
Day three, she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder. 
Day three. 
Day four. 
(Laughter) Day five and day six. 
(Laughter) Now the good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional, I know that even though she'll be scarred for life, she's going to make a full recovery. 
(Laughter) Now the good news about Architects for Humanity is they're really kind of the most amazing group. 
They've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions, clinic solutions, in Africa, and they've had a design competition. 
Now the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed the head of the Google Foundation, and so he decided that he would support -- he would support Cameron's work. 
And the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers of Google snacks. 
(Laughter) So I want to show you some prototypes. 
The U.N. -- you know, they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent, but I think we have some more exciting things. 
This is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate. 
And the really wonderful thing about this is, when you're done, well -- you can eat it. 
But the thing that I'm really, really excited about is this incredible granola house. 
(Laughter) And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof to collect water and recycle it. 
And it's -- well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids and Gummy Bears to let in the light. 
(Laughter) But on this side, it has sugary Gummy Bears, to diffuse the light more slightly. 
And we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, Einstein -- Einstein, tell me -- what's your favorite song? 
No, I said what's your favorite song? 
No, I said what's your favorite song? 
"Free Bird." 
(Laughter) (Applause) OK, so, Einstein, what's your favorite singing group? 
Could you say that again? What's your favorite singing group? 
OK, one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help. 
Your favorite singing group -- it's Diana Ross and the -- Audience: Supremes! 
Tom Reilly: Exactly. 
(Applause) Could we have the sound up on the laptop, please? 
(Laughter) "Free Bird" kind of reminds me that if you -- if you listen to "Free Bird" backwards, this is what you might hear. 
Computer: Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. 
Satan. Satan. Satan. 
TR: Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to -- (Laughter) so I wanted to help you a little bit. 
Computer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan. 
Buy "The Purpose-Driven Life," or Satan will take your soul. 
(Laughter) TR: So, we've talked a lot about global warming, but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice -- good weather in the wintertime, and New York City. 
And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough. 
So Al, I actually think I'm rather good at branding. 
So I've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace "global warming." 
So we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming. 
And then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch -- into "Het globale Verwarmen." 
From Dutch to [Korean], into "Hordahordaneecheewa." 
(Laughter) [Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global. 
Then Portuguese to Pig Latin. 
(Laughter) Aquecer-se ucked-fay. 
And then finally back into the English, which is, we're totally fucked. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now I don't know about you, but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings -- evolutionarily, they're designed to see patterns in things. 
For example, in cheese sandwiches. 
Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary? 
I tried to make it a little bit clearer. 
(Laughter) Is it the Virgin Mary? 
Or is it Mena Trott? 
So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center and the conferences. It's getting awfully big. 
It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit. 
So we tried to come up with a program -- how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED. 
So first of all we decided -- (Laughter) that we needed about one-third bookstore, one-third Google cafe, about 20 percent registration, 80 percent luxury hotel, about five percent for restrooms. 
And then of course, we wanted to have the simulcast lounge, the lobby and the Steinbeck forum. 
Now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program. 
So first, one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming and Greenland melts as you say, the ocean level is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center. 
So we're going to build this new building on stilts. 
So we build this building on stilts, then up here -- (Laughter) is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium. 
(Laughter) And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is, it's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System. 
(Laughter) Then we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there. 
And finally, we're going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top. 
(Applause) Now I don't know about you, but sometimes I have these images in my head of separated at birth. 
I don't know about you, but when I see Aubrey de Grey, I immediately go to Gandalf the Grey. 
(Laughter) OK. Now, we've heard, of course, that we're all soldiers here. 
So what I'd really, really like you to do now is, pick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper? 
And I want you to get out a pen, and I want you to write a terrorist note. 
(Laughter) If we put up the ELMO for a moment -- if we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know, I'll give you a model that you can work from, OK? 
(Laughter) And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane. 
And once you've folded it into a paper airplane, I want you to take some anthrax -- (Laughter) and I want you to put that in the paper airplane. 
And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young. 
(Laughter) Luckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year. 
And I wanted to see -- I want to dedicate this film to my father, Homer. 
OK. 
Now this film isn't really hard enough, so I wanted to make it a little bit harder. 
So I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi. 
(Laughter) 3.1415, 2657, 753, 8567, 24972 -- -- 85871, 25871, 3928, 5657, 2592, 5624. 
(Applause) Can we cue the music please? 
(Applause) Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit. 
Back in 1968, you can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain was covered in 151 inches of snow pack. 
Parenthetically, over there on the slopes, I did want to show you that black men ski. 
(Laughter) But over the years, 10 years later, the snow packs eroded, and, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow. 
The water level of the lake has started drying up. 
A few years later, there's no snow left at all. 
And all the trees have turned brown. 
This year, unfortunately the lakebed's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed. 
And I fear, if we do nothing for our planet, in 20 years, it's going to look like this. 
(Laughter) Mr. Vice President, I wish I knew how to quit you. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

It's great being here at TED. 
You know, I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head, but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. 
The little things in life, sometimes that we forget about, like pollination, that we take for granted. 
And you can't tell the story about pollinators -- bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years. 
I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years. 
To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of. 
It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart. 
Beauty and seduction, I believe, is nature's tool for survival, because we will protect what we fall in love with. 
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. 
It reminds us that we are a part of nature, and we're not separate from it. 
When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, it motivated me to take action. 
We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat. 
And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind. 
It's like the canary in the coalmine. 
If they disappear, so do we. 
It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. 
What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers: "What motivates the pollinators?" 
Well, their answer was, "It's all about risk and reward." 
Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?" 
And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive." 
I go, "Why?" 
"Well, in order to reproduce." 
"Well, why?" 
And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex." 
And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert, he replied, "Nothing lasts forever. 
Everything in the universe wears out." 
And that blew my mind. 
Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward, as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life. 
Rarely seen by the naked eye, this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment. 
It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself, over and over again. 
So here is some nectar from my film. 
I hope you'll drink, tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden. 
And always take time to smell the flowers, and let it fill you with beauty, and rediscover that sense of wonder. 
Here are some images from the film. 
(Music) (Applause) Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

My journey to become a polar specialist, photographing, specializing in the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. 
There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where [we] were one of three non-Inuit families. 
And in this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, radio. 
We didn't even have a telephone. 
All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. 
The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers. 
And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. 
And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. 
I'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only, some images, a cross-section of my work, to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever." 
I don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before, but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. 
National Geographic doesn't do this, so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. 
And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. 
It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear. 
It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear. 
There are only 200 of these bears left. 
They're more rare than the panda bear. 
I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. 
I thought, my career's over. 
I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. 
What in the heck was I thinking? 
So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me. 
Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses. 
(Laughter) And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. 
And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. 
He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. 
And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him, just in the forest, and photograph him. 
So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. 
Please enjoy.

The show's not over. 
My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop. 
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. 
We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. 
And in fact, scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years. 
Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic, the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years. 
And what does that mean? 
After a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news. 
You glaze over with it. 
And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. 
And I want people to understand and get the concept that, if we lose ice, we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. 
Projections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years. 
And there's no better, sexier, more beautiful, charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. 
Polar bears are amazing hunters. 
This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. 
There was no ice around. 
But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. 
And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb. bearded seal -- grabbed it, swam back and ate it. 
And he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal, that, as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture, his only defense was to keep eating more seal. 
And as he ate, he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth, he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. 
So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive, but it's the ice that's disappearing. 
We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. 
When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago, we never found dead bears. 
And in the last four or five years, we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. 
We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea, floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. 
I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. 
These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. 
Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere, and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice, which is great for them; they're safe at this point. 
They're not going to die of hypothermia. 
They're going to get to land. 
But unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. 
These ringed seals, these are the "fatsicles" of the Arctic. 
These little, fat dumplings, 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. 
And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. 
These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. 
They give birth inside the ice, and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. 
And here's a picture of sick ice. 
This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old. 
And what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts, these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. 
And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. 
The visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place. 
I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. 
But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice, that big chunk of ice up in the corner. 
In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms. 
And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. 
So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. 
It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. 
Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. 
Here's me in my office. 
I hope you appreciate yours. 
This is after an hour under the ice. 
I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet. 
And I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. 
After an hour in these conditions, it's so extreme that, when I go down, almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. 
And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. 
I get to hand my camera to my assistant, and I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, "Woo. Woo. Woo." 
Which means, "Take my camera." 
And he thinks I'm saying, "Take my picture." 
So we had this little communication breakdown. 
(Laughter) But it's worth it. 
I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales, and narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today, but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. 
I dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw, and I looked up under the underside of the ice, and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo. 
I got very nervous -- no rope, no safety line, the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought, "I'm in trouble." 
But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice, giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. 
This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here. 
And when you have low productivity in this, in ice, the productivity in copepods go down. 
This is a bowhead whale. 
Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. 
This very whale right here could be over 250 years old. 
This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. 
It could have survived 150 years of whaling. 
And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. 
Narwhals, these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water. 
But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe, catch a breath, because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. 
And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. 
Alright, my favorite part. 
When I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to remember one story more than any other. 
Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful, I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. 
Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation. 
They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. 
They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. 
They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. 
And tragically in [2003], a scientist was taken down and drowned, and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. 
And people were like, "We knew they were vicious. We knew they were." 
And so people love to form their opinions. 
And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica, get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood. 
So this is that story. 
Oh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. 
(Laughter) As a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute, therefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad. 
It doesn't work that way. 
The penguin doesn't know it's cute, and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. 
This is just the food chain unfolding. 
They're also big. 
They're not these little harbor seals. 
They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds. 
And they're also curiously aggressive. 
You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. 
The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. 
All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon. 
It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go. 
(Laughter) So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful -- after five days of crossing the Drake Passage, we have finally arrived at Antarctica. 
I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. 
His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran. 
And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. 
So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal. 
And even in his voice, he goes, "That's a bloody big seal, ya." 
(Laughter) And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth. 
And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one. 
And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin, came under the boat, the Zodiac, starting hitting the hull of the boat. 
And we're trying to not fall in the water. 
And we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me, "This is a good seal, ya. 
It's time for you to get in the water." 
(Laughter) And I looked at Goran, and I said to him, "Forget that." 
But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter "F." 
But he was right. 
He scolded me out, and said, "This is why we're here. 
And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. 
And now you've got to deliver. 
And you can't publish excuses." 
So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such, such dry mouth. 
And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. 
I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. 
I put my snorkel in my mouth, and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. 
And this was the first thing she did. 
She came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice. 
He said, "If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away." 
(Laughter) So that's all I had to work with at that point. 
But I just started to shoot these pictures. 
So she did this threat display for a few minutes, and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed. 
She went off, she got a penguin. 
She stopped about 10 feet away from me, and she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go. 
The penguin swims toward me, takes off. 
She grabs another one. She does this over and over. 
And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. 
Why else would she release these penguins at me? 
And after she did this four or five times, she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. 
You don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me like, "This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean." 
(Laughter) So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins, she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me, bobbing like this, and she'd let them go. 
This didn't work. 
I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater, just because it was so amazing. 
And so that didn't work. 
So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter) And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. 
This went on for four days. 
This just didn't happen a couple of times. 
And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones, so she brought me dead penguins. 
(Laughter) Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head, and I'm just sitting there shooting away. 
And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like, "Are you for real?" 
Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. 
Because in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding, so ... 
(Laughter) And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head. 
She was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around. 
She's trying to force-feed my camera, which is every photographer's dream. 
And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face. 
She would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve. 
But yet she didn't stop. 
She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. 
And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far, I got nervous because she came up to me, she rolled over on her back, and she did this deep, guttural jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok. 
And I thought, she's about to bite. 
She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. 
What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display. 
She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me. 
(Laughter) That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. 
I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals, and I never once had a scary encounter. 
They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with, and the same with polar bears. 
And just like the polar bears, these animals depend on an icy environment. 
I get emotional. Sorry. 
It's a story that lives deep in my heart, and I'm proud to share this with you. 
And I'm so passionate about it. 
Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go. 
We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thanks very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Thank you. 
I'm thrilled to be here. 
I'm going to talk about a new, old material that still continues to amaze us, and that might impact the way we think about material science, high technology -- and maybe, along the way, also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation. 
So that's kind of a bold statement. 
I'll tell you a little bit more. 
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true. 
It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature -- and is biodegradable with a clock, so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years. 
It's edible; it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response. 
It actually gets reintegrated in the body. 
And it's technological, so it can do things like microelectronics, and maybe photonics do. 
And the material looks something like this. 
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent. 
The components of this material are just water and protein. 
So this material is silk. 
So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk. 
So the question is, how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia? 
The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature. 
And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber. 
The silk worm does a remarkable thing: it uses these two ingredients, protein and water, that are in its gland, to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar. 
And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about, and that we're familiar with, for the textile industry, the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things. 
We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar. 
So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material. 
And this is an insight that came, about two decades ago, from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with, David Kaplan. 
And so we get this starting material. 
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block. 
And then we use this to do a variety of things -- like, for example, this film. 
And we take advantage of something that is very simple. 
The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do. 
They find their way to self-assemble. 
So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it, and you wait for the protein to self-assemble. 
And then you detach the protein and you get this film, as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates. 
But I mentioned that the film is also technological. 
And so what does that mean? 
It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology, like microelectronics and nanoscale technology. 
And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface, which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale. 
So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD. 
And we can store information that's film with water and protein. 
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk, which is right here, and the message is over there. 
And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically. 
And this requires a stable hand, so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people. 
So let me see. 
So as you see the film go in transparently through there, and then ... 
(Applause) And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that. 
So once you have these attributes of this material, then you can do a lot of things. 
It's actually not limited to films. 
And so the material can assume a lot of formats. 
And then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays, like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes. 
Or you can do beautiful things that, if the camera can capture, you can make. 
You can add a third dimensionality to the film. 
And if the angle is right, you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk. 
But you can do other things. 
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light, and so we've made optical fibers. 
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics. 
And you can think of different formats. 
So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle, we do microneedle arrays. 
What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that's made of silk -- just to give you a sense of size. 
You can do bigger things. 
You can do gears and nuts and bolts -- that you can buy at Whole Foods. 
And the gears work in water as well. 
So you think of alternative mechanical parts. 
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins, for example, or maybe an entire bone. 
And so you have here a little example of a small skull -- what we call mini Yorick. 
(Laughter) But you can do things like cups, for example, and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods. 
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap. 
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos. 
So there's versatility, as you see, in the material formats, that you can do with silk. 
But there are still some unique traits. 
I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real? 
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible. 
And you see here a picture of a tissue section. 
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible? 
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted. 
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats, in principle, can be implanted and disappear. 
And what you see there in that tissue section, in fact, is you see that reflector tape. 
So, much like you're seen at night by a car, then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue, you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk. 
And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue. 
And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing, but reintegration in the environment is important. 
So you have a clock, you have protein, and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- (Applause) unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday. 
It's edible, so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food. 
It doesn't taste good, so I'm going to need some help with that. 
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle. 
Silk, during its self-assembly process, acts like a cocoon for biological matter. 
And so if you change the recipe, and you add things when you pour -- so you add things to your liquid silk solution -- where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines, the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants. 
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive. 
So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same, while your bone is healing, for example. 
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge. 
So we've made a silk card with penicillin in it. 
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C, so 140 degrees Fahrenheit, for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin. 
And so that could be --- (Applause) that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels. (Laughter) And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it]. 
And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable. 
And so what you see there is the difference. 
In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade, and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water. 
And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it. 
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before. 
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you've seen. 
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread. 
We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do, whether you want to replace a vein or a bone, or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics, perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt, maybe carry your drugs in your pocket, deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert, the answer may be in a thread of silk. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero. 
I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy. 
But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true. 
So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton, which was a lot of fun, but didn't yield much result. 
When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers, I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science, to find a more useful truth. 
I started my journey in California, with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook, and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life. 
By measuring the students' smiles, researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage would be, (Laughter) how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being, and how inspiring she would be to others. 
In another yearbook, I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture. 
When I first saw his picture, I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar. 
(Laughter) But now I know it was all in his smile. 
Another aha! moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of Major League players. 
The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life. 
Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years, where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost 80 years. 
(Laughter) The good news is that we're actually born smiling. 
Using 3D ultrasound technology, we can now see that developing babies appear to smile, even in the womb. 
When they're born, babies continue to smile -- initially, mostly in their sleep. 
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice. 
Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans. 
In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea, Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions, found that even members of the Fore tribe, who were completely disconnected from Western culture, and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals, (Laughter) attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would. 
So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing, we smile often, and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction. 
How many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day? 
Raise your hand if you do. 
Oh, wow. 
Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five. 
In fact, those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children, who smile as many as 400 times per day. 
Have you ever wondered why being around children, who smile so frequently, makes you smile very often? 
A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles. 
You ask why? 
Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious, and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles. 
Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real, so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler. 
In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France, subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles. 
Without the pencil, subjects were excellent judges, but with the pencil in their mouth -- when they could not mimic the smile they saw -- their judgment was impaired. 
(Laughter) In addition to theorizing on evolution in "The Origin of Species," Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory. 
His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better, rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good. 
In his study, Darwin actually cited a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne, who sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles. 
Please, don't try this at home. 
(Laughter) In a related German study, researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles. 
The finding supported Darwin's theory, by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain, in a way that helps us feel better when we smile. 
Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-regarded pleasure inducer -- cannot match. 
British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate. 
(Laughter) Wait -- The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000 pounds sterling in cash. 
(Laughter) That's like 25 grand a smile. 
It's not bad. 
And think about it this way: 25,000 times 400 -- quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day. 
(Laughter) And unlike lots of chocolate, lots of smiling can actually make you healthier. 
Smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine, increase the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphins, and reduce overall blood pressure. 
And if that's not enough, smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others. 
A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you actually appear to be more competent. 
So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress or improve your marriage, or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost, or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages, or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile. 

My name is Amit. 
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it. 
And it took 18 months. 
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries. 
But I'm going to focus on the demo. 
There are a lot of stories about why we did this. 
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide, and it's access. 
And I grew up in India. 
I had a great education -- I'm not complaining -- but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks. 
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot. 
And while working at Google, I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together. 
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this. 
I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch. 
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com. 
You look around at all these museums here. 
You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA, the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh. 
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
Two ways of going in -- very simple. 
Click and, bang, you're in this museum. 
It doesn't matter where you are -- Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter. 
You move around, you have fun. 
You want to navigate around the museum? 
Open the plan up, and, in one click, jump. 
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor. 
Keep going. Have fun. 
Explore. 
(Applause) Thanks. I haven't come to the best part. 
(Laughter) So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met. 
I see this plus sign. 
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it. 
Now this is one of the images. 
So this is all of the meta-data information. 
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now. 
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology. 
So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels. 
And I get a lot of people asking me: "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?" 
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels. 
You can zoom around very simply. 
You see some fun stuff happening here. 
I love this guy; his expression is priceless. 
But then you really want to go deep. 
And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here. 
And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting." 
Went in, and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something. 
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, and actually found out that this is a game called squall, which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday. 
And apparently it was quite popular. 
I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it. 
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks. 
Now just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get. 
Here is where we were, and this is the painting. 
(Applause) The best is yet to come -- so in a second. 
So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA, again in New York. 
So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night." 
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details. 
But what if you want to see brush strokes? 
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece? 
You zoom in. You really go in. 
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks. 
This is "The Starry Night," I think, never seen like this before. 
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature. 
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time. 
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections. 
Any one of you, anybody -- doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter. 
You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images. 
Very simply, you go in -- and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom -- you can just zoom around. 
This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery. 
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. 
So I think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google. 
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums. 
I probably shouldn't say that. 
It really comes from these artists. 
And that's been my humbling experience in this. 
I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online. 
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is, "Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" 
And the answer is no. 
It's to supplement the experience. 
And that's it. Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend, Richard Feynman. 
I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence. 
And I'm going to tell you about the Richard Feynman that I knew. 
I'm sure there are people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew, and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman. 
He was a man of many, many parts. 
He was, of course, foremost, a very, very, very great scientist. 
He was an actor. You saw him act. 
I also had the good fortune to be in those lectures, up in the balcony. 
They were fantastic. 
He was a philosopher. 
He was a drum player. 
He was a teacher par excellence. 
Richard Feynman was also a showman, an enormous showman. 
He was full of macho, a kind of macho one-upmanship. 
He loved intellectual battle. 
He had a gargantuan ego. 
But the man had, somehow, a lot of room at the bottom. 
And what I mean by that is a lot of room, in my case -- I can't speak for anybody else, but in my case -- a lot of room for another big ego. 
Well, not as big as his, but fairly big. 
I always felt good with Dick Feynman. 
It was always fun to be with him. 
He always made me feel smart. 
How can somebody like that make you feel smart? 
He made me feel smart. He made me feel he was smart. 
He made me feel we were both smart, and the two of us could solve any problem whatever. 
And in fact, we did sometimes do physics together. 
We never published a paper together, but we did have a lot of fun. 
He loved to win, win these little macho games we would sometimes play. 
And he didn't only play them with me, but with all sorts of people. 
He would almost always win. 
But when he didn't win, when he lost, he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won. 
I remember once he told me a story about a joke the students played on him. 
I think it was for his birthday -- they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in Pasadena. 
It may still exist; I don't know. 
Celebrity sandwiches was their thing. 
You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich. 
You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich. 
The students went there in advance, and arranged that they'd all order Feynman sandwiches. 
One after another, they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches. 
Feynman loved this story. 
He told me this story, and he was really happy and laughing. 
When he finished the story, I said to him, "Dick, I wonder what would be the difference between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich." 
And without skipping a beat at all, he said, "Well, they'd be about the same. 
The only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham." 
"Ham" as in bad actor. 
(Laughter) Well, I happened to have been very quick that day, and I said, "Yeah, but a lot less baloney." 
(Laughter) (Applause) The truth of the matter is that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham, but absolutely no baloney. 
What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense -- phoniness, false sophistication, jargon. 
I remember sometime during the mid-'80s, Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco -- at some very rich guy's house -- up in San Francisco for dinner. 
And the last time the rich guy invited us, he also invited a couple of philosophers. 
These guys were philosophers of mind. 
Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness. 
And they were full of all kinds of jargon. 
I'm trying to remember the words -- "monism," "dualism," categories all over the place. 
I didn't know what those meant, neither did Dick or Sydney, for that matter. 
And what did we talk about? 
Well, what do you talk about when you talk about minds? 
There's one obvious thing to talk about: Can a machine become a mind? 
Can you build a machine that thinks like a human being that is conscious? 
We sat around and talked about this -- we of course never resolved it. 
But the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been science-ophizing. 
It's a scientific question, after all. 
And this was a very, very dangerous thing to do around Dick Feynman. 
(Laughter) Feynman let them have it -- both barrels, right between the eyes. 
It was brutal; it was funny -- ooh, it was funny. 
But it was really brutal. 
He really popped their balloon. 
But the amazing thing was -- Feynman had to leave a little early; he wasn't feeling too well, so he left a little bit early. 
And Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers. 
And the amazing thing is these guys were flying. 
They were so happy. 
They had met the great man; they had been instructed by the great man; they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud ... 
And it was something special. 
I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman, even when he did what he did. 
Dick -- he was my friend; I did call him Dick -- Dick and I had a little bit of a rapport. 
I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had. 
We liked each other; we liked the same kind of things. 
I also like the intellectual macho games. 
Sometimes I would win, mostly he would win, but we both enjoyed them. 
And Dick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality. 
I don't think he was right. 
I think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves. 
But he was convinced of this. 
And the man was incredibly curious. 
And he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection. 
And one day, we were walking. 
We were in France, in Les Houches. 
We were up in the mountains, 1976. 
And Feynman said to me, "Leonardo ..." 
The reason he called me "Leonardo" is because we were in Europe, and he was practicing his French. 
(Laughter) And he said, "Leonardo, were you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid?" 
I said, "Well, my real hero was my father. 
He was a working man, had a fifth-grade education. 
He was a master mechanic, and he taught me how to use tools. 
He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things. 
He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem. 
He didn't call it the hypotenuse, he called it the shortcut distance." 
And Feynman's eyes just opened up. 
He went off like a lightbulb. 
And he said that he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father. 
In fact, he had been convinced at one time that to be a good physicist, it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father. 
I apologize for the sexist conversation here, but this is the way it really happened. 
He said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary, a necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist. 
Being Dick, he, of course, wanted to check this. 
He wanted to go out and do an experiment. 
(Laughter) Well, he did. 
He went out and did an experiment. 
He asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists, "Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you?" 
They were all men, and to a man, every single one of them said, "My mother." 
(Laughter) There went that theory, down the trash can of history. 
(Laughter) But he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with his father as he had with his father. 
And for some time, he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well. 
I don't know. Maybe. Who knows? 
But let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist. 
Feynman's style -- no, "style" is not the right word. 
"Style" makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn, or the suit he was wearing. 
It's something much deeper than that, but I can't think of another word for it. 
Feynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest, most elementary solution to a problem that was possible. 
If it wasn't possible, you had to use something fancier. 
No doubt, part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could. 
But he also deeply believed, he truly believed, that if you couldn't explain something simply, you didn't understand it. 
In the 1950s, people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked. 
There was a theory. 
It was a complicated theory; I'll tell you what it was soon enough. 
It was a terribly complicated theory, full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth. 
And it sort of worked, but it didn't work very well. 
The only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very, very far apart. 
And unfortunately, the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other. 
Feynman decided, as a sort of amateur helium physicist, that he would try to figure it out. 
He had an idea, a very clear idea. 
He would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like. 
He would try to visualize it, guided by a small number of simple principles. 
The small number of simple principles were very, very simple. 
The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other, they repel. 
The implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero, it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other. 
The other fact is that in the ground state -- the lowest energy state of a quantum system -- the wave function is always very smooth; it has the minimum number of wiggles. 
So he sat down -- and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil -- and he tried to write down, and did write down, the simplest function that he could think of, which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between. 
He wrote down a simple thing -- so simple, in fact, that I suspect a really smart high-school student who didn't even have calculus could understand what he wrote down. 
The thing was, that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium, and then some. 
I've always wondered whether the professionals -- the real professional helium physicists -- were just a little bit embarrassed by this. 
They had their super-powerful technique, and they couldn't do as well. 
Incidentally, I'll tell you what that super-powerful technique was. 
It was the technique of Feynman diagrams. 
(Laughter) He did it again in 1968. 
In 1968, in my own university -- I wasn't there at the time -- they were exploring the structure of the proton. 
The proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles; this was more or less known. 
And the way to analyze it was, of course, Feynman diagrams. 
That's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for -- to understand particles. 
The experiments that were going on were very simple: you simply take the proton, and you hit it really sharply with an electron. 
This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for. 
The only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated. 
They're difficult integrals. 
If you could do all of them, you would have a very precise theory, but you couldn't -- they were just too complicated. 
People were trying to do them. 
You could do a one-loop diagram. Don't worry about one loop. 
One loop, two loops -- maybe you could do a three-loop diagram, but beyond that, you couldn't do anything. 
Just think of the proton as an assemblage, a swarm, of little particles." 
He called them "partons." 
He said, "Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast." 
Because they're moving real fast, relativity says the internal motions go very slow. 
The electron hits it suddenly -- it's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton. 
What do you see? 
They don't move, and because they don't move during the course of the experiment, you don't have to worry about how they're moving. 
You don't have to worry about the forces between them. 
You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons." 
This was the key to analyzing these experiments. 
Extremely effective. 
Somebody said the word "revolution" is a bad word. 
I suppose it is, so I won't say "revolution," but it certainly evolved very, very deeply our understanding of the proton, and of particles beyond that. 
Well, I had some more that I was going to tell you about my connection with Feynman, what he was like, but I see I have exactly half a minute. 
So I think I'll just finish up by saying: I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event. 
I think he would have said, "I don't need this." 
But ... 
How should we really honor Feynman? 
I think the answer is we should honor Feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can. 
(Applause) 

Think about your day for a second. 
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door, encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new. 
But I bet there's something you didn't think about today, something so close to home, you probably don't think about it very often at all. 
And that's that all those sensations, feelings, decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain. 
Now, the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh, amorphous. 
But the last 100 years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within. 
And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons. 
Now, unlike a human-designed computer, where there's a fairly small number of different parts, and we know how they work because we humans designed them, the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells, maybe tens of thousands. 
They come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules; they project and connect to different brain regions. 
They also change in different ways in different disease states. 
Let's make it concrete. 
There's a class of cells, a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors. 
It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia. 
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we're learning about. 
New ones are being discovered every day. 
As just a second example: these pyramidal cells, large cells, can span a significant fraction of the brain. 
They're excitatory. 
And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy. 
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device. 
They receive inputs from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs, which then, if they pass a certain threshold, will go to thousands of downstream partners. 
And this process, which takes just a millisecond or so, happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells, as long as you live and think and feel. 
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does? 
Ideally, we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies. 
If we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash, what they can initiate and sustain. 
If we could turn them off, then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for. 
And that's the story I'm going to tell you about today. 
And honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years, through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off, both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans. 
Now, before I tell you about the technology, the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room, if we live long enough, will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder. 
Already, a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them. 
The numbers don't do it justice, though. 
These disorders -- schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, depression, addiction -- they not only steal away our time to live, they change who we are. 
They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people. 
Now, in the 20th century, there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders. 
And while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders, practically none of them can be considered to be cured. 
In part, that's because, if you think about it, we're bathing the brain in a chemical -- this elaborate circuit, made of thousands of different kinds of cell -- is being bathed in a substance. 
That's also why most of the drugs, not all, on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too. 
Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain, for Parkinson's disease or cochlear implants. 
These have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorders. 
But electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance -- which is where that phrase, in part, comes from, and will also affect normal circuits, as well as the abnormal ones you want to fix. 
So again, we're sent back to the idea of ultraprecise control: Could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go? 
So, when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago -- I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist -- the first thing I thought about was, if these neurons are electrical devices, all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance. 
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors, that'd give us the tool to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded. 
It would also allow us to have the ultraprecise control we need to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry. 
Now, how are we going to do that? 
Well, there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity. 
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells. 
If we install these molecules in neurons somehow, then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light, and their neighbors, which don't have this molecule, would not. 
There's one other magic trick you need to make this happen: the ability to get light into the brain. 
The brain doesn't feel pain. 
Taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet, telecommunications, etc., you can put optical fibers connected to lasers to activate -- in animal models, for example, in preclinical studies -- these neurons and see what they do. 
So how do we do this? 
Around 2004, in collaboration with Georg Nagel and Karl Deisseroth, this vision came to fruition. 
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild, and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally. 
And it senses light with a little eyespot, which works not unlike how our eye works. 
In its membrane, or its boundary, it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity. 
These molecules are called channelrhodopsins. 
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about. 
When blue light hits it, it opens a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eyespot; that allows this eyespot to have an electrical signal, just like a solar cell charging a battery. 
So what we need to do is take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons. 
And because it's a protein, it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism. 
So all we've got to do is take that DNA, put it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus, and put it into neurons. 
And this was a very productive time in gene therapy, and lots of viruses were coming along, so this turned out to be fairly simple. 
Early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004, we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try. 
You take this DNA and put it into the neuron. 
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell, like putting solar panels on a roof. 
And the next thing you know, you have a neuron which can be activated with light. 
So this is very powerful. 
One of the tricks you have to do is figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells you want and not all the other neighbors. 
And you can do that; you can tweak the viruses so they hit some cells and not others. 
And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells. 
This field has now come to be known as "optogenetics." 
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do, you can take a complex network, use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network. 
And then when you shine light on the entire network, just that cell type will be activated. 
For example, let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier, the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory. 
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -- they won't be altered by the expression of the gene, of course -- then flash blue light over the entire brain network, just these cells are going to be driven. 
And when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal; there don't seem to be adverse events. 
Not only can you study what these cells do, what their power is in computing in the brain, you can also use this to try to figure out if we could jazz up the activity of these cells if indeed, they're atrophied. 
I want to tell you some short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels. 
One of the questions that we've confronted is: What signals in the brain mediate the sensation of reward? 
Because if you could find those, those would be some of the signals that could drive learning; the brain will do more of what got that reward. 
So if we could figure out what cells they are, we could maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have severe disability. 
To do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorillo group, where, if the animal goes to one side of this little box, it gets a pulse of light. 
And we'll make different cells in the brain sensitive to light. 
If these cells can mediate reward, the animal should go there more and more. 
And that's what happens. 
The animal goes to the right-hand side and pokes his nose there and gets a flash of blue light every time he does it. 
He'll do that hundreds of times. 
These are the dopamine neurons, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain. 
We've shown that a brief activation of these is enough to drive learning. 
Now we can generalize the idea. 
Instead of one point in the brain, we can devise devices that span the brain, that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns -- arrays of optical fibers, each coupled to its own independent miniature light source. 
Then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish, like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders. 
One story I want to tell you about is: How can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder, a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear? 
One of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear. 
This goes back to the Pavlovian days. 
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning, where a tone ends with a brief shock. 
The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying. 
And over time -- in this case, a mouse, which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone. 
It will react by freezing, sort of like a deer in the headlights. 
Now the question is: What targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear? 
So we play that tone again, after it's been associated with fear. 
But we activate different targets in the brain, using that optical fiber array I showed on the previous slide, in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear. 
This brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now. 
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex, a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states. 
The animal hears a tone. A flash of light occurs. 
There's no audio, but you see that the animal freezes -- the tone used to mean bad news. 
There's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner. 
You can see the animal is about two minutes into this. 
This next clip is just eight minutes later. 
And the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again. 
OK, there it goes. Right ... now. 
And now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment, that we've equipped the brain, by photoactivating this area, to overcome the expression of this fear memory. 
Over the last couple years, we've gone back to the tree of life, because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off. 
If we could do that, this could be extremely powerful. 
If you can delete cells for a few milliseconds or seconds, you can figure out what role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded. 
We surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life but animals; we see slightly differently. 
We found molecules called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins, that respond to green and yellow light. 
And they do the opposite of the molecule I told you about before, with the blue light activator, channelrhodopsin. 
Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go. 
Consider, for example, a condition like epilepsy, where the brain is overactive. 
Now, if drugs fail in epileptic treatment, one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain, but that's irreversible, and there could be side effects. 
What if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away, and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state, like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state? 
This animation tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light, and we beam light in, and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure, we're hoping to be able to turn it off. 
We don't have data to show you on this front, but we're very excited about this. 
I want to close on one story, which we think is another possibility, which is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultraprecise control, can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic. 
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted, maybe 100,000 people have cochlear implants, which allow them to hear. 
Another thing -- you've got to get these genes into cells. 
A new hope in gene therapy has been developed, because viruses like the adeno-associated virus -- which probably most of us around this room have; it doesn't have any symptoms -- have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body. 
And so far, there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus. 
There's one last elephant in the room: the proteins themselves, which come from algae, bacteria and funguses and all over the tree of life. 
Most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brains, so what will our brain do if we put that in? 
Will the cells tolerate it? Will the immune system react? 
It's early -- these haven't been done in humans yet -- but we're working on a variety of studies to examine this. 
So far, we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light. 
So it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it. 
I wanted to close with one story, which we think could potentially be a clinical application. 
Now, there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors -- light sensors in the back of our eye -- are gone. 
Let's zoom in on it so we can see it in more detail. 
The signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed via various computations until finally, the layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells, relay the information to the brain, where we see that as perception. 
In many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration, the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed. 
Now, how could you repair this? 
It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored, since there's nothing for the drug to bind to. 
On the other hand, light can still get into the eye. 
So what if we could take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras? 
And because there are so many of these cells in the eye, potentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras. 
This is some work that we're doing, led by one of our collaborators, Alan Horsager at USC, and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company, Eos Neuroscience, which is funded by the NIH. 
What you see here is a mouse trying to solve a six-arm maze. 
There's a bit of water to motivate the mouse to move or he'll just sit there. 
The goal of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port. 
Mice are smart, so this one solves the maze eventually, but he does a brute-force search. 
He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform. 
He's not using vision to do it. 
These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans. 
So we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach. 
So how can we solve this? 
We'll do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide. 
We'll take these blue light photo sensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light-sensitive. 
Light is converted to electricity on them. 
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule on a virus. 
And now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again. 
And to point out the power of this: these animals can get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives. 
So this preclinical study, I think, bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future. 
We're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology. 
We're developing tools and sharing them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world for them to study and try to treat different disorders. 
Our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them, we can take some of these intractable disorders I mentioned earlier, practically none of which are cured, and in the 21st century, make them history. 
(Applause) Juan Enriquez: So some of this stuff is a little dense. 
(Laughter) But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to target those specifically is a first step. 
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors, like an on-off switch. 
Ed Boyden: That's right. 
EB: Right. 
With blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one. 
And by turning things off, it's more or less a zero. 
Our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities. 
JE: And in theory, that means that, as a mouse feels, smells, hears, touches, you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros. 
EB: Yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain. 
JE: Does that mean that someday you could download memories and maybe upload them? 
EB: That's something we're starting to work on very hard. 
We're now working on trying to tile the brain with recording elements, too, so we can record information and then drive information back in -- sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing. 
JE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you. 
EB: Thank you. 

Hello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick. 
I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings. 
When I was growing up, I was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale. 
And I was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications I was seeing felt soulless and cold. 
And there on the smaller scale, the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument, was a materiality and a soulfulness. 
And this influenced me. 
The first building I built was 20 years ago. 
And since, in the last 20 years, I've developed a studio in London. 
Sorry, this was my mother, by the way, in her bead shop in London. 
I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that. 
I'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work, a few projects that we've worked on. 
This is a hospital building. 
This is a shop for a bag company. 
This is studios for artists. 
This is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball. 
And this is a window display. 
And this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London. 
And this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk. 
And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain. 
And just very quickly, something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again. 
Because the original Routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with, which had this open platform at the back -- in fact, I think all our Routemasters are here in California now actually. 
But they aren't in London. 
And so you're stuck on a bus. 
And if the bus is going to stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop, you're just a prisoner. 
But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform. 
So we've been working with Transport for London, and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years. 
And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work. 
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy. 
So it's got hybrid drive. 
And we've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics. 
I was going to show four main projects. 
And this is a project for a bridge. 
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open. 
And openings seemed -- everyone loves opening bridges, but it's quite a basic thing. 
I think we all kind of stand and watch. 
But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed -- I'm slightly squeamish -- but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball. 
And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee, and it had broken like this. 
And then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken. 
And so this is in Paddington in London. 
And it's a very boring bridge, as you can see. 
It's just steel and timber. 
But instead of what it is, our focus was on the way it worked. 
(Applause) So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other. 
(Applause) We actually had to halve its speed, because everyone was too scared when we first did it. 
So that's it speeded up. 
A project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station -- so a power station that uses organic waste material. 
In the news, the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time. 
And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power. 
But recently, any annual report of a power company doesn't have a power station on it. 
It has a child running through a field, or something like that. 
(Laughter) And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station, our condition was that we would work with them and that, whatever we did, we were not just going to decorate a normal power station. 
And instead, we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us. 
And so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements, and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on. 
That just taking a field and banging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work. 
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter, create one composition. 
And what we found -- this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain. 
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live. 
And there are 2,000 new homes being built next to this power station. 
So it felt this has a social dimension. 
It has a symbolic importance. 
And we should be proud of where our power is coming from, rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of. 
So we were looking at how we could make a power station, that, instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside, could be a place that pulls you in. 
And it has to be -- I'm trying to get my -- 250 feet high. 
So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in, and using the spare soil that's there on the site, we could make a power station that was silent as well. 
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference. 
And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost-effective way of making a structure to do this. 
The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station. 
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top. 
(Laughter) And it's a power park. 
So people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area, and use that height that we have to have for its function. 
In Shanghai, we were invited to build -- well we weren't invited; what am I talking about. 
We won the competition, and it was painful to get there. 
(Laughter) So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion. 
And an expo is a totally bonkers thing. 
There's 250 pavilions. 
It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened. 
So there are up to a million people there everyday. 
And 250 countries all competing. 
And the British government saying, "You need to be in the top five." 
And so that became the governmental goal -- is, how do you stand out in this chaos, which is an expo of stimulus? 
So our sense was we had to do one thing, and only one thing, instead of trying to have everything. 
And so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain. 
(Laughter) But the thing that was true, the expo was about the future of cities, and particularly the Victorians pioneered integrating nature into the cities. 
And the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain. 
And the world's first major botanical institution is in London, and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting 25 percent of all the world's plant species. 
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing. 
And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful, and I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like trees." 
And the same with flowers. 
I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like flowers." 
But we realized that seeds -- there's been this very serious project happening -- but that seeds -- at these major botanical gardens, seeds aren't on show. 
But you just have to go to a garden center, and they're in little paper packets. 
But this phenomenal project's been happening. 
So we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral. 
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things? 
And the film "Jurassic Park" actually really helped us. 
Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious, rather than looking like nuts. 
So the challenge was, how are we going to bring light and expose these things? 
We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content. 
So we were trying to think, how could we make a whole thing emanate. 
By the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations. 
So that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch. 
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue. 
(Video) Voice Over: The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop. 
Song: ♫ We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops ♫ ♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫ ♫ They're the Mop Tops ♫ Thomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea. 
So the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us, and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box, very simple box element, and make it a building that could move in the wind. 
So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows. 
And inside, the daylight -- each one is an optic and it brings light into the center. 
And by night, artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside. 
And to make the project affordable, we focused our energy. 
Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch, we focused it on this one element. 
And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else, and focus our energy on that. 
And so the rest of the site was a public space. 
And with a million people there a day, it just felt like offering some public space. 
We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini-me version of the seed cathedral, so that, even if you're partially-sighted, that it was kind of crunchy and soft, that piece of landscape that you see there. 
And then, you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur -- in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral, in effect, we've shaved it. 
And inside there's nothing; there's no famous actor's voice; there's no projections; there's no televisions; there's no color changing. 
There's just silence and a cool temperature. 
And if a cloud goes past, you can see a cloud on the tips where it's letting the light through. 
This is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings. 
(Laughter) A key thing was how people would interact. 
I mean, in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo. 
And I just wanted to show you. 
The British government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have. 
And there was a lot of terror. 
But there was an underlying support. 
And so there was a moment when suddenly -- actually, the next thing. 
This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment, who was our client, with the Chinese children, using the landscape. 
(Video) Children: One, two, three, go. 
(Laughter) TH: I'm sorry about my stupid voice there. 
(Laughter) So finally, texture is something. 
In the projects we've been working on, these slick buildings, where they might be a fancy shape, but the materiality feels the same, is something that we've been trying to research really, and explore alternatives. 
And the project that we're building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer. 
And it's in a piece of land that's this site. 
And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur said that, if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city, they would give them more gross floor area, buildable. 
So there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city. 
And the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower, and you squeeze a few trees around the edge, and you see cars parked. 
It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience, and the rest of it is just for postcards. 
The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this. 
So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom, we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer. 
And by linking these together, we could have 90 percent of the site as a rainforest, instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings. 
(Applause) So we're building these buildings. 
They're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective. 
They're just chopped at different heights. 
But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape, rather than engulf it. 
And that's my final slide. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) June Cohen: So thank you. Thank you, Thomas. You're a delight. 
Since we have an extra minute here, I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds, which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building. 
TH: These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure. 
So there were 66,000 of these. 
This optic was 22 feet long. 
And so the daylight was just coming -- it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed. 
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy. 
Because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway, but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it -- we had quite a time. 
There was one person in the contractors who was the right size -- and it wasn't a child -- who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building. 
JC: Thank you, Thomas. 
(Applause) 

I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist, so I put children to sleep for a living. 
(Laughter) And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free. 
(Laughter) But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto. 
And it's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning, that pain is a disease. 
Now most of the time, you think of pain as a symptom of a disease, and that's true most of the time. 
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation. 
But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists. 
It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease. 
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it, I want to show you how it feels for my patients. 
So imagine, if you will, that I'm stroking your arm with this feather, as I'm stroking my arm right now. 
Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this. 
Please keep your seat. 
(Laughter) A very different feeling. 
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain? 
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together. 
Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather, but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain. 
In fact, imagine something even worse. 
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather, and their brain [was] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch. 
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler, whom you see in the photograph. 
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman. 
She was 16 years old last year when I met her, and she aspired to be a professional dancer. 
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist. 
Now you would probably imagine, as she did, that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life. 
Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story. 
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story. 
This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain. 
You can see that the arm is discolored, purplish in color. 
It was cadaverically cold to the touch. 
The muscles were frozen, paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that. 
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands, to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow, almost all the way to her shoulder. 
But the worst part was, not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day. 
The worst part was that she had allodynia, the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch. 
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand, the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on -- caused excruciating, burning pain. 
How can the nervous system get this so wrong? 
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame? 
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. 
In your house, wires run in the wall, from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb. 
And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on. 
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off. 
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that. 
If you hit your thumb with a hammer, these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires, new nerves, take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt. 
But the situation, of course, in the human body is far more complicated than that. 
Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion, in fact, what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells. 
These cells, called glial cells, were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together, like the nerves. 
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences. 
These glial cells become activated. 
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins, which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves, and they start releasing their neurotransmitters, and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth, until what we have is a positive feedback loop. 
It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch, the toilet flushed three doors down, or your dishwasher went on, or your computer monitor turned off. 
That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain. 
And that's why pain becomes its own disease. 
The nervous system has plasticity. 
It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli. 
Well, what do we do about that? 
What can we do in a case like Chandler's? 
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time. 
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are, frankly, not very effective for this kind of pain. 
We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet, and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics. 
And most importantly, what we do is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life. 
And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency, despair and depression that always accompanies severe, chronic pain. 
It's successful, as you can see from this video of Chandler, who, two months after we first met her, is now doings a back flip. 
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here, and she's doing absolutely fantastic. 
But the future is actually even brighter. 
The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem, as we have now, but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells, or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate, that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up, or plasticity, that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain. 
So I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized, who said, "My philosophy: No pain, no pain." 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

A lot of people call me a "justice architect." 
But I don't design prisons. 
I don't design jails. 
I don't design detention centers, and I don't even design courthouses. 
All the same, I get a call every week, saying, "OK, but you design better prisons, right? 
You know, like those pretty ones they're building in Europe." 
And I always pause. 
And I invite them, and I invite you today, to imagine a world without prisons. 
What does that justice feel and look like? 
What do we need to build to get there? 
I'd like to show you some ideas today of things that we're building. 
And I'm going to start with an early prototype. 
This I built when I was five. 
I call it "the healing hut." 
And I built it after I got sent home from school for punching this kid in the face because he called me the N-word. 
OK, he deserved it. 
It happened a lot, though, because my family had desegregated a white community in rural Virginia. 
And I was really scared. 
I was afraid. 
I was angry. 
And so I would run into the forest, and I would build these little huts. 
They were made out of twigs and leaves and blankets I had taken from my mom. 
And as the light would stream into my refuge, I would feel at peace. 
Despite my efforts to comfort myself, I still left my community as soon as I could, and I went to architecture school and then into a professional career designing shopping centers, homes for the wealthy and office buildings, until I stepped into a prison for the first time. 
It was the Chester State Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania. 
And my friend, she invited me there to work with some of her incarcerated students and teach them about the positive power of design. 
The irony is so obvious, right? 
As I approached this concrete building, these tiny little windows, barbed wire, high walls, observation towers, and on the inside, these cold, hard spaces, little light or air, the guards are screaming, the doors are clanking, there's a wall of cells filled with so many black and brown bodies. 
And I realized that what I was seeing was the end result of our racist policies that had caused mass incarceration. 
But as an architect, what I was seeing was how a prison is the worst building type we could have created to address the harm that we're doing to one another. 
I thought, "Well, could I design an alternative to this, other than building a prettier prison?" 
It didn't feel good to me; it still doesn't feel good. 
But back then, I just didn't know what to do. 
What do we build instead of this? 
And then I heard about restorative justice. 
I felt at peace again, because here was an alternative system that says when a crime is committed, it is a breach of relationship, that the needs of those who have been harmed must be addressed first; that those who have committed the offense have an obligation to make amends. 
And what they are are really intense dialogues, where all stakeholders come together to find a way to repair the breach. 
Early data shows that restorative justice builds empathy; that it reduces violent reoffending by up to 75 percent; that it eases PTSD in survivors of the most severe violence. 
And because of these reasons, we see prosecutors and judges and district attorneys starting to divert cases out of court and into restorative justice so that some people never touch the system altogether. 
And so I thought, "Well, damn -- why aren't we designing for this system?" 
(Applause) Instead of building prisons, we should be building spaces to amplify restorative justice. 
And so I started in schools, because suspensions and expulsions have been fueling the pathway to prison for decades. 
And many school districts -- probably some of your own -- are turning to restorative justice as an alternative. 
So, my first project -- I just turned this dirty little storage room into a peacemaking room for a program in a high school in my hometown of Oakland. 
And after we were done, the director said that the circles she was holding in this space were more powerful in bringing the community together after fighting at school and gun violence in the community, and that students and teachers started to come here just because they saw it as a space of refuge. 
So what was happening is that the space was amplifying the effects of the process. 
OK, then I did something that architects always do, y'all. 
I was like, I'm going to build something massive now, right? 
I'm going to build the world's first restorative justice center all by myself. 
And it's going to be a beautiful figure on the skyline, like a beacon in the night. 
Thousands of people will come here instead of going to court. 
I will single-handedly end mass incarceration and win lots of design awards. 
(Laughter) And then I checked myself -- (Laughter) because here's the deal: we are incarcerating more of our citizens per capita than any country in the world. 
And the fastest-growing population there are black women. 
Ninety-five percent of all these folks are coming home. 
And most of them are survivors of severe sexual, physical and emotional abuse. 
They have literally been on both sides of the harm. 
So I thought, uh, maybe I should ask them what we should build instead of prisons. 
So I returned with a restorative justice expert, and we started to run the country's first design studios with incarcerated men and women around the intersection of restorative justice and design. 
And it was transformative for me. 
I saw all these people behind walls in a totally different way. 
These were souls deeply committed to their personal transformation and being accountable. 
They were creative, they were visionary. 
Danny is one of those souls. 
He's been incarcerated at San Quentin for 27 years for taking a life at the age of 21. 
From the very beginning, he's been focused on being accountable for that act and doing his best to make amends from behind bars. 
He brought that work into a design for a community center for reconciliation and wellness. 
It was a beautiful design, right? 
So it's this green campus filled with these circular structures for victim and offender dialogue. 
And when he presented the project to me, he started crying. 
He said, "After being in the brutality of San Quentin for so long, we don't think reconciliation will happen. 
This design is for a place that fulfills the promise of restorative justice. 
And it feels closer now." 
I know for a fact that just the visualization of spaces for restorative justice and healing are transformative. 
I've seen it in our workshops over and over again. 
But I think we know that just visualizing these spaces is not enough. 
We have to build them. 
And so I started to look for justice innovators. 
They are not easy to find. 
But I found one. 
I found the Center for Court Innovation. 
They were bringing Native American peacemaking practices into a non-Native community for the very first time in the United States. 
And I approached them, and I said, "OK, well, as you set up your process, could I work with the community to design a peacemaking center?" 
And they said yes. 
Thank God, because I had no backup to these guys. 
And so, in the Near Westside of Syracuse, New York, we started to run design workshops with the community to both locate and reenvision an old drug house to be a peacemaking center. 
The Near Westside Peacemaking Project is complete. 
And they are already running over 80 circles a year, with a very interesting outcome, and that it is the space itself that's convincing people to engage in peacemaking for the very first time in their lives. 
Isabel and her daughter are some of those community members. 
And they had been referred to peacemaking to heal their relationship after a history of family abuse, sexual abuse and other issues that they'd been having in their own family and the community. 
And, you know, Isabel didn't want to do peacemaking. 
She was like, "This is just like going to court. 
What is this peacemaking stuff?" 
But when she showed up, she was stressed, she was anxious. 
But when she got in, she kind of looked around, and she settled in. 
And she turned to the coordinator and said, "I feel comfortable here -- at ease. 
It's homey." 
Isabel and her daughter made a decision that day to engage and complete the peacemaking process. 
And today, their relationship is transformed; they're doing really well and they're healing. 
So after this project, I didn't go into a thing where I'm going to make a huge peacemaking center. 
I did want to have peacemaking centers in every community. 
But then a new idea emerged. 
I was doing a workshop in Santa Rita Jail in California, and one of our incarcerated designers, Doug, said, "Yeah, you know, repairing the harm, getting back on my feet, healing -- really important. 
But the reality is, Deanna, when I get home, I don't have anywhere to go. 
I have no job -- who's going to hire me? 
I'm just going to end up back here." 
And you know what, he's right, because 60 to 75 percent of those returning to their communities will be unemployed a year after their release. 
We also know, if you can't meet your basic economic needs, you're going to commit crime -- any of us would do that. 
So instead of building prisons, what we could build are spaces for job training and entrepreneurship. 
These are spaces for what we call "restorative economics." 
Located in East Oakland, California, "Restore Oakland" will be the country’s first center for restorative justice and restorative economics. 
(Applause) So here's what we're going to do. 
We're going to gut this building and turn it into three things. 
First, a restaurant called "Colors," that will break the racial divide in the restaurant industry by training low-wage restaurant workers to get living-wage jobs in fine dining. 
It does not matter if you have a criminal record or not. 
On the second floor, we have bright, open, airy spaces to support a constellation of activist organizations to amplify their cry of "Healthcare Not Handcuffs," and "Housing as a human right." 
And third, the county's first dedicated space for restorative justice, filled with nature, color, texture and spaces of refuge to support the dialogues here. 
This project breaks ground in just two months. 
And we have plans to replicate it in Washington D.C., Detroit, New York and New Orleans. 
(Applause) So you've seen two things we can build instead of prisons. 
And look, the price point is better. 
For one jail, we can build 30 restorative justice centers. 
(Applause) That is a better use of your tax dollars. 
So I want to build all of these. 
But building buildings is a really heavy lift. 
It takes time. 
And what was happening in the communities that I was serving is we were losing people every week to gun violence and mass incarceration. 
We needed to serve more people and faster and keep them out of the system. 
And a new idea emerged from the community, one that was a lot lighter on its feet. 
Instead of building prisons, we could build villages on wheels. 
It's called the Pop-Up Resource Village, and it brings an entire constellation of resources to isolated communities in the greater San Francisco area, including mobile medical, social services and pop-up shops. 
And so what we're doing now is we're building this whole village with the community, starting with transforming municipal buses into classrooms on wheels that bring GED and high school education across turf lines. 
(Applause) We will serve thousands of more students with this. 
We're creating mobile spaces of refuge for women released from jail in the middle of the night, at their most vulnerable. 
Next summer, the village will launch, and it pops up every single week, expanding to more and more communities as it goes. 
So look out for it. 
(Applause) So what do we build instead of prisons? 
We've looked at three things: peacemaking centers, centers for restorative justice and restorative economics and pop-up villages. 
But I'm telling you, I have a list a mile long. 
This is customized housing for youth transitioning out of foster care. 
These are reentry centers for women to reunite with their children. 
These are spaces for survivors of violence. 
These are spaces that address the root causes of mass incarceration. 
And not a single one of them is a jail or a prison. 
Activist, philosopher, writer Cornel West says that "Justice is what love looks like in public." 
So with this in mind, I ask you one more time to imagine a world without prisons, and join me in creating all the things that we could build instead. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world. 
And it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel, but it's to a place where it's defined by light. 
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light. 
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence. 
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs. 
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution. 
But mostly I'm entranced by it. 
Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible, when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays, I've been a bioluminescence junky. 
But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words, and they were totally inadequate to the task. 
I needed some way to share the experience directly. 
And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called Deep Rover. 
This next video clip, you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence. 
And the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across. 
(Video) Narrator: In front of the sub, a mess screen will come into contact with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea. 
With the sub's lights switched off, it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh. 
This is the first time it has ever been recorded. 
Edith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye. 
Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible. 
But just to try to prove that fact to you, I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration. 
(Laughter) So, if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible, I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it. 
And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now, either because they're dead -- (Laughter) or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like. 
(Gasps) Oops. Sorry. 
(Laughter) I spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that. 
Okay. 
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate, a single-celled alga. 
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light? 
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators. 
The flash is like a scream for help. 
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm, and just like the alarm on your car or your house, it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder, thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away. 
There's a lot of animals that use this trick, for example this black dragonfish. 
It's got a light organ under its eye. 
It's got a chin barbel. 
It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute. 
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime, because the top speed of this fish is one knot, which was the top speed of the submersible. 
But it was worth it, because we caught it in a special capture device, brought it up into the lab on the ship, and then everything on this fish lights up. 
It's unbelievable. 
The light organs under the eyes are flashing. 
That chin barbel is flashing. 
It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing, fin lights. 
It's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention. 
It's phenomenal. 
And you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets. 
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light. 
For example, this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud. 
This blinds or distracts the predator. 
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this. 
Now it may look like a tasty morsel, or a pig's head with wings -- (Laughter) but if it's attacked, it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes. 
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing. 
It's phenomenal. 
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light. 
And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why. 
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates, for defending against predators. 
But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean, that's where things get really strange. 
And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar," but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them. 
They're things like this. 
This is a golden coral, a bush. 
It grows very slowly. 
In fact, it's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old, which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed. 
The other reason is this amazing bush glows. 
So if you brush up against it, any place you brushed against it, you get this twinkling blue-green light that's just breathtaking. 
And you see things like this. 
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing. 
And these are flytrap anemones. 
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles. 
But if you keep poking it, it starts to produce light. 
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy. 
It produces these strings of light, presumably as some form of defense. 
There are starfish that can make light. 
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms. 
This looks like a plant, but it's actually an animal. 
And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock. 
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents, as you see here. 
But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock, it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume, changing color as it goes, from green to blue. 
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure. 
(Laughter) But we have no idea why it does that. 
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen. 
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride. 
It's a green saber of light. 
And like the one you just saw, it can produce these as bands of light. 
So if I squeeze the base, the bands go from base to tip. 
If I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base. 
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle? 
(Gasps) I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about. 
(Laughter) So there's a language of light in the deep ocean, and we're just beginning to understand it, and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays. 
This is an optical lure that I've used. 
We call it the electronic jellyfish. 
It's just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays. 
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals, so it's unobtrusive. 
So I just want to show you some of the responses we've elicited from animals in the deep sea. 
So the camera's black and white. 
It's not high-resolution. 
And what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean -- there are isopods all over it. 
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish. 
And when it starts flashing, it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast. 
But as soon as it starts to flash -- and it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera -- I want you to look right here. 
There's something small there that responds. 
We're talking to something. 
It looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact, three strings of pearls. 
And this was very consistent. 
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet. 
We basically have a chat room going on here, because once it gets started, everybody's talking. 
And I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water. 
But the cool thing is, we're talking to it. 
We don't know what we're saying. 
Personally, I think it's something sexy. 
(Laughter) And then finally, I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam, which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year. 
We've only just begun to analyze all of this data. 
This is going to be a glowing source first, which is like bioluminescent bacteria. 
And it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean. 
So this scavenger comes in, which is a giant sixgill shark. 
And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there. 
But if it had been following the odor plume, it would have come in from the other direction. 
And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish. 
That's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark. 
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam, and it's going to be this pinwheel display. 
And this is a burglar alarm. 
And that was a Humboldt squid, a juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long. 
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon. 
But if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly. 
It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish. 
But we did see a bunch of responses like this. 
This guy is a little more contemplative. 
"Hey, wait a minute. 
There's supposed to be something else there." 
He's thinking about it. 
But he's persistent. 
He keeps coming back. 
And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more, and thinks, "Maybe if I come in from a different angle." 
(Laughter) Nope. 
So we are starting to get a handle on this, but only just the beginnings. 
We need more eyes on the process. 
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible, by all means, climb in and take the plunge. 
This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list, because we live on an ocean planet. 
More than 90 percent, 99 percent, of the living space on our planet is ocean. 
It's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures, alien life forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see. 
But if you do take the plunge, please remember to turn out the lights. 
But I warn you, it's addictive. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Thomas Dolby: For pure pleasure please welcome the lovely, the delectable, and the bilingual Rachelle Garniez.

I'm used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective, intelligent, intellectual, savvy, worldly and innovative people in the world. 
And I think that's true. 
However, I also have reason to believe that many, if not most, of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly. 
(Laughter) Now I know that seems ludicrous. 
I know that seems ludicrous. 
And believe me, I lived the same sad life until about three years ago. 
And what happened to me was I bought, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes. 
But those shoes came with round nylon laces, and I couldn't keep them tied. 
So I went back to the store and said to the owner, "I love the shoes, but I hate the laces." 
He took a look and said, "Oh, you're tying them wrong." 
Now up until that moment, I would have thought that, by age 50, one of the life skills that I had really nailed was tying my shoes. 
(Laughter) But not so -- let me demonstrate. 
This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes. 
Now as it turns out -- thank you. 
(Applause) Wait, there's more. 
As it turns out -- (Laughter) there's a strong form and a weak form of this knot, and we were taught the weak form. 
If you pull the strands at the base of the knot, you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe. 
That's the weak form of the knot. 
But not to worry. 
If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow, we get this, the strong form of the knot. 
And if you pull the cords under the knot, you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe. 
This is a stronger knot. 
It will come untied less often. 
It will let you down less, and not only that, it looks better. 
We're going to do this one more time. 
(Applause) Start as usual -- (Applause) go the other way around the loop. 
This is a little hard for children, but I think you can handle it. 
Pull the knot. 
There it is: the strong form of the shoe knot. 
Now, in keeping with today's theme, I'd like to point out -- something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else. 
(Laughter) Live long and prosper. 
(Applause) 

So I think data can actually make us more human. 
We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives, and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories. 
Recently, a wise media theorist Tweeted, "The 19th century culture was defined by the novel, the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema, and the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface." 
And I believe this is going to prove true. 
Our lives are being driven by data, and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories. 
So I'm going to show you a few of the projects that I've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems. 
This is a project called Flight Patterns. 
What you're looking at is airplane traffic over North America for a 24-hour period. 
As you see, everything starts to fade to black, and you see people going to sleep. 
Followed by that, you see on the West coast planes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast. 
And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast, followed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner. 
Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast. 
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner. 
I think it's one thing to say there's 140,000 planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time, and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows. 
This is a time-lapse image of that exact same data, but I've color-coded it by type, so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us. 
And I started making these, and I put them into Google Maps and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports and the patterns that are occurring there. 
So here we can see the white represents low altitudes, and the blue are higher altitudes. 
And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta. 
You can see this is a major shipping airport, and there's all kinds of activity there. 
You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer. 
See again, the diversity. 
And you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have. 
This is scrolling up the East coast. 
You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other. 
So zooming back out real quick, we see, again, the U.S. -- you get Florida down in the right-hand corner. 
Moving across to the West coast, you see San Francisco and Los Angeles -- big low-traffic zones across Nevada and Arizona. 
And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom. 
I started taking a look as well at different perimeters, because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data. 
This is looking at ascending versus descending flights. 
And you can see, over time, the ways the airports change. 
You see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen. 
And you can see, eventually the airport actually flips directions. 
So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT. 
This is visualizing international communications. 
So it's how New York communicates with other international cities. 
And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition. 
And it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset, so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through AT&amp;T's data and revealing itself. 
This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.org. 
And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam. 
So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city, until we approach New Year's Eve, where everybody says, "Happy New Year!" 
(Laughter) So this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city. 
This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day. 
So again, you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city. 
And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before, which happens right here. 
And then you can see people celebrating the next day. 
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases. 
So now on to something completely different. 
Some of you may recognize this. 
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine. 
And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well, except for one thing: it's not a robot at all. 
There's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player. 
This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon called the Mechanical Turk -- named after this guy. 
And it's based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people, but really difficult for computers. 
So they made this web service and said, "Any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people." 
The nerdy side of me thought, "Wow, this is amazing. 
I can tap into thousands of people's minds." 
And the other nerdy side of me thought, "This is horrible. This is completely bizarre. 
What does this mean for the future of mankind, where we're all plugged into this borg?" 
I was probably being a little extreme. 
But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on, and we're just doing these little labors? 
So I created this drawing tool. 
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left. 
And I said, "I'll pay you two cents for your contribution." 
And I started collecting sheep. 
And I collected a lot, a lot of different sheep. 
Lots of sheep. 
I took the first 10,000 sheep that I collected, and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep. 
You can't pick individual sheep, but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity. 
And juxtaposed against this grid, you see actually, by rolling over each individual one, the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. 
I think there's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil -- something we can all relate to, this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing. 
I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid. 
Kind of amazing what some people did. 
So here's a few statistics from the project. 
Approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour, which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour. 
There were 662 rejected sheep that didn't meet "sheep-like" criteria and were thrown out of the flock. 
(Laughter) The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes. 
That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication. 
And there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project, or were unique IP addresses -- so about how many people contributed. 
But only one of them out of the 7,599 said this. 
(Laughter) Which I was pretty surprised by. 
I expected people to be wondering, "Why did I draw a sheep?" 
And I think it's a pretty valid question. 
And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep. 
Sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts, the first to be selectively bred for production traits, the first animal to be cloned. 
Obviously, we think of sheep as followers. 
And there's this reference to "Le Petit Prince" where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep. 
He draws sheep after sheep. 
The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box. 
And he says, "It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep. 
It's about your own interpretation and doing something different." 
And I like that. 
So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times." 
It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the Industrial Revolution. 
So there were no longer shoe makers, but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes. 
And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot. 
So I thought this was an interesting clip to divide into 16 pieces and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool. 
This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame, and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they're doing. 
And this was the inspiration for a project that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima. 
We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for, which is making money. 
So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces, and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk. 
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw. 
But here there was no sheep-like criteria. 
People, if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face, it actually made it into the bill. 
So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do. 
So we took these hundred dollar bills, and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com, where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions. 
And you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project, which is now known as One Laptop Per Child. 
This is again showing all the different contributions. 
You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings, like this one on top -- spent a long time making realistic versions. 
And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces. 
Here on the right-hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?" 
That's all I'm getting paid for this? 
(Laughter) So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about is called Bicycle Built for 2000. 
This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey. 
You may recognize these two guys. 
This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '60s, where they created the song "Daisy Bell," which was the world's first singing computer. 
You may recognize it from "2001: A Space Odyssey." 
When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song, as a reference to when computers became human. 
So we resynthesized this song. 
This is what that sounded like. 
We broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing. 
Daisy Bell: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ... ♫ Aaron Koblin: And we took all of those individual pieces, and we fed them into another Turk request. 
This is what it would look like if you went to the site. 
You type in your code, but you first test your mic. 
You'd be fed a simple audio clip. 
(Honk) And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice. 
After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted, you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context. 
And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. 
Recording: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ♫ ♫ give me your answer do ♫ ♫ I'm half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ It can't be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ I can't afford a carriage ♫ ♫ But you'll look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ AK: So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds, that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual. 
We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative, distributed music making, where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on. 
So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together. 
I'm sorry for this. 
(Noise) Chorus: ♫ Daisy, Daisy ♫ ♫ Give me your answer do ♫ ♫ I'm half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ It can't be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ I can't afford a carriage ♫ ♫ But you'd look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ AK: So stepping back for a quick second, when I was at UCLA going to grad school, I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing. 
And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners. 
So basically motion through 3D space. 
And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost who said, "Wait a minute. 
You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video?" 
So we did exactly that. 
We made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead. 
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers, but we also open sourced it, and we made it released as a Google Code project, where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it. 
And people were making some amazing things. 
This is actually two of my favorites: the pin-board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke. 
A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content. 
More recently, somebody even 3D-printed Thom Yorke's head, which is a little creepy, but pretty cool. 
So with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on, I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something. 
And I met a music video director named Chris Milk. 
And we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project. 
But we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for. 
So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months. 
And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin, who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album called "Ain't No Grave." 
The lyrics to the leading track are "Ain't no grave can hold my body down." 
So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash. 
So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello, also known as Mr. doob, who's a much better programmer than I am, and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool. 
As you know, an animation is a series of images. 
So what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash, and at eight frames a second, we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video. 
So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you, but I want to show you two short clips. 
One is the beginning of the music video. 
And that's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly. 
(Music) (Video) Johnny Cash: ♫ There ain't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body down ♫ ♫ There ain't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold body down ♫ ♫ When I hear the trumpet sound ♫ ♫ I'm going to ride right out of the ground ♫ ♫ Ain't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body ... ♫ (Applause) AK: What better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs. 
Collaborator: I felt really sad when he died. 
And I just thought it'd be wonderful, it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory. 
Collaborator Two: It really allows this last recording of his to be a living, breathing memorial. 
Collaborator Three: For all of the frames to be drawn by fans, each individual frame, it's got a very powerful feeling to it. 
Collaborator Four: I've seen everybody from Japan, Venezuela, to the States, to Knoxville, Tennessee. 
Collaborator Five: As much as is different from frame to frame, it really is personal. 
Collaborator Six: Watching the video in my room, I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it. 
And I just worked and worked through problems, until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves. 
You can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing, and a lot of light and dark comes into it. 
And in a weird way, that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well. 
It's the sum total of his life, all the things that had happened -- the bad things, the good things. 
You're hearing a person's life. 
AK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com, what you'll see is the video playing above. 
And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project. 
So this isn't finished at all, but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate. 
If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails, you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located. 
And if you find one that you're interested in, you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you're able to rate that frame, which helps it bubble up to the top. 
And you can also see the way that it was drawn. 
Again, you can get the playback and personal contribution. 
In addition to that, it's listed, the artist's name, the location, how long they spent drawing it. 
And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged "Abstract." 
But there's a bunch of different styles. 
And you can sort the video a number of different ways. 
You can say, "I want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version. 
And then this is, again, the abstract version, which ends up getting a little bit crazy. 
So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk. 
And this is called "The Wilderness Downtown." 
It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire. 
Chris and I were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers, where you have HTML5 audio and video and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast. 
And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web beyond the four-by-three or sixteen-by-nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen. 
But most importantly, I think, we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project, where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone. 
What if we had a very low commitment, but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed? 
So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up. 
And you type in the address -- it actually creates a music video specifically for you, pulling in Google maps and Streetview images into the experience itself. 
So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address, but I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect. 
(Video) Win Butler: ♫ Now our lives are changing fast ♫ ♫ Now our lives are changing fast ♫ ♫ Hope that something pure can last ♫ ♫ Hope that something pure can last ♫ ♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ Ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ Sometimes it never came ♫ ♫ Sometimes it never came ♫ ♫ Still moving through the pain ♫ ♫ We used to wait for it ♫ ♫ We used to wait for it ♫ ♫ We used to wait for it ♫ AK: So I think, if there's one thing to take away from my talk today, it's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device. 
And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data, we have an opportunity, and maybe even an obligation, to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together. 
Thanks a lot. 
(Applause) 

I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea. 
Actually, it's a really big idea. 
But to get us started, I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world. 
Now I bet, in this audience, you're thinking of some really incredible technology, some stuff that I haven't even heard of, I'm absolutely sure. 
But I'm also sure, pretty sure, that absolutely nobody is thinking of this. 
This is a polio vaccine. 
And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted. 
This is a great technology. 
We can take it completely for granted. 
But it wasn't always that way. 
Even here in California, if we were to go back just a few years, it was a very different story. 
People were terrified of this disease. 
They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic. 
And it was because of scenes like this. 
In this scene, people are living in an iron lung. 
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before, and then two days later, they can no longer breathe, and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs, but also their breathing muscles. 
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually, in this iron lung to breathe for them. 
This disease was terrifying. 
There was no cure, and there was no vaccine. 
The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it. 
Twenty years later, they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine. 
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s. 
Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease, and here in the United States it had an incredible impact. 
As you can see, the virus stopped, and it stopped very, very fast. 
But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world. 
And it happened so fast in the United States, however, that even just last month Jon Stewart said this: (Video) Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active? 
Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated. 
Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated. 
But the reality is that polio still exists today. 
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists. 
This is the picture. 
There's not very much left in the world. 
But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership working behind the scenes, almost unknown, I'm sure to most of you here today. 
It's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease, and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic. 
But just last year, we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio. 
And this is the reason: in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade, on opposite sides of the globe, there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks. 
Hundreds of people were paralyzed. 
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults. 
And in both cases, we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses, and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries. 
They had come from thousands of miles away. 
And in one case, it originated on another continent. 
And not only that, but when they came into these countries, then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia, where, for the first time in over a decade last year, children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years. 
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you, these are under control now, and it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly. 
But the message was very clear. 
Polio is still a devastating, explosive disease. 
It's just happening in another part of the world. 
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. 
So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership, is trying to do. 
We're not trying to control polio. 
We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases, because this disease is like a root fire; it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely. 
So what we're looking for is a permanent solution. 
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys, can take for granted a polio-free world. 
So we're looking for a permanent solution, and this is where we get lucky. 
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary. 
This virus can only survive in people. 
It can't live for a very long time in people. 
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all. 
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you. 
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely. 
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth. 
Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this, to eradicating diseases. 
It's been tried six times in the last century, and it's been successful exactly once. 
And this is because disease eradication, it's still the venture capital of public health. 
The risks are massive, but the pay-off -- economic, humanitarian, motivational -- it's absolutely huge. 
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs. 
And if we can finish polio eradication, the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone. 
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after. 
But smallpox eradication was hard; it was very, very hard. 
And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher, and there's a few reasons for that. 
The first is that, when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago, more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox. 
And there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries. 
So it was a massive effort. 
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine, which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile. 
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat, and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it's not potent; it's not going to protect them. 
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine. 
But the third challenge we have -- and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge -- is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy -- every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash. 
So you could get around the disease; you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off. 
With polio it's almost completely different. 
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease. 
So you can't see the enemy most of the time, and as a result, we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox. 
We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history. 
There's over 10 million people, probably 20 million people, largely volunteers, who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime. 
These people, these 20 million people, vaccinate over 500 million children every single year, multiple times at the peak of our operation. 
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple. 
It's just two drops, like that. 
But reaching 500 million people is much, much tougher. 
And these vaccinators, these volunteers, they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest, densest urban slums in the world. 
They've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world. 
And they also have to dodge bullets, because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children, even in areas affected by conflict. 
One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago -- a place which has eradicated polio, not once, but twice, because they got reinfected. 
He was sitting outside of the road, watching one of these polio campaigns unfold, and a few months later he wrote: "This is foreign aid at its most heroic." 
And these heroes, they come from every walk of life, all sorts of backgrounds. 
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International. 
This is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years. 
They're right at the center of the whole thing. 
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years, much longer than it should have -- but once it was built, the results were striking. 
Within a couple of years, every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses, with the exception of four countries that you see here. 
And in each of those, it was only part of the country. 
And then, by 1999, one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept. 
And then today, there's been a 99 percent reduction -- greater than 99 percent reduction -- in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease. 
When we started, over 20 years ago, 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus. 
Last year, it was 1,000. 
And at the same time, the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas. 
It's been working to help control pandemic flu, SARS for example. 
It's also tried to save children by doing other things -- giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots, giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns. 
But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us, the international community, to reach every single child, every single community, the most vulnerable people in the world, with the most basic of health services, irrespective of geography, poverty, culture and even conflict. 
So things were looking very exciting, and then about five years ago, this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back. 
The first problem we ran into was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus, we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out. 
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades. 
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have. 
In conditions like this, the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to. 
Now at that time, there was a great, as you can imagine, frustration -- let's call it frustration -- it started to grow very, very quickly. 
And all of a sudden, some very important voices in the world of public health started to say, "Hang on. 
We should abandon this idea of eradication. 
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough." 
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds, it's a false premise. 
The brutal truth is, if we don't have the will or the skill, or even the money that we need to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world, with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine, then pretty soon, more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year. 
There's absolutely no question. 
These are children like Umar. 
Umar is seven years old, and he's from northern Nigeria. 
He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters. 
Umar also has polio. 
Umar was paralyzed for life. 
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004. 
This leg, his right leg, now takes an awful beating because he has to half-crawl, because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters, than to get up on his crutches and walk. 
But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid. 
As you probably can't see the detail here, but this is his report card, and you'll see, he's got perfect scores. 
He got 100 percent in all the important things, like nursery rhymes, for example there. 
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days, but it's not true. 
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances. 
The reality of polio today is something very different. 
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world. 
It leaves their children paralyzed, and it drags their families deeper into poverty, because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have, trying in vain to find a cure for their children. 
We think children deserve better. 
And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago, when people were saying, "We should call it off," the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions, new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again. 
In northern India, we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this, so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters, so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services. 
In northern Nigeria, the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders, they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence. 
And now they've even started using these devices -- speaking of cool technology -- these little devices, little GIS trackers like this, which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators. 
And then they can track them, and at the end of the day, they look and see, did these guys get every single street, every single house. 
This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing. 
And in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches -- access negotiators. 
We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child. 
But as we tried these extraordinary things, as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics, we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine, so that when they finally get to these kids, we can have a better bang for our buck. 
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry, and within six months, we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted, just two years ago, the last two types of polio in the world. 
Now June the ninth, 2009, we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine, and it turned out to be a game-changer. 
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had, and we immediately started using this. 
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production. 
And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world. 
And we didn't start with the easy places. 
The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan, because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this. 
Now here at TED, over the last couple of days, I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible. 
So this morning at about seven o'clock, I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again, so that you could see something that's just unfolding today, which proves that the impossible is possible. 
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible. 
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio. 
Over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- 500,000 children every single month. 
Sanitation is terrible, and our old vaccine, you remember, worked half as well as it should have. 
And yet, the impossible is happening. 
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history, not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. 
(Applause) India's not unique. 
In Umar's home country of Nigeria, a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year. 
And in the last six months, we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history. 
Ladies and gentlemen, with a combination of smart people, smart technology and smart investments, polio can now be eradicated anywhere. 
We have major challenges, you can imagine, to finish this job, but as you've also seen, it's doable, it has great secondary benefits, and polio eradication is a great buy. 
And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus, it's a stark reminder that we are failing, as a society, to reach children with the most basic of services. 
And for that reason, polio eradication: it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice. 
The huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children. 
It's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things. 
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm, capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago. 
Finishing polio is a smart thing to do, and it's the right thing to do. 
Now we're in tough times economically. 
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio, "There's never a wrong time to do the right thing." 
Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do. 
And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years. 
We have a new vaccine, we have new resolve, and we have new tactics. 
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history. 
But if we blink now, we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease. 
Here's a great idea to spread: End polio now. 
Help us tell the story. 
Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child, every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Bill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be? 
Where would you say we need to be the smartest? 
BA: The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped -- northern Nigeria, northern India, the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan -- they're going to be the toughest. 
But the interesting thing is, of those three, India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data. 
And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly. 
It keeps getting reinfected. 
So the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished. 
They're going to be the tough ones. 
BG: Now what about the money? 
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year. 
And is it easy to raise that money? 
And what's it going to be like the next couple of years? 
BA: It's interesting. 
We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year. 
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children. 
It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money. 
But when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times -- 20, 30 cents to reach a child -- that's not very much money. 
But right now we don't have enough of that. 
We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners, and every time we cut corners, more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down. 
And that great buy costs us a little bit more. 
BG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out, and the governments will keep their generosity up. 
So good luck. We're all in this with you. 
Thank you. (BA: Thank you.) (Applause) 

The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist, as an Iranian woman artist, as an Iranian woman artist living in exile. 
Well, it has its pluses and minuses. 
On the dark side, politics doesn't seem to escape people like me. 
Every Iranian artist, in one form or another, is political. 
Politics have defined our lives. 
If you're living in Iran, you're facing censorship, harassment, arrest, torture -- at times, execution. 
If you're living outside like me, you're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family. 
Therefore, we don't find the moral, emotional, psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility. 
Oddly enough, an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice, the speaker of my people, even if I have, indeed, no access to my own country. 
Also, people like myself, we're fighting two battles on different grounds. 
We're being critical of the West, the perception of the West about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us, about our women, about our politics, about our religion. 
We are there to take pride and insist on respect. 
And at the same time, we're fighting another battle. 
That is our regime, our government -- our atrocious government, [that] has done every crime in order to stay in power. 
Our artists are at risk. 
We are in a position of danger. 
We pose a threat to the order of the government. 
But ironically, this situation has empowered all of us, because we are considered, as artists, central to the cultural, political, social discourse in Iran. 
We are there to inspire, to provoke, to mobilize, to bring hope to our people. 
We are the reporters of our people, and are communicators to the outside world. 
Art is our weapon. 
Culture is a form of resistance. 
I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression. 
For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics. 
From the fact that they are only serving one audience, mainly the Western culture. 
But also, I worry about the West, because often in this country, in this Western world that we have, culture risks being a form of entertainment. 
Our people depend on our artists, and culture is beyond communication. 
My journey as an artist started from a very, very personal place. 
I did not start to make social commentary about my country. 
The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good 12 years. 
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. 
While I was absent from Iran, the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture. 
I came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that I found my place in the society. 
But instead, I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn't recognize anymore. 
More so, I became very interested, as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions, I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution -- how, indeed, it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women. 
I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting, in the way the women of Iran, historically, seemed to embody the political transformation. 
So in a way, by studying a woman, you can read the structure and the ideology of the country. 
So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life, and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom, the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God, faith, but violence and crime and cruelty. 
For me, this became incredibly important. 
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this. 
I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place, but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution. 
This changed slowly as I found my voice and I discovered things that I didn't know I would discover. 
So my art became slightly more critical. 
My knife became a little sharper. 
And I fell into a life in exile. 
I am a nomadic artist. 
I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico. 
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran. 
Now I am making films. 
Last year, I finished a film called "Women Without Men." 
"Women Without Men" returns to history, but another part of our Iranian history. 
It goes to 1953 when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader, Dr. Mossadegh. 
The book is written by an Iranian woman, Shahrnush Parsipur. 
It's a magical realist novel. 
This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison. 
My obsession with this book, and the reason I made this into a film, is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally, historically in Iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change, freedom and democracy -- while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character, also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions. 
I made this film because I felt it's important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country. 
That all of you seem to remember Iran after the Islamic Revolution. 
That Iran was once a secular society, and we had democracy, and this democracy was stolen from us by the American government, by the British government. 
This film also speaks to the Iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized -- in the way we looked, in the way we played music, in the way we had intellectual life. 
And most of all, in the way that we fought for democracy. 
These are some of the shots actually from my film. 
These are some of the images of the coup. 
And we made this film in Casablanca, recreating all the shots. 
This film tried to find a balance between telling a political story, but also a feminine story. 
Being a visual artist, indeed, I am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics, religion, the question of feminism, and become an important, timeless, universal work of art. 
The challenge I have is how to do that. 
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story. 
How to move you with your emotions, but also make your mind work. 
These are some of the images and the characters of the film. 
Now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009, as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran. 
What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film, the cry for democracy and social justice, repeats itself now again in Tehran. 
The green movement significantly inspired the world. 
It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy. 
What was most significant for me was, once again, the presence of the women. 
They're absolutely inspirational for me. 
If in the Islamic Revolution, the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn't have a voice, now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of Tehran -- women who were educated, forward thinking, non-traditional, sexually open, fearless and seriously feminist. 
These women and those young men united Iranians across the world, inside and outside. 
I then discovered why I take so much inspiration from Iranian women. 
That, under all circumstances, they have pushed the boundary. 
They have confronted the authority. 
They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way. 
And once again, they proved themselves. 
I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice, and their voice is giving me my voice. 
And it's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist, even if I have to operate in the West only for now. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

A few weeks ago, I had a chance to go to Saudi Arabia. 
And the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim was to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba, the holiest shrine of Islam. 
And I did that; I put on my ritualistic dress, I went to the holy mosque, I did my prayers, I observed all the rituals. 
And meanwhile, besides all the spirituality, there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba that was pretty interesting for me: there was no separation of sexes. 
In other words, men and women were worshiping all together. 
They were together while doing tawāf, the circular walk around the Kaaba. 
They were together while praying. 
And if you wonder why this is interesting at all, you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia, because this a country which is strictly divided between the sexes. 
In other words: as men, you are simply not supposed to be in the same physical space with women. 
I left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca. 
I headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant. 
And I went there -- I noticed that there was a male section, which is carefully separated from the female section. 
I had to pay, order and eat in the male section. 
"It's funny," I said to myself, "You can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy Kaaba, but not at the Burger King?" 
(Laughter) Quite, quite ironic. 
Ironic, and it's also, I think, quite telling, because the Kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of Islam, that of prophet Muhammad. 
And if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women, the rituals around the Kaaba could have been designed accordingly. 
But apparently, that was not an issue at the time. 
So the rituals came that way. 
This is also, I think, confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the Koran -- the very core of Islam, the divine core of Islam -- that all Muslims, equally myself, believe. 
And I think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam, because many scholars who study the history of Islamic thought -- Muslim scholars or Westerners -- think that, actually, the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in Islam, as Muslims adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the Middle East. 
Seclusion of women was actually a Byzantine and Persian practice, and Muslims adopted it and made it a part of their religion. 
Actually, this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon. 
What we call today Islamic law, and especially Islamic culture -- and there are many Islamic cultures, actually; the one in Saudi Arabia is much different from where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey. 
But still, if you're going to speak about a Muslim culture, this has a core: the divine message which began the religion. 
But then many traditions, perceptions, practices were added on top of it. 
And these were traditions of the Middle East medieval traditions. 
There are two important messages, or two lessons, to take from that reality. 
First of all, Muslims -- pious, conservative, believing Muslims who want to be loyal to their religion -- should not cling onto everything in their culture, thinking that that's divinely mandated. 
Maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed. 
On the other hand, the Westerners who look at Islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains. 
Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam. 
There is a practice called female circumcision. 
It's something terrible, horrible. 
It is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure. 
And Westerners -- Europeans or Americans -- who didn't know about this before, [saw] this practice within some of the Muslim communities who migrated from North Africa. 
And they've thought, "Oh, what a horrible religion that is, which ordains something like that." 
But when you look at female circumcision, you see that it has nothing to do with Islam; it's just a North African practice which predates Islam. 
It was there for thousands of years. 
And, quite tellingly, some Muslims do practice it -- the Muslims in North Africa, not in other places. 
But also the non-Muslim communities of North Africa -- the animists, some Christians and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa -- are known to practice female circumcision. 
So what might look like a problem within Islamic faith might turn out to be a tradition that Muslims have subscribed to. 
The same thing can be said for honor killings, which is a recurrent theme in the Western media -- and which is, of course, a horrible tradition. 
And we see, truly, in some Muslim communities, that tradition. 
But in the non-Muslim communities of the Middle East, such as some Christian communities, Eastern communities, you see the same practice. 
We had a tragic case of an honor killing within Turkey's Armenian community just a few months ago. 
Now, these are things about general culture, but I'm also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated, or whether there's an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens. 
And it is no secret that many Islamic movements in the Middle East tend to be authoritarian, and some of the so-called "Islamic regimes," such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the worst case, the Taliban in Afghanistan, they are pretty authoritarian -- no doubt about that. 
For example, in Saudi Arabia, there is a phenomenon called the religious police. 
And the religious police imposes the supposed Islamic way of life on every citizen, by force -- like, women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab, the Islamic head cover. 
Now that is pretty authoritarian, and that's something I'm very much critical of. 
But when I realized that the non-Muslim, or the non-Islamic-minded actors in the same geography sometimes behaved similarly, I realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region, not just Islam. 
Let me give you an example: in Turkey, where I come from, which is a very hyper-secular republic, until very recently, we used to have what I call "secularism police," which would guard the universities against veiled students. 
In other words, they would force students to uncover their heads. 
And I think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it. 
It should be the citizen's decision. 
But when I saw that, I said, "Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region, and some Muslims have been influenced by that. 
But the secular-minded people can be influenced by that. 
Maybe it's a problem of the political culture, and we have to think about how to change that political culture." 
Now, these are some of the questions I had in mind a few years ago when I sat down to write a book. 
I said, "Well, I will do research about how Islam actually came to be what it is today, and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken." 
The name of the book is "Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty." 
And as the subtitle suggests, I looked at Islamic tradition and the history of Islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty, and I tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty. 
And there are strengths in Islamic tradition. 
Islam, actually, as a monotheistic religion, which defined man as a responsible agent by itself, created the idea of the individual in the Middle East, and saved it from the communitarianism, the collectivism of the tribe. 
You can derive many ideas from that. 
But besides that, I also saw problems within Islamic tradition. 
But one thing was curious: most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later, not from the very divine core of Islam, the Koran, but from, again, traditions and mentalities, or the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages. 
The Koran, for example, doesn't condone stoning. 
There is no punishment for apostasy. 
There is no punishment for personal sins like drinking. 
These things which make Islamic law, the troubling aspects of Islamic law, were developed into later interpretations of Islam. 
Which means that Muslims can, today, look at those things and say, "Well, the core of our religion is here to stay with us. 
It's our faith, and we will be loyal to it. 
But we can change how it was interpreted, because it was interpreted according to the time and milieu in the Middle Ages. 
Now we're living in a different world, with different values and political systems." 
Now, if I were the only person thinking that way, we would be in trouble. 
But that's not the case at all. 
Actually, from the 19th century on, there's a whole revisionist, reformist -- whatever you call it -- tradition, a trend in Islamic thinking. 
These were intellectuals or statesmen of the 19th century, and later, 20th century, which looked at Europe, basically, and saw that Europe has many things to admire, like science and technology. 
But not just that; also democracy, parliament, the idea of representation, the idea of equal citizenship. 
These Muslim thinkers, intellectuals and statesmen of the 19th century, looked at Europe, saw these things, and said, "Why don't we have these things?" 
And they looked back at Islamic tradition, and saw that there are problematic aspects, but they're not the core of the religion, so maybe they can be re-understood, and the Koran can be reread in the modern world. 
That trend is generally called Islamic modernism, and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen, not just as an intellectual idea, though, but also as a political program. 
And that's why, actually, in the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire, which then covered the whole Middle East, made very important reforms -- reforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status, accepting a constitution, accepting a representative parliament, advancing the idea of freedom of religion. 
That's why the Ottoman Empire, in its last decades, turned into a proto-democracy, a constitutional monarchy, and freedom was a very important political value at the time. 
Similarly, in the Arab world, there was what the great Arab historian Albert Hourani defines as the Liberal Age. 
He has a book, "Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age," and the Liberal Age, he defines as 19th century and early 20th century. 
Quite notably, this was the dominant trend in the early 20th century among Islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians. 
But there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th century, because we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line. 
And in place of that, what happens is that Islamism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian, which is quite strident, which is quite anti-Western, and which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision. 
So Islamism is the problematic idea that really created a lot of problems in the 20th-century Islamic world. 
And even the very extreme forms of Islamism led to terrorism in the name of Islam -- which is actually a practice that I think is against Islam, but some, obviously, extremists, did not think that way. 
But there is a curious question: If Islamic modernism was so popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, why did Islamism become so popular in the rest of the 20th century? 
And this is a question, I think, which needs to be discussed carefully. 
In my book, I went into that question as well. 
And actually, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that. 
Just look at the political history of the 20th century, and you see things have changed a lot. 
In the 19th century, when Muslims were looking at Europe as an example, they were independent; they were more self-confident. 
In the early 20th century, with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the whole Middle East was colonized. 
And when you have colonialization, what do you have? 
You have anti-colonialization. 
So Europe is not just an example now to emulate; it's an enemy to fight and to resist. 
So there's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the Muslim world, and what you see is more of a defensive, rigid, reactionary strain, which led to Arab socialism, Arab nationalism and ultimately to the Islamist ideology. 
And when the colonial period ended, what you had in place of that was generally secular dictators, which say they're a country, but did not bring democracy to the country, and established their own dictatorship. 
And I think the West, at least some powers in the West, particularly the United States, made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators, thinking that they were more helpful for their interests. 
But the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed Islamic groups in their country actually made the Islamists much more strident. 
So in the 20th century, you had this vicious cycle in the Arab world, where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people, including the Islamic pious, and they're reacting in reactionary ways. 
There was one country, though, which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle. 
And that's the country where I come from, Turkey. 
Turkey has never been colonized, so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. 
That's one thing to remember; it did not share the same anti-colonial hype that you can find in some other countries in the region. 
Secondly, and most importantly, Turkey became a democracy earlier than any of the countries we are talking about. 
In 1950, Turkey had the first free and fair elections, which ended the more autocratic secular regime, which was in the beginning of Turkey. 
And the pious Muslims in Turkey saw that they could change the political system by voting. 
And they realized that democracy is something compatible with Islam, compatible with their values, and they've been supportive of democracy. 
That's an experience that not every other Muslim nation in the Middle East had, until very recently. 
Secondly, in the past two decades, thanks to globalization, thanks to the market economy, thanks to the rise of a middle class, we in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism. 
Now, there's the more urban middle-class pious Muslims who, again, look at their tradition and see that there are some problems in the tradition, and understand that they need to be changed and questioned and reformed. 
And they look at Europe, and see an example, again, to follow. 
They see an example, at least, to take some inspiration from. 
That's why the EU process, Turkey's effort to join the EU, has been supported inside Turkey by the Islamic pious, while some secular nationalists were against it. 
Well, that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all Europeans are that welcoming, but that's another discussion. 
But the pro-EU sentiment in Turkey in the past decade has become almost an Islamic cause and supported by the Islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well, of course. 
And thanks to that, Turkey has been able to reasonably create a success story in which Islam and the most pious understandings of Islam have become part of the democratic game, and even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country. 
And this has been an inspiring example right now for some of the Islamic movements or some of the countries in the Arab world. 
You must have all seen the Arab Spring, which began in Tunis and in Egypt. 
Arab masses just revolted against their dictators. 
They were asking for democracy; they were asking for freedom. 
And they did not turn out to be the Islamist boogeyman that the dictators were always using to justify their regime. 
They said, "We want freedom; we want democracy. 
We are Muslim believers, but we want to be living as free people in free societies." 
Of course, this is a long road. 
Democracy is not an overnight achievement; it's a process. 
But this is a promising era in the Muslim world. 
And I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the 19th century, but which had a setback in the 20th century because of the political troubles of the Muslim world, is having a rebirth. 
And I think the takeaway message from that would be that Islam, despite some of the skeptics in the West, has the potential in itself to create its own way to democracy, create its own way to liberalism, create its own way to freedom. 
They just should be allowed to work for that. 
Thanks so much.

Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see. 
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now. 
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired. 
So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge. 
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself. 
You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously. 
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition. 
So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently. 
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?" 
We have already an autonomous vehicle. 
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right? 
(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong. 
What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive. 
So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch. 
So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility. 
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin. 
It was an absolutely amazing experience. 
But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones. 
So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads. 
So how does it work? 
Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it. 
So we have three steps. 
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces. 
Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver. 
For that, we use an initial measurement unit. 
So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear. 
We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car. 
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road. 
And we also use three laser range finders. 
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle. 
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things. 
One is, first of all, process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver. 
The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car. 
So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle. 
But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive? 
So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology. 
So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot. 
But today we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces. 
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip. 
So these are a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity. 
Another device is called SpeedStrip. 
So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair. 
We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal. 
So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening. 
This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer. 
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective. 
But the problem is these are instructional cue devices. 
So this is not really freedom, right? 
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop. 
We call this the "backseat-driver problem." 
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices. 
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix. 
So think of it as a monitor for the blind. 
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images. 
So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it, you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles. 
Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature. 
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface. 
So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix. 
For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix. 
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces. 
So basically that's how it works. 
So just a month ago, on January 29th, we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex 24 racing event. 
We also had some surprises. Let's take a look. 
(Music) (Video) Announcer: This is an historic day in January. 
He's coming up to the grandstand, fellow Federationists. 
(Cheering) (Honking) There's the grandstand now. 
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him. 
Well there comes the first box. 
Now let's see if Mark avoids it. 
He does. He passes it on the right. 
Third box is out. The fourth box is out. 
And he's perfectly making his way between the two. 
He's closing in on the van to make the moving pass. 
Well this is what it's all about, this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity. 
He's approaching the end of the run, makes his way between the barrels that are set up there. 
(Honking) (Applause) Dennis Hong: I'm so happy for you. 
Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel. 
Mark Riccobono: Yes. 
(Applause) DH: So since we started this project, we've been getting hundreds of letters, emails, phone calls from people from all around the world. 
Letters thanking us, but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one: "Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine." 
(Laughter) But sometimes -- (Laughter) But sometimes I also do get -- I wouldn't call it hate mail -- but letters of really strong concern: "Dr. Hong, are you insane, trying to put blind people on the road? 
You must be out of your mind." 
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle. 
And I truly believe that this can happen. 
But still, will the society, would they accept such a radical idea? 
How are we going to handle insurance? 
How are we going to issue driver's licenses? 
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality. 
Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind. 
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project. 
The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain. 
And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people. 
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting. 
Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non-visual interfaces. 
This is priceless. 
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

I spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness -- trying to see if I can actually train my mind in a particular way, like I can train my body, so I can end up with an improved feeling of overall well-being. 
Then this January, my mother died, and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me. 
So in a very typical, silly designer fashion, after years worth of work, pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film. 
(Music) They were still done when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia. 
We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs. 
It was a little bit too funky, and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way -- fashion. 
My studio in Bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest, and monkeys, of course, are supposed to be the happiest of all animals. 
So we trained them to be able to do three separate words, to lay out them properly. 
You can see, there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there. 
The serif is not really in place. 
So of course, what you don't do properly yourself is never deemed done really. 
So this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the Sayan Valley in Indonesia. 
In that year, what I did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys, looking at a lot of data on this subject. 
And it turns out that men and women report very, very similar levels of happiness. 
This is a very quick overview of all the studies that I looked at. 
That climate plays no role. 
That if you live in the best climate, in San Diego in the United States, or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York, you are going to be just as happy in either place. 
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S., any salary increase you're going to experience will have only a tiny, tiny influence on your overall well-being. 
Black people are just as happy as white people are. 
If you're old or young it doesn't really make a difference. 
If you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking it makes no difference whatsoever. 
You will adapt to it and get used to it. 
If you have manageable health problems it doesn't really matter. 
Now this does matter. 
So now the woman on the right is actually much happier than the guy on the left -- meaning that, if you have a lot of friends, and you have meaningful friendships, that does make a lot of difference. 
As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier than if you are single. 
A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt, came up with this beautiful little analogy between the conscious and the unconscious mind. 
He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant, the unconscious. 
And the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do, but the elephant really has his own ideas. 
If I look at my own life, I'm born in 1962 in Austria. 
If I would have been born a hundred years earlier, the big decisions in my life would have been made for me -- meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in; I would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did; and I would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected. 
I, of course, and all of us, are very much in charge of these big decisions in our lives. 
We live where we want to be -- at least in the West. 
We become what we really are interested in. 
We choose our own profession, and we choose our own partners. 
And so it's quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of. 
If you look at the statistics and you see that the guy called George, when he decides on where he wants to live -- is it Florida or North Dakota? -- he goes and lives in Georgia. 
And if you look at a guy called Dennis, when he decides what to become -- is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher? -- best chance is that he wants to become a dentist. 
And if Paula decides should she marry Joe or Jack, somehow Paul sounds the most interesting. 
And so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons, it remains statistically true that there are more Georges living in Georgia and there are more Dennises becoming dentists and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul than statistically viable. 
(Laughter) Now I, of course, thought, "Well this is American data," and I thought, "Well, those silly Americans. 
They get influenced by things that they're not aware of. 
This is just completely ridiculous." 
Then, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad -- (Laughter) Karolina and Karl, and grandmom and granddad, Josefine and Josef. 
So I am looking still for a Stephanie. 
I'll figure something out. 
If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer, the easiest answer, of course, is do more of the stuff that I like to do and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do -- for which it would be helpful to know what it is that I actually do like to do. 
I'm a big list maker, so I came up with a list. 
One of them is to think without pressure. 
This is a project we're working on right now with a very healthy deadline. 
It's a book on culture, and, as you can see, culture is rapidly drifting around. 
Doing things like I'm doing right now -- traveling to Cannes. 
The example I have here is a chair that came out of the year in Bali -- clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture, not being stuck behind a single computer screen all day long and be here and there. 
Quite consciously, design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques, just basically to fight straightforward adaptation. 
Being close to the content -- that's the content really is close to my heart. 
This is a bus, or vehicle, for a charity, for an NGO that wants to double the education budget in the United States -- carefully designed, so, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses. 
Having end results -- things that come back from the printer well, like this little business card for an animation company called Sideshow on lenticular foils. 
Working on projects that actually have visible impacts, like a book for a deceased German artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous. 
It just came out six months ago, and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany. 
And I think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest. 
And lately, to be involved in projects where I know about 50 percent of the project technique-wise and the other 50 percent would be new. 
So in this case, it's an outside projection for Singapore on these giant Times Square-like screens. 
And I of course knew stuff, as a designer, about typography, even though we worked with those animals not so successfully. 
But I didn't quite know all that much about movement or film. 
And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project. 
But also because the content was very close. 
In this case, "Keeping a Diary Supports Personal Development" -- I've been keeping a diary since I was 12. 
And I've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intriguing way. 
In this case also because it's part of one of the many sentiments that we build the whole series on -- that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

How many Creationists do we have in the room? 
Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians. 
And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes. 
It's all right. 
You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution. 
The World Wide Web? Not so sure. 
Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no. 
What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life, and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules? 
And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking. 
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that, keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here. 
So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture, and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass. 
It climbs up to the top, and it falls, and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs -- trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass. 
What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of? 
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass? 
What's in it for the ant? 
And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant. 
Well then, why is it doing this? 
Is it just a fluke? 
Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke. 
It's a little brain worm. 
It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle. 
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds, and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant, crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle. 
So there's nothing in it for the ant. 
The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain, inducing suicidal behavior. 
Pretty scary. 
Well, does anything like that happen with human beings? 
This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course. 
Well, it may already have occurred to you that Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah." 
Well, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains. 
Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas? 
No, it's worse than that. 
Most people have. 
(Laughter) There are a lot of ideas to die for. 
Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire. 
(Laughter) Justice. Truth. Communism. 
Many people have laid down their lives for communism, and many have laid down their lives for capitalism. 
And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam. 
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for. 
They're infectious. 
Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about "infectious repititis." 
It was a term of abuse, in effect. 
This is unthinking engineering. 
Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking. 
It's "infectious repetitis," and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection. 
Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others. 
I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is. 
And you have to have a bumper sticker, you know. You have to have a statement. 
So, this is mine. 
The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it. 
Most of us -- now that the "Me Decade" is well in the past -- now we actually do this. 
One set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives. 
This is what our summum bonum is. 
It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have. 
Now, this is a profound biological effect. 
It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests. 
And no other species does anything at all like it. 
Well, how are we going to think about this? 
It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one. 
Unmistakable. 
Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this? 
Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together? 
The idea of replicating ideas; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain. 
Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term "memes," and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book "The Selfish Gene." 
Now here am I talking about his idea. 
Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it. 
But it's everybody's idea now. 
And he's not responsible for what I say about memes. 
I'm responsible for what I say about memes. 
Actually, I think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas, but for their likely misuses. 
So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me, that these ideas not be abused and misused. 
They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous. 
And it's just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another. 
So we have to keep plugging away, trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread. 
But it is a problem. 
We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out, because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said. 
So let me just point out: memes are like viruses. 
That's what Richard said, back in '93. 
And you might think, "Well, how can that be? 
I mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?" 
Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but -- what's a virus? 
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude. 
(Laughter) That is, there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does. 
And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude. 
What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom? 
Not silicon. 
They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium. 
What's a word made of? 
Sometimes when people say, "Do memes exist?" 
I say, "Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?" 
If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced. 
Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced. 
There are different species of memes. 
Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple? 
Simple, beautiful furniture? 
And, of course, they're basically extinct now. 
And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom is that one should be celibate. 
Not just the priests. Everybody. 
Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter) But in fact that's not why they went extinct. 
They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there. 
And there were lots of widows and orphans, people like that, who needed a foster home. 
And so they had a ready supply of converts. 
And they could keep it going. 
And, in principle, it could've gone on forever, with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts. 
The idea being passed on through proselytizing, instead of through the gene line. 
So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they're not being passed on genetically. 
A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness. 
After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite. 
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile. 
It's part of their plan. 
They don't have to have minds to have a plan. 
I'm just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend. 
I've not time to go into more of it. 
In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, "Guns, Germs and Steel," he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel, that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere -- that conquered the rest of the world. 
When European explorers and travelers spread out, they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to, that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years, of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens. 
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people, who had no immunity to them at all. 
And we're doing it again. 
We're doing it this time with toxic ideas. 
Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others -- spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out, thanks to all the new technology all over the world. 
And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful. 
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas. 
Now, this has been realized for some time. 
Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam, one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden. 
"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests, ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations." Memes. 
These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures. 
They are wiping out languages. 
They are wiping out traditions and practices. 
And it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity. 
We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture. 
We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off. 
They're like a mild cold. 
They're not a big deal for us. 
But we should recognize that for many people in the world, they are a big deal. 
And we should be very alert to this. 
As we spread our education and our technology, one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes -- the memes that they are prepared to die for. 
Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes? 
That is not the job of the science of memetics. 
Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be. 
This is not the place for hate and anger. 
If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV. 
But the way to deal with that is to do science, and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective. 
Get the facts. 
Work out the implications. 
There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do. 
And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them. 
You will never annihilate the germs. 
What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence. 
That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties. 
That's all the time I have, so thank you very much for your attention. 

This is a representation of your brain, and your brain can be broken into two parts. 
There's the left half, which is the logical side, and then the right half, which is the intuitive. 
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere, then we can plot our brain. 
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical. 
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive. 
So where would you put your brain on this scale? 
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes, but I think for most people in the audience, your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time. 
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything. 
You can be logical and intuitive. 
And so I consider myself one of these people, along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas. 
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work. 
How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff. 
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts, and then we develop our intuition from there. 
And really you do the same thing. 
So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time. 
I mean, it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it. 
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop. 
He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over. 
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they stay in one place. 
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world, unless you're a particle physicist. 
It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car stops, they play with these little weird particles. 
And when they play with their particles, they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time. 
And so they wrote down all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics. 
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles. 
But you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us. 
This didn't really sit well with my intuition, and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often. 
Well, I play with them sometimes, but not very often. 
And I've never seen them. 
I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle. 
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either. 
Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics? 
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. 
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics. 
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that. 
So I made one. 
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. 
So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip. 
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle. 
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute. 
This is a photograph of the object. 
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center. 
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal. 
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal, and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge. 
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip. 
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours. 
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device. 
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition, but it needs a little help to do it. 
Here, let me give you an analogy. 
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator? 
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them, or, frankly, scare them. 
So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. 
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people, but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room. 
And so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. 
And so that's what we did. 
We turned off the lights, and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air, and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. 
Now, all alone in the elevator, the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted. 
And so we measured its motion. 
We found it was moving in really weird ways. 
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows. 
And by giving it a gentle nudge, we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics. 
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. 
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time? 
So let's think about the atoms. 
So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down. 
Now it's only at precise times when they align. 
The rest of the time they're delocalized. 
That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places. 
I think this is really cool. 
(Laughter) Really. 
(Applause) It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you. 
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, that chunk of metal can be in two different places, then why not you? 
I mean, this is just my logical side talking. 
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time, what would that be like? 
How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space? 
There's one more part to the story. 
It's when we warmed it up, and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece. 
And so I had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. 
You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected. 
Well, that's not quite right. 
It's more than that; it's deeper. 
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase. 
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed. 
I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different, colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion. 
But I don't buy anything new. 
I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores. 
Aww, thank you. 
Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet. 
I get to meet all kinds of great people; my dollars usually go to a good cause; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt. 
I mean, what am I going to find today? 
Is it going to be my size? 
Will I like the color? 
Will it be under $20? 
If all the answers are yes, I feel as though I've won. 
I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED. 
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her? 
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought. 
I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it. 
Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase. 
I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs. 
And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear -- (Laughter) that means I found a few things. 
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now. 
Does that sound good? 
(Applause) So as I do this, I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that, believe it or not, I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new. 
So let's start with Sunday. 
I call this "Shiny Tiger." 
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great. 
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50. 
This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week. 
Monday: Color is powerful. 
It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants. 
(Laughter) If you are happy, you are going to attract other happy people to you. 
Tuesday: Fitting in is way overrated. 
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in. 
Just be who you are. 
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it. 
Wednesday: Embrace your inner child. 
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress-up, or that I remind them of their seven-year-old. 
I like to smile and say, "Thank you." 
Thursday: Confidence is key. 
If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do. 
And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right. 
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out. 
But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant. 
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second. 
If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off. 
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience. 
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you: Gold sequins go with everything. 
And finally, Saturday: Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word. 
It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing, and we've had great conversations. 
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase. 
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything back. 
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go. 
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit just waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and look. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Power. 
That is the word that comes to mind. 
We're the new technologists. 
We have a lot of data, so we have a lot of power. 
How much power do we have? 
Scene from a movie: "Apocalypse Now" -- great movie. 
We've got to get our hero, Captain Willard, to the mouth of the Nung River so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz. 
The way we're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off. 
So the scene: the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in. 
And there's this loud, thrilling music in the background, this wild music. 
♫ Dum da ta da dum ♫ ♫ Dum da ta da dum ♫ ♫ Da ta da da ♫ That's a lot of power. 
That's the kind of power I feel in this room. 
That's the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have. 
Let's take an example. 
What can we do with just one person's data? 
What can we do with that guy's data? 
I can look at your financial records. 
I can tell if you pay your bills on time. 
I know if you're good to give a loan to. 
I can look at your medical records; I can see if your pump is still pumping -- see if you're good to offer insurance to. 
I can look at your clicking patterns. 
When you come to my website, I actually know what you're going to do already because I've seen you visit millions of websites before. 
And I'm sorry to tell you, you're like a poker player, you have a tell. 
I can tell with data analysis what you're going to do before you even do it. 
I know what you like. I know who you are, and that's even before I look at your mail or your phone. 
Those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have. 
But I'm not actually here to talk about what we can do. 
I'm here to talk about what we should do. 
What's the right thing to do? 
Now I see some puzzled looks like, "Why are you asking us what's the right thing to do? 
We're just building this stuff. Somebody else is using it." 
Fair enough. 
But it brings me back. 
I think about World War II -- some of our great technologists then, some of our great physicists, studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff. 
We gather together these physicists in Los Alamos to see what they'll build. 
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology. 
So what should we be doing with that guy's data? 
Should we be collecting it, gathering it, so we can make his online experience better? 
So we can make money? 
So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good? 
Or should we respect his privacy, protect his dignity and leave him alone? 
Which one is it? 
How should we figure it out? 
I know: crowdsource. Let's crowdsource this. 
So to get people warmed up, let's start with an easy question -- something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about: iPhone versus Android. 
Let's do a show of hands -- iPhone. 
Uh huh. 
Android. 
You'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones. 
(Laughter) Next question, a little bit harder. 
Should we be collecting all of that guy's data to make his experiences better and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good? 
Or should we leave him alone? 
Collect his data. 
Leave him alone. 
You're safe. It's fine. 
(Laughter) Okay, last question -- harder question -- when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case, should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework, or should we use a Millian consequentialist one? 
Kant. 
Mill. 
Not as many votes. 
(Laughter) Yeah, that's a terrifying result. 
Terrifying, because we have stronger opinions about our hand-held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions. 
How do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don't have a moral framework? 
We know more about mobile operating systems, but what we really need is a moral operating system. 
What's a moral operating system? 
We all know right and wrong, right? 
You feel good when you do something right, you feel bad when you do something wrong. 
Our parents teach us that: praise with the good, scold with the bad. 
But how do we figure out what's right and wrong? 
And from day to day, we have the techniques that we use. 
Maybe we just follow our gut. 
Maybe we take a vote -- we crowdsource. 
Or maybe we punt -- ask the legal department, see what they say. 
In other words, it's kind of random, kind of ad hoc, how we figure out what we should do. 
And maybe, if we want to be on surer footing, what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there, that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place, and how would we know in a given situation what to do. 
So let's get a moral framework. 
We're numbers people, living by numbers. 
How can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework? 
I know a guy who did exactly that. 
A brilliant guy -- he's been dead 2,500 years. 
Plato, that's right. 
Remember him -- old philosopher? 
You were sleeping during that class. 
And Plato, he had a lot of the same concerns that we did. 
He was worried about right and wrong. 
He wanted to know what is just. 
But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this. 
He says something's just. She says something else is just. 
It's kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too. 
I'm just going back and forth; I'm not getting anywhere. 
I don't want opinions; I want knowledge. 
I want to know the truth about justice -- like we have truths in math. 
In math, we know the objective facts. 
Take a number, any number -- two. 
Favorite number. I love that number. 
There are truths about two. 
If you've got two of something, you add two more, you get four. 
That's true no matter what thing you're talking about. 
It's an objective truth about the form of two, the abstract form. 
When you have two of anything -- two eyes, two ears, two noses, just two protrusions -- those all partake of the form of two. 
They all participate in the truths that two has. 
They all have two-ness in them. 
And therefore, it's not a matter of opinion. 
What if, Plato thought, ethics was like math? 
What if there were a pure form of justice? 
What if there are truths about justice, and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated, partook of that form of justice? 
Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't. 
It wouldn't be a matter of just opinion or just appearances. 
That's a stunning vision. 
I mean, think about that. How grand. How ambitious. 
That's as ambitious as we are. 
He wants to solve ethics. 
He wants objective truths. 
If you think that way, you have a Platonist moral framework. 
If you don't think that way, well, you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy, because the tidy idea, you know, people criticized it. 
Aristotle, in particular, he was not amused. 
He thought it was impractical. 
Aristotle said, "We should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows." 
Aristotle thought ethics wasn't a lot like math. 
He thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here-and-now using our best judgment to find the right path. 
If you think that, Plato's not your guy. 
But don't give up. 
Maybe there's another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework. 
How about this: What if in any situation you could just calculate, look at the choices, measure out which one's better and know what to do? 
That sound familiar? 
That's a utilitarian moral framework. 
John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this -- nice guy besides -- and only been dead 200 years. 
So basis of utilitarianism -- I'm sure you're familiar at least. 
The three people who voted for Mill before are familiar with this. 
But here's the way it works. 
What if morals, what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain? 
It does something intrinsic to the act. 
It's not like its relation to some abstract form. 
It's just a matter of the consequences. 
You just look at the consequences and see if, overall, it's for the good or for the worse. 
That would be simple. Then we know what to do. 
Let's take an example. 
Suppose I go up and I say, "I'm going to take your phone." 
Not just because it rang earlier, but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation. 
I thought, that guy looks suspicious. 
And what if he's been sending little messages to Bin Laden's hideout -- or whoever took over after Bin Laden -- and he's actually like a terrorist, a sleeper cell. 
I'm going to find that out, and when I find that out, I'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause. 
That has a very high utility to prevent that damage. 
And compared to the little pain that it's going to cause -- because it's going to be embarrassing when I'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a Farmville problem and that whole bit -- that's overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone. 
If you feel that way, that's a utilitarian choice. 
But maybe you don't feel that way either. 
Maybe you think, it's his phone. 
It's wrong to take his phone because he's a person and he has rights and he has dignity, and we can't just interfere with that. 
He has autonomy. 
It doesn't matter what the calculations are. 
There are things that are intrinsically wrong -- like lying is wrong, like torturing innocent children is wrong. 
Kant was very good on this point, and he said it a little better than I'll say it. 
He said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct, and then it is our duty to follow those rules. 
It's not a matter of calculation. 
So let's stop. 
We're right in the thick of it, this philosophical thicket. 
And this goes on for thousands of years, because these are hard questions, and I've only got 15 minutes. 
So let's cut to the chase. 
How should we be making our decisions? 
Is it Plato, is it Aristotle, is it Kant, is it Mill? 
What should we be doing? What's the answer? 
What's the formula that we can use in any situation to determine what we should do, whether we should use that guy's data or not? 
What's the formula? 
There's not a formula. 
There's not a simple answer. 
Ethics is hard. 
Ethics requires thinking. 
And that's uncomfortable. 
I know; I spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence, trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us, that could give us answers. 
But they can't. 
You can't just take human thinking and put it into a machine. 
We're the ones who have to do it. 
Happily, we're not machines, and we can do it. 
Not only can we think, we must. 
Hannah Arendt said, "The sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil. 
It arises from not thinking." 
That's what she called the "banality of evil." 
And the response to that is that we demand the exercise of thinking from every sane person. 
So let's do that. Let's think. 
In fact, let's start right now. 
Every person in this room do this: think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing, where you wondered, "What should I be doing?" 
Bring that to mind, and now reflect on that and say, "How did I come up that decision? 
What did I do? Did I follow my gut? 
Did I have somebody vote on it? Or did I punt to legal?" 
Or now we have a few more choices. 
"Did I evaluate what would be the highest pleasure like Mill would? 
Or like Kant, did I use reason to figure out what was intrinsically right?" 
Think about it. Really bring it to mind. This is important. 
It is so important we are going to spend 30 seconds of valuable TEDTalk time doing nothing but thinking about this. 
Are you ready? Go. 
Stop. Good work. 
What you just did, that's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power. 
Now the next step -- try this. 
Go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision. 
Not right now. Wait till I finish talking. 
Do it over lunch. 
And don't just find another technologist friend; find somebody different than you. 
Find an artist or a writer -- or, heaven forbid, find a philosopher and talk to them. 
In fact, find somebody from the humanities. 
Why? Because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists. 
Just a few days ago, right across the street from here, there was hundreds of people gathered together. 
It was technologists and humanists at that big BiblioTech Conference. 
And they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective. 
You have someone from Google talking to someone who does comparative literature. 
You're thinking about the relevance of 17th century French theater -- how does that bear upon venture capital? 
Well that's interesting. That's a different way of thinking. 
And when you think in that way, you become more sensitive to the human considerations, which are crucial to making ethical decisions. 
So imagine that right now you went and you found your musician friend. 
And you're telling him what we're talking about, about our whole data revolution and all this -- maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music. 
♫ Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum ♫ Well, your musician friend will stop you and say, "You know, the theme music for your data revolution, that's an opera, that's Wagner. 
It's based on Norse legend. 
It's Gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry." 
That's interesting. 
Now it's also a beautiful opera, and we're moved by that opera. 
We're moved because it's about the battle between good and evil, about right and wrong. 
And we care about right and wrong. 
We care what happens in that opera. 
We care what happens in "Apocalypse Now." 
And we certainly care what happens with our technologies. 
We have so much power today, it is up to us to figure out what to do, and that's the good news. 
We're the ones writing this opera. 
This is our movie. 
We figure out what will happen with this technology. 
We determine how this will all end. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When I was growing up in Montana, I had two dreams. 
I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur. 
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life. 
I was very fortunate early in my career. 
I was fortunate in finding things. 
I wasn't very good at reading things. 
In fact, I don't read much of anything. 
I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do. 
But instead, I go out and I find things. 
Then I just pick things up. 
I basically practice for finding money on the street. 
(Laughter) And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things. 
And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests, the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones. 
And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years. 
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special. 
And so, at that time, I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues. 
We were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young, brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds. 
So it was pretty interesting stuff. 
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social. 
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults. 
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals. 
In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults. 
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults. 
And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like. 
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around. 
(Laughter) But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton. 
And in his book, he talked about the social animals. 
And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures. 
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park." 
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life. 
You all know the story, right. 
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park." 
If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out. 
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it. 
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur. 
And everybody's happy about that. 
(Laughter) And they're happy over and over again. 
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things. 
And then, then, then, and then ... 
Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire. 
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around. 
So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And probably a whole bunch of trees as well. 
Now if you want dinosaur DNA, I say go to the dinosaur. 
So that's what we've done. 
Back in 1993 when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur, and we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen. 
And one of my former doctoral students, Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing. 
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there. 
They found these red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world, like red blood cells. 
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone. 
And so she thought, well, what the heck. 
So she sampled some material out of it. 
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA. 
But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin. 
And that was really cool. 
That was interesting. 
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme. 
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it. 
So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project. 
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them. 
And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff. 
And we did find a lot of stuff. 
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex. 
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock. 
It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex. 
And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16. 
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet. 
But this one died at the age of 16. 
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone. 
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant. 
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs. 
But Mary went further. 
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid. 
Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left. 
But there was something left. 
There were blood vessels left. 
There were flexible, clear blood vessels. 
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur. 
It was extraordinary. 
But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones. 
And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins. 
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground. 
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast. 
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples. 
And we did. We got better material. 
The cells looked better. 
The vessels looked better. 
Found the protein collagen. 
I mean, it was wonderful stuff. 
But it's not dinosaur DNA. 
So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast. 
We're just not going to be able to do what they did in "Jurassic Park." 
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur. 
But birds are dinosaurs. 
Birds are living dinosaurs. 
We actually classify them as dinosaurs. 
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs. 
So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct. 
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds. 
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them. 
(Laughter) I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders. 
(Laughter) The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No." 
(Laughter) "You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool." 
(Laughter) "The chicken is not." 
(Laughter) So this is our problem, as you can imagine. 
The chicken is a dinosaur. 
I mean it really is. 
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But the sixth-graders demand it. 
"Fix the chicken." 
(Laughter) So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken. 
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken. 
Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools. 
We'll call them biological modification tools. 
We have selection. 
And we know selection works. 
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese. 
I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification. 
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs. 
We also have transgenesis. 
Transgenesis is really cool too. 
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one. 
That's how people make GloFish. 
You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow. 
And that's pretty cool. 
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them. 
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things. 
I guess we could make a glow chicken. 
(Laughter) But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either. 
But there's another thing. 
There's what we call atavism activation. 
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic. 
You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic. 
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen. 
Snakes are occasionally born with legs. 
And here's an example. 
This is a chicken with teeth. 
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens. 
Now that's a good characteristic. 
We can save that one. 
We know we can use that. 
We can make a chicken with teeth. 
That's getting closer. 
That's better than a glowing chicken. 
(Laughter) A friend of mine, a colleague of mine, Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms. 
And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop, and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail. 
He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing. 
He's looking for those genes as well. 
And I said, "Well, if you can find those, I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders." 
And so he agreed. 
And so that's what we're looking into. 
If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it. 
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand. 
But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing. 
But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand. 
It has the three fingers, the three digits. 
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together. 
And so what we're looking for is that gene. 
We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, like the archaeopteryx. 
And the same goes for the tails. 
Birds have basically rudimentary tails. 
And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail. 
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it. 
So that's the other gene we're looking for. 
We want to stop that tail from resorbing. 
So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus. 
(Laughter) It's a cooler-looking chicken. 
But it's just the very basics. 
So that really is what we're doing. 
And people always say, "Why do that? 
Why make this thing? 
What good is it?" 
Well, that's a good question. 
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things. 
And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece. 
(Laughter) Anyway -- When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

This story is about taking imagination seriously. 
Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries. 
Today, I'm using it to create permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world. 
I was an unlikely person to be doing this. 
I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture. 
In fact, after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven. 
I went off on my own to become an artist, and I painted for 10 years, when I was offered a Fulbright to India. 
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings, I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram. 
The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn't. 
I had to do something. 
This fishing village was famous for sculpture. 
So I tried bronze casting. 
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive. 
I went for a walk on the beach, watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand. 
I'd seen it every day, but this time I saw it differently -- a new approach to sculpture, a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials. 
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen. 
It's a self-portrait titled "Wide Hips." 
(Laughter) We hoisted them on poles to photograph. 
I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns. 
I was mesmerized. 
I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans, next in Lithuania with lace makers. 
I liked the fine detail it gave my work, but I wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in. 
Returning to India to work with those fishermen, we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in Madrid. 
Thousands of people saw it, and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto, Portugal. 
He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city. 
I didn't know if I could do that and preserve my art. 
Durable, engineered, permanent -- those are in opposition to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral. 
For two years, I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays, salt, air, pollution, and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind. 
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle. 
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring. 
We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds. 
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving. 
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel. 
He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement. 
I couldn't build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane. 
So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory, learned the variables of their machines, and figured out a way to make lace with them. 
There was no language to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce. 
So we had to create one. 
Three years and two children later, we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net. 
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built, permanent and had lost nothing in translation. 
(Applause) This intersection had been bland and anonymous. 
Now it had a sense of place. 
I walked underneath it for the first time. 
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold, I felt sheltered and, at the same time, connected to limitless sky. 
My life was not going to be the same. 
I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world. 
I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work. 
Historic Philadelphia City Hall: its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting. 
So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing, discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet. 
I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time -- like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding. 
Next challenge, the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked, could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture? 
(Laughter) I didn't know where to begin, but I said yes. 
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean. 
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates, sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day. 
So I contacted NOAA, and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami, and translated it into this. 
Its title: "1.26" refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth's day was shortened. 
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew. 
Its shape was too complex now. 
So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel. 
The sculpture could now be entirely soft, which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city. 
There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity. 
So we had to create it. 
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line. 
This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers. 
They don't have funding yet, but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed. 
Fourteen years ago, I searched for beauty in the traditional things, in craft forms. 
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous, billowing forms the scale of buildings. 
My artistic horizons continue to grow. 
I'll leave you with this story. 
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix. 
An attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art, never visited the local art museum, dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture. 
There they were in their business suits, laying in the grass, noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know, sharing the rediscovery of wonder. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

In 2007, I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development. 
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work, they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents. 
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now. 
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them. 
But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them. 
So we could easily supply the world with dozens, maybe hundreds, of new cities. 
Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities. 
But just substitute apartment building for cities. 
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them; the other half aren't there yet. 
You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments. 
But you know what you'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction. 
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions. 
But you could go out someplace brand new, build a brand new apartment building, as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way. 
So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name: charter cities. 
Later I learned that at about this same time, Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras. 
They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year would leave to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Honduras. 
At one point, Javier said to Octavio, "What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States, they can go get jobs, do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?" 
In the summer of 2009, Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis. 
At the next regularly scheduled election, Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform, but reconciliation as well. 
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff. 
Meanwhile, I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal. 
Through a process of refinement, trial and error, a lot of user testing, I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials. 
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders. 
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes technologies and rules to get progress, and it's usually the rules that hold us back. 
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk. 
He showed it to Javier. 
They called me. 
They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country." 
So in December we met in Miami, in a hotel conference room. 
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, how much more valuable they are than they cost. 
And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City: notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases, per square meter. 
But it was a fairly abstract discussion, and at some point when there was a pause, Octavio said, "Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk." 
(Laughing) So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms, a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land, a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in, to go live under those rules or not. 
So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project, this is important, this could be the way forward for our country. 
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth. 
So I presented another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this, which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city, it has to be very big. 
This is a picture of Denver, and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver. 
This airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers. 
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans, if you build a new city, you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers. 
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres. 
Everybody applauded politely. 
The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive. 
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk. 
I've got it here on my laptop." 
So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk. 
And it got to the essence, which is that a new city could offer new choices for people. 
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras, instead of hundreds of miles away in the North. 
And it also involved new choices for leaders. 
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries, who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement, so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced. 
And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust. 
We went and looked at a site. 
This picture's from there. 
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers. 
And shortly thereafter, on January 19th, they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions. 
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis, the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one. 
All parties, all factions in society, backed this. 
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. 
On February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one. 
Immediately after that vote, on February 21st to the 24th, a delegation of about 30 Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business. 
One is South Korea. 
This is a picture of a big, new city center that's being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston. 
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the permits. 
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore. 
They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third. 
So if you think about this practically, here's where we are. 
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city. 
They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in, and also an external legal system. 
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there. 
There's designers and builders of cities who are very interested. 
They even can bring with them some financing. 
But the one thing you know they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants. 
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's lots of people who'd like to go there. 
Around the world, there's 700 million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now. 
There's a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States. 
Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing. 
Sadly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade. 
So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras? 
Or to build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these, around the world? 
What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents? 
This is an idea worth spreading. 
And my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you, TED. 
(Applause) 

I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day, at the exact same moment, each conceiving a baby, OK? 
So two couples each conceiving one baby. 
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception, because if you do, you're not going to listen to me, so just imagine that for a moment. 
And in this scenario, I want to imagine that, in one case, the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome, meeting that X chromosome of the egg. 
And in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome, meeting the X chromosome of the egg. 
Both are viable; both take off. 
We'll come back to these people later. 
So I wear two hats in most of what I do. 
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy. 
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies, animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies. 
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate -- or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors. 
In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms. 
So some of what I've worked on, for example, is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body. 
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical. 
And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types. 
And as a general term, we can use the term "intersex" for this. 
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms. 
I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female. 
So in one instance, you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis, and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life, to become testes. 
But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't react to the testosterone. 
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it. 
As a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path. 
When the child is born, she looks like a girl. 
She is a girl, she is raised as a girl. 
And it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts, but she's not getting her period, that somebody figures out something's up here. 
And they do some tests and figure out that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus, she has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome. 
Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male, but they're really not. 
Females, like males, have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands. 
They're in the back of our body. 
And the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone. 
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up, but I think I'm probably typical -- most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive. 
We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens. 
The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome. 
So sex is really complicated -- it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways, they can be all over the place. 
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy, and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside. 
What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 
He had XX chromosomes, and in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment. 
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinized, his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones. 
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything. 
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems from menstruating internally, that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female, internally. 
OK, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex. 
Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. 
And we're not exactly sure why that happens. 
So sex can come in lots of different varieties. 
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning, or it's an intersex type -- are often "normalized" by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health. 
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy. 
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories. 
Our system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity. 
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy in terms of your history. 
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea. 
And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different, it startles us in terms of those categorizations. 
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism. 
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism. 
You can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body. 
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin. 
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me, "Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female?" 
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test. 
In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit: Nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature. 
So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes, the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories, that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. 
And it's not just in terms of sex. 
It's also in terms of race, which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed. 
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas. 
We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees. 
What are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only, really, by a few nucleotides? 
And as we get farther and farther with our science, we get more and more into a discomforted zone, where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic. 
So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life. 
One of the places we're seeing it, for example, in our culture, in the United States today, is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life. 
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fetal life. 
We have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody's dead. 
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead. 
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet. 
If it stopped twitching, you bury them. 
But today, we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings.
