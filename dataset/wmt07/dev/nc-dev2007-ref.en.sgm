<seg id=1> Another Balkan High Noon </seg>
<seg id=2> With the world focused on Iraq, North Korea, and a possible clash with Iran over nuclear weapons, Kosovo has fallen off the radar screen. </seg>
<seg id=3> That inattention will end soon; a decision about the province's fate is looming. </seg>
<seg id=4> The United States and its European friends have repeatedly stated their intent to make the difficult decision before the end of the year on whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia. </seg>
<seg id=5> This decision -- crucial to the future of an unstable region -- will test Western determination and unity. </seg>
<seg id=6> Negotiations this year in Vienna, brokered by the United Nations, showed that an agreed settlement between Serbia and Kosovo on "final status" will not happen. </seg>
<seg id=7> Talks continue, but, as UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari diplomatically told the Security Council, they are effectively dead. </seg>
<seg id=8> No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo's independence, because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country. </seg>
<seg id=9> Indeed, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the apostle of Serbian nationalism, has been trying in every way to undermine Kosovo's interim government. </seg>
<seg id=10> He is rushing to hold a national referendum this month on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual public education. </seg>
<seg id=11> The main purpose of his new constitution is its preamble, which enshrines Kosovo as an inalienable part of Serbia. </seg>
<seg id=12> Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have proclaimed that they will not accept any tie to Serbia, no matter how tenuous. </seg>
<seg id=13> Throughout the 1990's, they virtually opted out of Serbian-run Kosovo by creating parallel institutions. </seg>
<seg id=14> Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO's subsequent intervention, which ended Serbia's rule and established a quasi-state under UN administration, has made anything other than independence intolerable. </seg>
<seg id=15> Some time over the next month or two, the Balkan Contact Group â€” the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia -- will consider Ahtisaari's recommendations on Kosovo's final status and possibly propose a solution to the Security Council, which must make the final decision. </seg>
<seg id=16> In public, all Contact Group members have tried to leave the question of Kosovo's final status open, but informally the US and some of its allies have told the two parties that they will propose independence this year. </seg>
<seg id=17> Some members of the Security Council -- particularly Russia and China -- are opposed to or skeptical of an imposed settlement, and few governments favor dividing up another country's territory, however compelling the circumstances. </seg>
<seg id=18> Whether the Security Council will approve independence largely depends on averting a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic effort. </seg>
<seg id=19> The nature of the independence bestowed is also important. </seg>
<seg id=20> An independent Kosovo must be secured and its minorities protected. </seg>
<seg id=21> Northern Kosovo, now largely under Belgrade's control, must not be partitioned off in all but name. </seg>
<seg id=22> In the interest of reducing the blow to Serbia, the Security Council must avoid granting independence in ways that are so contorted that the new state cannot effectively function. </seg>
<seg id=23> If the Security Council fails to reach a decision on final status, it will produce a GRAVE situation: Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally, and all nations would have to make up their mind whether or not to recognize the new state. </seg>
<seg id=24> If that happens, it is likely that the Serbs of North Kosovo would declare their own independence. </seg>
<seg id=25> At a minimum, Serbia would campaign strongly against recognition. </seg>
<seg id=26> In fact, Serbia's government is already trying to persuade the West to postpone a decision until mid-2007. </seg>
<seg id=27> It claims that if Kosovo is granted independence, the ultranationalist Radical Party will come to power in the next elections, and believes that holding elections as early as this year will cause the Contact Group to delay a proposal to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id=28> Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia's Republika Srpska to threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id=29> And they continue to push &#45;&#45; unsuccessfully &#45;&#45; for Ahtisaari's removal in order to prolong the Vienna talks. </seg>
<seg id=30> The timing of the constitutional referendum appears to be a part of this delaying strategy. </seg>
<seg id=31> Some hope that postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and further encourage Western reconsideration of independence. </seg>
<seg id=32> That tactic may be working. </seg>
<seg id=33> Many European Union countries are worried about the implications of taking away a country's territory, as well as the impact of Kosovo's independence on Serbian democracy. </seg>
<seg id=34> Given Serbia's political instability, they question the harm of a short-term postponement -- albeit mostly self-inflicted. </seg>
<seg id=35> But delay only offers more room for Kostunica to find ways to make a Security Council decision more difficult. </seg>
<seg id=36> The West must ignore Belgrade's siren song. </seg>
<seg id=37> Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable for the foreseeable future, and Serbian politicians will attempt to present this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo. </seg>
<seg id=38> Likewise, there will be problems establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo under any circumstances. </seg>
<seg id=39> But failure to proceed definitively now on Kosovo's final status will produce a worse Balkan situation, one that blocks Serbia's move toward the West and ultimate membership in the EU, condemns Kosovo's ethnic minorities to dangerous ambiguity, and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia. </seg>
<seg id=40> No realistic solution exists for Kosovo but independence. </seg>
<seg id=41> If Serbia wants to join the West, it must not forsake that opportunity by trapping itself in its nationalist past. </seg>
<seg id=42> South Korea's Dangerous New Dawn </seg>
<seg id=43> North Korea's decision to expel UN atomic energy inspectors is but another reason to view Roh Moo Hyun's election as South Korea's president two weeks ago as an historical watershed. </seg>
<seg id=44> The beginning of his term not only coincides with one of the most dangerous episodes on the Korean peninsula in decades, but his presidency will also test South Korea's relations with the US to a degree that has not been seen for many years. </seg>
<seg id=45> Roh's victory over Lee Hoi Chang signifies a generational shift in Korean politics, with the young determined to gain a freer hand in Korea's relations with the US. </seg>
<seg id=46> Indeed, generational differences were the deciding factor in the race, replacing the regional sentiments that dominated every presidential race before this one. </seg>
<seg id=47> According to one report, over 60% of people in their twenties and thirties voted for Roh to produce a margin of 2.3% in this first two-man, head-to-head presidential race in 31 years. </seg>
<seg id=48> Roh's populist and nationalist stance will be swiftly and sorely tested by reality when he assumes power in February. </seg>
<seg id=49> But couple the generational changeover thaty put him in office with a strong popular desire for continued engagement with North Korea--notwithstanding North Korea's growing nuclear brinkmanship--and the recipe is complete for disputes with the US. </seg>
<seg id=50> Roh, a self-made man who passed a bar examination without going to college and law school, succeeded in convincing voters that he would usher in a new brand of politics reflecting South Korea's growing wealth and middle class sentiments, thereby sweeping away insider-dominated politics, regional bickering, and factional struggles. </seg>
<seg id=51> His style and rhetoric projected the fresh (for Korea!) image of a common man committed to eliminating the ossified networks of cronyism and corruption. </seg>
<seg id=52> For the first time in modern Korean history, the presidential campaign actually debated the central issues facing the country, rather than focussing on parties and personalities. </seg>
<seg id=53> Candidate Roh called for a new relationship between South Korea and the US, one based on the principle of independence and equality. </seg>
<seg id=54> For example, he said that he would not kow-tow to the US or visit Washington just for the sake of a photo opportunity He also promised to continue President Kim Dae Jung's "Sunshine policy" of engagement with the North. </seg>
<seg id=55> Remarkably, Roh won the election despite North Korea's decision to reactivate nuclear reactors that had been frozen since 1994. </seg>
<seg id=56> A few years ago this would have doomed Roh's candidacy. </seg>
<seg id=57> That he overcame this obstacle without changing his stance on engaging North Korea means that times have radically changed. </seg>
<seg id=58> A popular yearning for change, not the security situation, is now the overriding concern of ordinary Koreans. </seg>
<seg id=59> Roh's campaign also took advantage of a rising tide of anti-Americanism. </seg>
<seg id=60> The acquittal by a US military court of two American soldiers who accidentally killed two Korean schoolgirls with their armored car last June triggered street demonstrations across the country. </seg>
<seg id=61> Although President George W. Bush apologized twice for the deaths of the girls, demands continue to escalate for changing the Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) that governs the legal treatment of American troops stationed in South Korea. </seg>
<seg id=62> Ordinary Koreans insist that US soldiers who commit crimes should be tried in Korean courts. </seg>
<seg id=63> This expression of wounded national pride was enabled by South Korea's tremendous performance in the World Cup football tournament last summer, which helped convince ordinary Koreans that their country was fully grown up--and thus might be able to stand on its own without the presence of 37,000 US troops. </seg>
<seg id=64> Indeed, many ordinary people now view the US presence, and not North Korea's communist regime, as the biggest obstacle to unification. </seg>
<seg id=65> According to a recent poll, only 54.8% of Koreans now support the stationing of American troops in the country, while 31.7% oppose it. </seg>
<seg id=66> These sentiments will form part of the diplomatic test shaping Roh's presidency from the start, for he must re-engineer relations with America at the same time that the Bush administration is fretting about North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its role in spreading weapons of mass destruction to rogue states. </seg>
<seg id=67> For now, Korean voters--apparently impervious to the threat that North Korea's nuclear weapons poses--support Roh's policy of maintaining dialogue and economic exchange with the North. </seg>
<seg id=68> Under President Roh, South Korea's domestic politics and relations with the US and North Korea will require an almost total overhaul. </seg>
<seg id=69> Can he walk the tightrope of maintaining security on the peninsula, keeping America engaged, and retaining the support of the voters who elected him? </seg>
<seg id=70> Reconciling those goals would test even the most experienced and cynical of politicians, so it is anyone's guess as to whether President Roh can succeed. </seg>
<seg id=71> Failure, however, offers such a horrific prospect that no one can possibly hope for it. </seg>
<seg id=72> The Unilateral Road to Peace </seg>
<seg id=73> In the next three weeks, the Israeli army will do something unprecedented: instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorism, it will evacuate -- by force if necessary -- 9,000 Israelis from their homes. </seg>
<seg id=74> Israel's unilateral withdrawal is the outcome of a deep political shift that has been caused by two somewhat contradictory convictions that have characterized Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's policies since 2003: first, that the US-initiated "road map" is going nowhere and, second, that the status quo is untenable. </seg>
<seg id=75> Certainly, according to Sharon's thinking, there is no future for 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </seg>
<seg id=76> Hence, in the absence of negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only meaningful step towards de-escalation and stabilization. </seg>
<seg id=77> This policy has deeply divided Israel: the settlers -- mostly, but not exclusively religious -- feel betrayed by Sharon, "The Father of the Settlements." </seg>
<seg id=78> It is now the Israeli left that, however reluctantly, realizes that Sharon's new pragmatism may be the first step in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id=79> Like de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has reshuffled the cards of Israel's politics. </seg>
<seg id=80> The last weeks have seen massive demonstrations, some of them verging on violence; many of the settlers have declared that they will not obey government orders to evacuate. </seg>
<seg id=81> The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions. </seg>
<seg id=82> This forcible approach is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis. </seg>
<seg id=83> Only the next days and weeks will tell whether the evacuation proceeds peacefully or not. </seg>
<seg id=84> In the meantime, Sharon has paid heavily for his policies. </seg>
<seg id=85> Two right-wing parties have left his ruling coalition, he has lost his majority within his own Likud Party, and his finance minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has quit his government. </seg>
<seg id=86> Only by bringing Shimon Peres's Labor Party into his cabinet did Sharon manage to retain his parliamentary majority. </seg>
<seg id=87> The question, of course, is what will happen after the Gaza disengagement. </seg>
<seg id=88> Many governments were initially skeptical about disengagement, but realized that -- as the Washington saying goes -- "this is the only game in town." </seg>
<seg id=89> Among them, as well as among the Palestinians, one hears the hope that after the Gaza withdrawal, it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume negotiations leading to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id=90> This is a major mistake. </seg>
<seg id=91> While motivated by the best of intentions, the hope of reviving the road map is out of touch with reality. </seg>
<seg id=92> Future negotiations will have to deal with the ultimate borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, and with the problem of the 1947-48 Palestinian refugees. </seg>
<seg id=93> On all of these issues, the gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions has not narrowed since the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000, while fear and distrust have increased. </seg>
<seg id=94> To attempt negotiations under these circumstances would not only be an exercise in futility, but may merely deepen alienation and suspicion on both sides. </seg>
<seg id=95> The failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough -- and the disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id=96> So what can be done? </seg>
<seg id=97> Probably the only rational way to proceed would be to acknowledge that unilateral steps on both sides can still further the cause of de-escalation and ultimate reconciliation. </seg>
<seg id=98> On the Israeli side, further disengagement from dozens of isolated and small settlements on the West Bank, entailing the evacuation of between 20,000 and 30,000 settlers, may be politically feasible and would give the Palestinians a contiguous territory on the West Bank. </seg>
<seg id=99> On the Palestinian side, consolidation of the Palestinian Authority's control over a dozen security services and militias would be an important step. </seg>
<seg id=100> The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, recognizes this, but the question is whether he can deliver. </seg>
<seg id=101> The Palestinian leadership could also start down the difficult road of telling the refugees that -- contrary to almost 50 years of Palestinian propaganda -- they will not return to Israel, but will have to be settled in the West Bank and Gaza, the areas that will become part of the eventual Palestinian state. </seg>
<seg id=102> In an ideal world, conflicts end by agreements and treaties. </seg>
<seg id=103> But in the real world -- and Cyprus, Bosnia, and Kosovo may be examples -- stabilization and the slow de-escalation of violence can sometimes achieve the same end, even without formal agreement. </seg>
<seg id=104> In the absence of plausible alternatives, one hopes that this will also be the case for Israelis and Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id=105> A World Restored? </seg>
<seg id=106> BERLIN: Like old battle horses feeling young as the bugle sounds, Cold War strategists are feeling the adrenalin mount as missile defense becomes front page news. </seg>
<seg id=107> True, the defense against missiles which Bill Clinton (reluctantly) and George W. Bush (enthusiastically) are proposing -- with massive support from America's Congress -- is different from Ronald Reagan's Star Wars dream of twenty years ago: NMD is supposed to catch only a modest number of warheads, not provide complete protection against enemy missiles. </seg>
<seg id=108> Nevertheless, the issue rekindles old debates over deterrence, mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control, and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers just when nuclear weapons had lost much of their relevance. </seg>
<seg id=109> Amazingly, debate is heating up even though it is uncertain that NMD will work. </seg>
<seg id=110> Even if it does work, it will be ten to fifteen years, possibly longer, before NMD is operational. </seg>
<seg id=111> So tempers are rising over something which, if and when it happens in the distant future, may or may not have much impact. </seg>
<seg id=112> Normally cautious governments are positioning themselves now as if the future were around the corner. </seg>
<seg id=113> What explains this odd behavior? </seg>
<seg id=114> Not blind faith in technology. </seg>
<seg id=115> After all, the history of missile defense is a tale of technology constantly disappointing its advocates in and out of government. </seg>
<seg id=116> No one in his right mind can assume that something never achieved before, namely destroying a small number of warheads in flight, will happen over night. </seg>
<seg id=117> Of the three tests so far conducted, one failed almost, two entirely, which is why President Clinton left the matter to his successor. </seg>
<seg id=118> If President Bush, as he has hinted, now favors a different design, it will take even more time to develop the architecture and devise a test program. </seg>
<seg id=119> Nobody can be sure that it will work either. </seg>
<seg id=120> Governments are worried now, not because of capabilities, but because of America's real or imagined intentions. </seg>
<seg id=121> While Americans claim that NMD is not directed against anyone, that all the US wants is to protect its citizens against states like Iraq or North Korea, almost everyone else thinks differently: Russians fear that America wants to cement its military superiority (and Russia's inferiority) forever; the Chinese are concerned that NMD signals American readiness to help Taiwan remain independent; Europeans worry that America's plans invite tensions with Russia and may separate the US from Europe. </seg>
<seg id=122> Because political intentions, not technical capabilities matter, NMD creates problems now: it pushes Russia into confrontation, heightens Chinese nervousness, and underpins a European sense of estrangement from the US. </seg>
<seg id=123> Damage is done from the word go while the end of the road remains obscured. </seg>
<seg id=124> Inflating this political damage is the fact that, thirty years ago, the US and the then Soviet Union renounced effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles. </seg>
<seg id=125> Normally, a US defense project in its infancy would not cause the excitement NMD generates. </seg>
<seg id=126> But the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits, for the indefinite future, systems to protect either country against such nuclear attack. </seg>
<seg id=127> As the US proceeds with NMD, it will either have to violate the Treaty or give six months notice to quit, something both signatories are entitled to do if they feel their vital security interests demand it. </seg>
<seg id=128> In the eyes of many, that would amount to America opting out of the structure of nuclear arms control built in the latter part of the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id=129> The Bush Administration argues that, because the Cold War is over, the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not mean a loss of nuclear stability. </seg>
<seg id=130> But stability is as much a matter of political perceptions as of technical calculations. </seg>
<seg id=131> By limiting strategic missile defense, the old treaty provides a certain predictability of deterrence for all nuclear weapon states. </seg>
<seg id=132> Its disappearance would affect all other arms control agreements. </seg>
<seg id=133> Russia threatens to scrap all of them once the US leaves the ABM-Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=134> While this threat lacks credibility (it would harm Russian interests most) it has a certain logic. </seg>
<seg id=135> The main question NMD poses is not how to prepare for a future world of missile defense but how to dampen today's political concerns. </seg>
<seg id=136> Such efforts are getting discretely underway. </seg>
<seg id=137> Legal experts in Washington suggest that modest preparations for building missile and radar sites do not violate the ABM-Treaty and so do not yet require a US notice to quit. </seg>
<seg id=138> For now, the Bush Administration will await the outcome of tests before deciding. </seg>
<seg id=139> Both Moscow and Washington hint at possible deep cuts in their offensive nuclear arsenals. </seg>
<seg id=140> Skeptical European allies are being mollified by US assurances of close consultation. </seg>
<seg id=141> The most important of confidence-building measures, a modification of the ABM-Treaty to allow for limited missile defense, is being explored. </seg>
<seg id=142> Russia's early "nyet" may not be the last word. </seg>
<seg id=143> So political turmoil with Russia and Europe might be calmed. </seg>
<seg id=144> But what about China? </seg>
<seg id=145> In contrast to Europe and Russia, China is not party to an alliance (as is Europe) or to a network of arms control treaties through which political solutions can evolve (like Russia), factors that contribute to Asian instabilities and Chinese sensitivity. </seg>
<seg id=146> Here confidence can only be built through the approach taken by the US to China. </seg>
<seg id=147> Regrettably, there are no indications yet that the problem is recognized in Washington as a serious one. </seg>
<seg id=148> All this comes as a disappointment to old Cold War strategists. </seg>
<seg id=149> While brushing up the vocabulary and abbreviations of the age of superpower deterrence, they discover that such a world has gone. </seg>
<seg id=150> Missile defense is not a threat to US-Russian strategic stability; its mishandling is a threat to political predictability. </seg>
<seg id=151> By announcing its determination to go ahead with a distant NMD, the US has created political turbulence which it must address now if major damage is to be avoided. </seg>
<seg id=152> The New Baby Boomers </seg>
<seg id=153> Alienated and unemployed youth are a concern everywhere. </seg>
<seg id=154> They pose a particular challenge in the developing world, where a demographic bulge equal to the great "baby boom" that occurred in the West at the end of World War II is growing. </seg>
<seg id=155> But the post-war era in the world's most developed countries was one of unprecedented prosperity for the baby boom generation, which is now nearing retirement. </seg>
<seg id=156> Will the future be as promising for the developing world's billion-plus young people between the ages of 12 and 24? </seg>
<seg id=157> Throughout the developing world, governments urgently need to devise the right mix of investments and policies to encourage their young people to get an education, find work, stay healthy, form families, and exercise citizenship. </seg>
<seg id=158> The payoff is huge if they get it right: accelerated development as economies reap the benefits of a burgeoning working-age population and lower dependency ratios. </seg>
<seg id=159> In East Asia, this "demographic dividend" is believed to have generated more than a quarter of the region's economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=160> Developing countries have already invested heavily in children. </seg>
<seg id=161> Their young people are therefore better-educated and healthier than previous generations. </seg>
<seg id=162> More than 80% of children now attend primary school, up from 50% in 1970, and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10% to 6.5% over the same period. </seg>
<seg id=163> But now governments must go beyond investments in children and begin supporting the new generation of young people. </seg>
<seg id=164> Indeed, even in countries with high primary-school completion rates, many young people do not attend secondary school. </seg>
<seg id=165> Young people account for half of all new HIV infections. </seg>
<seg id=166> And, in the Middle East and North Africa region, about a quarter of all young people are unemployed. </seg>
<seg id=167> These problems raise thorny questions: What prevents more young people from attending secondary school? </seg>
<seg id=168> Is it because they are sometimes close to being illiterate even after primary school, or because it is unaffordable? </seg>
<seg id=169> Why don't more young people learn how to lower the risk of getting HIV/AIDS? </seg>
<seg id=170> Why do businesses in these countries complain of a lack of skilled workers when so many university students are jobless? </seg>
<seg id=171> To build successful youth-friendly policies, governments need to focus on three policy areas: expanding opportunities, enhancing capabilities, and providing second chances for young people. </seg>
<seg id=172> Governments must broaden opportunities for young people by improving access to, and the quality of, health and educational services. </seg>
<seg id=173> We know that the full benefit of primary school is realized only when children go on to secondary school. </seg>
<seg id=174> Yet many young people are ill prepared for secondary school, and places are scarce. </seg>
<seg id=175> Today's employers want highly skilled workers. </seg>
<seg id=176> More than 20% of all firms, in countries as diverse as Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia, and Zambia, rate inadequate skills and education of workers as a major or a severe obstacle. </seg>
<seg id=177> If young people are not to become stuck in dead-end jobs, or end up without jobs at all, they need better education and skills that match those needed by employers. </seg>
<seg id=178> Several countries now facilitate access to secondary schooling, in particular through "conditional cash transfer programs," which offer a stipend to poor families whose children regularly attend school. </seg>
<seg id=179> These programs have successfully increased secondary school enrollment in countries like Mexico, Ecuador, Bangladesh, and Cambodia. </seg>
<seg id=180> For these programs to work, however, children must be ready to enter secondary education. </seg>
<seg id=181> Yet, in Morocco, for example, more than 80% of school children complete primary school, but fewer than 20% have mastered the material. </seg>
<seg id=182> Second, policies should support young people as they strive to make good decisions. </seg>
<seg id=183> Governments cannot substitute for parents or for communities, but they can encourage young people and their families to invest in themselves. </seg>
<seg id=184> Armed with the right information and incentives, young people can make better decisions about their health and education. </seg>
<seg id=185> In Cameroon, Horizon Jeunes, a reproductive health program that targets urban youth, increased young people's knowledge of reproductive health and successfully changed their behavior, with condom use among females increasing from 58% to 76% in the treatment group. </seg>
<seg id=186> Similarly, the rate at which eighth graders from the Dominican Republic entered upper secondary levels increased when they were simply told how much more those who finished high school earned -- an amount they had vastly underestimated. </seg>
<seg id=187> Bangladesh's Female Secondary Stipend Program was successful in helping girls aged 11 to 14 to delay marriage and remain in school. </seg>
<seg id=188> Governments must also begin to offer "second chances" for young people who have fallen behind due to difficult circumstances or poor choices. </seg>
<seg id=189> Such programs must be well designed, targeted, and coordinated to give the right incentives to beneficiaries. </seg>
<seg id=190> For example, sub-Saharan Africa has thousands of young combatants -- 100,000 in Sudan alone -- who hope to reconstruct their lives in peacetime but clearly require skills training and jobs, as well as medical and psychological support. </seg>
<seg id=191> Focusing political will and the efforts of young people themselves to expand opportunities, enhance capabilities, and provide second chances can help countries make the most of today's demographic advantage. </seg>
<seg id=192> Countries can either harness this growth -- and in so doing, transform their development prospects -- or face the risk of an alienated generation embittered by the unfulfilled chance of a better future. </seg>
<seg id=193> Down with Euro-Paternalism </seg>
<seg id=194> Italy's presidency of the European Union bears an enormous responsibility, namely reinvigorating enlargement as the key aspect of the new EU. </seg>
<seg id=195> A good place to start would be to push for a different attitude on accession countries' adoption of the Euro. </seg>
<seg id=196> Indeed, EU institutions' current paternalistic stance towards the accession countries threatens to create a two-tier Europe that will complicate the task of integration. </seg>
<seg id=197> The accession countries have upheld their end of the bargain, achieving a degree of trade integration with EU countries that is even higher than many current members. </seg>
<seg id=198> Three of them--Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--have currency boards or a fixed exchange rate with the Euro, as does Bulgaria, which is expected to enter the EU in 2007. </seg>
<seg id=199> The others have declared for several years their interest in adopting the Euro early on, in some cases unilaterally, even before entry into the EU--a position openly supported by the National Bank of Poland, and less forcefully by the National Bank of Hungary and the Czech National Bank. </seg>
<seg id=200> But, despite their progress in bringing their inflation and interest rates closer to EU levels, many candidate countries fear that with the full opening up to capital flows--a requirement of accession--they will be exposed to the risk of sudden stops in capital flows and currency crises. </seg>
<seg id=201> They have learned the lesson from Latin America and Asia in the 1990's. </seg>
<seg id=202> Adopting the Euro would give them a great way to escape such risks and focus on creating real growth in their economies. </seg>
<seg id=203> But the response from EU institutions, namely the European Central Bank and the European Commission, has been negative: candidate countries were told that they first must spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), where Euro aspirants are expected to prove their policy mettle. </seg>
<seg id=204> Initially, even currency boards were considered unacceptable, although, as is often the case in Europe, exceptions were made: countries with currency boards could keep them after entry into the EU. </seg>
<seg id=205> The opposition of the ECB and the Commission to rapid Euro adoption lacks strong foundations. </seg>
<seg id=206> What should matter for the EU is that the policies of any member state are not harmful to other members. </seg>
<seg id=207> As Leszek Balcerowicz, the Governor of the National Bank of Poland, argues, adoption of the Euro by candidate countries will certainly create benefits for candidate countries, while in the worst case being neutral for current members. </seg>
<seg id=208> Indeed, the combined size of the candidate countries' economies is so small--around 6% of the enlarged EU's GDP--that they cannot possibly exert any significant effect on the Euro. </seg>
<seg id=209> But continuing opposition by EU institutions has led most candidate countries to abandon the idea of adopting the Euro unilaterally or as quickly as possible after entering the Union. </seg>
<seg id=210> Unfortunately, the stubbornness of the ECB and the European Commission is now providing ammunition to populist governments in accession countries that are counting on currency appreciation to escape the fiscal discipline that adopting the Euro would imply. </seg>
<seg id=211> However, such fiscal expansion would probably disqualify a country from entering the Euro any time soon. </seg>
<seg id=212> Indeed, the accession countries that have not implemented a currency board have seen their budget deficits surge--exceeding 9% of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5% in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia--while large capital inflows have kept their currencies under strong pressure to appreciate. </seg>
<seg id=213> This trend exposes candidate countries' real economies to precisely the risk of a capital flow reversal and currency crisis that early Euro adoption was meant to eliminate. </seg>
<seg id=214> It is ironic that the candidate countries are being lectured to by officials at the ECB and the European Commission on the trade-off between nominal and real convergence. </seg>
<seg id=215> The objective of growth for the accession countries is apparently the sole imperative in Brussels; macroeconomic stability can wait. </seg>
<seg id=216> Large budget deficits support growth, but inflation evidently is not a problem. </seg>
<seg id=217> If this line of thought sounds familiar, perhaps it is because it (more or less) recapitulates the foundations of the unsustainable planning system with which the accession countries broke at the beginning of the 1990's. </seg>
<seg id=218> It was, of course, the embrace of rational, market-driven economic policies by the former communist nations that has brought them to the brink of EU membership. </seg>
<seg id=219> So European institutions should abandon their paternalistic approach and take seriously the concerns of accession countries' central bankers about the risks of maintaining their own currencies for a long period during which their economies have to open up completely to capital flows. </seg>
<seg id=220> As it is, the ECB and the European Commission are de facto supporting the positions of populist governments in Eastern Europe that are already spending the funds they hope to get in the future from the EU. </seg>
<seg id=221> It is high time that EU institutions address more seriously the challenges and opportunities posed by enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=222> They can begin by viewing accession countries' early adoption of the Euro more favorably, both for countries with a currency board and for those with floating exchange rates. </seg>
<seg id=223> Blair's EU disaster </seg>
<seg id=224> When voters in France and the Netherlands turned down the proposal for a Constitution for the European Union, the world knew that the European project was in deep trouble. </seg>
<seg id=225> Last week's bruising battle over the medium-term future of the Union's budget has confirmed that verdict with a vengeance. </seg>
<seg id=226> It also brought to a sorry close the UK's six-month presidency of the European Council, confirming Britain's long-standing reputation as the odd-man-out in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=227> The two events are intimately connected. </seg>
<seg id=228> French and Dutch voters did not say why they voted against the planned Constitution. </seg>
<seg id=229> But many commentators believe that they were protesting against what they perceived as the precipitate admission of ten new member states, mainly much poorer countries from Central and Eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id=230> In particular, voters were afraid that their jobs would be lost to hordes of Eastern immigrants, exemplified in the image widely quoted at the time, of the low-cost Polish plumber. </seg>
<seg id=231> The irony, of course, was that most of the 15 old member states had refused to give the new members full and immediate access to the Western job markets. </seg>
<seg id=232> But in any event, it was too late to protest: the ten Eastern states had already been granted membership of the Union. </seg>
<seg id=233> But now the 25 member states must deal with the financial consequences of that enlargement, not just in the overall size of the European Union budget for the next seven years, but in who pays and who benefits. </seg>
<seg id=234> In particular, the central issue is how far the old member states are willing to pay to boost the less developed economies of the new members. </seg>
<seg id=235> In the event, it turned into a three-way battle between Britain, France and the new member states. </seg>
<seg id=236> Traditionally, a large majority of the budget has gone either on agriculture or on the development of backward regions. </seg>
<seg id=237> In practice, this has meant large flows of money either to big agricultural producers, like France, or to poorer member states, like Greece and Portugal. </seg>
<seg id=238> On both counts, the new member states expected to benefit substantially from the EU system. </seg>
<seg id=239> In the past, the big loser from the EU system, in budgetary terms, was the UK; for while agriculture accounted for two thirds of all EU spending, the UK had a small farm sector, and therefore received small farm payments. </seg>
<seg id=240> The British long complained of the unfairness of these rules, especially in view of the fact that the UK was one of the relatively poorer member states; and in 1984, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government demanded, and got, a massive rebate on its net contribution to the EU budget. </seg>
<seg id=241> Today, the situation has changed in three important respects. </seg>
<seg id=242> EU farm policy has started to be reformed, and its share of the EU budget has fallen from over 60% to 40%; Britain has for several years enjoyed significantly faster economic growth than most other member states, so that it is now one of the richer EU countries, even compared with France and Germany; and the new member states are so much poorer than even the poorest of the old members, that they have an unanswerable moral case for a generous share of whatever budget could be negotiated. </seg>
<seg id=243> When negotiations started six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the Presidency of the European Council. </seg>
<seg id=244> Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, electrified the world of European politics by telling the European Parliament that he was a "passionate pro-European". </seg>
<seg id=245> This was a message for which Britain's European friends had long been hoping, and for which they had waited in vain since Blair's election in 1997. </seg>
<seg id=246> Certainly, he had never expressed any such sentiment inside the British Isles during the previous eight years. </seg>
<seg id=247> Since Britain had been one of the most insistent advocates of enlargement of the EU to the candidates from Central and Eastern Europe, one might have expected that the Blair government would have wished to be correspondingly generous to the new-comers in the conduct of the budgetary negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=248> At first, this seemed to be the British government's chosen tactic. </seg>
<seg id=249> Against all expectations, it struck a morally advantageous posture by offering to surrender some part of its budget rebate, but only if the rest of the European Union (i.e. France, in particular) would agree to fundamental reforms of EU farm policy. </seg>
<seg id=250> It took some time before the British came to understand that since President Jacques Chirac is a beleaguered lame-duck President, who will remain in office but not in power until 2007, he is in no position to agree to any such bargain. </seg>
<seg id=251> So when the British came to terms with this harsh reality, they played out the lamentable end-game of their management of the negotiations with small-minded cheese-paring and logic-chopping offers, all designed primarily to safeguard narrow British interests, mainly at the expense of the new member states. </seg>
<seg id=252> It is a sad conclusion to a presidency, launched six-months ago, with Blair's claim that he was a "passionate pro-European". </seg>
<seg id=253> Yet the full text of his speech tells it all. </seg>
<seg id=254> Blair is in favour of Europe; but not this Europe. </seg>
<seg id=255> He wants to be a part of a political Europe; but only if the other member states follow Britain's model of economic and social reform. </seg>
<seg id=256> The problem is that economic and social reform are purely national responsibilities, and do not lie within the competence of the Union; if there is to be economic and social reform in France and Germany, that is a matter exclusively for French and German voters and politicians. </seg>
<seg id=257> It could only be a European matter, if the EU were a real federation. </seg>
<seg id=258> Is Blair a federalist, then? </seg>
<seg id=259> Heavens, no! </seg>
<seg id=260> He is merely an unthinking nationalist, living in terror of the nationalist yellow tabloid press. </seg>
<seg id=261> So why does he say he is a passionate pro-European? </seg>
<seg id=262> Because he has not thought about the question for one moment. </seg>
<seg id=263> Europe's Neo-Liberal Challenge </seg>
<seg id=264> For over 20 years I have argued that Western Europe's high unemployment rates are unsustainable. </seg>
<seg id=265> At the end of the 1970's, monetarists bet that only a transitory and modest increase in unemployment could rein in the creeping -- and trotting -- inflation of the industrial west, and that in retrospect the cost of returning to effective price stability would be judged worthwhile. </seg>
<seg id=266> In Britain and the United States, this monetarist bet turned out well. </seg>
<seg id=267> In Western Europe, it did not. </seg>
<seg id=268> Over the past 25 years in Europe, unemployment rose as monetary policy was tightened and interest rates were raised to fight inflation. </seg>
<seg id=269> But after inflation succumbed, unemployment did not fall -- or not by much. </seg>
<seg id=270> If unemployment was not stuck quite at Great Depression levels, it remained high enough to make long-term joblessness or the fear of long-term joblessness a defining experience. </seg>
<seg id=271> Societies in which the official unemployment rate stands at 10% or more for generations are societies in which government economic management has failed. </seg>
<seg id=272> So, for 20 years it has seemed to me that Western Europe's underlying political equilibrium -- corporatist bargaining and ample social insurance, on the one hand, and tight monetary policies, on the other -- must crack. </seg>
<seg id=273> Twin fears appear to be paralyzing European policymakers. </seg>
<seg id=274> Europe's central bankers fear that their political masters will order them to loosen monetary policy, that the structural reforms needed to free up aggregate supply will not be forthcoming, and that the result will be a return to the inflation of the 1970's. </seg>
<seg id=275> In short, they fear that all of the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain. </seg>
<seg id=276> West European politicians, for their part, fear the opposite outcome. </seg>
<seg id=277> They worry that even after undertaking structural reforms to reduce the attractiveness of unemployment benefits and increase the ability of workers to move to jobs and of firms to move to workers, central bankers will continue to insist on tight money. </seg>
<seg id=278> In short, they fear that, with no expansion of output or employment, the net effect will simply be an increase in poverty. </seg>
<seg id=279> Of course, these fears are accompanied by the hope that structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony, boosting employment and output without raising inflation by much. </seg>
<seg id=280> But the reality is that steps toward looser monetary policies are non-existent -- especially with the fledgling European Central Bank anxious to establish its inflation-fighting credibility -- and that steps toward structural reforms are half-hearted, hesitant, and small. </seg>
<seg id=281> For 20 years, I have been wrong: West European polities have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens from meaningful participation in much of economic life. </seg>
<seg id=282> West European economies have continued to grow -- albeit not as rapidly as they might have -- despite bearing the heavy burden of the unemployed 10% or more of the labor force. </seg>
<seg id=283> Now, though, it looks like I may finally be right -- or at least right to worry, if not to panic. </seg>
<seg id=284> The French rejected the European Union constitution, primarily -- or so it appears -- because further European integration, it is feared, must bring in its wake the huge costs and disruptions of neo-liberalism. </seg>
<seg id=285> It is one thing to back the "European project" when the idea is to bind Germany so tightly to France that never again will anybody think it worthwhile to wage a war over what language is spoken in Alsace-Lorraine. </seg>
<seg id=286> It is another when the European project means that French workers face competition from Polish plumbers, Romanian farmers, and Turkish shop clerks. </seg>
<seg id=287> In Germany, the electorate seems poised to eject Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder out of discontent with his tepid allegiance to the neo-liberal project. </seg>
<seg id=288> The problem is that the electorate will then get four years of rule by a chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose commitment to the neo-liberal project is almost as strong as mine. </seg>
<seg id=289> I think that Germany would be better off in a decade under more neo-liberal policies. </seg>
<seg id=290> But this does not seem to be what the German electorate wants, and this makes the complexion of German politics four years from now incalculable. </seg>
<seg id=291> Coupled with all this is northern European discontent with the central bankers, specifically with the ECB and the euro. </seg>
<seg id=292> It is not that the end of European Monetary Union is on the agenda; it is merely that people have begun thinking about possible low-probability futures in which the end of EMU might be placed on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id=293> That is enough to shake asset prices worldwide. </seg>
<seg id=294> Western Europe's accomplishments since World War II are among the most heartening and impressive success stories in world history. </seg>
<seg id=295> Everyone should want today's undivided Europe to build on these accomplishments, rather than for generations of high unemployment to jeopardize them. </seg>
<seg id=296> But this will require a shift in the ECB's attitude. </seg>
<seg id=297> Europe needs a monetary policy that views aiding employment growth in northern Europe as more important than continental price stability. </seg>
<seg id=298> There will, after all be inflation in southern and eastern Europe -- there must be, for as regions develop and industrialize their terms of trade must improve, and under a monetary union regional inflation is how this can happen. </seg>
<seg id=299> The ECB should not try to balance inflation in the south and east with deflation in the north in order to hit artificial continent-wide targets. </seg>
<seg id=300> Saved by Taxes </seg>
<seg id=301> What do we owe to our great-great-great-grandchildren? </seg>
<seg id=302> What actions are we obligated to take now in order to diminish the risks to our descendants and our planet from the increasing likelihood of global warming and climate change? </seg>
<seg id=303> Almost everyone -- except the likes of ExxonMobil, US Vice President Dick Cheney, and their paid servants and deluded acolytes -- understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, where it acts like a giant blanket, absorbing infrared radiation coming up from below and warming the earth. </seg>
<seg id=304> Likewise, almost everyone understands that while global warming might be a much smaller or larger problem than existing models suggest, this uncertainty is no excuse for inaction. </seg>
<seg id=305> In fact, uncertainty about global climate change should lead us to do more to guard against it than if we knew it would proceed exactly according to the central-case projections. </seg>
<seg id=306> Finally, almost everyone agrees that governments, non-profit institutions, and energy companies should be spending far more to develop technologies that generate non-carbon-emitting power, that remove it from the atmosphere to forests or oceans, and that cool the earth by reflecting more of the sunlight that lands on it. </seg>
<seg id=307> Clearly, the world's rich countries should carry the burden of dealing with climate change over the next generations. </seg>
<seg id=308> After all, they could take an easy, emissions-intensive path to industrialization and wealth. </seg>
<seg id=309> Today, China, India, and other developing countries cannot, and it would be unfair to penalize them for that. </seg>
<seg id=310> So now is the time to build, not disrupt or impede, the international institutions that will manage our response to global climate change in the years ahead. </seg>
<seg id=311> But should we be doing anything else now and in the next decade? </seg>
<seg id=312> Economists like to think of things in terms of prices. </seg>
<seg id=313> And when economists see behavior that has destructive side effects, we like to tax it. </seg>
<seg id=314> Taxation makes individuals feel in their wallets the destruction they are causing. </seg>
<seg id=315> Imposing a tax on those who, say, drive low-mileage SUV's is a way of harnessing humanity's collective intelligence to decide when bad side effects are a reason to alter behavior. </seg>
<seg id=316> But it has to be the right tax. </seg>
<seg id=317> An SUV going ten miles in the city and burning a gallon of gasoline pumps about three kilograms of carbon into the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id=318> Should the extra "global warming" tax be $0.05 a gallon, $0.50 a gallon, or $1.50 a gallon? </seg>
<seg id=319> Our views will change as we learn more, but at the moment the size of the tax hinges on a question of moral philosophy: how much do we believe we owe our distant descendents? </seg>
<seg id=320> The Australian economist John Quiggin has an illuminating discussion on his website ( </seg>
<seg id=321> On the other hand, critics point out that the world today is poor: average annual GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is roughly $7,000. </seg>
<seg id=322> We expect improved technology and its spread to make the world of 2100, at a 2% annual growth rate, much richer: $50,000 per capita of year-2006 purchasing power. </seg>
<seg id=323> So the critics argue that we need the marginal $70 per capita today much more than the richer people of 2100 will need the $500 that they would gain from being spared the effects of global climate change. </seg>
<seg id=324> But what the critics often don't say is that the same logic applies to the world today. </seg>
<seg id=325> Average annual per capita incomes in the US, Japan, and Western Europe are currently around $40,000, and less than $6,000 for the poorer half of the world's population. </seg>
<seg id=326> The same logic that says we need our $70 more than the people of 2100 need an extra $500 dictates that we should tax the world's rich more, as long as each extra $500 in first-world taxes generates as little as an extra $70 in poor countries per capita incomes. </seg>
<seg id=327> In short, if the world's rich are stingy today toward our much richer descendants, and if we want to leave our environmental mess to them to deal with, we should be lavish toward the world's poor. </seg>
<seg id=328> Likewise, if we are stingy today toward the world's poor, we should be lavish toward our descendents. </seg>
<seg id=329> At least, that is what we should do, if our actions are based on some moral principle, rather than that of Leonid Brezhnev: what we have, we hold. </seg>
<seg id=330> Taking Drug Safety Seriously </seg>
<seg id=331> Health hazards -- nuclear reactors, guns, and contaminated foods -- surround all of us, so governments take an active role in limiting these hazards through regulations, which, in many cases, are very successful. </seg>
<seg id=332> But the situation is far different concerning the safety of prescription drugs. </seg>
<seg id=333> Indeed, as far as protecting the public is concerned, drug safety is the regulator's neglected stepchild. </seg>
<seg id=334> The magnitude of the problem is huge. </seg>
<seg id=335> In the United States alone, it is estimated that every year up to 100,000 patients die due to serious adverse drug reactions (ADR's). </seg>
<seg id=336> If true, drug-induced death would qualify as the fourth or fifth leading cause of death (depending on which mortality estimates are used). </seg>
<seg id=337> Moreover, the direct annual hospital costs attributable to ADR's run into the billions of dollars, and this does not include all the suffering that ADR's cause that does not lead to hospitalization (or death). </seg>
<seg id=338> The difficulties in determining cause and effect must be acknowledged. </seg>
<seg id=339> Whether a patient's death or hospitalization is due to a particular drug, the underlying illness, or a combination of the two can be hard to determine. </seg>
<seg id=340> But this makes drug safety all the more important. </seg>
<seg id=341> Inherent to drug safety is the fact that all drugs, in addition to their benefits, cause harm in certain patients. </seg>
<seg id=342> Drug approval and use requires a careful weighing of desirable and undesirable effects. </seg>
<seg id=343> These judgments vary, depending on whether they are made by a drug company, which stands to benefit from sales, or a patient at risk of suffering a serious adverse effect. </seg>
<seg id=344> Incomplete knowledge complicates this assessment. </seg>
<seg id=345> The rush to get new drugs to market often leads to inadequate safety documentation. </seg>
<seg id=346> More than half of all approved drugs produce a serious adverse reaction that is not known at the time of regulatory approval. </seg>
<seg id=347> For example, when the new class of painkillers called Cox-2 inhibitors was introduced, regulators, physicians, and patients were unaware that these drugs could cause heart attacks and strokes. </seg>
<seg id=348> Tens of thousands of innocent patients -- perhaps more -- suffered such ADR's before the first two drugs of this class were withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id=349> Proper and complete documentation of harmful drug effects is difficult. </seg>
<seg id=350> Spontaneous reporting rates to regulatory agencies are low -- approximately 1% -- and ongoing monitoring is passive in many countries. </seg>
<seg id=351> There is also a general reluctance to report unfavorable drug effects. </seg>
<seg id=352> Physicians may feel guilty and fear litigation, drug companies worry about the threat to corporate profits and regulatory agencies must face the question: "Why was the drug approved in the first place?" </seg>
<seg id=353> It is especially difficult to attribute an adverse reaction to a drug if the medical event is common in the user's age group or in the condition being treated. </seg>
<seg id=354> Because the risk of heart attacks is high in older people, many of whom have arthritic pain requiring treatment with painkillers, it took six years to link Cox-2 inhibitors to a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of heart attacks. </seg>
<seg id=355> A recent Harris Survey in the US concluded that 60% of adults are either not confident at all or not very confident that drug makers will publicly and in a timely manner disclose data on their products' adverse effects. </seg>
<seg id=356> Their skepticism is hardly groundless: internal documents obtained in recent lawsuits reveal that drug companies often fail to submit critical safety information to regulatory agencies, as required by law, and fail to communicate such information to physicians and patients. </seg>
<seg id=357> One problem is that the consequences for neglecting drug safety are non-existing or minimal. </seg>
<seg id=358> The time has come to get serious: </seg>
<seg id=359> Â· Citizens and government must make drug safety a priority and commit adequate resources to fixing the problems; </seg>
<seg id=360> Â· Penalties for drug companies' failure to report and communicate safety information must be increased dramatically if they are to serve as effective deterrents; </seg>
<seg id=361> Â· Regulatory agencies need enforcement authority so that stricter rules can be implemented; </seg>
<seg id=362> Â· The drug-safety problem must be seen as a systemic failure. </seg>
<seg id=363> It is unfair to blame clinicians for serious ADR's, particularly in the absence of complete safety information. </seg>
<seg id=364> Fixing the problem requires full cooperation from clinicians, but this requires ending their fear of litigation. </seg>
<seg id=365> This approach works well in the airline industry: pilots reporting near misses are not penalized; </seg>
<seg id=366> Â· Patients need to be better informed about the risks of prescription drugs and more involved in detection and reporting. </seg>
<seg id=367> Package inserts in fine print are useless; </seg>
<seg id=368> Â· Monitoring of ADR's must be more pro-active. </seg>
<seg id=369> This requires more funding, which should come from the main beneficiary of drug sales -- the pharmaceutical industry -- just as oversight of aviation safety is funded by the airlines. </seg>
<seg id=370> Above all, the success of any comprehensive effort to improve drug safety hinges upon establishing an independent office of drug safety to advocate, coordinate, and provide direction to the regulatory agenda. </seg>
<seg id=371> Such an office exists in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id=372> Other governments should follow this model in order to fulfill their neglected role as guardian of public health. </seg>
<seg id=373> The Virtual Enemy </seg>
<seg id=374> Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September, 2001, yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about how terrorist cells operate, and what their weaknesses are. </seg>
<seg id=375> The Bush administration still uses the phrase "war on terror" and behaves as though it really is a war, the ordinary kind where one government fights another. </seg>
<seg id=376> Yet after five years of military exertions, strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse. </seg>
<seg id=377> It is time to understand the new, emerging model of conflict. </seg>
<seg id=378> In order to make the "war" paradigm fit, the Bush administration alludes to al-Qaeda as a centrally directed enemy. </seg>
<seg id=379> In fact, there is now no master planner or funder of terrorist activities. </seg>
<seg id=380> The Madrid, London, and Bali attacks, as well as several thwarted operations in the United States and Britain, were all characterized by their dispersed organization. </seg>
<seg id=381> Independently generated plots emerged and used ad hoc resources, often within the target country. </seg>
<seg id=382> Those small operations also lacked a common internal design. </seg>
<seg id=383> Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell, even from person to person. </seg>
<seg id=384> Individuals can be involved for profit and power, or for political and religious reasons, while others participate for hate or thrills. </seg>
<seg id=385> Moreover, there are vast differences in terms of risks, rewards, and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain, or jumps from cell to cell. </seg>
<seg id=386> Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that, in this case, has no head. </seg>
<seg id=387> The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context. </seg>
<seg id=388> Terrorism is a violent version of an "agile virtual enterprise." </seg>
<seg id=389> A virtual enterprise is any small group that self-assembles into an organization that is just large enough to accomplish the collective intention. </seg>
<seg id=390> Virtual enterprises are unusually innovative, and, in the business sector, they are possibly the only system that can build a one-off product well. </seg>
<seg id=391> A conspicuous example already exists in the movie production industry. </seg>
<seg id=392> In fact, they are probably the commercial model of the future. </seg>
<seg id=393> The benefits of virtual enterprises stem from their lightness over stability. </seg>
<seg id=394> At present, most of the price of any product supports the huge, inefficient organization that assembled it. </seg>
<seg id=395> Nearly all the creativity and problem solving occurs in small companies and is later "integrated" by mega-corporations, which have an expensive and vulnerable infrastructure, and keep most of the profit. </seg>
<seg id=396> This model is the current basis of the business world, just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy. </seg>
<seg id=397> When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself. </seg>
<seg id=398> The small suppliers actually provide you with 80% of the value and innovation but only receive 20% of the reward. </seg>
<seg id=399> Ironically, extensive research into alternative models was funded through the US Department of Defense, which, as the world's largest buyer of complex machinery, wanted better, cheaper and more tailored goods. </seg>
<seg id=400> The research noted the conditions and triggers needed to facilitate the self-assembly of small opportunistic groups and enable them to act like large companies. </seg>
<seg id=401> Unfortunately, the research program was cancelled before its findings could be applied in the business world, almost certainly because it threatened large companies. </seg>
<seg id=402> It is often forgotten that US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller, more agile force, using some of these same insights. </seg>
<seg id=403> But the planning for the Iraq invasion, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than advised, suggests a poor understanding of distributed systems. </seg>
<seg id=404> While the forces were deployed for a flexible entry and withdrawal, the Bush administration ended up using them for an old-fashioned occupation. </seg>
<seg id=405> Terrorists have been better at capitalizing on models of distributed operation. </seg>
<seg id=406> Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies. </seg>
<seg id=407> The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public. </seg>
<seg id=408> These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly sophisticated in the adoption of modern management techniques. </seg>
<seg id=409> Their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management: how to nurture and support self-organizing cells. </seg>
<seg id=410> Perhaps the first lesson for Western policymakers is that virtual enterprises run on a culture of trust. </seg>
<seg id=411> Some kinds of trust can be based on an artificial notion of "not us" rather than on real values and direct experience. </seg>
<seg id=412> That is why the Bush administration's actions actually strengthen the virtual terrorist enterprise dynamic. </seg>
<seg id=413> Bush's "us and them" rhetoric clearly defines an "other" and positions it as a cohesive enemy. </seg>
<seg id=414> His "war" approach is making it easier for Islamist terrorists to view the West as an equally united and malevolent force. </seg>
<seg id=415> In the future, the virtual enterprise model will shape how business is conducted, wars will be fought and probably how government services will be administered. </seg>
<seg id=416> It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production, implying faster innovation and economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=417> However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how these structures operate, they stand no chance of combating the agile terrorist enterprise. </seg>
<seg id=418> Expansion is Solidarity </seg>
<seg id=419> Nowadays it is often alleged that the European Union's sense of solidarity was put in jeopardy, if not shattered outright, by its enlargement to take in the countries of central and eastern Europe. </seg>
<seg id=420> As Bulgaria and Romania come closer to membership, and with accession talks with Turkey and Croatia set to begin, it has become increasingly important to challenge that view. </seg>
<seg id=421> The values and interests of the EU's newest member states coincide in most ways with those of the 15 earlier members. </seg>
<seg id=422> It is, of course, true that enlargement has fundamentally changed the Union and given rise to new problems and policy concerns. </seg>
<seg id=423> But the new member states in central and eastern Europe are deeply embedded in the economic, social, and cultural development of our Continent. </seg>
<seg id=424> The ties that bind us together were frayed by forty years of Soviet domination, but this did not fundamentally change these states' European character. </seg>
<seg id=425> My country, Poland, has always had deep cultural ties to other European countries, especially France. </seg>
<seg id=426> We participated in all the major developments in European music, literature, and film (think of Andrzej Wajda's films from the Solidarity era, such as "Danton," which were French co-productions). </seg>
<seg id=427> Even in sport, East Europeans have long been integrated with the rest of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=428> Indeed, before World War I the German national football team consisted entirely of players with Polish names. </seg>
<seg id=429> But, above all, there is a deep sense among Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and others, that they are Europeans. </seg>
<seg id=430> This is the very meaning of the word "solidarity," as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary: "unity resulting from feelings and sympathies." </seg>
<seg id=431> Solidarity, in the sense of unity resulting from common interests, also clearly exists within both the original EU-15 and the enlarged Union. </seg>
<seg id=432> The exceptions prove the rule. </seg>
<seg id=433> The EU's disunity over the war in Iraq should not overshadow its member states' agreement on almost all other great questions of international affairs. </seg>
<seg id=434> In economic matters, disagreements on, say, a single EU regulation should not be allowed to mask the fact that no member state, new or old, has ever contested the internal market. </seg>
<seg id=435> Finally, the enlargement process itself is also manifestly a symbol of European social, civic, and cultural unity. </seg>
<seg id=436> The fact that it provoked debate and dispute does not detract from the conviction shared by old and new member states that they had an obligation to rebuild the Continent after 40 years of division. </seg>
<seg id=437> But there are concerns that, if not fundamentally divisive, are worrying. </seg>
<seg id=438> Should we fear the fact that Europe is no longer a purely Jewish/Christian and white continent? </seg>
<seg id=439> Will EU citizens whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu or Islam, Sikh or Buddhist, be able to identify with "European" values and culture? </seg>
<seg id=440> Will they be able to feel European, like the Poles or the Czechs have always felt? </seg>
<seg id=441> These questions apply most pointedly -- indeed, they cannot be avoided -- in the case of Turkey's possible accession to the EU. </seg>
<seg id=442> Is European integration animated by respect for another's values? </seg>
<seg id=443> Is it about sharing them or about contributing to them? </seg>
<seg id=444> These are obviously knotty questions. </seg>
<seg id=445> They are particularly difficult if we see culture as the cement of Europe's future. </seg>
<seg id=446> All European countries probably believed at the outset that non-European newcomers could be assimilated in the same way that Polish immigrants were assimilated into Germany's Ruhr region in the nineteenth century. </seg>
<seg id=447> That this has not happened, at least on a large scale, is not to say that it cannot happen at all. </seg>
<seg id=448> Look at the growing number of prominent citizens of Turkish origin in Germany. </seg>
<seg id=449> Consider the many second generation Indian and Pakistani Britons who are now seen in business suits carrying laptop computers and flying around the world. </seg>
<seg id=450> But Europeans must admit that these individuals represent a small minority. </seg>
<seg id=451> Many immigrant groups in Europe find themselves flung back on their own communities by the impossibility of social and economic integration. </seg>
<seg id=452> The constant threat of terrorism has made this isolation even more dramatic for the Europe's Islamic populations. </seg>
<seg id=453> The EU cannot simply proclaim "solidarity" as a core value and then do nothing to foster it among those who feel marginalized. </seg>
<seg id=454> They, too, must be allowed to feel those ties of "unity resulting from feelings and sympathy." </seg>
<seg id=455> European solidarity cannot and will not survive their neglect. </seg>
<seg id=456> After Kyoto </seg>
<seg id=457> The Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far. </seg>
<seg id=458> Now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations, including large emitters, in conversations about what to do after the treaty's expiration in 2012. </seg>
<seg id=459> This is exactly what the European Commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be discussed by the European Council next March. </seg>
<seg id=460> While the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries -- 5.2% between 2008-2012 relative to 1990 levels, with varying targets for individual countries -- real progress can be made in sustaining development efforts and preserving our planet. </seg>
<seg id=461> But first, all countries must integrate climate concerns into policy planning, and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and transport. </seg>
<seg id=462> In other words, we must act in accordance with the recognition that climate change and its effects on people in both rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security. </seg>
<seg id=463> At the end of the day, the long-term approach is likely to include a rules-based system, an incentives system, and investments in technology change. </seg>
<seg id=464> Increasingly, adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding. </seg>
<seg id=465> Dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive, but complementary. </seg>
<seg id=466> Looking ahead to the post-Kyoto world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change. </seg>
<seg id=467> Nations could set the more ambitious goal of limiting the long-term change in the earth's temperature, and then assign emissions rights among countries in such a way that will eventually limit temperature increases to an acceptable level. </seg>
<seg id=468> This would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies -- a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-private partnerships. </seg>
<seg id=469> Up to now, with only 15% of the world's population, rich countries have been responsible for more than 75% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and thus most of the environmental damage. </seg>
<seg id=470> However, it is the developing countries -- and thus the world's poor -- who are most vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id=471> It is unrealistic to ask poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies, to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change. </seg>
<seg id=472> Working with partners, the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change. </seg>
<seg id=473> To date, over $1 billion dollars in Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants, together with about $8 billion in co-financing, have been committed to programs related to climate change. </seg>
<seg id=474> While the regulatory mechanisms of both Kyoto and the European Trading Scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future. </seg>
<seg id=475> Without a regulatory framework beyond 2012, the window of opportunity for initiating project-based transactions will close by 2006/2007. </seg>
<seg id=476> Given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions, project developers have only a few years to act before carbon payments cease to make a meaningful contribution to project finance in the current context. </seg>
<seg id=477> Developing infrastructure projects is a long process that requires 3-7 years from identification, through licensing, financing, and construction, and finally to the first certification of carbon emission reductions. </seg>
<seg id=478> Therefore, projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007. </seg>
<seg id=479> The World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool, and in facilitating private-sector participation in the market. </seg>
<seg id=480> The Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities. </seg>
<seg id=481> But, without a commitment by governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain, and the private sector -- vital to the market's success -- is unlikely to expand its participation in a meaningful and sustained way. </seg>
<seg id=482> According to a recent World Bank-supported survey of companies interested in carbon finance, only one in five respondents declared that they were interested in buying post-2012 emissions reductions. </seg>
<seg id=483> Now is the chance to look forward and enlist the global community -- with no exclusions, although with differentiated responsibilities -- in the pursuit of a more secure world, one that avoids the dire risks of environmental degradation and social conflict implied by inaction. </seg>
<seg id=484> State of the Art, or Art of the State? </seg>
<seg id=485> September is traditionally the time when opera companies and orchestras return to their home cities from Aix, Salzburg, Tanglewood, and countless other summer festivals. </seg>
<seg id=486> This rentrÃ©e is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of worries about how classical music is financed. </seg>
<seg id=487> American symphonic life is Euro-centric in almost every respect except for its funding. </seg>
<seg id=488> Whereas Americans depend upon tax-deductible private donations and box office receipts to finance live classical music, Europeans prefer direct government support for the arts. </seg>
<seg id=489> Ironically, while arts advocates in the United States have long argued for adoption of the "European model" -- which has produced a rich and varied artistic life for Europeans -- Europe is being forced to change its system of support to one that depends more on private money and the box office. </seg>
<seg id=490> Unfortunately, Europe's system of direct government financial support is falling victim to Europe's slow economic growth and budget deficits. </seg>
<seg id=491> Particularly for those countries that have adopted the euro, government spending on the arts will be constrained for some time by the requirement that fiscal deficits be kept to 3% of GDP. </seg>
<seg id=492> The resulting pressure on Europe's performing arts institutions is causing concern at various different levels. </seg>
<seg id=493> Traditionally, Europe's social democracies have preferred allocating scarce goods and services like concerts and operas by queues (financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low) rather than by willingness to pay. </seg>
<seg id=494> Now, this will change. </seg>
<seg id=495> Performing arts advocates in Europe point to the US where, among other things, music directors of even major orchestras are now expected to fully participate in fundraising activities and be active in the local community on the orchestras behalf. </seg>
<seg id=496> The same thing, they fear, will happen in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=497> Some conductors, not wanting to carry a tin cup as they wave their batons, have rejected important posts in the US for this reason, feeling that it would interfere with their art. </seg>
<seg id=498> Daniel Barenboim is rumored to have left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands that were being made of him. </seg>
<seg id=499> But US experience shows that getting artistic leaders like orchestra music directors to participate in fundraising need not be bad for the artistic side of the job. </seg>
<seg id=500> Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, for example, has combined effective fundraising and artistic leadership to propel the San Francisco Symphony to the top rank of US orchestras. </seg>
<seg id=501> It also should be reassuring to Europeans who are concerned that greater reliance on private money necessarily means conservative programming that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most adventuresome repertoires in the US. </seg>
<seg id=502> If the audience has progressive tastes, private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible. </seg>
<seg id=503> A corollary is that public money makes it possible for adventuresome programming even if audience tastes run to the conservative side. </seg>
<seg id=504> This is one reason performing artists in Europe like public money -- it liberates them from a diet of only Beethoven and Mozart. </seg>
<seg id=505> Moreover, the audience may come to appreciate an adventuresome repertoire the more it becomes exposed to it. </seg>
<seg id=506> Of course, with reduced public spending on the performing arts, not only will there be greater reliance on private money, but ticket prices will have to rise as well. </seg>
<seg id=507> Some argue that this is a bad thing, because they prefer queuing to the price system and fear that higher prices will compromise future audiences by excluding young people. </seg>
<seg id=508> But cheap prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for youth. </seg>
<seg id=509> First, youth may not take advantage of cheap tickets to the extent that they are not interested in going to hear live classical music at any price. </seg>
<seg id=510> Second, even if they do want to go, they may not be able to get seats, which often are not available because subscriptions stay in the same hands year after year. </seg>
<seg id=511> What good are cheap prices, which serve mainly to subsidize the same subscription holders, if there are no seats? </seg>
<seg id=512> If a taste for classical music is to be subsidized, some more targeted subsidies should be preferred to cheap prices. </seg>
<seg id=513> The best way to bring youth to the performing arts is through education. </seg>
<seg id=514> Because American orchestras can't count on schools or government to provide the basic music education necessary to ensure a continuing audience for classical music, some orchestras are doing it themselves with private money. </seg>
<seg id=515> In San Francisco, for example, the Symphony runs a $23 million privately funded project -- called Keeping Score -- that includes a national public television series, radio shows, interactive music learning, and school music programs. </seg>
<seg id=516> This type of innovative program is relevant for European as well as American orchestras. </seg>
<seg id=517> The problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id=518> So does poor music education in state schools. </seg>
<seg id=519> If orchestras don't look after their own futures, they may well not have one to look after. </seg>
<seg id=520> Law and Order, Russian-Style </seg>
<seg id=521> Around the world, people worry that political freedom is disappearing in Vladimir Putin's Russia. </seg>
<seg id=522> Indeed, about the only people who are unconcerned about creeping authoritarianism in Russia are the Russians themselves. </seg>
<seg id=523> Russians seem to care less about political freedom than they do about social welfare - pensions, domestic violence, children's rights, or police brutality. </seg>
<seg id=524> In fact, most Russians are indifferent to the government's efforts to curtail press freedom and limit the right to protest. </seg>
<seg id=525> Such apathy makes my task as Russia's ombudsman, an office charged by the State Duma (parliament) with protecting political rights in Russia, difficult, if not impossible. </seg>
<seg id=526> The ombudsman acts as a bridge between the authorities and the people, seeking to resolve conflicts that arise between state bodies and citizens. </seg>
<seg id=527> My office is open not only to Russian citizens, but to foreigners and stateless people who feel their political rights have been compromised. </seg>
<seg id=528> The standards we apply are not only those contained in Russia's constitution, but also international legal principles and human rights norms, even if they sometimes contradict our constitution. </seg>
<seg id=529> For example, as ombudsman, I was opposed to curtailing the right of Russians to jury trials. </seg>
<seg id=530> Those who wanted to limit the use of juries supposedly feared a risk to state security in some instances. </seg>
<seg id=531> My office worked closely with the state to assure that, in most cases, juries are used. </seg>
<seg id=532> Similarly, my office defended the liberal weekly newspaper Novoe Vremya (New Times), which was being pressured by Moscow's city government on the pretext of a commercial dispute about a lease. </seg>
<seg id=533> That fight is not over, but after my intervention, Moscow's authorities must take into account the public's negative attitude to their effort to quash this publication. </seg>
<seg id=534> Of course, Russia provides far more headline-grabbling examples of political and human rights problems, such as the low-grade war in Chechnya or the Yukos affair. </seg>
<seg id=535> My office pays maximum attention to Chechnya, although this is not easy to do from Moscow. </seg>
<seg id=536> Indeed, I could spend all my time in Chechnya, but Russia has 89 regions with countless human rights issues to address. </seg>
<seg id=537> This is why I suggested to Putin that Chechnya have its own regional rights ombudsman who would spend all his time there. </seg>
<seg id=538> The new Chechen authorities seem to welcome this prospect. </seg>
<seg id=539> As to the Yukos affair, my office cannot intervene in any legal process until it is completed. </seg>
<seg id=540> Former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky's lawyers have sent a complaint to the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg. </seg>
<seg id=541> If Khodorkovsky disagrees with the final decision of the Russian courts, he will undoubtedly appeal to that court. </seg>
<seg id=542> Only then will I be able to express an opinion. </seg>
<seg id=543> Many observers nonetheless insist that those under criminal investigation should be released on bail instead of being kept in prison. </seg>
<seg id=544> Others say that this is not an option in Khodorkovsky's case - being very rich, he could easily jump bail and flee abroad. </seg>
<seg id=545> In fact, this is precisely what happened with other figures accused in the Yukos case. </seg>
<seg id=546> All of these serious human rights questions expose the fact that Russia's legal institutions remains half-formed. </seg>
<seg id=547> For example, the Duma has taken far too long to enact a law on lobbying, which in most developed democracies clearly defines what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behavior. </seg>
<seg id=548> Khodorkovsky might not be in as much trouble if such precise laws existed. </seg>
<seg id=549> Unformed laws are directly related to unformed ideas. </seg>
<seg id=550> Human rights in Russia are often violated simply because people are not aware that they have some particular right. </seg>
<seg id=551> The most important strategic goal of my office is that people learn how to defend their rights better, and to make the authorities take the complaints of ordinary Russians into consideration. </seg>
<seg id=552> Sadly, most bureaucrats still look upon human rights values with disdain. </seg>
<seg id=553> But the real problem for my office is neither ignorance nor legal infirmity, it is that in an under-developed legal system such as Russia's, my authority is mostly personal, and requires help from the mass media. </seg>
<seg id=554> Because concepts of human rights remain rudimentary, the best that can be hoped for is that awareness will slowly begin to take hold. </seg>
<seg id=555> My tactical goal is thus to raise the public profile of the ombudsman's office, in order to win more respect and recognition by both citizens and the state. </seg>
<seg id=556> This will be all but impossible without cooperation with non-governmental human rights organizations in Russia. </seg>
<seg id=557> Indeed, I view one of my tasks as being to facilitate contacts between these groups and the authorities. </seg>
<seg id=558> The government's response to these efforts will be an important indicator of whether and to what extent Putin's administration intends to include human and political rights within its so-called "dictatorship of law." </seg>
<seg id=559> The Revolutionary Conservative Pope </seg>
<seg id=560> Twenty-five years ago, Poland's people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow, as Pope. </seg>
<seg id=561> Some were frightened, others wept with joy. </seg>
<seg id=562> Here, said a prominent writer, was "Poland's second baptism." </seg>
<seg id=563> But even in our euphoria, we did not expect how much the new Pope would change not only Poland, but the world. </seg>
<seg id=564> His first return visit to his native country soon afterwards showed to all the world the new Pope's power. </seg>
<seg id=565> Communist police disappeared from the main streets of Warsaw, yet the streets became models of order. </seg>
<seg id=566> After decades of disempowerment, Poles suddenly regained their capacity for self-determination. </seg>
<seg id=567> In saying aloud that "there can be no just Europe without an independent Poland on its map," the Pope effectively swept away the unjust postwar settlement that had subjugated Poland to Soviet power. </seg>
<seg id=568> Then, in Auschwitz, the Pope said: "I speak in the name of everyone whose rights go unrecognized and violated anywhere in the world, I speak because I am bound, we are all bound, by truth." </seg>
<seg id=569> On that spot, that Golgotha of modern times, he called the Poles, who remembered dear ones gassed to death in Auschwitz's crematoria as well as those frozen into glass in Siberia's concentration camps, to a brotherhood devoted to struggle against even justified hatred and revenge. </seg>
<seg id=570> Some see in the Pope the person responsible for a religious revival; others see a man of peace. </seg>
<seg id=571> Some see a defender of the poor, others a critic of liberation theology. </seg>
<seg id=572> For the people of Poland, John Paul II, by making human rights the central subject of his teaching, will forever be the man who gave us courage and hope, who restored our historical identity. </seg>
<seg id=573> Indeed, the central feature of the first decade of the Pope's reign was his struggle against dictatorship--Communist dictatorship in particular. </seg>
<seg id=574> The strategy formulated by the Pope for the Catholic Church, and his ability to mobilize millions of believers in its cause, meant that no one could ever again repeat Stalin's question: "How many divisions does the Pope have?" </seg>
<seg id=575> John Paul II demonstrated that moral force was a weapon potent enough to undo Yalta's division of the world. </seg>
<seg id=576> Perhaps in part because of their strong anticommunist stance, the Polish Church and John Paul II are often branded as "conservative." </seg>
<seg id=577> The accusation is meant to suggest that the Church cannot live comfortably with a pluralist democracy. </seg>
<seg id=578> To be sure, in the struggle against Communism, the Polish Church was, indeed, conservative--and thank God for that! </seg>
<seg id=579> It was conservative in its absolute fidelity to evangelical values, to the truth of faith, to its historical identity. </seg>
<seg id=580> For the system of official atheism and legalized mendacity, the Church was a living rebuke. </seg>
<seg id=581> With Communism gone, however, the problem confronted by John Paul II and his Church today is this: in what language can evangelical values be articulated in a world where evil is not incarnated in a political system but is diffused in individual souls? </seg>
<seg id=582> What is the Pope's message for the postcommunist world he helped create? </seg>
<seg id=583> John Paul II undoubtedly keeps a distance from liberal economic ideas and the liberal state, which he often charges with permissiveness and moral relativism. </seg>
<seg id=584> A critique of individualism in the name of collective values occurs frequently in the Pope's pronouncements. </seg>
<seg id=585> He sees the failings of liberalism as particularly pernicious in postcommunist countries. </seg>
<seg id=586> The market economy, despite its practical achievements, seems to him oftentimes to lack a heart and a human face. </seg>
<seg id=587> He sees the market as favoring entrepreneurship over human solidarity. </seg>
<seg id=588> So John Paul II is no enthusiast of modern Western civilization, with its divorce from the world of values, and he contrasts with it the moral sensitivity of societies with fresh memories of decades of dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id=589> Like Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Pope tends to believe that it was above all in resistance to totalitarianism that man could become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilization. </seg>
<seg id=590> I confess that I view the heritage of Communism with more skepticism. </seg>
<seg id=591> Totalitarian pressure did, indeed, form exceptional people such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, people for whom religious faith bought freedom from mendacity and solitude. </seg>
<seg id=592> But it did the same for Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel, who defended their supreme values with reference to, and in the language of, lay humanism. </seg>
<seg id=593> For most people, however, life under totalitarian dictatorship was not ennobling; it was, rather, a daily immersion in lies, spiritual depravity, and material corruption. </seg>
<seg id=594> This is why postcommunist societies do not demonstrate any nobility or disinterestedness that seriously contrasts with the West. </seg>
<seg id=595> Communism's defeat left a huge black hole in communities' souls, which is now being filled with nationalism, bigotry, and Western consumerism. </seg>
<seg id=596> But John Paul II's basic intuition is correct: the postcommunist world--East and West--is in spiritual crisis, and the Pope wants to shake it into realizing the importance of higher values. </seg>
<seg id=597> Indeed, by his words and example, the Pope disrupts the world: it wants to live in wealth and comfort; he reminds us that we must also live in dignity. </seg>
<seg id=598> In the end, John Paul II does not fit neatly into any category and often represents a meeting of opposites: rejection of compromise with ecumenism, toughness with warmth, intellectual openness with insistence on theological orthodoxy. </seg>
<seg id=599> He is a conservative who loves freedom and a "peacemonger" who condemns injustice, but who reminds us that mercy is more important than justice. </seg>
<seg id=600> In this, he personifies the paradox that is Christianity: unbreakable and lasting principles joined by understanding and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id=601> Twenty-five years after John Paul II left Poland for Rome, we Poles remain grateful to him for having helped us regain our freedom. </seg>
<seg id=602> It is good that John Paul II is among us. </seg>
<seg id=603> A world where everything changes needs a guardian of what remains the same. </seg>
<seg id=604> The Intervention Syndrome </seg>
<seg id=605> Kosovo is often held up as a test case for the concept of "humanitarian" intervention. </seg>
<seg id=606> But as Iraq spirals into chaos, diplomats and leaders everywhere are again asking themselves if it is ever appropriate for alliances of nations or the international community as a whole to intervene when a sovereign country appears unable or unwilling to defend its citizens from genocide, war crimes, or ethnic cleansing. </seg>
<seg id=607> At the center of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the "responsibility to protect." </seg>
<seg id=608> As the United Nations-appointed Ombudsperson in Kosovo for the past five years, I have had the unique opportunity to observe the aftereffects of that doctrine following NATO's intervention in the former Yugoslavia in 1999. </seg>
<seg id=609> Kosovo has subsequently become an international experiment in society building, led by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). </seg>
<seg id=610> Experiment is the right word here. </seg>
<seg id=611> Indeed, Kosovo has become a Petri dish for international intervention. </seg>
<seg id=612> Having lived and worked long enough in Kosovo to see the outcome so far, I contend that such experiments require further research. </seg>
<seg id=613> Clearly, the need for international intervention in crises is often time-specific and a fairly swift response is frequently required. </seg>
<seg id=614> However, apart from military factors, where such intervention is being considered, it is of vital importance to focus international policy discussion on the rapid deployment of a linked civilian and security presence. </seg>
<seg id=615> This is especially true where human suffering is caused by communal conflict, as was the case in Kosovo. </seg>
<seg id=616> An immediate deployment of an adequate civilian and security presence during the months immediately after the end of the 1999 NATO bombing campaign might well have provided suitable protective mechanisms against the backlash that allowed victims to become victimizers. </seg>
<seg id=617> NATO peacekeeping troops were not directed to stop the abductions, disappearances, retaliation killings, and massive property destruction by groups of ethnic Albanians, which led to a vast reverse ethnic cleansing of the non-Albanian (mainly Serb) population. </seg>
<seg id=618> As a result of this neglect, a noxious social and political residue pervades today's Kosovo. </seg>
<seg id=619> Instead of cooling communal conflict, interethnic hatred remains as heated as ever. </seg>
<seg id=620> In addition to the lack of an adequate civilian and security presence to reassure every community of its safety, the overall lack of legal mechanisms to deliver swift justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention created additional tension. </seg>
<seg id=621> So pervasive is this tension, in fact, that any chance of even beginning the much-needed reconciliation process must now be pushed far into the future. </seg>
<seg id=622> Similarly, in Kosovo the international community has devoted little time to helping former combatants contemplate their collective responsibility for atrocities, no matter how direct or indirect their personal involvement. </seg>
<seg id=623> Without such an effort, attempting to improve the situation is like building a house on a sand dune. </seg>
<seg id=624> This lack of foresight about and planning for the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous to the people who have ostensibly been "saved"; it is counterproductive. </seg>
<seg id=625> Unless a humanitarian intervention is structured in such a way that it guarantees basic security, the underlying antagonisms that inspired the intervention in the first place will merely be reinforced, not diminished. </seg>
<seg id=626> So, six years after NATO's intervention, Kosovo seems as far from stability and social peace as ever. </seg>
<seg id=627> Despite the frequent assurances of UN authorities that Kosovo is on a path toward reconciliation and true home rule, NATO officials indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province in order to "guarantee that the political process will be concluded successfully." </seg>
<seg id=628> This brings me to another key point: a workable exit strategy is just as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention as the entry strategy. </seg>
<seg id=629> If an international intervention is to have any credible chance of success, clear criteria for what constitutes "success" are needed from the start. </seg>
<seg id=630> Only such clarity can allow for a proper end to international actors' engagement. </seg>
<seg id=631> In Kosovo, such clarity is and has been absent; as a result, NATO and the UN have no clear idea about when and how both should leave. </seg>
<seg id=632> Someone once rightly said that it is easy to bomb, but much harder to build; it is relatively easy to defeat a regime militarily, but it is far more difficult to create a solid, sustainable, civil society in its place. </seg>
<seg id=633> The UN General Assembly should keep this in mind as it starts to codify the doctrine of the "responsibility to protect." </seg>
<seg id=634> Central Europe's Fractious Right </seg>
<seg id=635> Is Eastern Europe's political pendulum about to run down? </seg>
<seg id=636> Across Central Europe since 1989, elections have oscillated between right and left. </seg>
<seg id=637> Is Hungary's slick young prime minister, Viktor Orban, poised to end all that? </seg>
<seg id=638> A ruthless program to absorb his political rivals on the right has helped Orban's FIDESZ party become nearly equal in size to his Socialist rivals on the left. </seg>
<seg id=639> Moreover, infighting among the Socialists has dented one of their biggest political advantages: the hard-headed discipline and political professionalism inherited from their Communist days. </seg>
<seg id=640> Premier Orban's semi-successful efforts to unify the right under the banner of FIDESZ are unique among Eastern Europe's fractured and fractious rightist parties. </seg>
<seg id=641> Since Communism's fall, center right parties in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia have suffered from disunity and a lack of vision. </seg>
<seg id=642> Despite the fact the region is still recovering from decades of communist mismanagement, the political right's fragmentation helped the political left, in some cases represented by former Communists, to win democratic elections regularly. </seg>
<seg id=643> Some problems faced by Central Europe's right are similar to those the political right faces elsewhere in Europe, where social democratic parties expropriated many formerly liberal ideas to seize a monopoly of the political center. </seg>
<seg id=644> In Central Europe this effect has been amplified by the fact that, regardless of ideological leanings, rulings parties have had to privatize the economy and, under pressure from the European Union, introduce reform measures that would, in a classical Western system, usually be undertaken by the political right. </seg>
<seg id=645> Leftist parties in various Central European countries, indeed, have often turned out to be more successful in reforming because they, paradoxically, have greater legitimacy in this respect. </seg>
<seg id=646> Many people believe that the Socialists would not privatize the economy or slash welfare systems if such measures were not absolutely necessary. </seg>
<seg id=647> The most serious problem of Central Europe's political right is a lack of identity. </seg>
<seg id=648> Although right-of-center politicians in Central European countries formally embrace traditional ideologies, for example, liberalism or conservatism, their electorates, unfamiliar with Western political philosophies, do not always understand the real meaning of those terms. </seg>
<seg id=649> In various surveys, significant segments of Central European electorates describe themselves as ``rightist,'' but years of communist paternalism pushed the region's political center of gravity firmly to the left. </seg>
<seg id=650> A person may describe him or herself as, for example, a liberal, yet at same time demand that the government continue subsidizing energy, education, or housing. </seg>
<seg id=651> Under the communist regimes, ideologies became totally instrumental. </seg>
<seg id=652> As during those years, many people now formally accept ideological labels but identify with them only as long as such an allegiance to a specific political current has tangible short-term benefits for them. </seg>
<seg id=653> One consequence of this cynical treatment of political ideologies is the wild swings in voters' preferences seen in various Central European countries. </seg>
<seg id=654> The problem of identity is made even worse by the fact that most Central European nations, where nation-building was retarded by Communism, easily succumb to nationalist sentiments that in turn are misused by some politicians. </seg>
<seg id=655> Although such politicians often describe themselves as ``rightist,'' their real policies, such as, for, example, those of former Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, are in fact demagogic populist or authoritarian. </seg>
<seg id=656> The situation of the political right in each Central European country is also influenced by experiences that are rooted in history and tradition. </seg>
<seg id=657> Political developments in Czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of communism set the Czech Republic and Slovakia apart from both Poland and Hungary. </seg>
<seg id=658> While both the Polish and Hungarian communist parties experienced internal liberalization that allowed relatively large semi-official zones of activity outside communist control, Czechoslovakia after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 became a rigid neo-Stalinist regime. </seg>
<seg id=659> When the communist regimes collapsed in 1989, the communist parties of Poland and Hungary transformed themselves into credible democratic-left parties that became formidable opponents of the newly emerging political right. </seg>
<seg id=660> No strong social democratic party in Czechoslovakia could emerge from the rigid Czechoslovak Communist Party. </seg>
<seg id=661> In the absence of a credible democratic left party, Czech center-right politicians had the upper hand, and were relatively united, until 1997. </seg>
<seg id=662> However, lack of a strong opposition corrupted the political right, which splintered into various groupings that cannot find a common language. </seg>
<seg id=663> In Slovakia, where nationalist sentiments were an important political factor after 1989, the political spectrum has not yet coalesced along standard right-left political axis. </seg>
<seg id=664> The main political battles occur between nationalist/populist forces, whose outlook have in essence been undemocratic, and forces that struggle for standard democracy. </seg>
<seg id=665> The threat of return to power by Meciar forced all democrats, leftist or rightist, into one camp. </seg>
<seg id=666> Even in this situation the political right has been quarrelsome, creating space for Meciar's possible return to power. </seg>
<seg id=667> Hungary's political right has suffered mainly from differences between conservative and populist forces on the one hand, and traditional, mainly urban, liberals on the other. </seg>
<seg id=668> Various rightist parties failed to decide whether the modus operandi on the political right should be traditional Western ideologies or a Hungarian brand of nationalist conservatism and populism. </seg>
<seg id=669> Although the current governing coalition, consisting of conservatives and populists, has been successful, the real reckoning for Hungary's right may still be yet to come. </seg>
<seg id=670> Poland's right poses the most difficult case. </seg>
<seg id=671> Its problems originate in the communist era, when a trade union movement, which under normal circumstances should stand to the political left, became the main anti-communist opposition. </seg>
<seg id=672> As a result, various political groups associated with the Solidarity trade union movement have, since Communism's fall, aspired to represent the political right, confusing the terms of political discourse. </seg>
<seg id=673> Christian-democratic parties, associated with the Catholic Church, and the liberals have been to some extent marginalized. </seg>
<seg id=674> The confusion has been made complete by the existence of relatively strong nationalist and populist parties that use the numerous Polish farmers as their electoral base. </seg>
<seg id=675> As in other postcommunist countries, the main beneficiary of such a lack of unity has been the democratic left. </seg>
<seg id=676> Wall-to-Wall Wal-Mart? </seg>
<seg id=677> Do you want to know which video clip will soon be scaring the daylights out of policymakers throughout the world? </seg>
<seg id=678> In a scenario that looks uncannily like the spread of a global pandemic, the economist Thomas Holmes has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the spread of Wal-Mart stores throughout the United States. </seg>
<seg id=679> Starting at the epicenter in Bentonville, Arkansas, where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962, giant boxy Wal-Mart stores have now multiplied to the point where the average American lives less than seven kilometers from an outlet. </seg>
<seg id=680> Interestingly, the video shows how the stores spread out like petals of a flower, ever thickening and expanding. </seg>
<seg id=681> Rather than jumping out to the coasts -- 80% of all Americans live within 80 kilometers of the Pacific or Atlantic oceans -- Wal-Marts have spread organically through an ever-expanding supply chain. </seg>
<seg id=682> Even though each new store takes away business from Wal-Mart stores established nearby, ever-improving supply efficiencies help maintain the chain's overall growth. </seg>
<seg id=683> Love them or hate them, what is undeniable is that Wal-Mart is the quintessential example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization. </seg>
<seg id=684> Consumers pay significantly less than at traditional outlets. </seg>
<seg id=685> For example, economists estimate that the food section of Wal-Mart charges 25% less than a typical large supermarket chain. </seg>
<seg id=686> The differences in price for many other consumer goods is even larger. </seg>
<seg id=687> Consider the following stunning fact: together with a few sister "big box" stores (Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot), Wal-Mart accounts for roughly 50% of America's much vaunted productivity growth edge over Europe during the last decade. </seg>
<seg id=688> Fifty percent! </seg>
<seg id=689> Similar advances in wholesaling supply chains account for another 25%! </seg>
<seg id=690> The notion that Americans have gotten better at everything while other rich countries have stood still is thus wildly misleading. </seg>
<seg id=691> The US productivity miracle and the emergence of Wal-Mart-style retailing are virtually synonymous. </seg>
<seg id=692> I have nothing against big box stores. </seg>
<seg id=693> They are an enormous boon to low-income consumers, partly compensating for the tepid wage growth that many of them have suffered during the past two decades. </seg>
<seg id=694> And I don't agree with friends of mine who turn their noses down at Wal-Mart stores, and claim never to have visited one. </seg>
<seg id=695> As a consumer, I think big-box stores are great. </seg>
<seg id=696> They have certainly been great for America's trading partners; Wal-Mart alone accounts for over 10% of all US imports from China. </seg>
<seg id=697> But I do have some reservations about the Wal-Mart model as a blueprint for global growth. </seg>
<seg id=698> First, there is the matter of its effect on low-wage workers and smaller-scale retailers. </seg>
<seg id=699> While completely legal, studies suggest that Wal-Mart's labor policies exploit regulatory loopholes that, for example, allow it to sidestep the burden of healthcare costs for many workers (Wal-Mart provides healthcare coverage to less than half its workers). </seg>
<seg id=700> And the entry of big-box stores into a community crushes long-established retailers, often traumatically transforming their character. </seg>
<seg id=701> Yes, to some extent, such is the price of progress. </seg>
<seg id=702> But the loss of aesthetics and community is not easily captured in simple income and price statistics. </seg>
<seg id=703> Big-box stores are not exactly attractive -- hence their name. </seg>
<seg id=704> If they continue their explosive growth over the next 20 years, will Americans someday come to regard their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure to adopt region-wide blueprints for balanced growth? </seg>
<seg id=705> Indeed, many Europeans, and others, will view Holmes's video simulation of Wal-Mart's spread as a horror film. </seg>
<seg id=706> The French may have invented the hyper mart -- the forerunner of the big-box store -- but they never intended to let their growth go unchecked. </seg>
<seg id=707> The big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to exploit some of the efficiency gains embodied by the Wal-Mart model without being overrun by it. </seg>
<seg id=708> For Americans, there is the additional question of what to do when the big-box store phenomenon has run its course. </seg>
<seg id=709> If so much of the US productivity edge really amounts to letting Wal-Mart and its big-box cousins run amok, what will happen after this source of growth tapers off? </seg>
<seg id=710> The US economy has many other strengths, including its superior financial system and leading position in high-tech capital goods, but the fact remains that America's advantage in these areas has so far not been nearly as striking as the Wal-Mart phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id=711> It is curious how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years simply because it has done so for the past ten years. </seg>
<seg id=712> Wal-Mart and its ilk are a central feature of the modern era of globalization. </seg>
<seg id=713> They are not quite the pandemic that their explosive growth pattern resembles, but nor is their emergence completely benign. </seg>
<seg id=714> Those who would aim to emulate US productivity trends must come to grips with how they feel about big-box stores sprouting across their countryside's, driving down wages and plowing under smaller-scale retailers. </seg>
<seg id=715> Americans, in turn, must think about where the proper balance lies between aesthetics, community, and low prices. </seg>
<seg id=716> Embracing Science </seg>
<seg id=717> Long-term economic progress comes mainly from the invention and spread of improved technologies. </seg>
<seg id=718> The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine, and India's escape from famine by increased farm yields -- the so-called "Green Revolution." </seg>
<seg id=719> Today's era of globalization emerged with the spread of computers and the Internet. </seg>
<seg id=720> Thus, when we seek solutions to some of the world's toughest problems, they, too, are likely to be found, at least in part, in new technologies that can resolve old and seemingly intractable problems. </seg>
<seg id=721> Consider poverty in Africa. </seg>
<seg id=722> Every conceivable explanation has been given, usually focusing on what Africans do wrong. </seg>
<seg id=723> But a visit to Africa's villages makes clear that the problems have more to do with the struggle for survival under difficult physical conditions than with any special problems that are unique to African societies. </seg>
<seg id=724> Africa's farmers produce roughly one-third or less food per hectare of farmland than their counterparts around the world, resulting in massive hunger, which is exacerbated by a heavy disease burden. </seg>
<seg id=725> Malaria poses a unique challenge, owing in large part to Africa's mosquito species, which are especially adept at transmitting the disease. </seg>
<seg id=726> Other tropical parasitic diseases imply similarly extraordinary burdens in Africa. </seg>
<seg id=727> Add the practical difficulties of broken-down roads and few cars and trucks, and economic isolation follows. </seg>
<seg id=728> So the challenges of survival are enormous. </seg>
<seg id=729> Yet practical solutions are at hand, because simple and low-cost technologies can address specific problems. </seg>
<seg id=730> Low farm yields can be addressed through improved seed varieties specially adapted for African conditions, combined with technologies for replenishing soil and managing water. </seg>
<seg id=731> Malaria can be controlled through newly designed long-lasting mosquito nets and a new generation of effective medicines. </seg>
<seg id=732> Other tropical diseases also can be controlled, and practical technologies for safe drinking water can dramatically reduce diarrheal diseases. </seg>
<seg id=733> Mobile phones, local wireless Internet, and more paved roads could do much to break the economic isolation of Africa's villages. </seg>
<seg id=734> Donor countries incessantly ask Africans to change their trade policies, government institutions, public administration, and more. </seg>
<seg id=735> Some of these changes are important, but the role of the rich countries has been lopsided, focusing on everything except how to finance and introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems. </seg>
<seg id=736> The rich countries' mistakes wouldn't matter if African countries had enough money to adopt the needed technologies on their own, but Africa is so poor that it must get financial help to escape poverty. </seg>
<seg id=737> The development challenges in Africa are just one example of how tough societal problems can be addressed by the design and spread of improved technologies. </seg>
<seg id=738> The same will be true of how the world best addresses manmade climate change -- another of those seemingly intractable global problems. </seg>
<seg id=739> Right now, rich countries are changing the world's climate by emitting billions of tons of carbon dioxide each year from the use of coal, oil, and natural gas. </seg>
<seg id=740> In future years, China and India also will make massive contributions to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id=741> Yet no country, rich or poor, is keen to cut its energy use, owing to concern that to do so would threaten jobs, incomes, and economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=742> New technologies will provide a key part of the solution. </seg>
<seg id=743> Already, "hybrid" automobiles, which combine gasoline and battery power, can roughly double fuel efficiency, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by half. </seg>
<seg id=744> Similarly, engineers have developed ways to capture the carbon dioxide that results from burning coal in power plants and store it safely underground. </seg>
<seg id=745> This new technology, called "carbon capture and sequestration," can cut by 80% the carbon dioxide emitted during the production of electricity. </seg>
<seg id=746> The costs appear relatively small. </seg>
<seg id=747> Consider also the depletion of ocean fisheries through over-fishing. </seg>
<seg id=748> Global demand for fish consumption is growing, and so, too, is the global capacity to catch fish, driving some species to the point of extinction. </seg>
<seg id=749> Improved aquaculture, in which fish are grown at manmade fishponds and reservoirs is still far from being a perfect technology, mainly for environmental reasons, yet it is enormously promising. </seg>
<seg id=750> On a recent visit to Africa, a senior agricultural scientist said that in today's world, the scientist is closer than ever before to the farmer, but farther away than ever from the policymakers. </seg>
<seg id=751> Politicians don't understand science, and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers in addressing major issues. </seg>
<seg id=752> Everything is viewed as politics and votes, not as technical problems requiring technological expertise, which is why Africa's poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than to ecological challenges. </seg>
<seg id=753> It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can save the day. </seg>
<seg id=754> After all, technological advance also requires good governance, market forces, effective universities, and more. </seg>
<seg id=755> Politics will still play its role. </seg>
<seg id=756> Nevertheless, it's time to recognize that governments are ill-equipped to understand the sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities facing the world, and that new ways are needed to ensure that science and technology are given the prominence needed to address a wide range of increasingly urgent global problems. </seg>
<seg id=757> Now is the time for every major international agency and national government to assume responsibility for gaining the scientific and technological expertise that they will need in the twenty-first century. </seg>
<seg id=758> Getting Latin America Unstuck </seg>
<seg id=759> One of the world economy's biggest puzzles is Latin America's poor performance. </seg>
<seg id=760> Since the early 1980's, Latin America has been stuck, with per capita incomes growing slowly (if at all) in most of the region, and with one big crisis following another. </seg>
<seg id=761> Many policies have been tried, especially trade liberalization, privatization of inefficient state enterprises, and budgetary reforms. </seg>
<seg id=762> Yet something is holding Latin America back. </seg>
<seg id=763> The lack of vigorous growth is all the more bewildering in view of Latin America's many advantages and social successes. </seg>
<seg id=764> Natural resources are plentiful, with vast amounts of fertile land. </seg>
<seg id=765> Health conditions are reasonably good, and all Latin American countries have made headway against illiteracy, with most reaching 90% adult literacy or higher. </seg>
<seg id=766> Moreover, fertility rates have fallen sharply, to a point where populations in many countries will probably level off in coming decades. </seg>
<seg id=767> Women's status has improved, and girls enjoy equal access to education, with even higher enrollment rates than boys in many countries. </seg>
<seg id=768> Latin America may be known for its "macho" culture, but women increasingly participate in the labor force and attain prominent political and social positions. </seg>
<seg id=769> Latin America boasts still other long-term advantages. </seg>
<seg id=770> Most people live near the coasts, with good access to international trade, and most live in cities - another advantage for growth. </seg>
<seg id=771> Indeed, the region is not poor by international standards, but rather stuck in the middle-income range between the world's poorest places and the high-income countries of North America, Europe, and East Asia. </seg>
<seg id=772> What, then, accounts for the puzzling lack of real growth over the past 25 years? </seg>
<seg id=773> I blame two unsolved, but solvable, problems. </seg>
<seg id=774> The first has been around for centuries: the social divisions that trace their origins back to the European conquest over Native Americans in the sixteenth century. </seg>
<seg id=775> More than most places, Latin America was born in violent conquest. </seg>
<seg id=776> Europeans subdued Amerindian populations and also brought in massive numbers of slaves from Africa, especially to the Caribbean basin and Brazil. </seg>
<seg id=777> Societies became racially and ethnically complex, as the European, Amerindian, and African populations intermarried, but the long-term trend of European dominance, indigenous and Afro-American subservience, and entrenched poverty became a scar on Latin American societies. </seg>
<seg id=778> Even today, income inequality in Latin America is among the highest in the world, reflecting the old patterns of ethnic and racial division. </seg>
<seg id=779> Income inequality casts a long shadow. </seg>
<seg id=780> The rich have long fought against taxation needed to increase investment in the education and health of the poor, perpetuating deep social divisions and leaving many people without the health and skills that global competitiveness requires. </seg>
<seg id=781> The situation today is improving in some places - such as Brazil - which augurs well for the future. </seg>
<seg id=782> In other places - for example, Guatemala and parts of the Andean region - social divisions remain fraught with violence and distrust. </seg>
<seg id=783> Beyond this, a basic failure of economic strategy has been largely overlooked, one that is reflected in a major difference between public policy discussions in Latin America and Asia. </seg>
<seg id=784> In Asia, public debate is about technology: how can Asia catch up? </seg>
<seg id=785> Asian governments relentlessly act to raise the scientific and technological capacities of their economies. </seg>
<seg id=786> In Latin America, the global technological revolution is much less discussed, and national policies to promote science and technology are rarely given prominence. </seg>
<seg id=787> The result is that Latin America has failed to benefit adequately from the global technological revolutions. </seg>
<seg id=788> Asian developing countries are now producers of computers, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and software. </seg>
<seg id=789> By contrast, even Latin America's star performer, Chile, remains largely a resource-based export economy, with a heavy concentration in copper and agricultural exports. </seg>
<seg id=790> These sectors are technologically sophisticated, but form a narrow base for long-term development. </seg>
<seg id=791> The situation is far from hopeless. </seg>
<seg id=792> Brazil has demonstrated the ability to be a technological export power. </seg>
<seg id=793> It has succeeded, notably, in exporting airplanes and many consumer durable goods. </seg>
<seg id=794> Mexico, too, has begun to mobilize significant technological prowess. </seg>
<seg id=795> Argentina, Chile, and other countries could become high-tech agricultural producers, in the forefront of agro-biotechnology for example, if they put their minds to it. </seg>
<seg id=796> Still, Latin American countries have not yet tried to foster a technological revolution, certainly not with the focus, skill, commitment, and financing that Asian countries have shown. </seg>
<seg id=797> Such a push could play a major role in jump-starting economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=798> Such a policy would entail committing to a major increase in spending on research and development, as Asian developing countries have done. </seg>
<seg id=799> Latin American countries should aim to increase spending to around 2% of GNP (from 0.5% currently), partly through public support for laboratories and universities and partly through incentives for private-sector R&D. They should roll out the red carpet for high-tech multinational firms, just as Asia has done. </seg>
<seg id=800> They should also increase their focus on scientific and technological training and encourage a higher proportion of students to go on to university education. </seg>
<seg id=801> Government stipends for tuition and for new and enlarged universities can play a big role, as can investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities. </seg>
<seg id=802> The social agenda and the technology agenda are not independent of each other. </seg>
<seg id=803> Both call upon Latin American societies to invest more in their people, so that Latin Americans can join the cutting edge of global productivity. </seg>
<seg id=804> If these investments reach all parts of Latin America, rich and poor, the region's prospects will brighten enormously. </seg>
<seg id=805> Are Housing Prices a House of Cards? </seg>
<seg id=806> The first big city to boom was London, starting around 1996. </seg>
<seg id=807> Boom mentality spread to Los Angeles, New York, and Sydney around 1997, to Paris in 1998, to Miami, Moscow, and Shanghai in 2001, and Vancouver around 2002. </seg>
<seg id=808> These and other cities have been booming pretty much ever since; prices in most are up at least 50% in real terms since 2000. </seg>
<seg id=809> This has been a big windfall to homeowners, but has hurt anyone planning to buy. </seg>
<seg id=810> Now growth in home prices is weakening in some of these cities. </seg>
<seg id=811> The rate of price growth in London and New York slowed sharply over the past year, to only about a 1% real increase in the second quarter of 2004. </seg>
<seg id=812> In Sydney, home prices actually fell in the second quarter. </seg>
<seg id=813> Has the boom ended? </seg>
<seg id=814> Will no other cities benefit? </seg>
<seg id=815> Worse still, could the mood in housing markets soon lead prices in downward? </seg>
<seg id=816> No one predicted this boom, so predicting its end is risky. </seg>
<seg id=817> Housing prices have shown tremendous upward momentum in the face of previous warnings that the party is over. </seg>
<seg id=818> Any prediction concerning the boom's end requires understanding why it occurred in so many places. </seg>
<seg id=819> Surprisingly, there is no well-received explanation, because this boom's ultimate causes are mostly psychological. </seg>
<seg id=820> Economists would rather talk about interest rates or unemployment statistics - factors that are concrete and knowable. </seg>
<seg id=821> Of course, these indicators do have a legitimate role to play in explaining housing markets, but they are simply not adequate to account for the recent booms. </seg>
<seg id=822> Three psychological causes stand out: first, a change in people's perceptions about the source of value in a changing world economy; second, increasing public faith in "glamour" cities with international name recognition; and third, the plain giddy dynamics of speculative bubbles. </seg>
<seg id=823> Each factor deserves greater attention if we are to understand current housing market conditions and discern future price trends. </seg>
<seg id=824> First, the world economy does look more chaotic than it did a decade ago. </seg>
<seg id=825> The crash in equity prices since 2000 in most countries has made financial assets look less secure, spurring a "flight to quality" - in this case, housing. </seg>
<seg id=826> Moreover, terrorism is now viewed as a problem for everyone, with major tragedies in Indonesia, Spain, and Russia. </seg>
<seg id=827> People feel safest investing in their homes, and there is little reason to expect imminent change. </seg>
<seg id=828> Fear and upward momentum in home prices go together. </seg>
<seg id=829> Second, the public's faith in glamorous international cities has increased with the explosive growth in global communications due to the Internet and the cell phone. </seg>
<seg id=830> Just as people increasingly admire international celebrities, so they believe that world famous centers of business, technology, and culture - whose names are household words to people everywhere - are uniquely valuable. </seg>
<seg id=831> As with fear of terrorism and suspicion of equities, geographical celebrity appears resilient, if not self-reinforcing: the more famous New York, Paris, and London get, the more glamorous they become. </seg>
<seg id=832> Third, and no less important, is the speculative contagion that underlies any bubble. </seg>
<seg id=833> The current boom has seen contagion within markets and across markets, as rising prices fuel popular excitement - and hence further price increases - in the same city, and then in other cities, even on the other side of the globe. </seg>
<seg id=834> People in Shanghai may not talk about London home prices, but Shanghai's opinion leaders know what is happening in London, and the boom there makes it seem plausible that there should be a boom in Shanghai, too. </seg>
<seg id=835> In contrast to the other two psychological causes, speculative contagion has a natural end. </seg>
<seg id=836> A speculative bubble, sustaining itself solely by reaction to price increases, cannot go on forever. </seg>
<seg id=837> So, where does this leave us? </seg>
<seg id=838> Two of the three psychological causes suggest continued upward momentum in housing prices, while the third suggests that the momentum will come to an end some day, but does not pinpoint when. </seg>
<seg id=839> I am betting that some high-flying glamour cities will continue to see decelerating growth in home prices - and eventually decreases. </seg>
<seg id=840> Historically, housing prices have shown a lot of momentum, and prices in all these cities are still going up at a brisk rate, though usually somewhat slower than a year or more ago. </seg>
<seg id=841> Based on extrapolation of growth trends, it looks safe to predict that prices will go up substantially in most of these places for another year or more, even as the rate of increase continues to decline. </seg>
<seg id=842> The psychological factors are more important for longer-term forecasts, beyond a year, where momentum no longer plays an important role. </seg>
<seg id=843> At this point, there is likely to be some downward instability in prices, because enthusiasm for investing in houses is likely to wane in line with declining price growth. </seg>
<seg id=844> Prices in glamour cities are likely to drop sharply the next time there is a serious recession, or if the local economy suffers a severe shock, or if interest rates rise too fast. </seg>
<seg id=845> Then, contagion within and across markets can work in a downward direction, propelling prices lower for years. </seg>
<seg id=846> Water for All </seg>
<seg id=847> This month, water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id=848> It is an opportune moment: while much of the world's attention has been fixed on issues of energy supply and security, hundreds of millions of people in the developing world continue to see the supply and security of fresh water as equally, if not more, important. </seg>
<seg id=849> Surveys undertaken by the World Bank in developing countries show that, when poor people are asked to name the three most important concerns they face, "good health" is always mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=850> And a key determinant of whether they will have good health or not is access to clean water. </seg>
<seg id=851> More than a billion people around the world today do not. </seg>
<seg id=852> As a result, they are increasingly vulnerable to poor health. </seg>
<seg id=853> The World Bank estimates that by 2035, as many as three billion people, almost all of them in developing countries, could live under conditions of severe water stress, especially if they happen to live in Africa, the Middle East, or South Asia. </seg>
<seg id=854> This will cause obvious hardship, but it will also hold back the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty. </seg>
<seg id=855> In Latin America, about 15% of the population -- roughly 76 million people -- do not have access to safe water, and 116 million people do not have access to sanitation services. </seg>
<seg id=856> The figures are worse in Africa and parts of Asia. </seg>
<seg id=857> This is a situation that few people in rich countries face. </seg>
<seg id=858> Generally, these countries' citizens enjoy services that provide for all water needs, from drinking to irrigation to sanitation. </seg>
<seg id=859> In addition, other water-related issues, such as the risks posed by flooding, have been reduced to manageable levels. </seg>
<seg id=860> Rich industrial countries have invested early and heavily in water infrastructure, institutions, and management capacities. </seg>
<seg id=861> The result, beyond the health benefits for all, has been a proven record of economic growth; one only has to look at investment in hydropower to see the positive impact of water management projects on many economies. </seg>
<seg id=862> Granted, rich countries have a certain advantage: they benefit from generally moderate climates, with regular rainfall and relatively low risks of drought and flooding. </seg>
<seg id=863> Even so, they are not immune to water-related disasters, as Hurricane Katrina's destruction of New Orleans taught us. </seg>
<seg id=864> But the impact of such events on poor countries is much greater. </seg>
<seg id=865> Extreme rainfall variations, floods, and droughts can have huge social and economic effects and result in the large-scale loss of life. </seg>
<seg id=866> The Gulf coast of Mexico and Central American countries has repeatedly experienced such tragedies, with poor communities the most vulnerable and the least able to cope. </seg>
<seg id=867> Ethiopia and Yemen are equally stark examples. </seg>
<seg id=868> Ethiopia's development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains, so high rainfall variation, together with lack of infrastructure, has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty. </seg>
<seg id=869> A single drought can cut growth potential by 10% over an extended period. </seg>
<seg id=870> Yemen, for its part, has no perennial surface water; its citizens depend entirely on rainfall, groundwater, and flash flooding. </seg>
<seg id=871> To move forward, developing countries need new water infrastructure and better management. </seg>
<seg id=872> Any approach must be tailored to the circumstances of each country and the needs of its people, but there is no fundamental constraint to designing water development investments that ensure that local communities and the environment gain tangible and early benefits. </seg>
<seg id=873> In some countries, new water infrastructure may mean canals, pumping stations, and levees. </seg>
<seg id=874> Still others might need deeper reservoirs, more modern filtration plants, or improved water transport schemes. </seg>
<seg id=875> These can all potentially be designed to improve and expand water supplies for power generation, irrigation, and household and industrial use, while providing security against droughts and protection from floods. </seg>
<seg id=876> The key to successful increased investment in water infrastructure is an equally increased investment in water institutions. </seg>
<seg id=877> Badly managed infrastructure will do little to improve peoples' health or support economic growth, so water development and water management must go hand in hand. </seg>
<seg id=878> Water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions, good governance, great attention to the environment, and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits. </seg>
<seg id=879> A water investment policy that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and offers basic water security for all will require customized planning and an effective partnership of donor countries, developing country governments, the private sector, and local communities. </seg>
<seg id=880> Delegates to the World Water Forum will have ample opportunity to forge and/or strengthen these partnerships. </seg>
<seg id=881> If they succeed, the rewards for the world's poor will be immense. </seg>
<seg id=882> Germany's Five Shocks </seg>
<seg id=883> Over the last decade, Germany has been the slowest growing economy in the European Union, and Europe has been the slowest growing continent in the world. </seg>
<seg id=884> From 1995 to 2005, Germany will have grown by only 14.6%, while the old EU on average will have grown by 24%, the US by 39.9%, and the world economy by 45.6%. </seg>
<seg id=885> Why has Germany performed so badly? </seg>
<seg id=886> One theory, endorsed by the head of Germany's ruling Social Democratic Party, Franz MÃ¼ntefering, is that Germany is already where the others still want to be. </seg>
<seg id=887> Slow German growth, he maintains, is a sign of natural convergence. </seg>
<seg id=888> But this theory is not convincing. </seg>
<seg id=889> Germany has recently been overtaken in terms of per capita income by several EU countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, and France, and is still growing more slowly than all of them. </seg>
<seg id=890> Another, more plausible theory is that over the past fifteen years there have been various external challenges or shocks that have hit the country simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id=891> Rigid as it was, with an extensive welfare system and an over-regulated labor market, Germany was unable to react to these shocks and ran into trouble. </seg>
<seg id=892> This theory recalls that of the British historian Arnold Toynbee, according to which empires collapse because they are unable to react to external challenges. </seg>
<seg id=893> The first shock was intensified globalization, which brought a lot of new low-wage competition. </seg>
<seg id=894> Although globalization is a gradual process, it gained momentum when China decided to play the game. </seg>
<seg id=895> China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan was not easy to deal with, either. </seg>
<seg id=896> German precision instruments and optical equipment, for example, lost their competitive edge when Japan entered the game. </seg>
<seg id=897> The second shock was EU integration, including the northern and southern enlargements. </seg>
<seg id=898> The dismantling of the EU's internal borders boosted each country's market size and brought about the predicted economies of scale. </seg>
<seg id=899> But this helped Europe's small countries more than the big ones, and it implied more competition for Germany, Europe's biggest economy. </seg>
<seg id=900> Think of Nokia, the mobile phone maker. </seg>
<seg id=901> Due to the economies of scale that the common market made possible, Nokia was able to exploit its inventions fully, while Germany's Siemens recently decided to give up on the mobile phone market. </seg>
<seg id=902> The third shock was the euro, which has induced a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in some countries had been five to seven percentage points above the German level. </seg>
<seg id=903> Freed from exchange-rate risk, international investors no longer demanded a risk premium from these countries and were willing to provide funds to all of them under the same favorable conditions that previously had been reserved for Germany. </seg>
<seg id=904> This is good for Europe, because it helps improve the allocation of capital and stimulates growth by transporting German savings to the remote and previously disadvantaged regions of the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id=905> But it is of doubtful benefit to German workers who also would have liked to cooperate with that capital. </seg>
<seg id=906> The fourth shock was eastern EU enlargement, which has brought extraordinary chances for trade and investment in the east, but has also brought massive low-wage competition. </seg>
<seg id=907> On average, wage costs in the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004 are only 14% of the West German level. </seg>
<seg id=908> Low-wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and off-shoring activities that have kept German firms competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor. </seg>
<seg id=909> As neither Germany's unions nor its welfare state would accept falling wages, the result was higher unemployment and slower growth. </seg>
<seg id=910> The fifth shock was German unification, which is a failure in economic terms. </seg>
<seg id=911> GDP per working-age person in East Germany had been 61% of the West German level in 1996, but it is now only 59%. </seg>
<seg id=912> The slow growth of the eastern part of the country has pulled down the Germany-wide average, while the enormous demand for public funds in the east has increased public debt. </seg>
<seg id=913> The weak fiscal position has in turn undermined investors' confidence, with obvious implications for economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=914> All five shocks constitute historical developments that are good for the world as a whole, but problematic for Germany. </seg>
<seg id=915> In order for the country to meet the challenges and to continue to grow, it would have to make its labor markets flexible. </seg>
<seg id=916> Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new international environment can German workers become competitive again, so that the country returns to a higher employment level, exploiting its human capital up to the capacity constraint. </seg>
<seg id=917> The new government that voters will most likely elect in September will be confronted with the difficult task of confronting Germans with reality and pushing through the necessary reforms. </seg>
<seg id=918> Only then will we know whether Germany can meet the Toynbeean challenge it is facing. </seg>
<seg id=919> Lessons from the Tsunami </seg>
<seg id=920> There are many lessons that emerge from the tsunami that brought such devastation and loss of life to Asia. </seg>
<seg id=921> It demonstrated the power of globalization, as television brought vivid pictures of the destruction to homes around the world. </seg>
<seg id=922> Indeed, it is at times like this that the world truly does seem like a global village. </seg>
<seg id=923> Of course, it seemed to take somewhat longer for news of the extent of the disaster to reach the Crawford, Texas, ranch of President Bush. </seg>
<seg id=924> But, in the end, he decided to interrupt his vacation and offer amounts of aid that were successively revised upwards, in a global competition which promised to benefit those who were desperate for help. </seg>
<seg id=925> America's aid still appeared niggardly when compared with the amounts offered by countries with a fraction of America's economic wealth. </seg>
<seg id=926> Lightly populated Australia offered more than twice America's assistance, Japan promised almost 50% more, and Europe pledged more than five times as much. </seg>
<seg id=927> This led many observers to reflect on the fact that the world's richest country was in general the most miserly in foreign assistance -- all the more so in comparison to the amount it spends on war and defense. </seg>
<seg id=928> The disaster was international, so it was appropriate that the United Nations take the lead in coordinating the relief effort. </seg>
<seg id=929> Unfortunately, in an effort that was widely seen as another attempt to undermine multilateralism, the US tried to lead a "core group" driving the assistance program, ignoring ongoing efforts within the region and at the UN. </seg>
<seg id=930> Whatever America's motive, it later wisely decided to join the UN effort. </seg>
<seg id=931> The Bush administration's face-saving rhetoric that it had rushed to push together the core group in the absence of other efforts was quietly let to pass. </seg>
<seg id=932> The response of some countries within the region was truly impressive, showing how far they had come in establishing efficient and effective governments. </seg>
<seg id=933> Myriad details were addressed: Thailand flew ambassadors to the affected part of the country to help attend to the needs of their citizens, helped those who lost their money and passports return home, provided health care for the injured, set up systems to identify bodies, and dealt with the difficulties posed by shortages of body bags and the lack of cold storage facilities. </seg>
<seg id=934> Countries, like Thailand, that felt that they could handle the finances on their own asked that assistance be directed to others. </seg>
<seg id=935> They did ask one thing: a reduction of tariff barriers and greater access to markets abroad. </seg>
<seg id=936> They didn't want a handout, only a chance to earn income. </seg>
<seg id=937> The response, at least at the time of this column's writing, has mostly been deafening silence. </seg>
<seg id=938> On the other hand, the G-7 made a truly important contribution in offering debt relief. </seg>
<seg id=939> This is especially important for Indonesia, which must service a debt of $132 billion (of which $70 billion is owed to public creditors or guaranteed by government agencies). </seg>
<seg id=940> Even without the tsunami, this debt burden would have been an enormous hindrance to the country's development as it finally recovers from the aftermath of the 1997 financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id=941> Indeed, there is a compelling case to be made for Indonesian debt relief in any case, given that much of the debt was incurred in loans to the corrupt Suharto government. </seg>
<seg id=942> Lenders knew, or should have known, that not all of the money was going to help Indonesian development. </seg>
<seg id=943> Moreover, some of the debt was incurred as part of the 1997-1998 crisis, which was aggravated and deepened by IMF-imposed policies. </seg>
<seg id=944> No one pretends that we can prevent or alter the forces of nature. </seg>
<seg id=945> Rather, we have to learn to cope with them. </seg>
<seg id=946> There are now calls for improved tsunami early warning systems. </seg>
<seg id=947> But in one area, global warming, we have already received an early warning. </seg>
<seg id=948> Most countries have recognized this, coming together in Rio and Kyoto to do something about itâ€”not enough, but the Kyoto protocol was intended only as a start. </seg>
<seg id=949> Sadly, global warming will likely destroy some of the same countries ravaged by the tsunami. </seg>
<seg id=950> Low lying islands like the Maldives will become submerged. </seg>
<seg id=951> We are, however, still not a global village. </seg>
<seg id=952> After first disputing that there was scientific evidence of the problem, the largest polluter in the world, the US, is now simply refusing to do anything about it (other than preaching voluntary restraintâ€”of which there is little evidence, at least in America). </seg>
<seg id=953> The international community has yet to figure out what to do with an aberrant member who fails to live up to its responsibilities as a global citizen. </seg>
<seg id=954> Optimists say that technology will solve the problem. </seg>
<seg id=955> Realists observe that in the long race between the environment and technology, it appears that technology has so far been losing. </seg>
<seg id=956> Nature, as we have learned from the tsunami, has its own timetable. </seg>
<seg id=957> Unless we learn how to respect it, we will all miss the boat. </seg>
<seg id=958> How Accurate Are Your Pet Pundits? </seg>
<seg id=959> Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers, and North Korea's Politburo. </seg>
<seg id=960> But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts? </seg>
<seg id=961> The sanguine view is that as long as those selling expertise compete vigorously for the attention of discriminating buyers (the mass media), market mechanisms will assure quality control. </seg>
<seg id=962> Pundits who make it into newspaper opinion pages or onto television and radio must have good track records; otherwise, they would have been weeded out. </seg>
<seg id=963> Skeptics, however, warn that the mass media dictate the voices we hear and are less interested in reasoned debate than in catering to popular prejudices. </seg>
<seg id=964> As a result, fame could be negatively, not positively, correlated with long-run accuracy. </seg>
<seg id=965> Until recently, no one knew who is right, because no one was keeping score. </seg>
<seg id=966> But the results of a 20-year research project now suggest that the skeptics are closer to the truth. </seg>
<seg id=967> I describe the project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment: How good is it? </seg>
<seg id=968> How can we know? </seg>
<seg id=969> The basic idea was to solicit thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and then score the predictions for accuracy. </seg>
<seg id=970> We find that the media not only fail to weed out bad ideas, but that they often favor bad ideas, especially when the truth is too messy to be packaged neatly. </seg>
<seg id=971> The evidence falls into two categories. </seg>
<seg id=972> First, as the skeptics warned, when hordes of pundits are jostling for the limelight, many are tempted to claim that they know more than they do. </seg>
<seg id=973> Boom and doom pundits are the most reliable over-claimers. </seg>
<seg id=974> Between 1985 and 2005, boomsters made 10-year forecasts that exaggerated the chances of big positive changes in both financial markets (e.g., a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 36,000) and world politics (e.g., tranquility in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub-Saharan Africa). </seg>
<seg id=975> They assigned probabilities of 65% to rosy scenarios that materialized only 15% of the time. </seg>
<seg id=976> In the same period, doomsters performed even more poorly, exaggerating the chances of negative changes in all the same places where boomsters accentuated the positive, plus several more (I still await the impending disintegration of Canada, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium, and Sudan). </seg>
<seg id=977> They assigned probabilities of 70% to bleak scenarios that materialized only 12% of the time. </seg>
<seg id=978> Second, again as the skeptics warned, over-claimers rarely pay penalties for being wrong. </seg>
<seg id=979> Indeed, the media shower lavish attention on over-claimers while neglecting their humbler colleagues. </seg>
<seg id=980> We can see this process in sharp relief when, following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we classify experts as "hedgehogs" or "foxes." </seg>
<seg id=981> Hedgehogs are big-idea thinkers in love with grand theories: libertarianism, Marxism, environmentalism, etc. </seg>
<seg id=982> Their self-confidence can be infectious. </seg>
<seg id=983> They know how to stoke momentum in an argument by multiplying reasons why they are right and others are wrong. </seg>
<seg id=984> That wins them media acclaim. </seg>
<seg id=985> But they don't know when to slam the mental brakes by making concessions to other points of view. </seg>
<seg id=986> They take their theories too seriously. </seg>
<seg id=987> The result: hedgehogs make more mistakes, but they pile up more hits on Google. </seg>
<seg id=988> Eclectic foxes are better at curbing their ideological enthusiasms. </seg>
<seg id=989> They are comfortable with protracted uncertainty about who is right even in bitter debates, conceding gaps in their knowledge and granting legitimacy to opposing views. </seg>
<seg id=990> They sprinkle their conversations with linguistic qualifiers that limit the reach of their arguments: â€˜but,' â€˜however,' â€˜although.' </seg>
<seg id=991> Because they avoid over-simplification, foxes make fewer mistakes. </seg>
<seg id=992> Foxes will often agree with hedgehogs up to a point, before complicating things: "Yes, my colleague is right that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember that coups are rare and that the government commands many means of squelching opposition." </seg>
<seg id=993> Imagine your job as a media executive depends on expanding your viewing audience. </seg>
<seg id=994> Whom would you pick: an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the likeliest outcome is more of the same, or an expert who gets viewers on the edge of their seats over radical Islamists seizing control and causing oil prices to soar? </seg>
<seg id=995> In short, the qualities that make foxes more accurate also make them less popular. </seg>
<seg id=996> At this point, uncharitable skeptics chortle that we get the media we deserve. </seg>
<seg id=997> But that is unfair. </seg>
<seg id=998> No society has yet created a widely trusted method for keeping score on the punditocracy. </seg>
<seg id=999> Even citizens who prize accuracy have little way of knowing that they are sacrificing it when they switch channels from boring foxes to charismatic hedgehogs. </seg>
<seg id=1000> Here, then, is a modest proposal that applies to all democracies: the marketplace of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see the trade-offs between accuracy and entertainment, or between accuracy and party loyalty. </seg>
<seg id=1001> Wouldn't they be more likely to read pundits with better track records? </seg>
<seg id=1002> If so, pundits might adapt to accountability by showing more humility, and political debate might begin to sound less shrill. </seg>
<seg id=1003> Granted, it is not easy to create methods of keeping score that are credible across the spectrum of reasonable opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1004> But in a world where, as Yeats said, "and the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity," it is worth trying. </seg>
<seg id=1005> What Next for Europe? </seg>
<seg id=1006> In many ways, 2005 has been Europe's annus horibilis. </seg>
<seg id=1007> It began well, when Spanish voters approved the draft European Union constitution, but it turned sour when French and Dutch voters spurned it soon after. </seg>
<seg id=1008> Those votes partly reflected displeasure with domestic policies, and partly disappointment with the way governments conduct European affairs. </seg>
<seg id=1009> Governments promptly obliged with more of the same. </seg>
<seg id=1010> Within days of the votes, they failed to agree on the EU budget for 2007-13. </seg>
<seg id=1011> French and British leaders engaged in a heated quarrel that derailed the subsequent summit, before Britain assumed the rotating six-month EU presidency in July. </seg>
<seg id=1012> Normally, countries use their EU presidencies to display their ability to solve problems and move the Union forward. </seg>
<seg id=1013> But, as of early December, Britain has remained dormant. </seg>
<seg id=1014> Besides burying the draft constitution, it has largely sidestepped the budget issue. </seg>
<seg id=1015> Chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim, and, unless the dispute is resolved soon, the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007. </seg>
<seg id=1016> Even if a budget is adopted, there is no lack of depressing business for the Austrian presidency, which starts on January 1. </seg>
<seg id=1017> The deepest problem is Europe's inability to grow at more than a snail's pace and to provide jobs to its citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1018> This is mostly due to the Big Three -- France, Germany, and Italy -- which produce 70% of Europe's GDP. </seg>
<seg id=1019> The collective response, adopted in 2000, has been the "Lisbon Strategy," which aims at making the EU "the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world" by 2010. </seg>
<seg id=1020> More realistically, it is designed to provide governments with the incentive to undertake the reforms that stimulate economic growth and productivity. </seg>
<seg id=1021> That means facing down the myriad interest groups -- from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies -- that have (so far) successfully protected their turfs. </seg>
<seg id=1022> The strategy rests on peer pressure, naming and shaming governments that fail to make progress. </seg>
<seg id=1023> In practice, however, peer pressure has become peer collusion. </seg>
<seg id=1024> When EU leaders met last spring to assess progress, they pitifully recognized that the Lisbon Strategy's goal was unlikely to be met. </seg>
<seg id=1025> The best that they could do now would be to dump the pretense of a strategy and carry on with the other business. </seg>
<seg id=1026> Unfortunately, the host of the 2000 summit was JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission, who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy. </seg>
<seg id=1027> Expect him to push on hopelessly. </seg>
<seg id=1028> One of the few good ideas contained in the Lisbon Strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services. </seg>
<seg id=1029> Intra-European competition in services is restricted by innumerable national regulations that, for instance, strictly determine the requirements for becoming a hairdresser or a plumber. </seg>
<seg id=1030> One of the defining features of the past decades is the sharp increase in services productivity in the US; none of that happened in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1031> Guess why. </seg>
<seg id=1032> Because services account for 70% of European GDP, the potential impact from enhanced competition is substantial. </seg>
<seg id=1033> But removing protection is always politically difficult. </seg>
<seg id=1034> The European Commission submitted a proposal in 2005 -- just as the constitution was being put up for a vote. </seg>
<seg id=1035> Not surprisingly, the proposal was quickly shelved. </seg>
<seg id=1036> Now, with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance, the battle will be firmly on the EU's agenda in 2006. </seg>
<seg id=1037> At the same time, Europe is again blocking progress in the Doha round of world trade talks, with the farmers' lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies. </seg>
<seg id=1038> Many governments are so fearful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground, no matter what. </seg>
<seg id=1039> Europe has agreed to a single trade policy. </seg>
<seg id=1040> When disagreements run as deep as they do on agriculture, there can be no give-and-take of the kind that allows for successful negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=1041> There is little reason for optimism. </seg>
<seg id=1042> And what next for the ECB, which has just nudged up interest rates by 0.25%, after 30 months on hold. </seg>
<seg id=1043> Experts can disagree about whether the move was premature, but no one agrees with the many political leaders who have argued that the tiny hike will derail the timid resumption of economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=1044> The sharpness of political attacks on the ECB might trigger dangerous talk about restricting its independence. </seg>
<seg id=1045> While such a move is out of the question -- it would require a change in the European Treaty -- the noise is unhealthy. </seg>
<seg id=1046> It distracts the ECB, adds to the impression that Europe is bad, and, more importantly, will be used by ineffective governments as a scapegoat for their failings. </seg>
<seg id=1047> Expect more ECB-bashing. </seg>
<seg id=1048> Is Europe stuck? </seg>
<seg id=1049> The current team of leaders has been an enormous disappointment. </seg>
<seg id=1050> But as they fade away, there could be some light at the end of the tunnel. </seg>
<seg id=1051> In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is obviously more positive on Europe and more pro-reform than her predecessor, but she is tied up in a grand coalition. </seg>
<seg id=1052> In France, President Jacques Chirac, the epitome of a leader captured by his lobbies, is staggering impotently toward the end of his term in 2007. </seg>
<seg id=1053> The two frontrunners to succeed him, Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, both in government, compete on a reformist agenda, but pre-election years do not encourage bold moves. </seg>
<seg id=1054> Meanwhile, Italy must decide whether it replaces Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who displayed no interest in reform and European affairs, with the cautious Romano Prodi, the former European Commission President. </seg>
<seg id=1055> Tony Blair, once an ardent pro-European (at least by Britain's undemanding standards), might finally have to cede power to Gordon Brown, who is famously cold to European integration. </seg>
<seg id=1056> Fortunately, Britain has always been an outsider. </seg>
<seg id=1057> In the end, whatever light there is, it may not shine until 2007, after the French elections. </seg>
