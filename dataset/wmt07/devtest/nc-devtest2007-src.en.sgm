<seg id=1> Taming Politicians on Both Sides of the Atlantic </seg>
<seg id=2> Despite occasional grumbles from politicians, no one seriously doubts the European Central Bank's independence, or that monetary policy within the euro zone is therefore well insulated from political pressures. </seg>
<seg id=3> But the recent death of the Stability and Growth Pact-killed off by Germany, its father, with France acting as co-conspirator and willing accomplice-reminds us of a key lesson: elected politicians find it hard, if not impossible, to relinquish substantial power in the area of fiscal policy. </seg>
<seg id=4> The same is true across the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id=5> The US Federal Reserve Board is, of course, very independent. </seg>
<seg id=6> But any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of America's Federal government in the manner of the Stability Pact-for example, the infamous Gramm/Rudman rules of the Clinton era-always collapse in the end in the face of presidential and congressional pressure. </seg>
<seg id=7> Monetary policy can be used to stimulate an economy just as much as fiscal policy, if not more, in election years, which politicians will always want to do. </seg>
<seg id=8> But reckless use of either mechanism for short-term goals may create long-term costs, justifying some restrictions on politicians' latitude in influencing macroeconomic policies. </seg>
<seg id=9> When politicians can control inflation by exercising decisive sway over central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, avoiding the need for more taxation to pay it off. </seg>
<seg id=10> This was the great lesson of the 1970's and early 1980's, when rampant inflation forced politicians to surrender this power to independent central banks, which alone could convince markets that price stability would be restored. </seg>
<seg id=11> Yet monetary policy is not a unique species of economic policymaking. </seg>
<seg id=12> Aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians in line. </seg>
<seg id=13> Why not, for example, entrust an independent bureaucracy with some redistributive goals or control over the level of public investment or deficit management? </seg>
<seg id=14> An independent fiscal authority could arguably implement a society's long-term goals in these areas better than politicians, who have their eyes on the next election. </seg>
<seg id=15> Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is not clear why monetary policy and fiscal policy should be treated so differently, with one completely delegated to a bureaucratic agency and the other completely discretionary and in the hand of politicians. </seg>
<seg id=16> So why do we see this large difference in reality in both America and Europe? </seg>
<seg id=17> The answer is that fiscal policy is the key tool politicians use to attract and maintain the support of a winning coalition of voters, say retirees, public employees, and middle-class homeowners, while imposing the costs on the losers. </seg>
<seg id=18> It is not necessary to please 100% of the voters, only enough to win. </seg>
<seg id=19> The fiscal card is critical in choosing which groups of voters to buy. </seg>
<seg id=20> Independent fiscal authorities-or fiscal rules such as the Stability Pact-stand in the way of this political use of fiscal policy, which is costly. </seg>
<seg id=21> After all, if politicians could not win elections by taking money from some-including future generations, which will have to foot a portion of the bill-and giving it to others, they would have to work much harder to display some ability in producing public benefits for all. </seg>
<seg id=22> This is far more difficult! </seg>
<seg id=23> Of course, monetary policy also has redistributive effects. </seg>
<seg id=24> Think about the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors. </seg>
<seg id=25> However, monetary policy is a much more awkward, indirect and imprecise way of choosing winners and losers than fiscal policy. </seg>
<seg id=26> Independent central banks can occasionally be a pain for politicians, but at least they can be used as scapegoats when necessary-a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of losing control over a useful tool. </seg>
<seg id=27> These considerations should guide the choice of what will follow the Stability Pact in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=28> It is now abundantly clear that national governments (especially those of large countries) will never accept substantial limitations on their fiscal discretion. </seg>
<seg id=29> They may have suspended their freedom of fiscal maneuver long enough to launch the euro, but in normal times, national governments will reclaim their fiscal turf. </seg>
<seg id=30> So the European Commission should stop fighting a rearguard battle that merely weakens its credibility, especially in the eyes of small countries, which are the only ones that can be bullied into accepting unwanted fiscal rules. </seg>
<seg id=31> Realistically, all that the Commission can ask of European national governments is for transparency and clarity in their fiscal accounts. </seg>
<seg id=32> Preventing the political use of fiscal policy is an impossible task. </seg>
<seg id=33> But at least a country's fiscal actions should not be hidden in its budgets' obscure methodological footnotes. </seg>
<seg id=34> Even this limited goal may not be easy to achieve. </seg>
<seg id=35> A strategic lack of transparency is the bread and butter of shrewd politicians who want to please a lobby by hiding the costs of the public's largesse from the majority of citizens. </seg>
<seg id=36> The rules that govern politicians' behavior must not be written as if disinterested, well-intentioned public servants will apply them. </seg>
<seg id=37> Politicians are willing to go to great lengths to please their supporters and win elections. </seg>
<seg id=38> The best that we can plausibly hope for is to ensure that the worst of what they do is done out in the open. </seg>
<seg id=39> Will the EU Keep Faith with Turkey? </seg>
<seg id=40> More than forty years ago, Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community. </seg>
<seg id=41> With the Association agreement of 1963, a special relationship was established, culminating in the customs union of 1996. </seg>
<seg id=42> During all these years, European governments consistently confirmed Turkey's eligibility for full membership, making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria. </seg>
<seg id=43> Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life. </seg>
<seg id=44> Should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled, it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005. </seg>
<seg id=45> Not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU's credibility in the world. </seg>
<seg id=46> In many parts of Europe, however, Turkey's admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size, relatively poor economy, fears of massive immigration, and, above all, cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam. </seg>
<seg id=47> It would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges. </seg>
<seg id=48> However, they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable. </seg>
<seg id=49> Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015. </seg>
<seg id=50> This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms. </seg>
<seg id=51> With 80 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states. </seg>
<seg id=52> But the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU's decision-making process, because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power. </seg>
<seg id=53> Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU. </seg>
<seg id=54> Because of its weak economy, Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance. </seg>
<seg id=55> The size of these transfers, however, would depend on the EU's financial policies at the time of admission, the outcome of accession negotiations, and economic developments in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=56> In any case, the EU's practice of "capping" its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey's accession. </seg>
<seg id=57> Immigration should not be a cause for undue concern, either. </seg>
<seg id=58> Human mobility is limited, and Turkey workers' would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period, possibly not before 2025. </seg>
<seg id=59> Given the expected upswing of Turkey's economy and its declining birthrate, experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point. </seg>
<seg id=60> Meanwhile, diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity. </seg>
<seg id=61> Among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable, Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation. </seg>
<seg id=62> It is Turkey's Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions. </seg>
<seg id=63> Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture. </seg>
<seg id=64> It is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state. </seg>
<seg id=65> Unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey's deeply rooted secularism, such a risk cannot be totally excluded. </seg>
<seg id=66> But the same is true for any other democracy, where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes. </seg>
<seg id=67> Surely, the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey's democratic system, which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries. </seg>
<seg id=68> As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a closed "Christian club" or an open and inclusive society, drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity. </seg>
<seg id=69> Turkey's accession to the Union would give a powerful answer, one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world. </seg>
<seg id=70> The need to refute arguments against Turkey's admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned: its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, Southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe's security; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy; and the great potential of the Turkish economy, with its young and dynamic labor force. </seg>
<seg id=71> At the same time, the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account: the likelihood that the reform process would collapse, bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU's doorsteps. </seg>
<seg id=72> Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges. </seg>
<seg id=73> On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks. </seg>
<seg id=74> Playing at Democracy </seg>
<seg id=75> In Calcutta, when some younger kid came along and insisted on joining the game my friends were playing, we would let the new kid in, but only after whispering into each other's ears the words, </seg>
<seg id=76> As a child, mastering the cruel art of </seg>
<seg id=77> The technique of </seg>
<seg id=78> What's true of children and adults is also true of international institutions. </seg>
<seg id=79> Indeed, organizations that are officially committed to involving all nations in their decision making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations, while others merely go through the motions of participation. </seg>
<seg id=80> The World Trade Organization (WTO), supposedly run on the principle of one country one vote, actually has its agenda selected behind the stage by a small group of nations. </seg>
<seg id=81> It is now standard practice for international organizations publishing a report to involve all the "stakeholders" and to reflect their opinions. </seg>
<seg id=82> So the evolving report is usually put up on a Web site and suggestions are invited from one and all--NGOs, trade unions, and other organizations of civil society. </seg>
<seg id=83> This promotes a sense of participation, but as a friend, seasoned in such matters, informed me, the key in the end is to ignore all the comments received and to write up the report as if there were no Web site and no participation. </seg>
<seg id=84> Increasingly, free expression of opinion does not influence or restrain how government behaves. </seg>
<seg id=85> Consider the United States. </seg>
<seg id=86> People expressed their opinion freely--in newspapers, on television, in Internet chat rooms--concerning George Bush's planned war on Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=87> Never before was there so much opposition to a war </seg>
<seg id=88> Part of what happened--or, rather what didn't happen--is admirable: almost no effort was made to muzzle criticism of the government, as happens in China and scores of dictatorial countries. </seg>
<seg id=89> But the world's great democracies--the US, India, the UK, and others--are increasingly adept at not allowing freely expressed opinions to constrain what the government does. </seg>
<seg id=90> The current war in Iraq is perhaps the strongest proof of this. </seg>
<seg id=91> Leaving aside the immorality of this war--and immoral it is--I wish to draw attention to this increasing ability and inclination of democracies to "deal" with (meaning neutralize) public opinion. </seg>
<seg id=92> They have embraced the </seg>
<seg id=93> As democracies mature they become ever more practiced at managing opinion, and in many cases, at shaping opinion. </seg>
<seg id=94> Every time Hans Blix commented on the UN inspections of Iraq that he was conducting, members of the Bush administration would paraphrase what Blix said. </seg>
<seg id=95> The paraphrasing would subtly change Blix's comments to suit America's case for war. </seg>
<seg id=96> By repeating the altered comments, it was hoped, mass opinion would shift in favor of the war. </seg>
<seg id=97> Overthrowing a totalitarian regime and organizing elections may be hard, but the harder task is to go from voting to establishing a true democracy. </seg>
<seg id=98> For people accustomed to living in a totalitarian state, learn what participation means is not easy. </seg>
<seg id=99> Hence the popular belief that democracies, like wine, improve with age. </seg>
<seg id=100> While this may be true, there is a downside to maturity. </seg>
<seg id=101> Just as citizens in a democracy continuously learn to participate, democratic governments continuously learn how to get their way despite the participation. </seg>
<seg id=102> It is no use denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize a sham. </seg>
<seg id=103> We must recognize and confront this problem to prevent established democracies from atrophying and to help new democracies become more effective. </seg>
<seg id=104> For it is not only morally wrong to leave nations and communities feeling marginalized and without voice; it is a recipe for frustration, rage, and terrorism. </seg>
<seg id=105> Recasting Governance in Asia </seg>
<seg id=106> Governance--the way in which decisions that affect the public interest are made--has emerged as a key factor in determining a country's pace of development. </seg>
<seg id=107> Successful governance brings purposeful change. </seg>
<seg id=108> Failure is punished by unrest, disaffection, and stagnation. On April 18 </seg>
<seg id=109> Today's Asian policymakers confront a very different environment from that faced by their predecessors fifty years ago. </seg>
<seg id=110> Asia's population has more than doubled since 1950, with most of that growth coming in its poorest countries. </seg>
<seg id=111> The political systems of these countries were tailored to small, static, rural populations. </seg>
<seg id=112> Now these societies must cope not only with vast urban centers, but also with the very different talents and demands of urbanized people. </seg>
<seg id=113> The global economy has changed dramatically, too. </seg>
<seg id=114> Increased flows of goods, money, and knowledge around the world mean that foreign organizations and individuals become more influential, making it increasingly difficult for national governments manage their countries by themselves. </seg>
<seg id=115> For example, international bodies such as the WTO have changed the framework within which economic decisions are taken. </seg>
<seg id=116> Local economic change has been equally dramatic. </seg>
<seg id=117> In parts of Asia, living standards have skyrocketed. </seg>
<seg id=118> Foreign investment from within and outside the region has altered the structure of domestic economies. </seg>
<seg id=119> Old models of economic growth, however, such as export orientation and selective use of import restrictions that worked well for East Asia in the last century, are less feasible under today's global trade rules. </seg>
<seg id=120> So new rules of the game are needed. </seg>
<seg id=121> In most Asian countries, formal rules need to be simplified and applied more fairly. </seg>
<seg id=122> A "back to basics" approach is vital in three inter-linked areas, in which national governments must take the lead: minimizing corruption, enforcing property rights, and consistent application of the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id=123> Few countries score strongly here. </seg>
<seg id=124> Close links between business and governments were blamed by many for the financial crisis that struck Southeast Asia in 1997. </seg>
<seg id=125> In parts of South Asia, violent conflict and the power of vested interests threaten the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id=126> The result of such failures is that small elites benefit while the majority suffers. </seg>
<seg id=127> A clear structure of formal rules is the best antidote to these flaws, for they bolster the informal customs on which so much in society depends. </seg>
<seg id=128> Most business is not conducted in courts but in meetings where trust and reputation are essential. </seg>
<seg id=129> As the social theorist Robert Putnam has explained, "social capital"--the networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate cooperation and coordination for mutual benefit--is as much a determinant as it is a result of economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=130> Empowering as many members citizens as possible is likely to instill a widespread sense of purpose into efforts to move countries forward. </seg>
<seg id=131> Government, the private sector, and civil society all have a role to play in strengthening social capital. </seg>
<seg id=132> But successful interactions between these sectors cannot be wished into existence, and it is essential that the role of each is clearly defined. </seg>
<seg id=133> Many Asian governments recognize the need to define their roles more clearly. </seg>
<seg id=134> Following the 1997 crisis, the state withdrew further from markets, acknowledging the limits to what it can achieve and the importance of allowing private enterprise to flourish. </seg>
<seg id=135> But governments retain a role in fostering an enabling environment within which markets operate. </seg>
<seg id=136> Monitoring rules and enforcement are important, but different ways of working--say, through public-private partnerships--are also increasingly being considered in many innovative Asian economies. </seg>
<seg id=137> The valuable role of civil society in giving voice to communities that governments cannot reach is also recognized, but its relationship with government and business is often characterized more by conflict than cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=138> The private sector's role in decision-making, too, often needs to be clarified--where businesses have too much influence over government, their need to operate profitable may lead to policies that favor the few over the many. </seg>
<seg id=139> The metaphor of a game--with rules and participants--leads many to think in terms of a competition between nations. </seg>
<seg id=140> This is not entirely healthy, as our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game, where one country's gain is another's loss. </seg>
<seg id=141> Indeed, countries do not compete against each other in the way that firms do. </seg>
<seg id=142> Trade is potentially a positive-sum game, with all countries benefiting by exploiting their areas of comparative advantage. </seg>
<seg id=143> Good governance can enhance this positive-sum game, and ensure that companies and individuals within countries partake of the benefits. </seg>
<seg id=144> In another sense, however, it is valuable to think of governments as being in competition--providing a more effective service to their people than other governments. </seg>
<seg id=145> International comparison of systems therefore plays an important role. </seg>
<seg id=146> In this spirit, this month's UNCTAD-UNDP conference--"Governance in Asia: Underpinning Competitiveness in a Global Economy"--will bring together policy-makers from across Asia to discuss the governance challenges that Asia faces. </seg>
<seg id=147> The role of government--the only actor possessing the legitimacy of a popular mandate--is fundamentally important in steering a society forward. </seg>
<seg id=148> The private sector and civil society are, of course, increasingly important partners for governments. </seg>
<seg id=149> How relationships among these stakeholders function will powerfully influence Asia's future development. </seg>
<seg id=150> The Eighteenth Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger </seg>
<seg id=151> Replacing a governor whom they re-elected only a year before with Arnold Schwarzenegger must have given Californian voters an enormous--if guilty--pleasure. </seg>
<seg id=152> Some members of the opposition in Germany would dearly love to do the same to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, though they have not (yet! </seg>
<seg id=153> ) found a film star to replace him. </seg>
<seg id=154> Several other European governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after being elected. </seg>
<seg id=155> Beyond Europe this is true even for the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva, to say nothing of Mexican President Vicente Fox and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, the latter having called for a referendum to help arrest his sinking popularity. </seg>
<seg id=156> Electoral success, it appears, fades fast nowadays. </seg>
<seg id=157> So should every country adopt a recall procedure to maintain the legitimacy of governments? </seg>
<seg id=158> Absolutely not. </seg>
<seg id=159> Democracy, in the words of the philosopher Karl Popper, is about being able to remove those in power without violence; it is in this sense about trial and error. </seg>
<seg id=160> But leaders must be given the chance to govern. </seg>
<seg id=161> Indeed, they need a chance to make mistakes and to learn and recover from their errors, as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order itself. </seg>
<seg id=162> Trial and error implies the opportunity to err before we try again. </seg>
<seg id=163> Californian voters' first mistake is thus what may be called "the lure of the immediate"--none too surprising in a state where instant gratification is supposedly a core value. </seg>
<seg id=164> But sometimes this desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere. </seg>
<seg id=165> Indeed, democracy nowadays has embraced a pop culture of rapidly passing fads; today's hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow, and there are always more waiting in the wings. </seg>
<seg id=166> In politics this can be dangerous, because it encourages basing decisions, no matter how weighty, on whatever popular opinion momentarily prevails. </seg>
<seg id=167> The call for more referenda both reflects and fuels this trend. </seg>
<seg id=168> Referenda are for the most part snapshots. </seg>
<seg id=169> Switzerland, with its generally slower pace and its thorough political debates before votes are held, may be the exception. </seg>
<seg id=170> As a rule however, referenda measure the popularity of political leaders at a particular moment, regardless of the issue at stake. </seg>
<seg id=171> If and when Britain votes on joining the Euro, the result will most likely tell us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and about the European Union, but little about the merits of the common currency. </seg>
<seg id=172> So the case for representative government remains strong. </seg>
<seg id=173> Democracy is government by debate, by taking important decisions after thorough deliberation of the kind that--at least in large countries--must be conducted in a parliament through elected representatives. </seg>
<seg id=174> Sometimes parliaments wish to act quickly, and perhaps must do so, but as a rule they take enough time to examine issues fully. </seg>
<seg id=175> Parliaments talk before reaching conclusions; hence their name. </seg>
<seg id=176> Consider Germany, where some leaders of the opposition Christian Democrats yearn to sink the Schröder government. </seg>
<seg id=177> Clearly, the reforms proposed and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular, and there is little doubt that, a year after their re-election, the coalition of the Social Democrats and the Greens would not stand much of a chance at the polls. </seg>
<seg id=178> But who knows what the electorate will think in three years, at the end of the government's full term in office? </seg>
<seg id=179> By the time of the next regularly scheduled election, it could become clear that there were no real alternatives to Schröder's policies, and it could even be the case that the predicted beneficial effects of painful reforms will become apparent by then. </seg>
<seg id=180> Leadership needs time to take and implement unpopular decisions as well as popular ones. </seg>
<seg id=181> Leaders themselves need the nerve to take often precarious parliamentary majorities through the troughs of popularity. </seg>
<seg id=182> This is why they should commit their cruelest deeds in the first year and soften up as the next election approaches. </seg>
<seg id=183> The uneasy partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is a good example of this tactic. </seg>
<seg id=184> Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worth their position. </seg>
<seg id=185> So California has set a bad example, and Californians will probably pay a heavy price for it. </seg>
<seg id=186> They may not pay as heavy a price as France a century and a half ago, when the popularly elected Louis Napoleon transformed himself, via a wildly popular referendum, into Napoleon III--that vote being the last the French would enjoy until the end of the Second Empire. </seg>
<seg id=187> Californians, of course, won't be disenfranchised, but their willfulness threatens to yield a wayward and irresponsible form of state politics. </seg>
<seg id=188> To be sure, democracy implies limiting the time that the powerful have to exercise their power without challenge. </seg>
<seg id=189> An effective democracy must give them enough time to win the support of those elected to legislate and to carry out their program. </seg>
<seg id=190> These two imperatives are inherently contradictory, but the balance between them is still best achieved through representative, parliamentary democracy. </seg>
<seg id=191> Anything else is likely to be about as stable as this week's top ten pop songs. </seg>
<seg id=192> Herbert Hoover and the Stability Pact </seg>
<seg id=193> In mid-July the great-and-good finance ministers of the European Monetary Union (EMU) gathered to consider the euro zone's economic condition. </seg>
<seg id=194> They ruminated over the most recent economic forecast, which projects annual GDP growth in the euro zone this year at a pathetically anemic 0.7%. </seg>
<seg id=195> Then, to a minister, without exception, they all but decided that their economies should suffer more of the same, if not worse. </seg>
<seg id=196> They reiterated their commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact, which requires euro-zone countries to raise taxes and cut spending, putting even more downward pressure on their economies. </seg>
<seg id=197> The Pact is already knocking Germany into recession, and Italy's government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts fast enough to keep up with falling output. </seg>
<seg id=198> But none of this is apparently enough to force officials to re-examine their priorities. </seg>
<seg id=199> Some EU finance ministers still view the Stability Pact as the ``cornerstone'' of EMU. </seg>
<seg id=200> Others talk of the importance of obeying the ``rules of the game.'' </seg>
<seg id=201> Still others say that while it is clearly essential to restore economic growth, the recovery must occur ``within the spirit of the Pact.'' </seg>
<seg id=202> From the American side of the Atlantic, all of these rationales seem utterly bizarre. </seg>
<seg id=203> The last time an American government tried to ensure a balanced budget in the face of a recession was over seventy years ago, during the presidency of Herbert Hoover at the outset of the Great Depression. </seg>
<seg id=204> Since then the broad consensus in the US has been that cyclical economic distress requires the use of budget deficits to ameliorate suffering, stimulate aggregate demand, and hasten recovery. </seg>
<seg id=205> Economists call these cyclical fiscal boosts ``automatic stabilizers.'' </seg>
<seg id=206> When private incomes fall, so do public revenues. </seg>
<seg id=207> The reduction in tax collection can increase disposable income. </seg>
<seg id=208> But, more importantly, when private incomes fall, government social-welfare expenditures rise, sparking a recovery in demand, output, investment, and employment. </seg>
<seg id=209> The fall in taxes and the rise in spending do widen the budget deficit, but in a healthy and useful way. </seg>
<seg id=210> On the American side of the Atlantic, the usefulness of these automatic fiscal stabilizers is unchallenged. </seg>
<seg id=211> On the contrary, whenever recession threatens, political debate revolves around whether they need to be reinforced by </seg>
<seg id=212> Nor is it even a fiscal discipline issue. </seg>
<seg id=213> Whenever proposals have surfaced for some sort of balanced-budget amendment to the US Constitution, proponents have typically included exemptions not just for war, but also for recessions. </seg>
<seg id=214> We know the origins of the Stability and Growth Pact. </seg>
<seg id=215> Northern European countries--particularly Germany and the Netherlands--prided themselves on traditionally maintaining moderate debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively low interest rates. </seg>
<seg id=216> These countries saw that Southern European countries--Italy and Greece were the biggest worries--traditionally had high debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively high nominal interest rates because of their perceived tolerance of inflation. </seg>
<seg id=217> The Northern European countries feared that deficit spending by the South might ultimately create pressure for partial monetization of their debt through inflation of the euro--or, more precisely, their leaders feared that investors, fearing the same thing, would demand higher interest rates. </seg>
<seg id=218> The Stability and Growth Pact was intended to keep the public debts of southern Europe low, and thus keep interest rates low by reassuring investors that national debts would never be allowed to rise high enough to generate serious inflationary pressures. </seg>
<seg id=219> But if you look at the euro zone's economic problems today, the danger of high long-term nominal interest rates does not even rank among investors' top ten concerns. </seg>
<seg id=220> At the very least, investors clearly do not fear that high debt will lead governments to stoke inflation by printing more money. </seg>
<seg id=221> The EU's problems are stagnant output, high structural unemployment, weak productivity growth, the wasteful and unfair Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and the forthcoming structural adjustments from the expansion of the EU itself. </seg>
<seg id=222> From one perspective, it is good that the euro zone's finance ministers are eager to keep their national debts low in the long term: it is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970's will not be casually thrown away. </seg>
<seg id=223> But it is dangerous to become obsessed with the past. </seg>
<seg id=224> There is no more certain route to economic disaster than to put on historical blinders. </seg>
<seg id=225> As Herbert Hoover could attest, when we see only the economic policy problems of a generation ago, we risk missing the hazards that lie directly in front of our eyes. </seg>
<seg id=226> The Ghosts of Economics Past </seg>
<seg id=227> In Charles Dicken's great novel "A Christmas Carol," the soulless businessman Ebeneezer Scrooge is tormented by a visit from the Spirit of Christmas Past. </seg>
<seg id=228> Today, economists are similarly troubled by unwanted ghosts, as they ponder the reappearance of economic ills long thought buried and dead. </seg>
<seg id=229> From Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley to Paul Krugman at Princeton, to the Governors of the US Federal Reserve and the senior staff at the European Central Bank, to almost everyone in Japan, economists all over the world are worrying about deflation. </seg>
<seg id=230> Their thoughts retrace the economic thinking of over fifty years ago, a time when economists concluded that the thing to do with deflation was to avoid it like the plague. </seg>
<seg id=231> Back in 1933 Irving Fisher --Milton Friedman's predecessor atop America's monetarist school of economists-- announced that governments could prevent deep depressions by avoiding deflation. </seg>
<seg id=232> Deflation --a steady ongoing decline in prices-- gave businesses and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and hoard cash. </seg>
<seg id=233> It reduced the ability of businesses and banks to service their debt, and might trigger a chain of big bankruptcies that would destroy confidence in the financial system, providing further incentives to hoard. </seg>
<seg id=234> Such strong incentives to hoard rather than spend can keep demand low and falling, and unemployment high and rising, for a much longer time than even the most laissez-faire-oriented politician or economist had ever dared contemplate. </seg>
<seg id=235> Hence the Keynesian solution: use monetary policy (lower interest rates) and fiscal policy (expanded government spending and reduced taxes) to keep the economy from ever approaching the precipice where deflation becomes possible. </seg>
<seg id=236> But if this is an issue solved over fifty years ago, why is it haunting us now? </seg>
<seg id=237> Why is this menace a matter of grave concern in Japan today, and a threat worth worrying about in the US? </seg>
<seg id=238> In the late 1940s, those present at the creation of the post-World War II international economic order tried to create an international monetary system that would (a) allow for exchange rates stable enough for producers and consumers to escape the risks of excessive and irrational exchange rate fluctuations, (b) allow countries to follow their own domestic macroeconomic policies, and (c) prevent the catastrophic panics affecting not just individual banks but whole countries that produced the destructive international financial crisis of the Great Depression. </seg>
<seg id=239> The result was the fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate system of Bretton Woods, which over time mutated into the floating-rate system of the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id=240> Then came the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id=241> All of a sudden tremendously destructive herd-driven financial crises were back: Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Brazil, and so on looked like nothing as much as the US financial panic of 1873 or the Austrian Creditanstalt crisis of 1931. </seg>
<seg id=242> Argentina's crisis at the end of 2001 looked remarkably like Argentina's Baring Brothers crisis of 1890 -- save that politicians and international bankers seem to have had a much better idea of what to do to minimize the damage in 1890 than they do today. </seg>
<seg id=243> But if those who built the post-World War II international monetary system worked to guard against the dangers posed by panic-driven international financial crises, why are these financial devils back? </seg>
<seg id=244> The truth is that economic policymakers are juggling sets of potential disasters, exchanging the one that appears most threatening for a threat that seems more distant. </seg>
<seg id=245> In the US, the Bush Administration is skeptical of the stimulative power of monetary policy and wants bigger fiscal deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- low investment, slow growth, loss of confidence, uncontrolled inflation and exchange rate depreciation-- can be finessed, or will not become visible until after the Bush team leaves office. </seg>
<seg id=246> In Europe, the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the costs of European employment that is far too high. </seg>
<seg id=247> In developing countries, capital controls to prevent financial crises are feared as obstacles to attracting the finance necessary for industrialization, and as potential sources of corruption as financial flows somehow pass through the hands of the Vice Minister of Finance's nephew-in-law. </seg>
<seg id=248> Flexible exchange rates, designed to allow the market to signal when confidence in the currency is declining, also put exporters at a competitive disadvantage against foreign-country producers whose prices aren't batted around by unpredictable exchange rates. </seg>
<seg id=249> Even the import-substitution policies, now universally scorned, were originally adopted by the developing world for good (as well as bad) reasons: the protectionist shutting-off of developed-country markets during the Great Depression which had disastrous consequences for the developing economies. </seg>
<seg id=250> The ghosts of economics' past return because the lessons of the present are always oversold. </seg>
<seg id=251> Politicians and policymakers advance their approach to economics as the "One True Doctrine." </seg>
<seg id=252> But what they are doing, however, is dealing with the biggest problem of the moment but at the price of removing institutions and policies that policymakers before them had put into place to control problems which they felt to be the most pressing. </seg>
<seg id=253> Ebeneezer Scrooge's nocturnal visitors were able to convince him of the errors of his ways. </seg>
<seg id=254> Let's hope that today's economists also learn the lessons of their unwanted ghosts. </seg>
<seg id=255> In the D-Mark's Shadow </seg>
<seg id=256> Getting Over the Irish Stew </seg>
<seg id=257> Justifying Humanitarian Intervention </seg>
<seg id=258> In 1998, I visited Central Asia's former Soviet republics for talks--concerning the democratic development that was--or should have been--taking place in those newly independent countries. </seg>
<seg id=259> My hosts were former communist leaders who were now more or less democratically elected presidents. </seg>
<seg id=260> Each spoke easily about institutions, democratic procedures, and respect for the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id=261> But human rights were another matter entirely. </seg>
<seg id=262> In each country, I presented lists of political prisoners and asked about their fates. </seg>
<seg id=263> In one country, the president immediately decided to free a man accused of plotting a coup. </seg>
<seg id=264> But even this seeming success was morally ambiguous. </seg>
<seg id=265> The president had not made a political decision; he had bestowed a personal favor. </seg>
<seg id=266> I was receiving a gift--itself merely another demonstration of the president's arbitrary exercise of power--not proof of respect for moral principles. </seg>
<seg id=267> In one country, I spoke with a leader of the Islamic fundamentalist opposition, which had waged a long civil war against the government. </seg>
<seg id=268> This man now styled himself as chairman of a "Committee of National Reconciliation." </seg>
<seg id=269> Guards armed to the teeth surrounded him, yet he firmly supported the notion of democratization. </seg>
<seg id=270> Indeed, he saw it as his surest route to power, because the vast majority of the population thought exactly as he did. </seg>
<seg id=271> Democracy, he hinted more ominously, would enable him to "eliminate"--he did not dwell on the exact meaning of the word--those who did not. </seg>
<seg id=272> In such democracies without democrats, "human rights" are more problematic to discuss than procedural formalities, because they are not thought of as "rights" in the legal sense, but merely as pangs of conscience, or else as gifts to be exchanged for something else of value. </seg>
<seg id=273> This distinction matters because it points to the limited effectiveness of formalized legal norms as a means of promoting human rights. </seg>
<seg id=274> This gap between human rights and the behavior of rulers has brought about the greatest shift in the conduct of international affairs in our time--the advent of "humanitarian intervention." </seg>
<seg id=275> It arose initially outside established international institutions and the UN system, originating with the French group, Doctors Without Borders, which deemed human rights to be a value superior to national sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id=276> Doctors Without Borders introduced the concept of "the right of intervention" in humanitarian disasters, bypassing the strictures of traditional international law. </seg>
<seg id=277> The international system rather quickly adopted (and transformed) this notion, and numerous humanitarian </seg>
<seg id=278> NATO's intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that US Secretary of State Colin Powell used to justify the war with Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=279> But, however compelling the cause of humanitarian military intervention, such actions must be brought under the umbrella of the UN Charter. </seg>
<seg id=280> Promoting respect for human rights was, after all, the guiding principle behind the UN's establishment. </seg>
<seg id=281> Its tasks in this area were affirmed in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which give human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual states. </seg>
<seg id=282> Yet a glaring contradiction exists between the universality and supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in states' internal affairs, which are also enshrined in UN documents. </seg>
<seg id=283> One way to overcome this chasm is to introduce into the UN Charter a new chapter devoted to human rights and to reformulate Chapter IV, which concerns the use of force in international relations. </seg>
<seg id=284> Moreover, the principle of sovereignty itself needs redefinition. </seg>
<seg id=285> What the world needs is a system of legal injunctions--bilateral and multilateral agreements, as well as appropriate monitoring and supervisory institutions--to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons. </seg>
<seg id=286> Legal restraints on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators too often use it to justify criminal aggression. </seg>
<seg id=287> Adolf Hitler minted this strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia--supposedly in defense of the Sudeten Germans--and later when he invaded my homeland, Poland. </seg>
<seg id=288> As Milosevic showed again in the 1990s, when he claimed to be defending innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, justifying military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much room for their distortion and abuse. </seg>
<seg id=289> This is why debates about reforming the Security Council should focus not on changing its composition, but on its mission. </seg>
<seg id=290> The Council should be made explicitly responsible for "human security" and be given a responsibility to protect it, in addition to its current role in safeguarding more traditional notions of international security. </seg>
<seg id=291> The principle of non-intervention in a state's internal affairs was never absolute, and globalization confronts it with a radical challenge. </seg>
<seg id=292> The term "international relations" assumes the Westphalian order of commitments among sovereign nation states, which replaced the medieval order of communities defined by personal fealty to a king. </seg>
<seg id=293> But today it is the Westphalian order that is in decline, along with the significance of state borders. </seg>
<seg id=294> In this wider and uncertain context, the need to regulate humanitarian military intervention looms large. </seg>
<seg id=295> What Does America Want? </seg>
<seg id=296> When the leaders of the world's richest nations gather in Evian, France, one unasked question will dominate: what does America want in the world? </seg>
<seg id=297> So it may be helpful to outline the principles and ideas that guide US foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=298> First, inconsistency is no vice. </seg>
<seg id=299> Indeed, in foreign policymaking, inconsistency is often a virtue. </seg>
<seg id=300> I speak not of principles, but of policy. </seg>
<seg id=301> The US does not have a "one size fits all" approach to the world. </seg>
<seg id=302> What happened in Iraq should not be over?interpreted as a rigid template for US policy toward countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction, support terrorism, or deny people liberty. </seg>
<seg id=303> In Iraq, the US used force as a last resort, against a country with a clear record of aggression, and after a large degree of international consensus had developed about what Iraq needed to do. </seg>
<seg id=304> Different policies-tailored for local, regional, and international realities-will be needed to meet the challenges posed by North Korea, Iran, Syria, or elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id=305> America's armed forces are an essential background to much of what the US accomplishes internationally. </seg>
<seg id=306> But defense policy is only one component of foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=307> Not every threat to America's national interests can be addressed with military power. </seg>
<seg id=308> If all you have to work with is a hammer, as the saying goes, every problem looks like a nail. </seg>
<seg id=309> Success in foreign policy, as in carpentry, requires the right tools for the job. </seg>
<seg id=310> Partnership is essential here. </seg>
<seg id=311> For all of America's power, there is little that the US can do in the world that it can't do better with the active participation of others, be they governments, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations. </seg>
<seg id=312> Partnership facilitates solutions to problems that defy purely national responses and means that burdens are shared. </seg>
<seg id=313> America relies on partnerships in the global war on terrorism: foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers; private financial institutions help track the transfers of funds that sustain terror networks. </seg>
<seg id=314> Beyond partnerships, international institutions add value-provided they are effectively organized, have realistic mandates, and contain members that are committed to common norms and aims. </seg>
<seg id=315> Such institutions can and often do advance US national interests. </seg>
<seg id=316> Indeed, it would be difficult to carry out critical dimensions of US foreign policy-from trade to non?proliferation to environmental policy-without them. </seg>
<seg id=317> The World Trade Organization is a case in point. </seg>
<seg id=318> It provides a forum in which to negotiate new trade liberalization agreements, seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies, and resolve disputes with trading partners. </seg>
<seg id=319> But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities. </seg>
<seg id=320> NATO, for example, is evolving from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to one suited to meeting today's security challenges wherever they may arise, such as in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=321> Multilateralism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values. </seg>
<seg id=322> The UN and other global frameworks may sometimes be best placed to address US foreign policy goals. </seg>
<seg id=323> When the UN or other bodies are unwilling or unable to move against dire threats, America reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible, </seg>
<seg id=324> This flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon. </seg>
<seg id=325> We ignore failing states at our peril, because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can offer a haven for terrorists, criminals, and drug traffickers. </seg>
<seg id=326> One of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states. </seg>
<seg id=327> Another is to assist countries that have collapsed into violence to begin the slow process of recovery. </seg>
<seg id=328> One impulse behind America's international engagement, and one of the great sources of its global power, has been its enduring impulse to make the world a better place. </seg>
<seg id=329> Any US foreign policy must combine interests and values, because the American public always insists that US national objectives be linked to national ideals. </seg>
<seg id=330> The appeal of US leadership abroad rests in part on the attractiveness of America's political institutions, society, and culture, and its willingness to champion human rights and democracy. </seg>
<seg id=331> At the same time, our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve US interests, owing to the hardheaded realization that democracies settle their differences peaceably. </seg>
<seg id=332> Today's world lacks irreconcilable conflict among the main concentrations of world power: Europe, Russia, China, Japan, and the US. </seg>
<seg id=333> This congruence of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising foundation for managing the common challenges that confront us all. </seg>
<seg id=334> Our over?riding goal should be to create a world in which governments, organizations, and peoples embrace arrangements that allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values. </seg>
<seg id=335> Everyone has an interest in a world in which force is used only as a last resort, terrorism is regarded as beyond the pale, weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used, free trade becomes the norm, citizens enjoy basic liberties, democratic values triumph, and the rule of law replaces the way of the gun. </seg>
<seg id=336> Bringing such an integrated world may be optimistic, even idealistic, but it is hardly naive. </seg>
<seg id=337> The Road to the Double Helix, the Structure of DNA </seg>
<seg id=338> Fifty years ago, on April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the science magazine </seg>
<seg id=339> A second major advance came a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and hemoglobin. </seg>
<seg id=340> Since then, X-ray structural analysis of protein molecules has helped us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions. </seg>
<seg id=341> Both discoveries--DNA structure and protein structure--were made at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory. </seg>
<seg id=342> So why were these two foundation stones of the revolution in biology and medicine that dominated science in the second half of the 20th century uncovered in a British </seg>
<seg id=343> The great breakthroughs of 1953 rested on the strength of experimental physics at Cambridge, beginning in the late 19th century. </seg>
<seg id=344> This legacy shaped the intellectual environment in which the father-and-son team of William and Lawrence Bragg were trained, and where Lawrence Bragg--first as an undergraduate and then as a research student--developed in 1912 the ideas that led to X-ray structural analysis. </seg>
<seg id=345> Although Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich, and Paul Knipping had discovered the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, it was Lawrence Bragg who understood how it could be exploited scientifically. </seg>
<seg id=346> Reflection by "Bragg planes"--sheets of atoms that can diffract X-rays at specific angles that are determined by the separation between sheets--enabled the Braggs to calculate the exact arrangement of sodium and chloride atoms in a crystal of salt. </seg>
<seg id=347> William Bragg graduated in mathematics in Cambridge in 1884, and became professor of physics in Adelaide, Australia. </seg>
<seg id=348> In 1909 he returned to Britain to take up a chair at Leeds, continuing his work on the nature of X-rays. </seg>
<seg id=349> He became director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he attracted some outstanding young scientists interested in the X-ray field. </seg>
<seg id=350> Among them were two recent Cambridge graduates, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who became interested in the problem of protein structure--Astbury as a result of being asked by Bragg to provide X-ray diagrams of wool and silk. </seg>
<seg id=351> Bernal moved back to Cambridge as a lecturer in structural crystallography in 1927, and in 1931 was promoted to assistant director of research in crystallography, by then a sub-department of the Cavendish Laboratory. </seg>
<seg id=352> Bernal's main scientific interest was initially the atomic structure of crystals, metals, and minerals, then of hormones and sterols--and of some amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. </seg>
<seg id=353> Astbury, meanwhile, moved to Leeds in 1928, where he also began working on amino acids and proteins. </seg>
<seg id=354> Describing his unsuccessful attempts to obtain well-ordered X-ray diffraction patterns from crystals of the protein pepsin, he wondered whether Bernal could help obtain crystals of other proteins. </seg>
<seg id=355> A friend of Bernal's named Glenn Millikan had happened to visit a lab in Uppsala, Sweden, where large pepsin crystals had been obtained, and he brought some of the crystals, still in their mother-liquor, back to Cambridge. </seg>
<seg id=356> Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (later Hodgkin) obtained patterns of the dry crystals, as Astbury had, and with similarly disappointing results. </seg>
<seg id=357> But when Bernal observed the crystals in a light microscope, he noticed that as the large amount of water in the crystal lattice evaporated, they became disordered. </seg>
<seg id=358> They repeated the X-ray experiment, but with the crystal surrounded by its mother-liquor and sealed in a glass capillary, obtaining patterns with large numbers of crystalline reflections. </seg>
<seg id=359> The results of this first defining moment in protein crystallography were published as a letter in </seg>
<seg id=360> Max Perutz, a chemistry graduate from Vienna, arrived in Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with Bernal. </seg>
<seg id=361> The next year, he was given excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best X-ray diffraction patterns to date. </seg>
<seg id=362> But the observable diffraction pattern--the intensities and positions of the individual reflections--represents only half of the data needed to deduce the structure of the diffracting object. </seg>
<seg id=363> In mathematical terms, it gives the amplitude, but not the phases--i.e., the stages in an oscillatory motion--without which the atomic positions could not be determined. </seg>
<seg id=364> With simpler structures made up of small numbers of atoms, chemistry could provide considerable guidance as to the atomic arrangements, and a solution could thus often be found by trial and error. </seg>
<seg id=365> But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this to work. </seg>
<seg id=366> So despite the enormous amount of excellent data that was collected, the solution remained tantalizingly out of reach. </seg>
<seg id=367> But the faith remained that detailed information about protein structure could be obtained from the X-ray patterns in some way, if only it could be discovered. </seg>
<seg id=368> It was only natural that where chemistry fell short, physics--and its premier laboratory--showed the way forward, a way grasped by Watson and Crick in the epic breakthrough that we celebrate this month. </seg>
<seg id=369> Worlds Apart </seg>
<seg id=370> Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence. </seg>
<seg id=371> Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next. </seg>
<seg id=372> As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality, or to its consequences for education, health, and social welfare. </seg>
<seg id=373> Of course, there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence. </seg>
<seg id=374> But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability, threatening security. </seg>
<seg id=375> Excluded and facing bleak life prospects, young people, in particular, often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior, including violence. </seg>
<seg id=376> Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty. </seg>
<seg id=377> Clearly, however, poverty arises from various complex conditions, and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach. </seg>
<seg id=378> It is hard to imagine, for example, how to "make poverty history" without also generating enough decent work, educational opportunities, and healthcare for all. </seg>
<seg id=379> To be sure, the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id=380> Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced. </seg>
<seg id=381> Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems. </seg>
<seg id=382> Overall, however, the inequality gaps are large and, in many cases, growing. </seg>
<seg id=383> The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries. </seg>
<seg id=384> Meanwhile, growing unemployment, widening skill and productivity gaps, and the "informalization" or "casualization" of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide, as the number of "working poor" and the incidence of "jobless growth" has spread. </seg>
<seg id=385> Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs, imposed since the 1980's, delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=386> Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries. </seg>
<seg id=387> Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally. </seg>
<seg id=388> But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels. </seg>
<seg id=389> Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities. </seg>
<seg id=390> The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions. </seg>
<seg id=391> But they are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemployment, greater earnings disparities, reduced social protection, and environmental degradation. </seg>
<seg id=392> International financial liberalization, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities. </seg>
<seg id=393> In addition, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity. </seg>
<seg id=394> Meanwhile, free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends. </seg>
<seg id=395> Developing countries' international terms of trade have worsened: prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures, as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture, and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights. </seg>
<seg id=396> As a result, trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world, as in the case of garments this year. </seg>
<seg id=397> And, while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters. </seg>
<seg id=398> Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off. </seg>
<seg id=399> The "retreat of the state" in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government, including the capacity to lead and sustain development, as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education, health, housing, and utilities. </seg>
<seg id=400> The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start, and its consequences have become glaringly obvious. </seg>
<seg id=401> Unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction, the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart. </seg>
<seg id=402> Don't Follow The Fed </seg>
<seg id=403> The US Federal Reserve faces a dilemma, for it needs to continue raising interest rates in the face of a hurricane-devastated economy. </seg>
<seg id=404> The Fed's failure to raise rates earlier thus holds a powerful lesson for the European Central Bank: after a prolonged period of monetary stability at unusually low interest rates, waiting too long to raise rates to more normal and appropriate levels holds dangerous consequences. </seg>
<seg id=405> The Fed was late in beginning the interest-rate normalization process, and it is now paying a price. </seg>
<seg id=406> The ECB must not make the same mistake, even bearing in mind that the two central banks operate in different milieus and under different constraints. </seg>
<seg id=407> Warning signs of impending inflation abound across the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id=408> Money-supply growth has been well above target levels for some time now, indicating excess liquidity. </seg>
<seg id=409> September headline inflation, at 2.6%, is above the ECB's 2% target ­ -- as is the latest forecast for 2006 inflation (updated forecasts will be released at the beginning of December). </seg>
<seg id=410> "The period of wage moderation may be coming to an end," warns Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, implying that soaring energy prices may now be feeding through into the overall price level (so-called "second-round effects"). </seg>
<seg id=411> In these circumstances, there is no good reason to wait to raise interest rates. </seg>
<seg id=412> The longer energy prices remain at their current lofty levels, the greater the probability that inflationary expectations will increase and that second-round effects will materialize. </seg>
<seg id=413> Further procrastination on interest-rate normalization by the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation. </seg>
<seg id=414> This would be disastrous for Europe's economic recovery, as the ECB would have no choice but to slam down hard on the monetary brakes. </seg>
<seg id=415> No one wants this. </seg>
<seg id=416> Better a 50-basis-point increase now -- thereby allowing the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation in check -- than triple or quadruple that figure down the road. </seg>
<seg id=417> The old adage that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" applies with particular force to monetary policy. </seg>
<seg id=418> Judging from the outcome of last month's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council, that "ounce of prevention" appears to be right around the corner for the euro-zone economy. </seg>
<seg id=419> Indeed, the pace of ECB warnings about the risks of inflation has quickened in recent months -- the earlier "We are vigilant" became "We are particularly vigilant" in September, which became "Strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted" in October. </seg>
<seg id=420> The Governing Council is in danger of running out of adjectives -- as well as credibility -- if it does not act soon. </seg>
<seg id=421> The tone of ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's comments in the Q & A section of the press conference following the October meeting was unusually hawkish. </seg>
<seg id=422> Trichet appeared to be calling for a pre-emptive approach when he said, "We must not allow second-round effects to materialize." </seg>
<seg id=423> For the first time, the ECB president was willing to admit publicly that the Governing Council had discussed the pros and cons of a rate hike at the meeting. </seg>
<seg id=424> Nonetheless, current interest rates were described as "still appropriate" in October, signaling that the ECB has not yet reached a decision to bite the bullet. </seg>
<seg id=425> To be sure, an unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a strong rise in the value of the euro could postpone the inevitable rate hike. </seg>
<seg id=426> But what seems clear is that the ECB used the October press conference to warn politicians, trade unions, and the markets that its long period of monetary-policy inactivity is coming to an end. </seg>
<seg id=427> The exit process has begun. </seg>
<seg id=428> Not everyone is happy with this news. </seg>
<seg id=429> Politicians -- like Jacques Chirac in France, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and ECOFIN (the finance ministers of the European Union's member states) -- continue to press for fixed, even lower, interest rates. </seg>
<seg id=430> But it's easy for politicians to be irresponsible about monetary policy. </seg>
<seg id=431> They are not the ones who will be blamed for soaring prices, nor are they the ones who will have to force the inflation genie back into the bottle. </seg>
<seg id=432> By constantly pushing for lower interest rates than the ECB can deliver, politicians set the central bank up as a scapegoat for Europe's poor economic performance. </seg>
<seg id=433> Europe is doing badly, they argue, not because of their own failure to lead the structural reform process, but because interest rates are too high. </seg>
<seg id=434> At the same time, the ECB does not need to go nearly as far as the Fed, which has raised interest rates in increments of 25 basis points at 12 consecutive meetings, with still more to come. </seg>
<seg id=435> For the ECB, an increase of 50 basis points could do the job at this point -- after which rates could probably be put on hold for some time. </seg>
<seg id=436> The Fed waited too long to start the normalization process, and, because it was more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the interest-rate cycle, it has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the upward phase. </seg>
<seg id=437> This is not the type of volatile monetary policy that Europe wants or needs. </seg>
<seg id=438> The West Versus the Rest? </seg>
<seg id=439> The Madrid bombings have made Europeans feel the scourge of terrorism in their bones. </seg>
<seg id=440> March 11 is now Europe's version of September 11 in America. </seg>
<seg id=441> Yet America and Europe often do not seem to see the world through the same glasses: Spain's response to the terrorist attacks - a threat common to all democracies - was to vote in a government promising an end to pro-US policy on Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=442> Does this mean that Europe and the US have dramatically different visions? </seg>
<seg id=443> Part of the seeming disconnect on foreign policy emerges from a misunderstanding about what "Europe" is about. </seg>
<seg id=444> The European project is a realist's response to globalization and its challenges. </seg>
<seg id=445> It was initiated to create "solidarités de fait," promote political stability, and consolidate democracy and Europe's social model. </seg>
<seg id=446> Having achieved these goals, Europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world developments. </seg>
<seg id=447> This is not nostalgia for past glory. </seg>
<seg id=448> An unprecedented degree of solidarity now exists across Europe, as was apparent in the collective mourning and outpouring of sympathy towards Spain; we must build on that huge potential to create a logic of solidarity in the world. </seg>
<seg id=449> The US, also victim of a horrendous attack, feels drawn to the world but not to promote a similar model of cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=450> Rather, in defending their values and security, Americans strive to defend the world, especially the Western world, from dark new threats. </seg>
<seg id=451> The messianic idealism that liberated Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from communism is now directed at other enemies. </seg>
<seg id=452> With all the attention devoted to strained transatlantic relations, it is easy to overlook how often our preoccupations overlap. </seg>
<seg id=453> On issues such as terrorism, weapons proliferation, Iran, Afghanistan (where we jointly train the country's future army), and Africa (where French initiatives with American support recently succeeded in stabilizing Côte d'Ivoire and Congo), Europe and the US speak with a common voice. </seg>
<seg id=454> But on some issues, such as the Iraq war, Europeans are not all ready to follow America blindly. </seg>
<seg id=455> The world - Europe in particular - has fascination and admiration for the US. </seg>
<seg id=456> But today we must move away from fascination and gratitude and realize that the pursuit of European integration remains in the best interest of the US, which has supported it for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id=457> In today's world, there is clearly work for two to bring about stability and security, and in promoting common values. </seg>
<seg id=458> In particular, the Franco-German "engine" of Europe should not be seen as a potential rival to the US. </seg>
<seg id=459> France and Germany are not an axis aspiring to be some sort of an alternative leadership to the US. </seg>
<seg id=460> Rather, the two countries form a laboratory needed for the internal working of the EU. </seg>
<seg id=461> Anyone who thinks we are building a European rival to America has not looked properly at the facts. </seg>
<seg id=462> Indeed, France and Germany do not get along naturally. </seg>
<seg id=463> Much sets us apart: EU enlargement, agriculture, and domestic market issues. </seg>
<seg id=464> So it is not the </seg>
<seg id=465> So I do not believe that a lasting rift looms. </seg>
<seg id=466> Most Americans still see in Europe a partner with largely the same aims in the world. </seg>
<seg id=467> Most Europeans see in America a strong friend. </seg>
<seg id=468> We are all allies of the US; our draft constitution restates the importance of the NATO link; our strategy for growth and our contribution to global stability depend on the irreplaceable nature of our relationship with America. </seg>
<seg id=469> This is why the US should encourage the development of a common European security and defense policy, which is merely the burden sharing that America has been pressing on Europe for decades. </seg>
<seg id=470> We must forge greater European military capacities simply to put in place a mechanism that allows us to stand effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other catastrophes strike one of our democracies, as just happened. </seg>
<seg id=471> But we must also establish an autonomous European military planning capacity, because the EU might need to lead its own operations, perhaps because NATO is unwilling to. </seg>
<seg id=472> We French are opposed to building a "two-speed" Europe. </seg>
<seg id=473> But we want structured co-operation - meaning that some European states may press ahead in defense capacity - because we are not prepared to let the more cautious and hesitant dictate a recurrence of the Balkan tragedy of the 1990's, when Europeans couldn't act and Americans wouldn't (for a while). </seg>
<seg id=474> The creation of such a capacity will make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner. </seg>
<seg id=475> So it is hard for Europeans to understand why plans for closer European integration should be seen as anti-American. </seg>
<seg id=476> The only way to arrest such fears is through closer and more frequent dialogue. </seg>
<seg id=477> On defense and security matters, the EU's security doctrine provides a great opportunity to build on our common worries: terrorism and non-proliferation, but also the need to ensure sustainable development in all quarters of the world. </seg>
<seg id=478> Europe and the US must pursue their aims in cooperation, while ensuring that such cooperation never becomes an alliance of the "West against the Rest." </seg>
<seg id=479> Some in the West have tried to conjure a "Clash of Civilizations" out of our troubled times. </seg>
<seg id=480> Our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against anybody in particular. </seg>
<seg id=481> Is India Ready for Full Currency Convertibility? </seg>
<seg id=482> India's political boldness in seeking peace with Pakistan in their half-century twilight struggle for Kashmir may soon be matched by economic moves equally as daring. </seg>
<seg id=483> Indeed, India is edging toward a truly bold reform: full international convertibility of the rupee. </seg>
<seg id=484> How it goes about this will not only effect India's economic development, but provide object lessons for China as it ponders convertibility in the years ahead. </seg>
<seg id=485> Since 1991 India has been travelling on a path from rupee devaluation to full convertibility, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) relaxing a range of foreign-exchange controls. </seg>
<seg id=486> Resident Indians can now maintain a foreign-currency account and invest in shares of foreign companies, while non-resident Indians can repatriate legacy/inheritance assets. </seg>
<seg id=487> Indian companies listed abroad can buy property in foreign countries, and resident firms will be allowed to pre-pay external commercial debt up to US$100 million. </seg>
<seg id=488> Limits on exporters' foreign-currency accounts will be removed, and banks may invest in overseas money and debt markets. </seg>
<seg id=489> Is India ready for full convertibility? </seg>
<seg id=490> The government is still lagging on its domestic economic reforms. </seg>
<seg id=491> Structural reform and privatization have slowed, eroding investors' confidence. </seg>
<seg id=492> But failure to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term. </seg>
<seg id=493> Hence it would be premature for India to open up its capital account immediately. </seg>
<seg id=494> Exchange rate stability is the key anchor when a country's reform process is underway. </seg>
<seg id=495> There is, however, little evidence that capital account convertibility has a meaningful impact on a country's growth rate. </seg>
<seg id=496> With capital-account convertibility, the rupee's exchange rate will be determined more by capital flows than by inflation differentials, as India's inflation rate remains broadly in line with the OECD average of around 3%. </seg>
<seg id=497> Because India is still running a trade deficit, there could be some pressure on the rupee following any negative shock. </seg>
<seg id=498> Although monetary growth is more than twice the rate of real GDP growth, the inflationary risk is probably low because substantial excess capacity exists. </seg>
<seg id=499> Indeed, throughout the 1990s, despite rising output, deflation occurred, which means that India's potential output is expanding. </seg>
<seg id=500> The moves towards full capital-account convertibility have proceeded in step with impressive growth in India's foreign-currency reserves. </seg>
<seg id=501> Indeed, India's external liquidity position has strengthened dramatically in the past decade. </seg>
<seg id=502> As a result of a current-account surplus and an interest-rate differential of 3-4%, foreign reserves reached $70.3 billion by the end of 2002--enough to cover almost 15 months of imports--up from only US$4 billion in 1990. </seg>
<seg id=503> Following the 1991 balance of payments crisis, the rupee's exchange rate was devalued around 20%. </seg>
<seg id=504> Exporters could exchange 30% of their earnings at the market rate. </seg>
<seg id=505> This was subsequently replaced with a two-tier exchange-rate system making the rupee partially convertible--60% of export earnings could be converted at the market exchange rate, and the rest at the RBI's fixed rate (used by the government to finance essential imports like petroleum, cooking oil, fertilizers, and life-saving drugs). </seg>
<seg id=506> The two-tier exchange-rate system acted as an export tax, but it did not survive for long, giving way to a unified exchange rate on the trade account. </seg>
<seg id=507> Full convertibility on the current account followed in August 1994. </seg>
<seg id=508> The policy debate then turned to capital-account convertibility, with the IMF and the World Bank strongly in favor. </seg>
<seg id=509> In May 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility charted a three-stage liberalization process to be completed by 1999-2000, with an accompanying emphasis on fiscal consolidation, a mandated inflation target, and a strong financial system. </seg>
<seg id=510> Then the East Asian currency crisis put further action on hold and raised serious questions about when--and whether--to proceed. </seg>
<seg id=511> The sudden meltdown of apparently healthy economies served as a stark reminder that strong external liquidity should not be the driving force towards full convertibility. </seg>
<seg id=512> The downside risk of capital-account liberalization, after all, is higher exchange-rate volatility, and even countries with sound liquidity positions could not prevent a run on their reserves. </seg>
<seg id=513> The lesson for India is that, in the event of a domestic or external shock, full convertibility could prove to be a costly, short-lived experiment. </seg>
<seg id=514> The fundamental question is whether full convertibility will encourage higher net inflows or outflows of capital. </seg>
<seg id=515> The downside risk of higher volatility for the rupee is aggravated by some serious problems, including a deficit running at 6% of GDP and the strategic stand-off with Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id=516> Short-term capital outflows--which might occur should either risk worsen--could create greater output volatility. </seg>
<seg id=517> So it is vital for India to increase the inward flow of long-term capital, regardless of whether the capital account is closed or open. </seg>
<seg id=518> In this context, it is noteworthy that China, with a closed capital account, has foreign-exchange reserves of US$286 billion, four times the size of India's, though China's economy is only double India's size. </seg>
<seg id=519> Nor is full convertibility the key to attracting higher inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). </seg>
<seg id=520> China attracted FDI inflows of US$52.7 billion in 2002--the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id=521> India needs to attract higher FDI inflows to help soak up the economy's excess capacity. </seg>
<seg id=522> This underscores the importance for India's financial stability of successful management of the capital account (monitoring inflows and outflows) following any move toward full convertibility. </seg>
<seg id=523> But, in the near term, full capital account convertibility is not in India's interest. </seg>
<seg id=524> Twilight of the Chancellor? </seg>
<seg id=525> Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's resignation as chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) will deeply affect the distribution of forces within the German government and its slim "Red-Green" majority in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=526> While it seems to be premature to speak, as some in Germany now do, of a "Twilight of the Chancellor" or to call Schröder's surprising step "the beginning of the end" of his tenure, it is perfectly correct to describe it as a dramatic loss of power. </seg>
<seg id=527> The immediate winner is Franz Müntefering, age 64, the SPD's parliamentary floor leader who will succeed Schröder, as party chairman. </seg>
<seg id=528> Both politicians will constitute a tandem, but Schröder will be more dependent on Müntefering's loyalty than Müntefering is dependent on Schröder's success. </seg>
<seg id=529> Schröder has been representing a moderately left political platform and agenda, one comparable to British Prime Minister Tony Blair's New Labour philosophy or former US President Bill Clinton's centrism. </seg>
<seg id=530> Müntefering, however, is more attached to traditional Social Democratic (or Old Labour) values. </seg>
<seg id=531> In terms of leadership style, Schröder is a soloist; Müntefering a team player. </seg>
<seg id=532> In Germany, the Chancellor holds the strongest position among the key political players. </seg>
<seg id=533> However, the main source of any German Chancellor's strength is not to be found in the legal powers conferred upon him by the constitution; it is the actual support he holds within his own party. </seg>
<seg id=534> With one notable exception in the 1950's, none of Germany's two main political parties - the Social Democrats and the moderately conservative Christian Democrats - has ever managed to win an absolute majority in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=535> As a consequence, German Chancellors usually preside over coalition governments, and their effective authority is based on the loyalty of the party forces they command within such political alliances. </seg>
<seg id=536> Although the Social Democrats never really liked Schröder (they certainly do not love him in the way they did the unforgettable Willy Brandt), they willy-nilly followed him so long as they saw him as the only guarantor of electoral success after 16 frustrating years (1982-1998) in opposition to Helmut Kohl. </seg>
<seg id=537> But this is no longer the case. </seg>
<seg id=538> Since the end of 2002, Schröder and the SPD have been facing unusually low public approval ratings - and this pattern is not likely to change soon. </seg>
<seg id=539> In 2003 alone, almost 40,000 Social Democrats left their party, a hemorrhaging previously unheard of. </seg>
<seg id=540> If national elections had, say, been held last Sunday, February 8, a centre-right coalition consisting of the Christian Democrats and the Liberals would have won 57% of the vote, according to "Infratest dimap," one of Germany's main polling institutes. </seg>
<seg id=541> With no more than 35% of the vote, Schröder's "Red-Green" coalition would have suffered a disaster. </seg>
<seg id=542> At the beginning of what has been dubbed a "super election year" in Germany - with 14 elections, one at the European, five at the regional, and eight at the local levels - this is hideously bad news for the SPD. </seg>
<seg id=543> Several times before, Schröder had been thoroughly energized by desperate situations when he stood with his back to the wall. </seg>
<seg id=544> This quality is his greatest strength, and it seems he has now embarked on his riskiest counteroffensive ever. </seg>
<seg id=545> It is based on the bet that there will be a considerable economic upswing from mid-2004 onwards until the next national elections in autumn 2006 - and that voters will attribute the expected recovery to the economic, labour market and welfare state reforms, called "Agenda 2010," that Schröder has made the hallmark of his chancellorship. </seg>
<seg id=546> For a long time, Schröder's reformist rhetoric had not been matched by his politics. </seg>
<seg id=547> Only after his re-election in autumn 2002, did he give up his previous populist stance, short-term responses and neo-corporatist ways of trying to talk trade unions and employers' associations into compromise. </seg>
<seg id=548> In view of Germany's most pressing problems - an accelerating demographic decline, an overregulated labour market, and a cloudy and confusing tax system - Schröder's reform agenda may look far too timid, but many cuts have been perceived as extremely cruel by the SPD's core constituency, especially the powerful labour unions. </seg>
<seg id=549> But, given Germany's economic distress, which looks likely to worsen given the country's demographic problems, the Social Democrats are now condemned to give wealth creation priority over redistribution. </seg>
<seg id=550> Germany cannot afford to slow down or, worse yet, stop the reform process. </seg>
<seg id=551> In the best case scenario, Schröder will therefore stick to the "Agenda 2010" philosophy, and Müntefering will patiently explain to a reluctant SPD that you have to cross the desert in order to make it to the Promised Land. </seg>
<seg id=552> In the worst case, Schröder will lapse back into populism for the sake of short-term electoral success, and Müntefering will confirm that method so as to save the wounded Social Democratic soul from total despair. </seg>
<seg id=553> Schröder's tragedy is that his power may further erode whatever way he chooses. </seg>
<seg id=554> At the end of this current "super election year," we will know the answer. </seg>
<seg id=555> The Great Man Syndrome </seg>
<seg id=556> In our globalized age, vast impersonal forces are supposed to determine events. </seg>
<seg id=557> Globalized markets, unfettered trade, militant Islam, China's awakening: these are the things historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny. </seg>
<seg id=558> But most people don't see things this way. </seg>
<seg id=559> Instead, most people still instinctively look at "great men" as the agents of history, the men (and women) who seem to forge events through their political vision, personal charisma, and the force of their moral claims. </seg>
<seg id=560> By sheer force of conviction and personality, such figures, many of us believe, can carry the day, bringing a glimmer of hope to an otherwise detached and impersonal universe. </seg>
<seg id=561> This yearning for providential men or women in our global age results from at least three factors. </seg>
<seg id=562> The first concerns the complexity and vulnerability of our world. </seg>
<seg id=563> The second, paradoxically, reflects our growing cynicism towards politics and politicians. </seg>
<seg id=564> And the third is the result of our media culture, obsessed as it is with putting a "face" to events. </seg>
<seg id=565> Confronted with the problem of bringing about positive changes in a domestic or international environment that seems to defy the power of "normal" leaders, one looks for new Alexanders to untie the "Gordian knot" and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism. </seg>
<seg id=566> For example, structural reforms in Europe are thought impossible to enact unless imposed by some reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id=567> In the Middle East, everyone waits for a new Anwar Sadat to arise among the Arabs. </seg>
<seg id=568> Disillusion with politics and politicians also is a key element of our yearning for providential leaders. </seg>
<seg id=569> In France for example, the overly flattering commemoration of President François Mitterrand's death ten years ago primarily reflects widespread disillusion with his successor, Jacques Chirac. </seg>
<seg id=570> Indirect criticism of the present is usually a key element in idealized views of the past. </seg>
<seg id=571> The less we expect from a "normal" politician, the more we look for a hero. </seg>
<seg id=572> With the world becoming a global stage, the media's role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential. </seg>
<seg id=573> The public demands quick answers to complex problems that, unsolved, risk endangering the planet. </seg>
<seg id=574> They need figures with whom they can identify, immediately recognize, and, above all, trust. </seg>
<seg id=575> The emergence of an embryonic "world civil society" heightens demand for universal and charismatic figures, holding out the hope of global accountability, but also carrying populist overtones. </seg>
<seg id=576> In a world searching for providential leaders, the case of Ariel Sharon is both symbolic and paradoxical, for this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades. </seg>
<seg id=577> He has become a nearly revered figure in his country, and large segments of Western public opinion believe that his political demise represents a potentially fatal blow to any hope of progress in the region, even as he remains hated in large parts of the Arab and Muslim world. </seg>
<seg id=578> Sharon's transformation from villain to hero within the space of a mere few years is a source of fascination for his people, the region, and the world -- all the more so because his ultimate intentions will remain a subject of endless dispute among historians tomorrow and among politicians claiming to be his faithful heirs today. </seg>
<seg id=579> Was Sharon really convinced by demographers that the "Great Israel" that once seemed to be his dream would actually mean the end of a Jewish State, or did his disengagement strategy of "Gaza first" really mean "Gaza last"? </seg>
<seg id=580> For those who support one or the other reading, Sharon will forever hold the benefit of the doubt. </seg>
<seg id=581> That Sharon's stroke could be compared -- in terms of political consequences -- with the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates that his personality had become associated with hope and security. </seg>
<seg id=582> The "bulldozer" had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too. </seg>
<seg id=583> He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement. </seg>
<seg id=584> In fact, one may wonder if the world has made of Sharon a providential man because it wanted so much to believe that there was still "hope around the corner" in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=585> Was this wishful thinking or self-fulfilling prophecy? </seg>
<seg id=586> We will never know. </seg>
<seg id=587> What is certain is that the vacuum left by Sharon's departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the Gaza that Israel has vacated, and the collapse of the Palestinian authority before our eyes. </seg>
<seg id=588> Nor will the emergence of another providential figure come easily. </seg>
<seg id=589> Not all exceptional periods create their Bonapartes, and this is probably a good thing, for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have solutions, which is far from true. </seg>
<seg id=590> The natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress "at the margin," but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs. </seg>
<seg id=591> Many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by a providential man, with all the hopes -- and dangers -- that this entails. </seg>
<seg id=592> The Fall of the UN </seg>
<seg id=593> Saddam Hussein's reign of terror is about to end. </seg>
<seg id=594> His Ba'athist government, however, will not go alone. </seg>
<seg id=595> In a fitting irony, the United Nations is going down with him. </seg>
<seg id=596> Perhaps the entire UN will not disappear. </seg>
<seg id=597> Those parts devoted to "good works" (i.e., the low-risk peacekeeping bureaucracies or those that fight AIDs and malaria or protect children) will remain. </seg>
<seg id=598> The looming chatterbox on New York's East River will also continue to bleat. </seg>
<seg id=599> What died with the Security Council's unwillingness to sanction force to implement its own resolutions on Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction was the decades-old fantasy of the UN as the bedrock of world order. </seg>
<seg id=600> As we sift the debris of the war to liberate Iraq, it will be important to preserve-the better to understand-the intellectual wreckage of the liberal conceit of security through international law administered by international institutions. </seg>
<seg id=601> As free Iraqis document the quarter-century nightmare of Saddam's rule, we must not forget who supported this war and who did not, who held that the international community's moral authority was enshrined in pleas for more time for the UN arms inspectors, and who marched against "regime change". </seg>
<seg id=602> In the spirit of post-war reconciliation that diplomats are always keen to engender, we must not reconcile ourselves to the timid, blighted notion that world order requires us to recoil before rogue states that terrorize their citizens and menace our own. </seg>
<seg id=603> Decent, thoughtful, high-minded, the millions who marched against holding Iraq to account were catalyzed by the idea that only the UN Security Council has the authority to legitimize the resort to force. </seg>
<seg id=604> A voluntary coalition of liberal democracies willing to put their own soldiers in harm's way isn't good enough. </seg>
<seg id=605> It does not seem to matter that such troops are being used to enforce the UN's own demands. </seg>
<seg id=606> If a country or coalition of countries other than the UN Security Council uses force, even as a last resort, "anarchy", not international law, would prevail, destroying all hope of world order. </seg>
<seg id=607> Or so the protestors believed. </seg>
<seg id=608> But this is a dangerously wrong idea, an idea that leads inexorably to handing great moral (and even existential politico-military decisions) to the likes of Syria, Cameroon, Angola, Russia, China, and France. </seg>
<seg id=609> If a policy is right when the Security Council approves, how can it be wrong just because communist China or Russia or France or a gaggle of minor dictatorships withhold approbation? </seg>
<seg id=610> Those who opposed the actions of the coalition in Iraq usually fall back on the answer that "order" must have primacy over "anarchy". </seg>
<seg id=611> But is this right? </seg>
<seg id=612> Is the UN Security Council the institution most capable of ensuring order and saving us from anarchy? </seg>
<seg id=613> History suggests not. </seg>
<seg id=614> The UN arose from the ashes of a war that the League of Nations was unable to avert. </seg>
<seg id=615> The League was simply not up to confronting Italy in Abyssinia, much less (had it survived that debacle) taking on Nazi Germany. </seg>
<seg id=616> In the euphoric aftermath of the victory in World War Two, the hope that security could be made collective was reposed in the UN Security Council-with abject results. </seg>
<seg id=617> During the Cold War the Security Council was hopelessly paralyzed. </seg>
<seg id=618> Indeed, the decision to defend South Korea from attack in 1950 was taken by the Council only because Stalin ordered his diplomats to boycott UN proceedings, which meant that no Soviet ambassador was around to cast a veto. </seg>
<seg id=619> It was a mistake the Soviets would not make again. </seg>
<seg id=620> In both 1967 and 1973, with war looming, the UN withdrew from the Middle East, leaving Israel to defend itself. </seg>
<seg id=621> The Soviet empire was wrestled to the ground, and Eastern Europe liberated, not by the UN but by the mother of all coalitions, NATO. </seg>
<seg id=622> Facing Milosevic's multiple aggressions, the UN could not stop the Balkan wars or even protect its victims. </seg>
<seg id=623> Remember Sarajevo? </seg>
<seg id=624> Remember Srebrenica and the slaughter of thousands of Muslims under the supposed protection of the UN? </seg>
<seg id=625> It took a coalition of the willing to save Bosnia from extinction. </seg>
<seg id=626> When the war was over, peace was made in Dayton, Ohio, not at the UN. </seg>
<seg id=627> The rescue of Kosovo's Muslims was not a UN action: their cause never gained Security Council approval. </seg>
<seg id=628> This century now challenges the hopes for a new world order in new ways. </seg>
<seg id=629> We will not defeat or even contain fanatical terror unless we can carry the war to the territories from which it is launched. </seg>
<seg id=630> This will sometimes require that we use force against states that harbor terrorists, as we did in destroying the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id=631> The most dangerous of these states are those that possess weapons of mass destruction, the chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons that can kill not hundreds or thousands but hundreds of thousands. </seg>
<seg id=632> Iraq was such a state, but there are others. </seg>
<seg id=633> Whatever hope exists that they can be persuaded to withdraw support or sanctuary from terrorists rests on the certainty and effectiveness with which they are confronted. </seg>
<seg id=634> The chronic failure of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions (with respect to Iraq) is unmistakable: it is simply not up to the task. </seg>
<seg id=635> So we are left with coalitions of the willing. </seg>
<seg id=636> Far from disparaging them as a threat to a new world order, we should recognize that they are, by default, the best hope for that order, and the true alternative to the anarchy caused by the dismal failure of the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id=637> After Neoliberalism, What? </seg>
<seg id=638> Two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results. </seg>
<seg id=639> Latin America, the region that tried hardest to implement the "Washington Consensus" recipes--free trade, price deregulation, and privatization--has experienced low and volatile growth, with widening inequalities. </seg>
<seg id=640> Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, few have caught up with real output levels that prevailed before 1990. </seg>
<seg id=641> In Sub-Saharan Africa, most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and World Bank. </seg>
<seg id=642> The few instances of success occurred in countries that marched to their own drummers--and that are hardly poster children for neoliberalism. </seg>
<seg id=643> China, Vietnam, India: all three violated virtually every rule in the neoliberal guidebook, even as they moved in a more market-oriented direction. </seg>
<seg id=644> It is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus. </seg>
<seg id=645> But the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development, without falling into the trap of promulgating yet another impractical blueprint, supposedly right for all countries at all times. </seg>
<seg id=646> The record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term, and an institution-building strategy designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of adverse shocks. </seg>
<seg id=647> The key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy. </seg>
<seg id=648> Encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work. </seg>
<seg id=649> An effective strategy must accomplish two tasks: encourage investment in non-traditional areas, and weed out projects and investments that fail. </seg>
<seg id=650> For this, governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick. </seg>
<seg id=651> Learning what a country is (or can be) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development. </seg>
<seg id=652> The carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering, for example, that cut flowers, or soccer balls, or computer software can be produced at low cost, because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs. </seg>
<seg id=653> The entrepreneur who makes the initial "discovery" can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates, as other entrepreneurs will quickly emulate him. </seg>
<seg id=654> Consequently, entrepreneurship of this type--learning what can be produced--will typically be under-supplied in the absence of non-market incentives. </seg>
<seg id=655> In turn, the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in unproductive and wasteful investments. </seg>
<seg id=656> Implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country, depending on administrative capacity, the prevailing incentive regime, the flexibility of the fiscal system, the degree of sophistication of the financial sector, and the underlying political economy. </seg>
<seg id=657> Time-bound subsidy schemes, public venture funds, and export subsidization are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented, but there are many others. </seg>
<seg id=658> No single instrument will work everywhere. </seg>
<seg id=659> Governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to mess things up rather than improve allocation of resources. </seg>
<seg id=660> The job can be done, but economic growth requires more than eliciting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship. </seg>
<seg id=661> It also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build resilience to shocks: </seg>
<seg id=662> Market-creating institutions (for property rights and contract enforcement); </seg>
<seg id=663> Market-regulating institutions (for externalities, economies of scale, and information about companies); </seg>
<seg id=664> Market-stabilizing institutions (for monetary and fiscal management); </seg>
<seg id=665> Market-legitimizing institutions (for social protection and insurance). </seg>
<seg id=666> Building and solidifying these institutions, however, takes time. </seg>
<seg id=667> Using an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can pay high dividends later on. </seg>
<seg id=668> A key point here is that institutional arrangements are, by necessity, country-specific. </seg>
<seg id=669> Discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation. </seg>
<seg id=670> After all, institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate. </seg>
<seg id=671> Reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others. </seg>
<seg id=672> Such specificity helps explain why successful countries--China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, among others--usually combined unorthodox elements with orthodox policies. </seg>
<seg id=673> It also accounts for why important institutional differences persist among the advanced countries of North America, Western Europe, and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector, the legal system, corporate governance, financial markets, labor markets, and social insurance. </seg>
<seg id=674> While economic analysis can help in making institutional choices, there is also a large role for public deliberation and collective choice. </seg>
<seg id=675> In fact, we can think of participatory democracy as a meta-institution that helps select among the "menu" of possible institutional arrangements in each area. </seg>
<seg id=676> Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies. </seg>
<seg id=677> It is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually country-specific and do not respond well to standardized recipes. </seg>
<seg id=678> But it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted, relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic payoffs and start a virtuous cycle of growth and institutional reform. </seg>
<seg id=679> Adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics--far from it. </seg>
<seg id=680> Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy. </seg>
<seg id=681> In both cases, it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other. </seg>
<seg id=682> Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics--only its misuse. </seg>
<seg id=683> The Other Central Europe </seg>
<seg id=684> A specter is haunting Central Europe as its countries prepare for EU membership. </seg>
<seg id=685> That promising development is being endangered by a fevered electoral nationalism which seeks to gain votes by promising to reopen old wounds and settle old scores. </seg>
<seg id=686> The clearest case of this comes from Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban demanded an abrogation of President Edvard Benes' decrees of 1945 (which confiscated the assets of and stripped citizenship from the German and Hungarian populations deported from Czechoslovakia at that time) as part of a re-election campaign that failed narrowly. </seg>
<seg id=687> But Orban is not alone in seeing electoral advantage in summoning the memories of old ghosts. </seg>
<seg id=688> Orban argued that revoking the "Benes decrees" must be made a condition for the Czech Republic (as well as Slovakia) joining the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=689> The ill will Orban's gambit inspired brought to a halt much of the regional cooperation of the last decade. </seg>
<seg id=690> In its place, an ugly new form of national populism is emerging across the plain that extends between Bavaria and the Danube. </seg>
<seg id=691> The chain reaction of reawakening nationalisms is altering the political landscape in dangerous ways. </seg>
<seg id=692> Since the election that brought the coalition of Wolfgang Schüssel's and Jorg Haider's parties to power in Vienna, Austria's relations with the neighboring Czech Republic have deteriorated over two issues: a demand that the Czechs shutdown the Temelin nuclear power plant on the Austrian border, and revoke the Benes decrees in which Sudeten Germans were deported from Czechoslovakia and settled massively in Bavaria but also in Austria. </seg>
<seg id=693> When the nuclear plant issue was resolved, populist pressure was forced into a single channel, the demand to abrogate the Benes decrees. </seg>
<seg id=694> Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that he, too, could play a demagogic nationalist card. </seg>
<seg id=695> He described the Sudeten Germans as Hitler's "Fifth Column" and suggested that Israel could solve its Palestinian problem through resort to the Czech method of 1945: deportation. </seg>
<seg id=696> Edmund Stoiber, Bavaria's leader, the conservative CDU/CSU candidate for German chancellor against current Chancellor Schroeder, and a staunch advocate of the Sudeten Germans, demanded that Schroeder cancel a scheduled visit to Prague in response to Zeman's outburst. </seg>
<seg id=697> To defuse an electoral fight with his rival, Schroeder agreed. </seg>
<seg id=698> That Orban seconded Stoiber's demands came as something of a gift from god to the Slovak nationalist Vladimir Meciar in his bid to become Prime Minister once more, as it allowed him to argue that his domestic opponents were preparing to surrender to EU pressure and force Slovakia to compensate the Hungarians expelled by Benes in 1945. </seg>
<seg id=699> So Meciar pounced, denouncing the "Hungarian menace," undoing in a stroke four years of hard work by Slovakia's current government to integrate representatives of the ethnic Hungarian minority into Slovakia's government. </seg>
<seg id=700> Questions about postwar Europe's juridical order go beyond the former Czechoslovakia. </seg>
<seg id=701> Erika Steinbach, President of the Association of Deportees (from the East) and a member of Stoiber's CDU, argues that the issue of the deportation of German populations is one faced by Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenes, thus taking in most of East/Central Europe. </seg>
<seg id=702> In the 1930s, the pet hate of some Central European countries was "the Versailles Order." </seg>
<seg id=703> Today, it appears that the Potsdam declarations of 1945, which sanctioned the mass eviction of German populations, are the new enemy. </seg>
<seg id=704> The worry now is that such demagoguery may incite a cycle of populist victories. </seg>
<seg id=705> That worry was dented when Viktor Orban's Fidesz party lost in Hungary's recent parliamentary elections, but other politicians happy to demagogue national resentments - Vaclav Klaus in Prague, Edmund Stoiber in Germany, Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia - still see nationalism as an electoral plus despite Orban's defeat. </seg>
<seg id=706> Linked to EU skeptics like Italy's Berlusconi and Austria's Schüssel-Haider coalition, the very nature of European politics may turn decidedly nasty. </seg>
<seg id=707> Since its inception, the EU has sought to reach beyond past grief and, through cooperation, to build a better future. </seg>
<seg id=708> Today, some politicians want to capitalize on Eastern Europe's desire to be part of Europe to reopen historical issues to their political advantage. </seg>
<seg id=709> Two savage consequences are foreseeable: first, that there is no better way to turn parts of public opinion in the candidate countries against the EU than by allowing local populists to portray the Union as an agent of spreading German power. </seg>
<seg id=710> An extended EU should represent a means to balance the asymmetrical relationship between Eastern Europe's small countries with Germany. </seg>
<seg id=711> There's a chance that it would be perceived as a pointer to this asymmetry. </seg>
<seg id=712> The second worry is that, as NATO and the EU expand, these ugly debates will infect relations within these international bodies. </seg>
<seg id=713> Fear about this may be one reason why President Bush refused to meet Prime Minister Orban recently, and there are frequent suggestions that, had Orban spoken as he now does before Hungary joined NATO, his country's application would have been rejected. </seg>
<seg id=714> What can halt this? </seg>
<seg id=715> After 1945, Western Europe undertook painful debates about history, and these helped bring about Franco-German reconciliation. </seg>
<seg id=716> Notions about "collective guilt" were put aside as having no place in a united and uniting Europe. </seg>
<seg id=717> So President Vaclav Havel courageously argued during his first trip to Germany in January 1990, but his comments were mistaken for weakness. </seg>
<seg id=718> As EU expansion looms, Europe's mission must not become undermined by the advocates of that old and "other" Central Europe, politicians who prefer to wallow in the past rather than think in responsible ways about building a peaceful and prosperous Europe. </seg>
<seg id=719> Consequences of the Iraq War </seg>
<seg id=720> The Iraq war's main consequences will not be on the battlefield. </seg>
<seg id=721> They will come later, and will depend on whether George Bush and Tony Blair can justify their onslaught on a largely defenseless population. </seg>
<seg id=722> They launched this war for certain declared reasons, all of which were heatedly debated around the world. </seg>
<seg id=723> If they are vindicated, then the war could conceivably bring a safer world. </seg>
<seg id=724> If their arguments remain unproved or are disproved, then the war will incite instability. </seg>
<seg id=725> In that case, a critical step towards healing the world would be their quick departure from office. </seg>
<seg id=726> The Iraq War was not and could not be justified on the basis that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant. </seg>
<seg id=727> Justification, if it exists, rests on the danger Saddam's regime posed. </seg>
<seg id=728> Bush and Blair made four claims: </seg>
<seg id=729> Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction; </seg>
<seg id=730> those weapons pose a grave, immediate threat; </seg>
<seg id=731> UN inspections were not eliminating that threat; </seg>
<seg id=732> the threat could best be eliminated by war. </seg>
<seg id=733> The first claim should be the easiest to verify. </seg>
<seg id=734> Bush and Blair talked repeatedly about stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, massive underground and mobile units to produce or launch such weapons, and active programs to obtain nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id=735> It is incumbent upon Bush and Blair to prove their case, and to prove it in the face of worldwide suspicion that the US and UK security agencies might plant phony evidence. </seg>
<seg id=736> For this reason, independent UN experts should assess any evidence that is uncovered. </seg>
<seg id=737> If no evidence of such weapons is produced, then both Bush and Blair deserve to be finished politically, no matter what else happens in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=738> The second claim will be trickier to prove. </seg>
<seg id=739> Bush and Blair must show that any weapons of mass destruction that are recovered posed a grave and urgent threat. </seg>
<seg id=740> We know that Iraq at one time possessed chemical and biological weapons, because the US sold them to Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=741> The test is not whether traces of those weapons remain, as such traces will be found at disposal sites, but whether those weapons were poised for use in threatening amounts. </seg>
<seg id=742> If the Iraqis launch an attack with such weapons, this would demonstrate that the weapons were ready for use. </seg>
<seg id=743> Whether they posed any real threat outside Iraq's borders, or would have been used in the absence of the current war, must still be assessed. </seg>
<seg id=744> The third claim is hugely contentious. </seg>
<seg id=745> Bush and Blair should demonstrate that the UN inspection process was failing. </seg>
<seg id=746> This can be done by showing that the Iraqis were simply hiding the evidence at sites visited by the inspectors and declared free of weapons. </seg>
<seg id=747> There should be a systematic review of sites that were visited. </seg>
<seg id=748> There should also be an explanation, if weapons of mass destruction are uncovered at other sites, as to why the inspectors could not have found such weapons in a realistic period of time. </seg>
<seg id=749> The fourth claim will be subject to wild propaganda on both sides. </seg>
<seg id=750> Was the war justified in terms of costs and benefits, and was war really the last resort? </seg>
<seg id=751> This will depend on an objective assessment of the costs of the war in terms of loss of life, destruction of property, economic impact within Iraq, spillovers into other forms of violence such as terrorism, and geopolitical consequences. </seg>
<seg id=752> To date, Bush and Blair have failed to make the case to the world, with the partial exception of their own countries. </seg>
<seg id=753> The American people have been treated to a spectacle of jingoism, fear mongering, confusion of Iraq with Osama bin Laden's terrorists, and simple patriotism. </seg>
<seg id=754> None of this swayed the rest of the world, which views the war with disdain and alarm. </seg>
<seg id=755> This would change if evidence on the four points is mustered. </seg>
<seg id=756> When the 13 British colonies in North America launched their own War of Independence, Thomas Jefferson understood that "the decent respect to the opinions of mankind" required an explanation for that war, which he set forth in the Declaration of Independence. </seg>
<seg id=757> Such an explanation, backed by rigorous evidence, is no less necessary today. </seg>
<seg id=758> If the arguments for war are not proved, the consequences will be profound. </seg>
<seg id=759> Propaganda, streets lined with cheering Iraqis, amazement over the prowess of US smart bombs, would not distract us from an awful truth-that Bush and Blair shattered world peace, engaged in massive premeditated killing, and did so against overwhelming global opinion. </seg>
<seg id=760> Healing today's divided world could start only with fresh political leadership in both the US and UK, and a strong assertion of UN authority. </seg>
<seg id=761> Given the terrible costs, I hope that this war will prove justified, though I have my doubts based on the current evidence. </seg>
<seg id=762> If compelling evidence proves that weapons of mass destruction were at hand; that they were poised for use on a threatening scale; that the UN inspectors had poor prospects of uncovering and dismantling those weapons, then we must acknowledge the arguments made by Bush and Blair. </seg>
<seg id=763> Even in those circumstances, war might well have been unwise compared to a policy of containment. </seg>
<seg id=764> Still, the war would then at least make some sense. </seg>
<seg id=765> The horrors of a senseless war are almost too frightening to contemplate. </seg>
<seg id=766> Remembering and Forgetting Zhao Ziyang </seg>
<seg id=767> So, at last former Chinese Premier and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang has died. </seg>
<seg id=768> But the political agenda that he espoused while in office passed away long ago, on May 19, 1989, when he appeared in Tiananmen Square just before dawn to beg tearfully for the forgiveness of protesters. </seg>
<seg id=769> "I am very sorry," he said to startled onlookers. </seg>
<seg id=770> "I have come too late." </seg>
<seg id=771> After that, he existed more as an historical chimera than as a real person. </seg>
<seg id=772> When his bizarre and unscheduled appearance in the square was broadcast on Central Chinese Television the next morning -- during one of the last days of uncensored media coverage -- people across China were stunned by this fleeting moment of all-too-human, official anguish. </seg>
<seg id=773> After all, Party leaders rarely evince their personal feelings in public, much less transgress the Party line as brazenly as Zhao did. </seg>
<seg id=774> Such individualism fit neither Leninist nor traditional Chinese proscriptions for behavior by a high official. </seg>
<seg id=775> As the crackdown following those heady weeks of free expression and assembly came to its apocalyptic end on the night of June 3-4, Zhao vanished, sucked down the Party's memory hole into which so many other leaders have vanished since China's "socialist liberation." </seg>
<seg id=776> To the discredit of the democratic world, hardly any head of state remonstrated on Zhao's behalf, minimally demanding that some accounting be made for his illegal and immoral incarceration. </seg>
<seg id=777> Instead, Zhao was allowed to remain in suspended animation, under house arrest, conveniently forgotten like some cryogenically frozen celebrity with no hope of resurrection. </seg>
<seg id=778> Zhao was not killed, but allowed to live in an old Beijing courtyard house with his family. </seg>
<seg id=779> He was let out from time to time, but under guard like a zoo animal, to go to some spa or to play solitary holes of golf, one of the many manifestations of "bourgeois liberalization" that his reform efforts allowed to leak through China's once hermetic seal. </seg>
<seg id=780> Chinese have long since used the deaths of defrocked leaders as occasions to let out sentiments that can find no expression through the normal political process. </seg>
<seg id=781> During the winter of 1976, when Premier Zhou Enlai (viewed as a relative liberal in the Maoist hierarchy) died, tens of thousands of people spontaneously flooded Tiananmen Square, giving the Party a tremendous fright. </seg>
<seg id=782> It was, of course, the death of former Party chief Hu Yaobang, a liberal like Zhao, which set off the protests in 1989. </seg>
<seg id=783> Whether Zhao's supporters will express themselves in a similar fashion is uncertain. </seg>
<seg id=784> The events of 1989 remain so sensitive, and Tiananmen Square so securely guarded, that it is hard to imagine a protest happening there soon. </seg>
<seg id=785> At the same time, China seems so drugged on business nowadays that it is hard to imagine many people marching for a cause that would do nothing for their bottom line. </seg>
<seg id=786> It's almost as if the Communist Party had turned Marx on his head, replacing religion with profit as the new "opium of the masses." </seg>
<seg id=787> Few outside of the lumpen classes of unemployed workers and dispossessed peasants seem to have any gusto for political protest. </seg>
<seg id=788> By contrast, Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history when to be a reformer meant to take on not only the economy, but every aspect of life. </seg>
<seg id=789> Before becoming Premier and Party chief, he experimented with everything from the de-collectivization of agriculture and separation of the Party from business to laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness toward the outside world for ordinary people. </seg>
<seg id=790> He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than a Mao habit when traveling abroad, as well as the first to hold an open press conference. </seg>
<seg id=791> Although Zhao was no visionary, no Vaclav Havel or Lech Walesa, and not even anti-communist, his agenda in the mid-1980's embraced the economy, politics, culture, media, and society, and it led to one of the most open and intellectually rich periods of Chinese history. </seg>
<seg id=792> It was a tragic paradox that the political movement that so peacefully swept China in 1989 ended up arresting the process of broad-based, evolutionary reform to which Zhao consecrated his life. </seg>
<seg id=793> So chastened by the trauma of June 4 was the Party leadership that, for several years afterwards, it was unclear if any reform would survive. </seg>
<seg id=794> Then, in 1992, Deng Xiaoping set in motion one of the most rapid and total marketizations of a society in history, catalyzing China's spectacular rise as an economic superpower. </seg>
<seg id=795> Zhao Ziyang's death reminds us not only of how unjustly he was treated, but of how lopsided China's reforms have been. </seg>
<seg id=796> For China's "miracle" to truly become miraculous, Party leaders could do worse than study the record of a man whose legacy they now seem eager to push into oblivion. </seg>
<seg id=797> The Real Risks of Deficits </seg>
<seg id=798> Deficits are back--with a vengeance. </seg>
<seg id=799> America's government budget deficit now stands at $455 billion, 4.1% of GDP. </seg>
<seg id=800> Two years ago, the US predicted budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. </seg>
<seg id=801> Although marginally less bloated than the US deficit, other rich countries are drowning in red ink. </seg>
<seg id=802> The European Commission predicts that the French government deficit will reach 3.7% of GDP this year, with Germany's widening to 3.4%--both figures well beyond the deficit cap (3% of GDP) set by the Euro-zone's Stability and Growth Pact. </seg>
<seg id=803> By running a deficit, a country increases its national debt and imposes burdens on future generations. </seg>
<seg id=804> Politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is shifted between generations. </seg>
<seg id=805> Their priority is paying for immediate problems, and for today's promised benefits. </seg>
<seg id=806> The accountants who compute government deficits try to keep politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding something of the future cost. </seg>
<seg id=807> But what these accountants do not provide is a way to judge when deficits are justifiable and when they are not. </seg>
<seg id=808> Deficits raise not only immediate political issues, but also issues of distributive justice between generations, and of intergenerational risk sharing. </seg>
<seg id=809> No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation. </seg>
<seg id=810> Whether or not deficits treat future generations properly depends on how a government's systems for taxation and expenditure are designed. </seg>
<seg id=811> Those who advocate running deficits often portray them as necessary to fix an economy in which confidence is draining away. </seg>
<seg id=812> Following Keynes, they argue that running deficits will restore confidence before a recession or depression can take hold. </seg>
<seg id=813> It is like putting a patient on Prozac before he becomes suicidal. </seg>
<seg id=814> But such arguments, although valid at times, have their limits. </seg>
<seg id=815> Japan's public deficits spawned a national debt of 140% of annual GDP, without producing any economic resurgence. </seg>
<seg id=816> Indeed, today's budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not what Keynesian theory envisions. </seg>
<seg id=817> So discussions about deficits should be recast in terms of the really long-term intergenerational issues that matter. </seg>
<seg id=818> The issues are subtle, because they hinge on what future governments may do. </seg>
<seg id=819> In the past, some governments, when faced with large national debts, effectively ``inflated them away.'' </seg>
<seg id=820> They thus shifted the debt burden away from the next generation and onto investors who did not bail out of the bond market at the first sign of rising prices, or who postponed buying a house when inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage debt. </seg>
<seg id=821> Governments could decide to act this way again, especially if national debts grow bigger. </seg>
<seg id=822> A resurgence of substantial inflation may seem unthinkable in today's environment, but remember that even a relatively modest 6% annual inflation rate cuts the real value of a nation's debt in half in just 11 years. </seg>
<seg id=823> Continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id=824> Some future politicians may succeed again in planting the idea that inflation, being stimulative, is good for the economy. </seg>
<seg id=825> But in addition to today's officially measured government deficits, there are also other looming obligations caused by a demographic change (declining birth rates) and the prospect of huge social-welfare payments in the future. </seg>
<seg id=826> The scale of these obligations is monumental. </seg>
<seg id=827> In their 2003 report, the Trustees of the US Social Security Administration Trust Funds estimate that maintaining the Social Security System's solvency for the next 75 years will require an amount whose present value is $3.5 trillion, nearly equal to today's total US government debt ($3.9 trillion). </seg>
<seg id=828> The Trustees of the US Medicare Trust Funds (providing medical services to the retired) estimate that their unfunded obligations have a present value of $5.9 trillion--50% larger than America's official publicly-held national debt. </seg>
<seg id=829> The potential for budgetary shortfall with social security and health care is even worse in Europe and Japan, due to their more troublesome demographics. </seg>
<seg id=830> Moreover, unlike official national debt, social-welfare obligations are not fixed in currency. </seg>
<seg id=831> Instead, they are promises of a certain standard of living (including the value of medical services), corrected for inflation. </seg>
<seg id=832> No government can thus ``inflate them away.'' </seg>
<seg id=833> But this does not mean that pensions and other welfare obligations are entirely fixed. </seg>
<seg id=834> What it does mean is that the problem is political. </seg>
<seg id=835> Pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy, and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental an issue. </seg>
<seg id=836> Still, we need to face squarely the intergenerational issues at the core of today's economic dilemmas. </seg>
<seg id=837> Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a ``generational accounting'' that assures that economic risk is spread systematically across generations. </seg>
<seg id=838> What this means is that pension and tax institutions must be designed to take better account of the changing circumstances facing different generations, rather than make fixed promises--which most likely cannot be kept, anyway--of a certain payout in the future. </seg>
<seg id=839> For example, when demographic trends or persistent economic hardships impose undue social-welfare burdens on working people, benefits to pensioners should be automatically modified by raising the retirement age and/or adjusting benefits. </seg>
<seg id=840> Such adjustments will probably happen anyway in the coming decades, but only after a long lag and with many inequities in the process. </seg>
<seg id=841> What we need is the right system from the beginning, so that we can rationally manage risks that span several generations. </seg>
<seg id=842> Can these issues be addressed now, when the economic slowdown in most advanced countries makes most politicians focus on short-term fixes? </seg>
<seg id=843> Hard times, like the Great Depression, have been occasions for fundamental changes. </seg>
<seg id=844> With proper leadership (which unfortunately seems in short supply), today's milder hardships could provide an opportunity for public discussion of better ways of intergenerational risk sharing. </seg>
<seg id=845> Just Say No to Bush </seg>
<seg id=846> For three years, America's president has pursued a unilateralist agenda, ignoring all evidence that contradicts his positions, and putting aside basic and longstanding American principles. </seg>
<seg id=847> Take global warming. </seg>
<seg id=848> Here Bush is conspicuously absent without leave (AWOL in military jargon). </seg>
<seg id=849> Time and again, he questions the scientific evidence. </seg>
<seg id=850> (Of course, Bush's academic credentials were never very impressive.) </seg>
<seg id=851> Bush's position is more than wrong; it is an embarrassment. </seg>
<seg id=852> Indeed, when asked by Bush to look into the matter, America's National Academy of Sciences came to a resounding verdict (the only one they could honestly reach) that greenhouse gases are a menace. </seg>
<seg id=853> But America's automakers love their gas-guzzlers, and Bush's oil industry pals want no interference with their destruction of the planet's atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id=854> So no change in policy. </seg>
<seg id=855> In Iraq, Bush again pursued a unilateralist agenda, saying that there was incontrovertible evidence of a link with Al Queda, and that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. </seg>
<seg id=856> Even before the invasion, there was overwhelming evidence that Bush was lying. </seg>
<seg id=857> Detection technology made it clear that Iraq did not have nuclear weapons, as chief UN inspector Hans Blix pointed out. </seg>
<seg id=858> It's possible that Bush read those reports, but that they were beyond his comprehension. </seg>
<seg id=859> It is also possible that he did not believe what he read. </seg>
<seg id=860> Whatever the case, American policy was not based on evidence. </seg>
<seg id=861> Since the Cold War's end, America is the world's sole superpower. </seg>
<seg id=862> Yet it has failed to exercise the kind of leadership needed to create a new world order based on principles like fairness. </seg>
<seg id=863> Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this; but they don't vote in American elections. </seg>
<seg id=864> Even so, the rest of the world is not powerless. </seg>
<seg id=865> Instead, the rest of the world should </seg>
<seg id=866> America has not won the hearts and minds of those in Iraq; indeed, it has lost them, just as it has lost the hearts and minds of much of the world. </seg>
<seg id=867> The US wants to retain control of the occupation, but it wants others to receive the bullets now mowing down American soldiers. </seg>
<seg id=868> UN soldiers should not bear the consequence of America's failure to manage the occupation, so US cries for financial help should fall on deaf ears. </seg>
<seg id=869> What sympathy does the US agenda deserve, when President Bush has ladled out tax cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest people in the world. </seg>
<seg id=870> It was not long ago that a Republican Congress held up $1 billion of UN dues, and threatened that it would only pay what it owed if the UN satisfied a raft of conditions. </seg>
<seg id=871> America's unwillingness to provide small sums to wage peace contrasts sharply with the huge amounts Congress quickly granted to wage war. </seg>
<seg id=872> Advocates of a softer approach say that if the UN stays on the sidelines, it will become irrelevant; by participating in Iraq, it will build trust with America, so that the next time a dispute such as this arises, America will turn earlier to the UN. </seg>
<seg id=873> Nonsense. </seg>
<seg id=874> Those in the White House today believe in </seg>
<seg id=875> I normally write about economics, not politics. </seg>
<seg id=876> But in the new world of globalization, there is greater economic interdependence, which requires more collective action, rules and institutions, and an international rule of law. </seg>
<seg id=877> Economic globalization has, however, outpaced political globalization; the processes for decision making are far from democratic, or even transparent. </seg>
<seg id=878> In no small measure, the failures of globalization can be traced to the same mindset that led to the failures in Iraq: multilateral institutions must serve not just one country's interest, but all countries'. </seg>
<seg id=879> At the recent World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Cancun, the developing countries put America--and Europe--on notice that this system can no longer continue. </seg>
<seg id=880> In that case, Europe was as much the culprit as America. </seg>
<seg id=881> Europe has no trouble seeing the dangers of unilateralism in America's actions, in everything from abandoning Kyoto to its refusal to join the International Criminal Court. </seg>
<seg id=882> But Europe should also reflect on its own practices, including trade policy, where the EU works systematically to unbalance the global trade regime against developing countries, despite promising that those imbalances would be corrected in the current round of trade negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=883> Here, Europe acts like America, which has long talked the rhetoric of free trade, while its actions have long ignored the principles. </seg>
<seg id=884> Forget about America's rhetoric of upholding fairness and justice; in trade negotiations, the US ignores the pleas of the poorest countries of the world to eliminate the cotton subsidies that have had so devastating an effect on them. </seg>
<seg id=885> If we are to make the world politically more secure and economically more stable and prosperous, political globalization will have to catch up with economic globalization. </seg>
<seg id=886> Principles of democracy, social justice, social solidarity, and the rule of law need to be extended beyond national boundaries. </seg>
<seg id=887> Europe and the rest of the world will have to do their part--abiding by these principles themselves, and giving each other, and America, a shove in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id=888> Right now, this entails `Just Saying No' to President Bush. </seg>
<seg id=889> The True Costs of the Iraq War </seg>
<seg id=890> The most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless. </seg>
<seg id=891> But that doesn't mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), like defense, should not be subjected to cool, hard economic analysis. </seg>
<seg id=892> Shortly before the current Iraq war, when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $100 and $200 billion, other officials quickly demurred. </seg>
<seg id=893> For example, Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels put the number at $60 billion. </seg>
<seg id=894> It now appears that Lindsey's numbers were a gross underestimate. </seg>
<seg id=895> Concerned that the Bush administration might be misleading everyone about the Iraq war's costs, just as it had about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connection with Al Qaida, I teamed up with Linda Bilmes, a budget expert at Harvard, to examine the issue. </seg>
<seg id=896> Even we, as opponents of the war, were staggered by what we found, with conservative to moderate estimates ranging from slightly less than a trillion dollars to more than $2 trillion. </seg>
<seg id=897> Our analysis starts with the $500 billion that the Congressional Budget Office openly talks about, which is still ten times higher than what the administration said the war would cost. </seg>
<seg id=898> Its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government. </seg>
<seg id=899> And the budgetary costs are but a fraction of the costs to the economy as a whole. </seg>
<seg id=900> For example, the Bush administration has been doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely wounded -- 16,000 so far, including roughly 20% with serious brain and head injuries. </seg>
<seg id=901> So it is no surprise that its figure of $500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come. </seg>
<seg id=902> Nor does the administration want to face up to the military's recruiting and retention problems. </seg>
<seg id=903> The result is large re-enlistment bonuses, improved benefits, and higher recruiting costs -- up 20% just from 2003 to 2005. </seg>
<seg id=904> Moreover, the war is extremely wearing on equipment, some of which will have to be replaced. </seg>
<seg id=905> These budgetary costs (exclusive of interest) amount to $652 billion in our conservative estimate and $799 billion in our moderate estimate. </seg>
<seg id=906> Arguably, since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes, the expenditures have been debt financed, and the interest costs on this debt add another $98 billion (conservative) to $385 billion (moderate) to the budgetary costs. </seg>
<seg id=907> Of course, the brunt of the costs of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families. </seg>
<seg id=908> But the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings. </seg>
<seg id=909> Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million). </seg>
<seg id=910> But the costs don't stop there. </seg>
<seg id=911> The Bush administration once claimed that the Iraq war would be good for the economy, with one spokesperson even suggesting that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices. </seg>
<seg id=912> As in so many other ways, things have turned out differently: the oil companies are the big winners, while the American and global economies are losers. </seg>
<seg id=913> Being extremely conservative, we estimate the overall effect on the economy if only $5 or $10 of the increase is attributed to the war. </seg>
<seg id=914> At the same time, money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id=915> We estimate that if a proportion of that money had been allocated to domestic investment in roads, schools, and research, the American economy would have been stimulated more in the short run, and its growth would have been enhanced in the long run. </seg>
<seg id=916> There are a number of other costs, some potentially quite large, although quantifying them is problematic. </seg>
<seg id=917> For instance, Americans pay some $300 billion annually for the "option value" of military preparedness -- being able to fight wherever needed. </seg>
<seg id=918> That Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs. </seg>
<seg id=919> But there is little doubt that the option value has been greatly impaired and will likely remain so for several years. </seg>
<seg id=920> In short, even our "moderate" estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America's involvement in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=921> And our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself. </seg>
<seg id=922> We do not attempt to explain whether the American people were deliberately misled regarding the war's costs, or whether the Bush administration's gross underestimate should be attributed to incompetence, as it vehemently argues is true in the case of weapons of mass destruction. </seg>
<seg id=923> Nor do we attempt to assess whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging the war. </seg>
<seg id=924> Recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs. </seg>
<seg id=925> Certainly, when a war's timing is a matter of choice, as in this case, inadequate preparation is even less justifiable. </seg>
<seg id=926> But such considerations appear to be beyond the Bush administration's reckoning. </seg>
<seg id=927> Elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and elsewhere in government for almost a half-century. </seg>
<seg id=928> The Iraq war was an immense "project," yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was greatly flawed and that of its costs virtually absent. </seg>
<seg id=929> One cannot help but wonder: were there alternative ways of spending a fraction of the war's $1-$2 trillion in costs that would have better strengthened security, boosted prosperity, and promoted democracy? </seg>
<seg id=930> Is Freedom Enough? </seg>
<seg id=931> Do democracies need values? </seg>
<seg id=932> The question seems absurd in the light of photographs of American soldiers torturing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners. </seg>
<seg id=933> But the fact is that the advance of democracy historically entailed the erosion of shared values and the rise of individual autonomy. </seg>
<seg id=934> It presupposed moral agnosticism and a plurality of meanings, none of which are sacred or compulsory to all. </seg>
<seg id=935> Democracy does nurture some common values, but they are overwhelmingly liberal values - in other words, individual rights trump collective obligations. </seg>
<seg id=936> For contemporary democrats, the fullest possible respect for the autonomous individual is, as Thomas Jefferson put it, "self-evident." </seg>
<seg id=937> But are civil, political, and human rights enough to ensure the strength and survival of democracies? </seg>
<seg id=938> Are today's democracies virtuous enough to rally the energies - including self-sacrifice - needed to defeat their enemies? </seg>
<seg id=939> Such questions were never so urgent in the past, partly because fundamental democratic values were less abstract than they seem nowadays. </seg>
<seg id=940> Such values animated the fight against Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism, fascism, and military dictatorship; in their name, decolonization was achieved, and minorities gained equality and dignity. </seg>
<seg id=941> Democracy's values may be one-sided on behalf of individual rights, but this has also made them universal, legitimizing the struggle against oppression, wherever it is played out. </seg>
<seg id=942> But in the world's most advanced countries, the promise of material prosperity that freedom made possible has long since replaced attention to and defense of fundamental democratic values as the cement of society. </seg>
<seg id=943> Western citizens do not rush to emulate the freedom fighters who built their world, despite celebrations, memorials, and the persistence of oppression. </seg>
<seg id=944> The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States allegedly changed everything - not only international relations, but the balance between rights and obligations that we long took for granted. </seg>
<seg id=945> In fact, the attacks, while surprising in their method, symbolic character, and scope, changed nothing. </seg>
<seg id=946> By themselves, they merely revealed the urgency of a fundamental reappraisal that has long been necessary. </seg>
<seg id=947> What is the Western model of democratic development really worth? </seg>
<seg id=948> Some non-democratic systems seem to evoke deeper support, because they are based on religious or national communal solidarity, and because closed societies minimize doubt, drift, and criticism. </seg>
<seg id=949> Beyond fundamental freedoms and economic prosperity, do we have a specific civilization to defend? </seg>
<seg id=950> Ours is a civilization that accepts selfishness towards one's own family and group; that tolerates, with few exceptions, autonomy in moral matters; and that considers blasphemy, criticism of authority, and even civil disobedience fundamental freedoms. </seg>
<seg id=951> Our civilization, despite its drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, incivility, and vandalism, will always be better than rule by Mullahs or soldiers, because its social problems can be allayed, if never entirely eliminated, without changing the foundations of the regime. </seg>
<seg id=952> This is not true of totalitarian or fundamentalist regimes, because, to foster free societies, they must be deposed. </seg>
<seg id=953> But if our civilization is worth defending, why is it that fundamentalists, of whatever stripe, have the most committed fighters on their side? </seg>
<seg id=954> Can we oppose them with anything but individual rights? </seg>
<seg id=955> Two opposite temptations must be resisted. </seg>
<seg id=956> The first temptation, characteristic of frightened societies, is a rush to embrace so-called "traditional" values, with their implications of withdrawal, closure, intolerance, and even hatred. </seg>
<seg id=957> The second temptation is a purely military policy that fixates on physical strength without considering how to project greater credibility and fairness. </seg>
<seg id=958> Of course, when enemies are already attacking, one cannot afford to ask too many questions. </seg>
<seg id=959> But when enemies are merely threatening, it is better first to assert legitimacy, and thus acquire some credibility at home and abroad. </seg>
<seg id=960> To do so, there cannot be too wide a gap between our stated principles and our actual behavior. </seg>
<seg id=961> Nor can we claim, as we used to, that our values spring from God, nature, reason, or historical laws. </seg>
<seg id=962> Our values reflect the democratic debate itself, nothing more, and our defense of them must address three related fields. </seg>
<seg id=963> First, we must update our social contract. </seg>
<seg id=964> France's ongoing public debate about secularism and legislation is an important effort in this direction, even if the debate could be better organized to demonstrate the link between principles, social and anthropological facts, and public policy. </seg>
<seg id=965> Such a debate should also involve education - its rules, objectives, and contents. </seg>
<seg id=966> In many countries, however, political parties find it difficult even to contemplate such debates. </seg>
<seg id=967> The second axis of values concerns social justice and the environment. </seg>
<seg id=968> Issues linked to inequality, the distribution of wealth, and our exploitation of the natural world will become increasingly salient. </seg>
<seg id=969> This debate has not happened in the US, despite vague attempts at the beginning of the first Clinton administration; it has barely begun with Tony Blair's "Third Way" in the UK, or with Gerhard Schröder's variant in Germany. </seg>
<seg id=970> In France, the debate has stalled altogether due to bitter distributive conflicts, deep division within the Left, and the Right's absence of an economic and social vision. </seg>
<seg id=971> What remains are the values linked to the global order, defense of which requires leading by example, not by narrow, legalistic initiatives aimed at crisis management or conflict resolution. </seg>
<seg id=972> This approach too often sacrifices long-term essential objectives to short-term concerns. </seg>
<seg id=973> The fight for democracy cannot be selective. </seg>
<seg id=974> A desirable vision for the future of humanity must appeal to universally shared conceptions of justice and equity. </seg>
<seg id=975> We must all become freedom fighters. </seg>
<seg id=976> Elections Are Venezuela's Last Chance </seg>
<seg id=977> Venezuela is mired in a dangerous stalemate. </seg>
<seg id=978> President Hugo Chávez clings to power despite the obvious failings of his government: severe economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization. </seg>
<seg id=979> The opposition, tainted by their botched coup of April 2002, now seeks to force Chávez from office through a costly general strike. </seg>
<seg id=980> Both sides justify their intransigence with one-sided interpretations. </seg>
<seg id=981> His sympathizers glorify Chávez as a defender of the poor besieged by a selfish, coup-plotting elite. </seg>
<seg id=982> His fiercest opponents demonize Chávez as an autocrat pursuing a Cuban-style revolution and destroying democracy. </seg>
<seg id=983> Both interpretations are flawed. </seg>
<seg id=984> The Chávez government has not helped Venezuela's poor in any significant way. </seg>
<seg id=985> On the contrary, his belligerent rhetoric and inept governance scared off investors, inciting economic decline and boosting unemployment and poverty. </seg>
<seg id=986> Now Chávez lacks majority backing even among the poor. </seg>
<seg id=987> The opposition comprises most of Venezuela's organized civil society, not only business, but also trade unions, professional associations, and NGOs. </seg>
<seg id=988> So Venezuela's polarization does not pit "the poor" against "the oligarchy," but a populist against civil society. </seg>
<seg id=989> The opposition's view--shared by rightists in the Bush administration--is equally unconvincing. </seg>
<seg id=990> Rather than initiating a revolution, Chávez merely spouts fiery rhetoric. </seg>
<seg id=991> While his democratic credentials are dubious, he has not </seg>
<seg id=992> But Chávez's insistence on the inviolability of the current constitution is hypocritical. </seg>
<seg id=993> Four years ago, Chávez deviated from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to engineer a new one, tailor-made for him. </seg>
<seg id=994> Now he invokes that charter to block calls for a plebiscite on his continuation in office. </seg>
<seg id=995> The paradox here is that Chávez's earlier example may provide the solution to today's standoff. </seg>
<seg id=996> As Chávez used para-constitutional means to advance a desire for change in 1999, so the international community should not be confined by the present constitution in pressing to resolve a crisis that is ruining the country. </seg>
<seg id=997> In fact, the Latin American members of the "group of friendly nations" trying to mediate this conflict can draw on interesting experiences to design such a solution. </seg>
<seg id=998> After all, confrontations like this are not unusual in Latin America's rigid presidential systems. </seg>
<seg id=999> When chief executives with fixed terms of office lose political support, they cannot be removed through a no-confidence vote, as in parliamentary systems. </seg>
<seg id=1000> Presidential systems therefore risk lengthy stand-offs that threaten democracy--as in Venezuela today. </seg>
<seg id=1001> But over the last decade, Latin American politicians have made presidential systems more flexible by finding innovative ways to remove unpopular presidents. </seg>
<seg id=1002> One of Chávez's discredited predecessors was impeached on flimsy charges of malfeasance; Ecuador's Congress declared a disastrous chief executive "mentally incompetent"; in Peru, an autocratic president, after months of domestic and international pressure, was forced into exile. </seg>
<seg id=1003> While politicians interpreted the law with a good deal of creativity in these instances, they usually did so to ensure the survival of fragile democracies facing a crisis. </seg>
<seg id=1004> As long as these maneuvers do not proliferate and turn into easy ammunition for the opposition of the moment, they may provide a safety valve for presidential systems. </seg>
<seg id=1005> International monitoring can also safeguard against frivolous use of such mechanisms. </seg>
<seg id=1006> It is to be hoped that the group of friendly nations can help design an innovative solution to Venezuela's standoff. </seg>
<seg id=1007> To be acceptable to both sides, such a solution must deviate from the favorite proposals of each. </seg>
<seg id=1008> The opposition prefers an "up-or-down" vote on Chávez's continuation in office, which it would most likely win--and which Chávez will never accept. </seg>
<seg id=1009> Chávez insists on the recall referendum mechanism included in his constitution, which the opposition cannot tolerate: removing the president in this way would require a larger absolute number of votes than Chávez garnered in the last election. </seg>
<seg id=1010> But rising abstention makes this virtually impossible. </seg>
<seg id=1011> Both proposals are thus politically unfeasible. </seg>
<seg id=1012> Only a democratic mechanism for conflict resolution that has an uncertain outcome has any chance of being adopted. </seg>
<seg id=1013> That mechanism is an election, to be held as soon as possible (realistically, by this summer). </seg>
<seg id=1014> Both sides will have to work hard if they want to win. </seg>
<seg id=1015> The fractious opposition will need to go beyond rejection of Chávez, elaborate a program for the country's reconstruction, and unite behind an attractive candidate. </seg>
<seg id=1016> President Chávez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his "Bolivarian Revolution." </seg>
<seg id=1017> Since Chávez is a skilled campaigner and the opposition so far lacks unity, he will have a realistic chance of winning--which should make a new contest acceptable to him. </seg>
<seg id=1018> Pressure from the group of friendly nations may induce both sides to accept this last chance to avoid a political and economic meltdown. </seg>
<seg id=1019> Elections can be made legitimate through a constitutional amendment shortening the presidential term, as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent mediation effort. </seg>
<seg id=1020> Since this is designed to defuse an exceptional crisis, it would not become a precedent that encourages frivolous attacks on Latin America's democratically elected governments. </seg>
<seg id=1021> An election now in Venezuela will save, not undermine, democracy. </seg>
<seg id=1022> Syria's Dangerous Liaisons </seg>
<seg id=1023> All eyes turned to Syria following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. </seg>
<seg id=1024> Opposition groups in Lebanon, as well as Hariri supporters, openly accused Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime of being responsible for the killing. </seg>
<seg id=1025> The Bush administration, while not formally blaming Syria, virtually did so and recalled its ambassador to Damascus. </seg>
<seg id=1026> The US is said to be extremely angry at Syria's refusal to withdraw its forces from Lebanon in line with a United Nations resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1027> Growing opposition to Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is but one of four related problems Syria faces, all of which it has addressed inadequately. </seg>
<seg id=1028> The other three are Syria's behavior in Iraq, its relations with the US, and the need for domestic reform. </seg>
<seg id=1029> While corrosive immobility is a trademark of the Syrian regime, these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria internationally even more so than today. </seg>
<seg id=1030> In Lebanon, the Syrians have repeatedly misread the Bush administration's intentions. </seg>
<seg id=1031> Last September, the US, together with France, sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding a Syrian pullout and the disarming of militias -- mainly Hezbollah. </seg>
<seg id=1032> This came after Assad last September imposed an unconstitutional extension of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud's mandate, despite French and American warnings. </seg>
<seg id=1033> Yet to this day, Syrian officials privately say that they don't think the US is serious about a withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id=1034> Syria's leaders also continue to dismiss demands from within Lebanon for an end to Syria's 28-year military presence. </seg>
<seg id=1035> Such demands escalated dramatically after Hariri's death, as tens of thousands of the former prime minister's partisans, who previously sat on the fence when it came to Syria, shouted "Syria out." </seg>
<seg id=1036> Indeed, a broad multi-communal opposition front has formed in Beirut to demand Syria's departure. </seg>
<seg id=1037> Yet rather than address the front's demands and shape a healthy bilateral relationship between equal countries, Syria has sought to divide the opposition and reassert control. </seg>
<seg id=1038> Hariri's assassination makes that far more difficult, and Syria must prepare for a strong backlash from the US and France. </seg>
<seg id=1039> In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003, Damascus has shown undue nostalgia for the old system. </seg>
<seg id=1040> Though the Syrian and Iraqi Baath parties were bitter foes, there was consolation in that both were members of a confederacy of despotisms. </seg>
<seg id=1041> For the Syrians, a democratic Iraq friendly to the US was always far worse than Saddam Hussein, the enemy they knew -- and later profitably traded with -- during the years of international sanctions against Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=1042> Syria's suspected support for Iraqi Baathist exiles threatens to damage relations with the new Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=1043> Baghdad has repeatedly accused the Assad regime of allowing Iraqi funds to be channeled to insurgents, and recently notified the Syrians that the photograph of a senior Syrian intelligence official taken with an Islamist combatant was found on the latter's body in Falluja. </seg>
<seg id=1044> As a legitimate Iraqi authority emerges following the elections, the Syrians will have to show foresight in jettisoning their pro-Saddam acquaintances. </seg>
<seg id=1045> The Bush administration's growing impatience with Syrian involvement in the Iraqi insurgency is a major reason for Syria's deteriorating relationship with the US. </seg>
<seg id=1046> Indeed, there is palpable disdain for Syria in Washington. </seg>
<seg id=1047> That is why Syria's denials that it is playing a spoiler role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously, and why Assad has not gained American support for renewed negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights. </seg>
<seg id=1048> There are signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues as well. </seg>
<seg id=1049> For example, Assad apparently still does not realize how much the Bush administration associates his regime with terrorism. </seg>
<seg id=1050> Syrian officials believe that because the Baath Party is secular, the US will invariably support it against an Islamist resurgence. </seg>
<seg id=1051> They fail to see that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq, and Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id=1052> At home, Assad's regime also finds itself in a bind. </seg>
<seg id=1053> Political and economic reform, when it advances, does so at a glacial pace. </seg>
<seg id=1054> A major item of discussion in Syria is the revival of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system offering few incentives except to regime grandees. </seg>
<seg id=1055> France's opposition to Syria's presence in Lebanon was at least partly a reflection of disenchantment with Assad's reformist ambitions, and the European Union has expressed similar reservations. </seg>
<seg id=1056> Assad is now in a consolidation phase, leaving little room for reform. </seg>
<seg id=1057> Indeed, his new interior minister, Ghazi Kanaan, an old-school hardliner, spearheaded a crackdown on reformers and Kurds in the past year or so. </seg>
<seg id=1058> The reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad's preferences. </seg>
<seg id=1059> In the coming month, several rounds of retirements should allow the president to place more of his people in positions of power. </seg>
<seg id=1060> Consolidation, however, is not reform. </seg>
<seg id=1061> Assad must show that his enhanced authority can lead to genuine transformation. </seg>
<seg id=1062> Until now, the president has toed a hard line on Iraq, on Lebanon, and in domestic affairs. </seg>
<seg id=1063> If he's a reformer, few are convinced. </seg>
<seg id=1064> Syria may pay a heavy price for that ambiguity. </seg>
