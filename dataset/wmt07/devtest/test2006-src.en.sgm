<seg id=1> I hope with all my heart, and I must say this quite emphatically, that an opportunity will arise when this document can be incorporated into the Treaties at some point in the future. </seg>
<seg id=2> Should this fail to materialise, we should not be surprised if public opinion proves sceptical about Europe, or even rejects it. </seg>
<seg id=3> The Intergovernmental Conference - to address a third subject - on the reform of the European institutions is also of decisive significance for us in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=4> At present I feel there is a danger that if the proposal by the Belgian Government on these sanction mechanisms were to be implemented, we would be hitting first and examining only afterwards. </seg>
<seg id=5> The Charter therefore guarantees a greater level of protection than the European Convention on Human Rights - this needs to be said to all those who are asserting the opposite here in the plenary - and it formulates political and social rights in a balanced way. </seg>
<seg id=6> We must bear in mind the Community as a whole. </seg>
<seg id=7> But we must reach agreement on what to put in this constitution. </seg>
<seg id=8> I am not a Christian Democrat, so I do not believe in miracles, but I do want to salute the European Parliament as such, because it has made a major contribution to this project. </seg>
<seg id=9> In today' s debate, I associate myself with the words of all those who have spoken - Mr Moscovici, Mr Napolitano and the heads of Groups - on the importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights: this is something innovative and, moreover, unhoped-for. </seg>
<seg id=10> This does not mean that everything has to happen at once. </seg>
<seg id=11> Vote </seg>
<seg id=12> Report (A5-0231/2000) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic [COM(2000) 137 - C5-0164/2000 - 2000/0060(COD)] </seg>
<seg id=13> . Technical cooperation with Russia while the Chechen people are suffering a full-scale genocide is a cause of shame for the European Union at a time when this House has greeted the final version of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </seg>
<seg id=14> The Commission also proposes to apply a coefficient to the 'non collectable' percentage in order to avoid understating the true level of deficit, compared with the Maastricht requirements. </seg>
<seg id=15> Even in countries where 15-metre buses are not allowed officially, in practice they are not refused or sent back at the border. </seg>
<seg id=16> Skinner report (A5-0235/2000) </seg>
<seg id=17> Opting for direct government aid when acquiring risk-bearing starting capital for innovative companies means that this aid must mainly be funded by those paying taxes and pension premiums. </seg>
<seg id=18> We did not vote against this resolution because we did not want our votes to be confused with those of the extreme right, which objects to a number of fundamental rights even being affirmed or opposable to the sovereignty of States. </seg>
<seg id=19> The achievement of the colleagues whom I named just now and others has been outstanding here. </seg>
<seg id=20> The content of this document, they say, represents a fundamental step forward for the protection of citizens' rights in Europe, to the extent that the matter should be referred to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Nice Council should decide to enshrine it in the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=21> The Charter aims to provide comprehensive protection of people's fundamental rights and different sections go completely or partly beyond the jurisdiction of the EU. </seg>
<seg id=22> Because social rights are fundamental rights for a Europe that respects democratic and social rights and freedoms, we champion the idea of another charter to protect workers, women, foreigners, those excluded from society, national minorities. </seg>
<seg id=23> It cannot serve as a basis for the establishment of a European constitution. </seg>
<seg id=24> (A5-0247/2000) by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne on Romania (COM(1999) 510 - C5-0033/2000 - 1997/2172(COS)); </seg>
<seg id=25> I think that this is a good proposal which should be supported, and an equally good proposal is that from the European People's Party stating that if possible the first countries should be able to participate in the European Parliament elections in 2004. </seg>
<seg id=26> Our first guideline is that we must, of course, go as far as possible in the accession negotiations in order to draw up a report that is as accurate as possible, in Nice, country by country and chapter by chapter. </seg>
<seg id=27> Next, let me say a few works on the 'Helsinki Six' , in inverted commas once again, who entered into negotiations at the beginning of this year. </seg>
<seg id=28> Personally, I remain convinced that, in the debate on the date of the first accessions, the European Union must avoid - with very great respect to the European Parliament - trying to make an impact so often. </seg>
<seg id=29> Enlargement is our future, on condition that the acquis communautaire and the common policies which we all value highly are not thereby weakened or watered down. </seg>
<seg id=30> Populists will stand up and maintain that the EU has finally made it clear that, in truth, it does not want any new members. </seg>
<seg id=31> The advantages are already there; they are visible and everyone stands to gain. </seg>
<seg id=32> We can help countries catch up, but not by putting their neighbours on hold. </seg>
<seg id=33> All the candidate countries are keen to accede to monetary union and accession to monetary union is governed by special terms in the Maastricht Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=34> The costs of enlargement are set out in the current financial perspectives and will be reflected in the budget. </seg>
<seg id=35> The Commission report is right in pointing out that all candidate countries have experienced major reform - and must do so in future. </seg>
<seg id=36> The hallmark of German reunification was that there were politicians who understood the Zeitgeist, who dared to act. </seg>
<seg id=37> The progress and efforts being made in central and eastern Europe give us hope that the first accession treaties will still be able to be ratified in the European Parliament in this parliamentary term. </seg>
<seg id=38> My Group has 23 visiting MPs, our "virtual MEPs", sitting in the gallery now: I welcome all of you to this debate in the House. </seg>
<seg id=39> We must also take our own administrative reforms very seriously if we also wish to root out corruption in future Member States, as transparency and good administration are the best guarantee that there is no corruption. </seg>
<seg id=40> We are also in favour of a European Union that includes Russia, and which therefore includes all the countries which have built - albeit in conflicting ways - this historical, cultural, economic, social and political reality known as Europe. </seg>
<seg id=41> Our opposition to the Brok report is not an indication of ostracism of our partners in Eastern and Central Europe, or southern Europe, quite the contrary, it means that this report sets conditions which are absolutely intolerable, with regard to countries which have been European for centuries and of which we should not be making any other demand whatsoever except, perhaps, for the one condition that political pluralism be respected. </seg>
<seg id=42> Now, in the previous enlargement processes, particularly when Spain and Portugal joined the Union, we were in possession of a very powerful budgetary tool, for the Delors I and Delors II packages provided an impetus which made it possible for struggling economies to make up for lost time. </seg>
<seg id=43> It was the fall of the Berlin Wall, this fantastic historic event, which created the conditions for enlargement and for European reunification and which, once again, gives perspective and meaning to this task which will go down in the history of our continent. </seg>
<seg id=44> In this information campaign, we must fight exaggerated fears, but also solve problems as they arise. </seg>
<seg id=45> Several years ago in Copenhagen we defined the requisite criteria. </seg>
<seg id=46> As far as the other sine qua non are concerned, they are not within our powers of discretion or disposal. </seg>
<seg id=47> The problem is that, if you set a date, there is a danger that the enthusiasm for reform in these countries will wane. </seg>
<seg id=48> It was said during the debate that opening the borders would cause the immediate collapse of agriculture in certain countries, such as Poland. </seg>
<seg id=49> Mr President, today when I flew from Stockholm, in over Germany and then drove on down to historic Alsace, I could not help but feel grateful for this Europe of mine. </seg>
<seg id=50> Our support and commitment continue - to a large extent, for our own sake. </seg>
<seg id=51> The environment is the area which will constitute a stumbling block in the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=52> They are simply not entitled to chide this Baltic country like a stupid schoolboy. </seg>
<seg id=53> The process of economic change and fast transition has not only brought successes; it has also resulted in social differences, increasing regional disparities and huge hidden unemployment, which is why these issues must take priority in the pre-accession strategy. </seg>
<seg id=54> There is a good chance of this, but particular efforts are still needed. </seg>
<seg id=55> The multi-faceted problems and the dangers inherent in the social and economic crisis in the region will not be averted, let alone solved, by isolating it. </seg>
<seg id=56> Despite the words of the Commissioner, who declared himself passionately in favour of enlargement, Brussels sometimes gives the impression that it is trying to slow down the process, and this is reflected in the attitude of the candidate countries whose citizens become despondent and confused. </seg>
<seg id=57> As far as cause for criticism is concerned, as I state in my report, the European Parliament stresses the need to ensure a high standard of safety at nuclear facilities and to carry out the relevant environmental impact assessments. </seg>
<seg id=58> There is that risk and I am going to try to prove the opposite is true in the case of Slovakia. </seg>
<seg id=59> The acquis is also being implemented at a satisfying rate. </seg>
<seg id=60> In this context, the issue of integrating the ethnic gypsy minority into Hungarian society has been central to the discussions held in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. </seg>
<seg id=61> The rapporteur for Bulgaria, Mr Geoffrey Van Orden, has asked me to speak on his behalf since he has to attend the defence debate at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth, England, today. </seg>
<seg id=62> - Mr President, Romania's people welcome wholeheartedly the European Union's Helsinki decision to incorporate Romania in the first wave of the current enlargement countries. </seg>
<seg id=63> We must look forward to Romania becoming a full and active member of the Union without undue delay. </seg>
<seg id=64> I have a duty to point out, however, that transposing the acquis communautaire is taking too long and that Cyprus, like other candidate countries moreover, should tighten up its administrative, fiscal and legal systems. </seg>
<seg id=65> Because of its geopolitical position as the last outpost of Europe, at the crossroads with the Middle East and North Africa, the importance of Malta goes far beyond its geographical size and its small population. </seg>
<seg id=66> Allow me now to jump across to Poland, which is without doubt a key country in the enlargement process, not just because it is the most expansive of all the central European economies but because of its size and geopolitical position. </seg>
<seg id=67> These interim solutions are not intended to set the status quo in stone but to act as intelligent buffers which adapt to changing circumstances. </seg>
<seg id=68> I am speaking on behalf of the Industry Committee - to abbreviate its full title - on the areas of industry, external trade, research and energy. </seg>
<seg id=69> Energy generation and distribution must continue to be made more efficient, while complying with environmental standards. </seg>
<seg id=70> Finally, enlargement is not just a game of words, because we cannot improve the human rights situation in Tibet just by translating the human rights declaration into Tibetan. </seg>
<seg id=71> In order to meet all 200 environmental EU requirements, all Eastern European governments together need to spend another EUR 120 billion. </seg>
<seg id=72> We need to try to protect the countryside and the natural areas from any negative impact. </seg>
<seg id=73> There is a message for EU governments and indeed for the Commission: for governments on compliance and the Commission on enforcement. </seg>
<seg id=74> It is essential, ladies and gentlemen, to create a genuine European regional planning policy, of which the Structural Funds are a component, an element, but which gives rise to ambitious actions in favour of balanced and integrated development of the European area in its different dimensions. </seg>
<seg id=75> But it is precisely with the "how" and "when" that we need to ensure that enlargement is prepared carefully and implemented seriously, in order to guarantee its success. </seg>
<seg id=76> It is important that it should not just become a flag of convenience and that all measures prescribed in the acquis are taken to ensure that safety is writ large. </seg>
<seg id=77> But having said all that, it is questions about how we can survive as a State that have occupied people' s minds. </seg>
<seg id=78> Within the Union institutions, the views on enlargement continue to be positive and you must therefore contradict every ambassador from your countries who believes otherwise. </seg>
<seg id=79> After such a comprehensive debate, I should just like to address and highlight two questions, which now have no or the wrong meaning in the public eye. </seg>
<seg id=80> That is important not only for them but also for ourselves. </seg>
<seg id=81> I also call for individual countries to be given possible target dates. </seg>
<seg id=82> Nor is freedom and security created by the European Union - as Austria, on the one hand, and the Balkans, on the other, know full well - because the European Union is, alas, totally subservient to the United States Government and the nations which have just recovered their sovereignty are soon going to realise that, tomorrow, they will be asked to renounce it in the name of subservience to the supposed world order. </seg>
<seg id=83> It would be just as irresponsible to wish to go further. </seg>
<seg id=84> To these should be added all the other advantages which cannot be measured in figures or assessed in economic terms. </seg>
<seg id=85> The speeches of all those who have contributed to today' s debate on enlargement paint a not-dissimilar picture. </seg>
<seg id=86> Talk about the fast accession to the Union on the part of the applicant countries is just empty words unless the conditions of membership are changed. </seg>
<seg id=87> I visited two of these houses that I can recommend to anyone. </seg>
<seg id=88> The Polish people believe that the country will be ready for accession with effect from 31 December 2002, and Poland has certainly made great strides since the accession negotiations started in March 1998. </seg>
<seg id=89> I would therefore call on the government leaders to assume their responsibility and to stop this trend in its tracks. </seg>
<seg id=90> I would merely remind the House that, of all the candidate countries, Cyprus comes first as regards meeting the economic criteria and qualifies for immediate membership of EMU. </seg>
<seg id=91> In other words, a great many issues are based on subsidiarity, and that is how it should stay. </seg>
<seg id=92> I sometimes hear our neighbouring countries asking why we are so bothered about the acquis, when all that matters to them is having it confirmed that they are ready for accession. </seg>
<seg id=93> It is time to lead European opinion in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id=94> It has successfully embraced reforms which are essential to secure a more prosperous and safer future. </seg>
<seg id=95> In the course of the last few years, it has been possible to bring about a distinct improvement in the situation, due in no small part to the influence of the European Institutions. </seg>
<seg id=96> Since Helmut Kohl, Europe' s citizen of honour, stepped down from the European stage, Jean-Claude Junker is the only other Head of Government I can think of off the top of my head, for whom the European project is a matter truly dear to their heart. </seg>
<seg id=97> In addressing problems such as this, which have no easy solution, it is essential to create an environment conducive to the work of industry and to there being competitive economic structures. </seg>
<seg id=98> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'from problem child to model pupil' , that is how we could characterise the determination of the Slovakian government and the Slovakian parliament to swiftly tread the path to EU membership, and to spend the past two years making every available effort to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria. </seg>
<seg id=99> This is where we have to set to work. </seg>
<seg id=100> We must make sure that the countries are ready to join and in particular that they have the administrative capacity to deal with the acquis communautaire. </seg>
<seg id=101> Mr President, Commissioner, what with the enlargement reports which are the subject of today' s debate, together with the Brok report and the debate on institutional reform, today can be described, without fear of exaggeration, as a day for celebrating Europe in the 21st century. </seg>
<seg id=102> It is fantastic that countries on this continent which only ten or so years ago were divided are to make joint decisions on matters of common interest in the near future. </seg>
<seg id=103> If transitional periods are to be granted, then it would be both necessary and helpful to include realistic interim goals in the accession treaty, and to regard failure to attain these interim goals as a violation of the treaty. </seg>
<seg id=104> We speak a lot about how enlargement should be financed. </seg>
<seg id=105> Mr President, our task in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, was primarily to assess the situation in the candidate countries with regard to the internal market and the relevant legislation. </seg>
<seg id=106> In this sense, it is a process of development, which we follow attentively, but we hope that Slovenia will continue to hold this positive position and that it will be in the first group. </seg>
<seg id=107> The EEA could act as a kind of hatchery, where EU embryos would mature into fully fledged members </seg>
<seg id=108> Mutual respect, consideration for, and fair treatment of, each other, must form one of the main pillars of our European Community. </seg>
<seg id=109> Firstly, as we see it, enlargement is not merely an obligation. </seg>
<seg id=110> Mr President, with regard to yesterday' s debate on Slovakia, I should like to point out that Belgium and other countries have introduced a visa requirement for Slovakia. </seg>
<seg id=111> There are none. </seg>
<seg id=112> Twelve years ago the Court of Justice gave a judgment against Italy in the case of the foreign language lecturers. </seg>
<seg id=113> Animal nutrition </seg>
<seg id=114> I totally agree with all the proposals tabled by the Commission on this issue. </seg>
<seg id=115> When it comes to the directive on the official control of the field of animal nutrition, it is important that we really do have a form of inspection which is implemented and which is the same throughout the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=116> One of the strong points of the proposal is the principle of non-dilution, which prohibits using healthy feedingstuffs to dilute a batch of animal feedingstuffs contaminated by, for example, dioxins. </seg>
<seg id=117> In all our deliberations, however, we must be mindful of the entire supply chain; in other words, we need what Mr Glavany, the French President of the Council, has called a quality pact between society, industry and agriculture. </seg>
<seg id=118> During one of the greatest of all food crises, namely the BSE crisis, the House managed to cooperate in a spirit of mutual confidence, irrespective of party affiliations, and I should have found it very regrettable if, at such a juncture as this, a pseudo-interest group - for it would not have been a genuine interest group - had carried the day. </seg>
<seg id=119> This crisis not only cost billions of euros, but also resulted in even more suspicion about what we eat. </seg>
<seg id=120> Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on her report. </seg>
<seg id=121> Our citizens are fed up with being forced to be happy, of being hampered a little more every day in their activities by petty, pernickety and stifling red tape. </seg>
<seg id=122> That is not just a precaution, it is common sense. </seg>
<seg id=123> These proposals also mean a step towards a complete package of measures in favour of food safety. </seg>
<seg id=124> I am confident that with this systematic set of uniform rules we are laying the groundwork for filling the gaps in the existing legislation and enhancing food safety throughout the food chain. </seg>
<seg id=125> The full declaration certainly costs money, and the farmer ultimately has to foot the bill. </seg>
<seg id=126> From my own conversations, however, I know that I am not speaking for a majority of the House on this particular point. </seg>
<seg id=127> The good quality of the former is regulated by legislation on hygiene and the directive on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is most essential with regard to the latter. </seg>
<seg id=128> Although the definition does not preclude water being considered as feedingstuff, it is clear from the Community legislation that water has not until now been considered as feedingstuff, as is clear from the fact that Council Directive 96/25 of 29 April 1996 on the circulation of feed materials, containing a non-exhaustive list of the main feed materials, does not include water in the list. </seg>
<seg id=129> More generally, it is appropriate that the provisions of the annexes are periodically reviewed in the light of the developments of scientific and technological knowledge. </seg>
<seg id=130> The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 14, 17 - the first sentence in particular - and 19 concerning the deletion of the adjective "serious" when clarifying a risk for consistency with our general policy laid down in the General Products Safety Directive. </seg>
<seg id=131> I hope that our cooperation will continue with the same positive results when this proposal is discussed at the second stage. </seg>
<seg id=132> That has been the worst part of the present regime, because it meant, for example, that the term 'fats' could cover all sorts of fat and that there was no indication at all as to the origins of the fat content. </seg>
<seg id=133> We must have a clear and unequivocal white list, and both committees - the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee - have reiterated that point. </seg>
<seg id=134> Equally important, of course, is the food-safety aspect - beef is another issue here - and traceability. </seg>
<seg id=135> I also expect the Commission to stipulate the necessary measures along with a strict timetable in order to ensure that the directive is applied in the Member States of the Union. </seg>
<seg id=136> Of course, farmers have the right to know what their cows are eating and the right to know whether their pigs are eating car sump oil, which contains dioxins. </seg>
<seg id=137> As far as checks on feedingstuffs are concerned, I should like to state that the problem is not so much the lack of a European legal framework as the failure of the individual Member States to transpose the existing provisions. </seg>
<seg id=138> It is also what we want, namely trust between the producer and consumer. </seg>
<seg id=139> As stressed in the report by these two committees, this proposal was initiated by the European Parliament out of a concern to improve both traceability and the provision of information through the labelling of compound-feeding stuffs. </seg>
<seg id=140> The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m. </seg>
<seg id=141> In connection with human rights, only a brief mention was made here of the Romanies. </seg>
<seg id=142> Mr President, the reason for this amendment concerns the fact that recital c) highlights the persistence of segregation in children' s education and serious discrimination in the various sectors of Hungarian civil society, from the economy to the public sector, which in its seriousness does not correspond to my perception of the current situation, which I have had the opportunity to observe as rapporteur and during my visits there. </seg>
<seg id=143> The new wording of Recital A, which would become Paragraph 1, and which I propose to the House, would read as follows: 'Whereas Slovenia must continue to meet the Copenhagen political criteria also in those areas where questions remain open, as specifically mentioned in the Commission' s 1999 report.' </seg>
<seg id=144> The economies of these countries are already at the mercy of the law laid down by the great European trusts. </seg>
<seg id=145> I refer in particular to paragraph 19 of the report' s draft resolution in which it is stated that the European Parliament 'emphasises that acceptance of the provisions laid down regarding Economic and Monetary Union rules out any possibility of opting out and represents a commitment to a global, irreversible political project ... which does not mean mere membership of a currency area but which greatly entails coordination of economic and social policies' . </seg>
<seg id=146> I should also like to remind you that this process must not cause us to neglect the cooperation with the countries on all sides of the Mediterranean to which we are committed! </seg>
<seg id=147> We must remind those people who have no sense of solidarity and are concerned about the economic cost of enlargement, that the prize of peace fully justifies this cost. </seg>
<seg id=148> Nevertheless, in order to prevent Europe becoming nothing more than a free trade area, the European Union must provide clear answers to the institutional, social and economic questions that enlargement is bound to raise. </seg>
<seg id=149> " The various structural adjustment plans demand forced privatisations in all strategic sectors: finance, insurance, industry, education, and public services, etc., and impose budgetary restrictions. </seg>
<seg id=150> Less would have amounted to more! </seg>
<seg id=151> This is my view, and the purpose of my abstention was to emphasise that this Parliament would have done better to produce less paper but more substance. </seg>
<seg id=152> Is it really in the interest of farmers in Poland or Hungary to condemn themselves to becoming redundant within two decades of entering the Union? </seg>
<seg id=153> Thirdly, the implications of enlargement for the Union's regional policy cannot be overlooked. </seg>
<seg id=154> This is certainly positive and we should congratulate the Republic of Estonia on this and its other merits. </seg>
<seg id=155> Like the rapporteur, I should like to express my pleasure at the considerable progress which Latvia has made in recent months in order to be included in the first wave of enlargement that the European Union is shortly to experience. </seg>
<seg id=156> Gawronski Report (A5-0246/2000) </seg>
<seg id=157> The country should, moreover, make greater efforts to combat corruption. </seg>
<seg id=158> Mr President, I voted for the report on the current status of the Czech Republic's application for membership of the European Union and I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of that country. </seg>
<seg id=159> Mr President, I voted for the report on the current status of Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=160> If Hungary continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Hungary should not be admitted to the Union. </seg>
<seg id=161> Sadly, this phenomenon is not restricted to Romania alone, but I particularly hope that the Romanian authorities will distinguish themselves by eliminating this fault as well - which is particularly apparent in their preparations for accession to the European Union - and respect civil rights. </seg>
<seg id=162> I feel that this step and the entry of Cyprus into the European Union will prove extremely important in terms of bringing peace to this tortured island in our Mediterranean. </seg>
<seg id=163> The UN settlement process has now lasted since December 1999 without a break, longer than any of the previous attempts to solve the Cyprus problem. </seg>
<seg id=164> The European Union does have the capacity to make a key contribution to the security of the Cypriot communities in the context of a peace settlement. </seg>
<seg id=165> Like the rapporteur, I too welcome the Helsinki Council agreement not to make a solution to the division of the island a pre-condition for accession. </seg>
<seg id=166> The safety bolt guaranteeing this discipline lies in the Commission' s determination to ensure that consumers are provided with consistent quality, at all levels, in the products available on the market. </seg>
<seg id=167> The prohibition of undesirable substances in animal feedingstuffs is therefore a basic element in our food safety policy. </seg>
<seg id=168> I welcome the vote by this Parliament deploring the flagrant violations of James' rights under UN international law. </seg>
<seg id=169> A politician can have no greater responsibility than to be given the opportunity to redress the wrongs so often visited upon minorities. </seg>
<seg id=170> Now is the time to do the job and it must be done with every fibre of our being. </seg>
<seg id=171> Some undertakings reject applicants for continuing and ongoing training on the pretext that they are too young or too old. </seg>
<seg id=172> Fifthly, religious communities, perhaps one of the most sensitive areas of our directive. </seg>
<seg id=173> Next we booked a disabled access hotel only to find that a single bed was put across the bathroom. </seg>
<seg id=174> This summer, the Council adopted a directive to combat discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin. </seg>
<seg id=175> For this reason, the sum total of the appropriations must be allocated to financing operating expenditure. </seg>
<seg id=176> I, too, congratulate both the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mr Mann, on their excellent work. </seg>
<seg id=177> It is very important that organisations representing the people affected are listened to, because they will help us make the transition from fine words here today to practical policies that work in our Member States. </seg>
<seg id=178> Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Commission on the initiative to develop Article 13 of the Treaty further. </seg>
<seg id=179> I urgently call on the Commission to adopt this recommendation and to do justice to the tolerance and pluralism desired by the representatives of so many States. </seg>
<seg id=180> I would like to air a few concerns regarding this directive which are of particular importance for my group. </seg>
<seg id=181> We cannot accept seeing women and men still not having equal rights at the dawn of the 21st century, seeing the disabled socially marginalised, or people being excluded from society because of their sexual orientation and branded as different. </seg>
<seg id=182> I would like to remind you that the first action of the members of the Bonino List this parliamentary term was to promote a proposal for a resolution on the fight against discrimination based on sex. </seg>
<seg id=183> Discrimination in the sense of treating people as inferior, taunting them and putting them at a disadvantage is an evil that must be eradicated. </seg>
<seg id=184> I do not think we should ask too much of anybody. </seg>
<seg id=185> Yet we were even more impressed by fact that, at the end of the report, provision was made for an evaluation of the outcome of the processes and programmes, for this is also a guarantee of fairness, impartiality and transparency. </seg>
<seg id=186> They will also be expected to respond to the needs of the potential workforce, particularly in the area of disability. </seg>
<seg id=187> Yet, should the law not provide the victims of discrimination with better means to escape the isolation they too often find themselves in? </seg>
<seg id=188> Our entire dispute with the United States, moreover, has arisen because we wanted positive discrimination in favour of our own ACP banana producers whereas the United States wanted an egalitarian system which would serve the interests of multinationals. </seg>
<seg id=189> The amount should be at least equal to the sums made available for the preparations for this programme, to make it possible to implement it fully and effectively. </seg>
<seg id=190> As we all know, the causes of discrimination must be rooted out right from the start - and the work of prevention is just as vital - through information, education and training in the promotion of equality and the fight against prejudice, changing attitudes through the various forms of positive action, particularly favouring groups that are discriminated against, or by appealing to the relevant authorities whenever employers persist in discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=191> I thank Mr Mann for his support on this point. </seg>
<seg id=192> It is almost acceptable in its original form because, essentially, it is directed at something fundamental, that is, educating European society in the value of the human being, of whatever type. </seg>
<seg id=193> Mr President, I should like to underline what my colleague Mr Hernández Mollar has just said. </seg>
<seg id=194> I welcome the rather obvious fact that priests and ministers can be restricted to the relevant faith without promoting accusations of illegal discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=195> On the subject, now, of the programme to combat discrimination, the Commission' s proposals are satisfactory. </seg>
<seg id=196> The family, for instance, remains a foundation and a pillar of our society. </seg>
<seg id=197> In terms of social solidarity, human rights and social justice, and in terms of the internal market, it is very important to understand that we must have the same minimum social standards in all Member States and in the applicant countries in the future as well. </seg>
<seg id=198> Others risk creating an imbalance in programmes by an over-concentration on a particular aspect; others again are not necessary to achieve Parliament's objective, as the ideas are either implicitly or explicitly already included in the decision, such as those on drawing on the experience of third countries. </seg>
<seg id=199> The Commission's intention is to create workable rules for companies while at the same time prohibiting instances of discrimination which are arbitrary and not objectively justified. </seg>
<seg id=200> I agree that it is very important and I pledge that it will be a communication: we will examine this in the text of the communication we have already announced in the social agenda. </seg>
<seg id=201> Some of the Members have referred to the particular problems that Turkey has with the Kurdish language and the problems in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=202> Yet today, thanks to the Finnish Presidency, we are able to discuss the annual report. </seg>
<seg id=203> They should be better coordinated and more effective. </seg>
<seg id=204> That said, since I am a dreamer whose feet are firmly on the ground, I will hold onto my dreams and work towards their realisation. </seg>
<seg id=205> Mr President, this Parliament has always argued in favour of improving EU laws on arms export and, partly as a result of these pleas, we now have a code of conduct which we are able to debate today for the first time. </seg>
<seg id=206> I would like to underline this, also on behalf of my group. </seg>
<seg id=207> The third criterion, the needs and challenges of the European defence industries, and to a certain extent criterion 4, the development of a common defence policy, are potentially and factually at odds with criterion 1, namely the consistency of the Union' s external action, whereby its objectives regarding conflict prevention and promotion of human rights prevail. </seg>
<seg id=208> But the arms trade is currently dealt with in the context of the common foreign and security policy, with which of course the Commission is fully associated. </seg>
<seg id=209> We agree with the rapporteur that further efforts are needed in establishing common rules for controlling the legal trade and for eradicating trafficking and smuggling in such arms. </seg>
<seg id=210> It proposes guidelines for future Union research activities, for the period 2002-2006, and more especially for the Union's future Research Framework Programme. </seg>
<seg id=211> The guideline document adopted today is designed to trigger debate immediately, beginning with debate within the institutions. </seg>
<seg id=212> This is the discussion on criteria that we will be having with the Member States, of course, and also with Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=213> In a resolution quoted by yourself, which was adopted in this Parliament on 18 May and for which I was rapporteur, I recommended multi-disciplinary teams for research, since innovations often occur on the cutting edge of different disciplines. </seg>
<seg id=214> Yes, with an opening-up of the national programmes of several Member States onto an area with European added value, the Commission and the Union can intervene. </seg>
<seg id=215> I would therefore welcome any form of debate or discussion on this issue. </seg>
<seg id=216> Mr President, Mr Harbour and Mr Piétrasanta - I apologise for not having replied to your question - firstly, as concerns pilot experiments for 2000-2001, we will make every effort to accurately assess the feasibility of certain elements, including that of networking. </seg>
<seg id=217> I indeed feel that, in Europe, research and development must be conducted with the citizens. </seg>
<seg id=218> In the case of Portugal, Mrs Torres Marques, but above all in the case of Greece, the number of projects received does not give me the same cause to hope for a satisfactory implementation of appropriations. </seg>
<seg id=219> You know that this fund has always been very well managed by the four countries and has always had 100% take-up rates. </seg>
<seg id=220> I provided all this information to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 11 September, but, if you really wanted, I could arrange for this information to be transmitted to you this evening or tomorrow, in the form that it was submitted, in all transparency, to the competent Committee on 11 September, under a month ago, for all the countries concerned. </seg>
<seg id=221> Eventually, in 1992, the Member States unanimously decided on the introduction of a Community system of tax levies on mineral oils which only provided for a minimum tax rate for each type of mineral oil on the basis of its use; i.e. as fuel for motor vehicles, for industrial and commercial use or for heating. </seg>
<seg id=222> I want to be clear and insist on this point, because, as I said in my answer in the first instance, the Commission has made several attempts to get Member States to agree to the harmonisation of excise taxes precisely to avoid distortions in trade which may arise as a result of the differences therein. </seg>
<seg id=223> Although the precise shape of the elasticity curve is something we may debate, the fact that it exists is certain if one looks at the oil-intensity of the economy and how that intensity has changed. </seg>
<seg id=224> From my point of view, I look after the fiscal matters of the Union, insofar as I am allowed to do so by the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=225> Out of a total of 750 million inhabitants, 100 million belong to minority groups. </seg>
<seg id=226> In the past the Commission's executive tasks have increased while its political and legislative work has decreased in relative terms. </seg>
<seg id=227> Thirdly, how, in the light of enlargement towards the East, do you interpret the decision to remove resources from a practical fight in Sweden, Austria and Germany against child sex tourism when we know that there are special problems involving the sex trade and trade in human beings in a large number of the candidate countries? </seg>
<seg id=228> Support for ECPAT is incredibly important. </seg>
<seg id=229> Indeed many SMEs are still not fully aware of the implications of the changeover for their businesses, particularly as regards the legal tax and accounting rules and their software. </seg>
<seg id=230> Question No 8 by (H-0724/00): </seg>
<seg id=231> The fact is that elk hunting is extremely widespread in Sweden and Finland. </seg>
<seg id=232> The Commission is currently monitoring the situation in both cases. </seg>
<seg id=233> We are considering infringement proceedings in relation to this Member State but no such proceedings have been initiated as yet. </seg>
<seg id=234> Under this plan the Member States would immediately organise testing of a significant number of seed lots of conventional varieties to determine the presence of GM seeds until the coming into force of related new Community legislative measures. </seg>
<seg id=235> There are also some safety requirements for eye protection at work in the Directive on the Safety in the Workplace but none yet for private use. </seg>
<seg id=236> From a logical point of view I entirely agree.The difficulty in this issue is that the Commission and the European institutions have far greater powers in legislation governing the workplace than in, for instance, legislation governing private homes. </seg>
<seg id=237> What will the Commission do in this case? </seg>
<seg id=238> I am particularly concerned by reports that party members, waiting with Aung San Suu Kyi at Rangoon station two weeks ago, were attacked and even chloroformed before being evicted from the station premises. </seg>
<seg id=239> This is where the whole question of whether or not it is worth engaging in a dialogue is one that has to think about very carefully. </seg>
<seg id=240> Mr President, the Commission fully supports the decision of the UN Secretary General's special representative for Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, to hold the Kosovo municipal elections on 28 October and the efforts of the UN mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, to organise these elections. </seg>
<seg id=241> I hope that will continue, that the election process will produce results in which everybody in Kosovo from every group will be able to feel that they are sharing in the administration of their local communities. </seg>
<seg id=242> Arms trade code of conduct (continuation) </seg>
<seg id=243> Finally, arms fuel conflicts all over the world. </seg>
<seg id=244> We only have to look at Indonesia and the fact that the European Union could not wait to lift the arms embargo, or to not reinstate it. </seg>
<seg id=245> We should therefore take this opportunity to make the code more efficient and to ensure that our young soldiers engaged in peace missions do not have to confront, as they occasionally do, arms exported by the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=246> The proposal to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function flows directly from the recommendations formulated last year by the Committee of Independent Experts, which Parliament endorsed in my report of 19 January of this year. </seg>
<seg id=247> First, the division of responsibilities between the financial controller and the new internal auditor must be clarified. </seg>
<seg id=248> My report proposes that the annual internal audit report produced in one institution should be made available to all other institutions to enable them where appropriate to apply the conclusions arrived at elsewhere to their own management and control systems. </seg>
<seg id=249> I would like to pay special attention to one point in particular, namely the fact that the separation of ex ante control and the audit may not have any bearing on the position of ex ante control. </seg>
<seg id=250> Like several Member States, I think there is still some doubt as to what this general reform will cost at the final count or what benefits it will produce. </seg>
<seg id=251> Otherwise, my group is able to support all the rapporteur' s amendments, especially those which stipulate that annual progress reports should be compiled. </seg>
<seg id=252> However, we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control. </seg>
<seg id=253> We know what we want and it is the will of this Parliament, but it is crucial that the transitional period should not be extended beyond what is strictly necessary. </seg>
<seg id=254> On the question of the Financial Regulation in general, let me say very briefly that I really am very sorry that the revised version is still not available in all the languages. </seg>
<seg id=255> Let me say briefly that the Commission accepts Amendment No 2, which - most importantly - provides for an annual report by the financial controller, to ensure greater transparency. </seg>
<seg id=256> Firstly, we must identify all the technological systems in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or Internet of material which could be considered harmful to the psychological development of minors: I refer, in particular, to filtering systems and programme classification systems. </seg>
<seg id=257> Television and the Internet have to be learned and, of course, also taught. </seg>
<seg id=258> Systems of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis. </seg>
<seg id=259> In so far as the President of the Commission has had any ideas about which areas belong where, I hope that he shares my view that issues of parental control of children' s television viewing do not belong on the EU' s agenda. </seg>
<seg id=260> Aside from all the positive aspects, we must not disregard the negative side-effects of this ease of access. </seg>
<seg id=261> This occurred not far away and not very long ago. </seg>
<seg id=262> Mr President, I should like to thank both the European Parliament and its rapporteur for the important work which has been done on this issue. </seg>
<seg id=263> Where, finally, the protection of minors is concerned, I should like to point out that there is a Council Recommendation of 24 September on promoting national frameworks designed to ensure comparable and effective levels of protection of minors and of human dignity. </seg>
<seg id=264> Since then, a great deal of work by my own staff, by Parliament's staff and indeed by the Commission's own staff, to all of whom I pay warm tribute, has presented us with what I thought, until today, was perhaps a worthy if not perfect report, certainly one that was satisfactory and would go some way to achieving my aims. </seg>
<seg id=265> I would draw attention, out of the amendments tabled, to the inclusion in this recommendation of the specific category of researchers, since this category was originally included in the Green Paper. </seg>
<seg id=266> This is why thresholds need to be lowered on behalf of students, volunteers, university teachers and researchers - yes, I include researchers in this as well. </seg>
<seg id=267> Questions of responsibility have also been raised, especially when it is a matter of on-the-job learning. </seg>
<seg id=268> What this highlighted was that unless some serious remedial action is taken on the financing of the ERASMUS Programme and the kind of support that is made available to students, there will be inequality between those whose parents can afford to send them and those whose parents cannot. </seg>
<seg id=269> We are not only protecting the rights of young people, since the same applies to researchers. </seg>
<seg id=270> Finally, we call for measures to create greater transparency in the recognition of qualifications, periods of study and training. </seg>
<seg id=271> At the Council meeting in Nice, mobility will be one of the items for discussion. </seg>
<seg id=272> (The sitting was closed at 11.12 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=273> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am aware of the significance and responsibility of addressing Parliament, which is the sole European body to be directly and democratically elected. </seg>
<seg id=274> Enlargement requires reinforcement; reinforcement facilitates enlargement but does not compromise it. </seg>
<seg id=275> Against the backdrop of the many centuries of our continent's history, the idea of Europe was translated in a relatively short space of time from a utopian ideal into agreements, institutions, into a community and now into a Union. </seg>
<seg id=276> First, as regards the need for regular assessment and monitoring of equality at every level regarding work, employment, education, training, family life, health, and the dignity of women, we will only be able to make significant progress if we have the most accurate intelligence on every aspect underlying discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=277> We must all commit ourselves to following and developing this encouraging initiative. </seg>
<seg id=278> This is a particularly important advance for women, as Mrs Hautala is sure to emphasise when she presents her report to Parliament on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities. </seg>
<seg id=279> Combining work and family life, entitlement to paid maternity leave, rights of a more general scope, such as the right to dignity and the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity, also appear in the Charter. </seg>
<seg id=280> Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, covering equal opportunities for men and women and Article 141 covering positive measures for employment are a guarantee for women that should take effect in all the policies of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=281> Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking our fellow MEP, Mrs Dybkjær for an excellent report and welcoming her back to Parliament after her recent weeks' campaigning. </seg>
<seg id=282> An ombudsman for equality issues should be introduced, and in the candidate countries too. </seg>
<seg id=283> It would appear that it is getting harder for young families to take advantage of the rights that have been guaranteed them by law, as competition in the job market has become so fierce. </seg>
<seg id=284> The European method, imposing uniformity, is wrong. </seg>
<seg id=285> I do smile sometimes in this House, particularly when I hear that the group most hostile to the single currency are women, especially in Denmark. </seg>
<seg id=286> The number of dual earner households has grown considerably. </seg>
<seg id=287> After all, it is the cool, rational, enlightened thinking which advances human beings as independent, autonomous creatures and downgrades women to being the second sex. </seg>
<seg id=288> Five years ago, we unanimously adopted an excellent report on this subject, one of our demands being a framework statute for spouses that help out in the family business. </seg>
<seg id=289> I would like to remind our President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, of the important speech he made here. </seg>
<seg id=290> The reports are welcome and the progress they outline is a step forward, but until we really begin to exchange good practice and base our work on real statistics, we are not in a position to judge whether we are on the right road to achieving real equality between women and men. </seg>
<seg id=291> We have both a political and a moral responsibility for these countries trying to find their way into Europe and for the cohesion of the enlarged Europe which we are preparing. </seg>
<seg id=292> In conclusion, I would like to say something about the men - and it is the men that I address. </seg>
<seg id=293> We cannot continue with an elitist debate, we cannot continue to have progress only benefiting those women who enjoy greater opportunities. </seg>
<seg id=294> I will now respond generally on the issues, rather than give individual answers to any one of you. </seg>
<seg id=295> Fifth point: the Charter. </seg>
<seg id=296> The second interesting comment concerns the wage differential between men and women which, at European level, is hovering at the unacceptable level of 23% to 24% and, in some regions of Europe, is as high as 40%. </seg>
<seg id=297> Community customs code </seg>
<seg id=298> The Council considered that it was not drafted suitably in order to be included in the Community Customs Code and pointed out that there is a Green Paper - which is currently being converted into rules - specifically for combating fraud. </seg>
<seg id=299> Let us hope that in the future we will at least be able to achieve those guarantees. </seg>
<seg id=300> I think that the modifications are very positive, but I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission for greater vigilance and for stricter measures on fraud in Community customs. </seg>
<seg id=301> That has been, as is known, the outcome of a long debate in the Council, during which debate the Commission staunchly defended its view. </seg>
<seg id=302> I am sorry about that. </seg>
<seg id=303> Perhaps you could get your services to check this. </seg>
<seg id=304> Explanations of vote- Recommendation for second reading Palacio Vallelersundi (A5-0254/2000) </seg>
<seg id=305> Everyone agrees that this mobility must be encouraged in the name of the free movement of persons, but also and especially because of all the benefits to the young citizens of Europe and hence the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=306> As the rapporteur said, the Commission appears to be aware that, unless concrete measures are adopted, certain fundamental freedoms that are enshrined in the Treaty, such as the right of residence and the right of free movement, are, in practice, in danger of becoming mere statements of principle. </seg>
<seg id=307> Report Mann (A5-0264/2000) </seg>
<seg id=308> This article has been slightly modified by an amendment from the European Parliament, which complicates the wording, but does not alter the general thrust. </seg>
<seg id=309> As regards the action programme to fight discrimination, the European Commission' s proposal was broadly satisfactory. </seg>
<seg id=310> This directive gives Member States a great opportunity to enhance the rights of workers across the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=311> If absurdity could kill then the authors of such an amendment would definitely no longer be with us. </seg>
<seg id=312> However, we do want to ensure the directive lets us continue with the approach in the Disability Discrimination Act, although we recognise that some relatively minor changes may be required. </seg>
<seg id=313> We believe that the negations to come will provide an opportunity to tackle these issues and we look forward to enactment of the directive and the benefits it will bring to workers in the UK and other EU countries. </seg>
<seg id=314> Rapporteur Van Hulten is right in filling in the gaps in the Commission proposal: what is needed is a clear definition of the distribution of responsibilities between financial control and internal audit. </seg>
<seg id=315> If this two-faced policy were stopped then many of the difficulties could be overcome. </seg>
<seg id=316> The report also means that Europe' s war industry is regarded as an economically important industry, and that is an indefensible perspective on an industry whose primary task is implicitly to kill and annihilate people. </seg>
<seg id=317> Consequently, I cannot support these viewpoints, expressed either in Recital R or in Paragraphs 1 c, 1 d and 1 e. </seg>
<seg id=318> The Commission text and the report contain a number of accurate findings as regards the adverse impact on the psychological makeup and developing personality of children and, consequently, on the dangers in store for tomorrow' s society as the result of their watching these programmes and using these products. </seg>
<seg id=319> There is no single European definition of a minor nor is there full agreement on what is or is not harmful to minors watching certain television programmes. </seg>
<seg id=320> I would hope that the key television broadcasting organisations, both from the private and the public sector within the European Union, will engage positively in this process. </seg>
<seg id=321> It must be said that although equality between women and men has been proclaimed by law, the facts are there to remind us that the discrimination and difficulties women face unfortunately persist. </seg>
<seg id=322> Women are still one of the most vulnerable sections of society, whose rights are rudely trampled underfoot by the current social and economic system. </seg>
<seg id=323> B5-0777/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the crisis in Peru; </seg>
<seg id=324> The European Parliament firmly rejected the election of Mr Fujimori and I am pleased to see honourable Members in the two main groups committing themselves clearly to strong European Parliament support for establishing democracy in Peru. </seg>
<seg id=325> I feel that this resolution marks a key point in Parliament's political initiative. </seg>
<seg id=326> If these weaknesses are not dealt with, there is a risk that the next elections will be extremely dubious too. </seg>
<seg id=327> It is an important resolution because Afghanistan and its desperately suffering people, and especially its children who are blown up by mines and its women who face appalling discrimination, deserve far more attention from us. </seg>
<seg id=328> The international community can no longer content itself with burying its head in the sand, and conducting 'wait-and-see' diplomacy. </seg>
<seg id=329> There are a few examples I could mention: the monitoring of weapons exports and small arms through to the end-user, so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there, support for non-governmental organisations and women' s organisations based there, which are courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation. </seg>
<seg id=330> Mr President, today, just as and even more so than in the past, the tragic military success of the Taliban has meant that hundreds of thousands of women are subject to severe repression and are denied medical assistance, education, the possibility of supporting themselves and the freedom of movement. </seg>
<seg id=331> I do not think that this code will be useful unless it is effective in preventing weapons from reaching the hands of people who are committing very serious violations against human rights, as these people are. </seg>
<seg id=332> The joint debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=333> Fortunately, in this particular case, we can welcome the fact that the Spanish Jesuit and other Spaniards, as well as other Community citizens, have been released. </seg>
<seg id=334> We urge the Colombian government again to investigate the precise circumstances of these crimes. </seg>
<seg id=335> B5-0788/2000, by Mr Lagendijk and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, law on higher education and universities in Macedonia. </seg>
<seg id=336> Therefore, I believe we owe it to the young people to find a solution to the problem, and have now paved the way to this end. </seg>
<seg id=337> Finally, I would like to spend a moment on something which, normally speaking, I do not think belongs in a European Parliament, namely the role of a fellow countryman. </seg>
<seg id=338> Even though this notion is unpopular in this House - indeed the prevailing mood is the smaller the unit, the more divided the systems, and the more separatist the movements, the better - I would like to make the point here, which is one we have also discussed at some length in the delegation with our counterparts from Macedonia, that we must be clear about the fact that their own Albanian-language institutions should help to promote social cohesion in Macedonia and not create divisions. </seg>
<seg id=339> I believe the same will apply to Macedonia. </seg>
<seg id=340> The directive on life-saving equipment, life-jackets and life-rafts was infringed. </seg>
<seg id=341> We need to debate and to call, as we do in the resolution, for the absolute application - with no derogations - of Community legislation, which is inadequate and needs to be enriched; we need to call for and encourage modernisation and improvements in port infrastructures, crew training in modern equipment, crews which, I should like to add, Mr President, are among the most experienced in the world. </seg>
<seg id=342> That is what we are waiting to hear from the European Commission. </seg>
<seg id=343> The fact that the ill-fated ship was 34 years old and was not included on the list of ships which - and this too is wrong - were exempted from the additional inspections required under Directive 98/18/ÅC, is positive proof of the unaccountability of the shipping industry which always finds a way, for which governments and regulatory authorities are to blame, of getting round even these generally inadequate regulations, at the expense of passenger and shipping safety. </seg>
<seg id=344> We cannot afford to make the same mistake again. </seg>
<seg id=345> As a result of the check requested by the Commission, 60 ships were taken out of service pending proof of compliance with standards. </seg>
<seg id=346> The sitting was suspended at 4.36 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m. </seg>
<seg id=347> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=348> We call for the voice of the Serbian people to be heard and respected and we share its burning desire to see the back of Milosevic and his cohorts, who have brought so much suffering and unhappiness to so many, both in Serbia and in several other countries. </seg>
<seg id=349> I hope that the meeting between President Mubarak, President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak in Sharm el Sheik will mark a return to constructive negotiation on a lasting peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id=350> I think that this is a commitment that we need to reiterate today, unanimously, and I urge the Secretary of the Council, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission not to give up on their efforts and to express this unanimous will of all the peoples and all the representatives of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=351> My question to Mr Solana and the Commission is the following: what could the European Union do in very concrete terms in order, first of all, to substantiate the international inquiry into these disturbances, and secondly, to bring the peace process back on track? </seg>
<seg id=352> It is not a question of the Israelis making concessions; we must enforce the law. </seg>
<seg id=353> And here I want to pay homage to the resolute diplomacy of the United States, France and Egypt in particular. </seg>
<seg id=354> If the European Union wants to be a reliable partner in the peace process, it will have to unequivocally condemn provocations and calls for violent action. </seg>
<seg id=355> I expected today' s events to take place last Monday. </seg>
<seg id=356> Here, too, I have one thing to say: we have supported the efforts with which the people have defended themselves against the brutal force emanating from Milosevic in both Kosovo and Montenegro, but under no circumstances do we support the concept of ethnically clean states. </seg>
<seg id=357> Our group has confidence in our President and in the declaration which we have agreed she should make. </seg>
<seg id=358> A unanimous stance on the part of the Serbian population has proved extremely important, as it will continue to do so for the next couple of days and weeks. </seg>
<seg id=359> If I had not been given information by Mrs Langenhagen, who is a first-class shipbuilding and shipping safety expert, I would not now know what I was supposed to be voting on. </seg>
<seg id=360> We have all been very industrious. </seg>
<seg id=361> In this connection we will at the same time make it known to the Commission that next year the Guarantee Fund reserves will not be sufficient for guaranteeing the loans we can expect. </seg>
<seg id=362> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the Committee on Budgets under discussion, which recommends extending the Community guarantee given to the European Investment Bank to loans granted to Croatia, deals with two important matters. </seg>
<seg id=363> The chances of achieving a stabilisation and association agreement have now been looked into, and it is expected that negotiations on this topic will begin before the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id=364> I support the amendment by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is right in saying that this loan is important, but that, in the final analysis, the overall programme, given the necessary financial backing, is more important. </seg>
<seg id=365> We must now consider the bigger picture. </seg>
<seg id=366> Along with legal inequality for the opposition and overt state violence, this also manifested itself in the fact that fear was instilled in the people of Serbia vis-à-vis the big bad world outside and that people who criticised the regime were proclaimed traitor to their own country. </seg>
<seg id=367> As far as Croatia is concerned, there is every reason to set up a financial arrangement. </seg>
<seg id=368> Mr President, first of all I must declare a personal interest, I have a son-in-law who was, and is, a refugee from the Krajina in Croatia. </seg>
<seg id=369> Adjournment of the session </seg>
<seg id=370> Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, since our last part-session, a fortnight ago, three more people have been shot and killed by ETA. </seg>
<seg id=371> Madam President, last week, the MEP Karla Peijs was attacked in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id=372> (The President cut the speaker off) </seg>
<seg id=373> That was part of a concerted diplomatic effort and the House will be pleased to have learned that Mr Mawdsley was released by the Burmese authorities last week. </seg>
<seg id=374> Just because, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are supposed to be discussing the order of business does not mean that we have to take orders as to our business. </seg>
<seg id=375> We therefore propose postponing examination of this report. </seg>
<seg id=376> (Parliament rejected the request) </seg>
<seg id=377> The request for a reprieve that you mentioned, Madam President, does not alter this situation, as it is not a legal appeal. </seg>
<seg id=378> Madam President, I certainly do not require the two minutes allocated to me because, after the explanation from Mr MacCormick and the additional explanation by Mr Zappalà, from the point of view of the Group of the Party of European Socialists of the European Parliament, there is no doubt that Mr Pacheco Pereira' s immunity should not be waived. </seg>
<seg id=379> Secondly, I would like to comment on the instruments. </seg>
<seg id=380> We must also make it clear that the social agenda does not intend to impose a uniform social policy but to coordinate, support and boost national policies within a global framework for social development, because all Member States currently face common challenges, which are naturally of varying proportions, such as working structures, discrimination against citizens and gender inequalities. </seg>
<seg id=381> The French Presidency welcomes this text and undertakes to give it the utmost consideration in its work. </seg>
<seg id=382> You will understand, given my duties as a member of the French Government, that I was particularly pleased to note that, firstly, the equality of men and women and, secondly, lifelong training are two areas which receive very strong support. </seg>
<seg id=383> I am thinking in particular of non-standard work. </seg>
<seg id=384> It is thus something which we are passing on to the Commission for further examination. </seg>
<seg id=385> We do not therefore share the report' s predilection for legislation at EU level. </seg>
<seg id=386> It is also important to ensure quality in health, an improved social situation, and an improved environment for everyone - the third system - and tax and legislative measures are essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerging economy of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id=387> Finally, I would just add that I am not a co-author of Amendment No 35 as stated in the document with the amendments. </seg>
<seg id=388> The Commission communication and Mrs Van Lancker' s report have the merit of remedying this imbalance by acknowledging the interaction between social and economic policy and employment policy. </seg>
<seg id=389> I should also like to thank the other Anna for the substantial work she has done on this matter, something we could not have done without. </seg>
<seg id=390> What is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy, based on the Lisbon Decisions, indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature. </seg>
<seg id=391> Neither can we forget what the e-Europe initiative means for new jobs, new technologies and the information society, where I think women have an important role to play. </seg>
<seg id=392> We need modern, European social harmonisation, not deregulation. </seg>
<seg id=393> The second strand to the social agenda is a set of projects on social policy. </seg>
<seg id=394> Finally, as far as procedures are concerned, I really must congratulate Parliament on its initiative in starting a dialogue with the civil society and the important contribution which this dialogue made to the agenda, as well as highlight the discussions which took place with Parliament, with the Member States and with the social partners at European and national level; this is how we were able to combine national idiosyncrasies and ensure, above all, that the Agenda is not merely ambitious but flexible and efficient. </seg>
<seg id=395> It is also incredibly important, not to say fundamental, that the various Community actions, the framework strategy and the Member States' measures complement, and do not counteract, each other. </seg>
<seg id=396> Commissioner, we waited with a great deal of anticipation for the Commission' s communication on the strategy which it intends to apply to gender equality over the next five years. </seg>
<seg id=397> Financial resources are indispensable, as is always the case when goals are to be achieved and there is a great deal of catching up to do. </seg>
<seg id=398> For too long, women' s role has been despised. </seg>
<seg id=399> I should like to see this House confirming this bold change of course. </seg>
<seg id=400> We need to encourage a change in the roles and stereotypes associated with gender, which will also help to solve some of the other problems above. </seg>
<seg id=401> More emphasis should be placed on establishing links between women' s organisations, which is something I called for back when I was rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme. </seg>
<seg id=402> Mr President, I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Eriksson, who has endeavoured in the short time available to respond to the need for us to accept the programme as quickly as possible, so that we can avoid a vacuum between the fourth and fifth programmes and can start implementing the fifth programme in January. </seg>
<seg id=403> (A5-0290/2000) tabled by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on the XXIXth report on competition policy - 1999 [SEC(2000) 720 - C5-0302/2000 - 2000/2153 (COS)]; </seg>
<seg id=404> I make no secret of the fact that I feel very strongly about tightening up on the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully, especially since this is another area it is important to sort out before enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=405> I know that is a matter of concern to the Commissioner and it is certainly a concern I share. </seg>
<seg id=406> I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue is raised both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we are discussing today. </seg>
<seg id=407> The second paragraph I want to mention is paragraph 18. </seg>
<seg id=408> Lastly, Commissioner, there is the case of the public financing of State television under the alibi of financing a public service, which is a concept that is fading fast. </seg>
<seg id=409> What I mean - and this is directed at the public, not the Commission - is that its decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation, but must instead lead to Europeanisation. </seg>
<seg id=410> Without a properly administered competition policy, neither the European Union' s economy nor its external manifestation, in the form of the euro, will ever be able to achieve its full potential. </seg>
<seg id=411> Secondly, the Member States have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activities. </seg>
<seg id=412> On the subject of explaining competition policy, I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the success of the first two European Competition Days, which were held in Lisbon on 9 June and in Paris on 17 October this year. </seg>
<seg id=413> As you know, on 9 and 10 November, the Commission and Parliament are jointly organising a conference on this reform in Freiburg, a conference proposed for the first time precisely in your resolution on the White Paper. </seg>
<seg id=414> Concerning the problem of one DG Competition official who resigned, I have already expressed my regret about that resignation. </seg>
<seg id=415> Financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments </seg>
<seg id=416> On that occasion, the Council endorsed the Commission' s position, which recommended that the mechanism should be continued, and decided that a further assessment, carried out according to the same procedure, would be necessary in the light of the changes linked to the commencement of the third stage. </seg>
<seg id=417> As far as I am concerned, French vine propagators should also be in a position to propagate vines for the German or Italian market, and vice versa. </seg>
<seg id=418> " Just who is going to benefit from this amended regulation which includes GMOs? </seg>
<seg id=419> The base legislation in force dates from 1968, a long way back, and a great deal of progress had been made in this sector since then: new materials have been tried out, often using natural methods and sometimes genetic modification. </seg>
<seg id=420> Commissioner, Mrs Klass, listen to the opinions of the experts from the Institut national des appellations d'origine, the French National Appellations Institute. </seg>
<seg id=421> Moreover, these amendments have already been discussed but not accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. </seg>
<seg id=422> While the Council of State was in the process of examining the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the committee in no way refrained from discussing the consequences of this appeal, nor even from assessing the decision taken. </seg>
<seg id=423> I would remind you that the Greek word for such independence would be 'auto nomoi' , which means 'having its own laws' , and as the rapporteur says "its own rules" . </seg>
<seg id=424> Thus, while certain deep-seated reservations persist concerning taxation, some form of progress will still be possible thanks to the technical adjustments that the Presidency is to look into with the help of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=425> Work will now continue in a very intensive manner up to Nice, on the basis of the informal guidelines adopted by this European Council. </seg>
<seg id=426> It was precisely with this in mind that President Kostunica was invited, as you will be aware, to take part in the summit meeting between the European Union and the countries of the western Balkans, which is to be held in Zagreb, at the instigation of the President of the French Republic, on 24 November. </seg>
<seg id=427> In saying this, ladies and gentlemen, I have in mind a number of points that are still under discussion. </seg>
<seg id=428> Another point of criticism - but the weather can always improve - is that we have quite obviously failed to make any progress to speak of when it comes to majority decisions in the Council of Ministers. </seg>
<seg id=429> With regard to the report by the President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament has no essential criticisms. </seg>
<seg id=430> We must be coherent and uphold the Charter here and in our own national parliaments. </seg>
<seg id=431> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the enlargement of the Union is a means of increasing stability and safety in Europe and of promoting tolerance and democracy. </seg>
<seg id=432> It is very important, as part of the process that has started, for the Union to contribute to the reconstruction, stability and promotion of human rights in all the countries of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id=433> The heart of the matter is that the élites who are keenest on integration want to be able to make decisions without broad democratic support. </seg>
<seg id=434> You can in any case rest assured, Mr President, that it is the genuine desire of the Presidency of the Council to seek out a compromise that suits everyone. </seg>
<seg id=435> Mr Barón Crespo asked several questions which primarily concern the link between qualified majority voting and codecision. </seg>
<seg id=436> I will make no secret of the fact that we are engaged in a process, one in which we are well versed, of having the Charter proclaimed by each of the three institutions. </seg>
<seg id=437> I believe that now, in this policy of forward movement, the inclusion in Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union is very important, as there is no sense - and I do not wish to be inconsistent - in the European Union deciding not to provide a legal basis in the Treaty for the Union to be able to adhere to the European Convention on Human Rights and, at the same time, talking in the same paragraph about the interpretation of fundamental rights based on this same European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. </seg>
<seg id=438> No one in this Parliament would understand it if no agreement on this issue was reached at Nice. </seg>
<seg id=439> It therefore comes as no surprise that governments clashed on essential issues. </seg>
<seg id=440> A third and final course of action, which no one has talked about but which seems to me very important, is the need to also incorporate a revision clause into the Charter so that we have a dynamic rather than a static text. </seg>
<seg id=441> Let us reflect for a moment on the ratification procedure for any newly revised European Union treaty. </seg>
<seg id=442> Four revisions in fifteen years have not improved matters, and now we are expected to believe that a charter or a constitution might do something to change things. </seg>
<seg id=443> Sometimes the intergovernmental conference looks like an anxious administrative bureaucracy trying to share out power. </seg>
<seg id=444> Mr President, there are many important issues which must be solved. </seg>
<seg id=445> Now, the moment of truth has arrived in which we must be prepared to defend the little influence we have. </seg>
<seg id=446> Nevertheless, we all know that there are huge numbers of citizens, both in Israel and in Palestine, who are simply finding out - in the hope of peace - how tough life is as long as peace has not really been established. </seg>
<seg id=447> The members of Forza Italia voted for the Charter in Europe and I am able to inform you officially that we will vote for it here in Strasbourg in November. </seg>
<seg id=448> Biarritz did not manage to dispel all the storm clouds attending our mission to promote the democratisation of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=449> In the past, the European Union has been successful in those areas where the Monnet method and majority decision-making are applied, and where the institutions, i.e. Parliament and the Commission, have been strengthened. </seg>
<seg id=450> Mr President, Mr Moscovici, Commissioner Barnier, although no progress was made at the Biarritz summit in the area of essential structural reform of the Union, I have faith in the ability of France, as the country holding the Presidency of the Council, under the leadership of her innovative President Chirac, to pilot structural solutions too in a direction which will cause the stream of development to continue to flow and which is acceptable to all at Nice also. </seg>
<seg id=451> I would point out that right from the start the Commission indicated that it was in favour of the idea of giving legal effect to this Charter. </seg>
<seg id=452> Lastly, as Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Poettering have just suggested, I believe that we must indeed raise the debate to the political level and the correct level, that of the final decision, which is to say the level of Heads of State and Government. </seg>
<seg id=453> To the right of us, we have Joseph de Maistre, the counter-revolutionary thinker, who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of a constitution, because a constitution is made - shock, horror! </seg>
<seg id=454> Peace, prosperity, democracy and justice are values which, each in their own way, virtually all the Members and the groups in Parliament, and the majority of elected representatives and political groups wish to see achieved by Europe and for Europe. </seg>
<seg id=455> The report proposes these two phases as commitments that should be entered into at Nice, because it is possible. </seg>
<seg id=456> Mr President, I am outlining here a resolution which was approved and discussed last week by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I would like to thank the Chairman, Mr Napolitano, who conducted the proceedings and signed the resolution. </seg>
<seg id=457> I note, at any rate, that for today, the last matter has not been referred to us, and I am in complete agreement with Commissioner Barnier. </seg>
<seg id=458> Objectively speaking, this is a real matter of principle which makes it impossible, in my view, to adopt exactly the same rules within each area of reinforced cooperation as within the European Union, and this is all the more true in the very specific and delicate area of foreign security and defence policy. </seg>
<seg id=459> Let me come back to the three matters I mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=460> As usual, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with its chairman, and yourself, Mr Segni, brought up questions that were both extremely pertinent but also extremely complex. </seg>
<seg id=461> We now need to work together to ensure that this intention or direction actually becomes reality. </seg>
<seg id=462> Commissioner Barnier, you made this point a moment ago, and rightly so. </seg>
<seg id=463> Openness and transparency must be ensured under all circumstances. </seg>
<seg id=464> The people of Europe need, deserve and, according to opinion polls, want a common constitution clearly expressing the EU' s values and objectives and clarifying the division of power and responsibility both between the institutions and between the institutions and the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=465> The Council' s claim to power is the main stumbling block in the current constitutional process and it is the root cause of the Union' s democratic deficit. </seg>
<seg id=466> The main aim behind this, which is not clearly stated in the resolution, would be to lay down for Europe, even for the fundamental texts, majority-style collective decision-making procedures, completely different, therefore, to the unanimous Council votes or the votes on ratification by Member States used today to amend the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=467> According to paragraph 4, we need a constitution because the Treaties are "unreadable and invisible" . </seg>
<seg id=468> When the intergovernmental conference in Amsterdam inserted a special reference to islands into Article 158 on economic and social cohesion, adding the word "islands" as a special category under the regions which deserve particular attention within the context of cohesion policies, we here in the European Parliament who had first fought for this development thought that it marked the start of a new era for island regions. </seg>
<seg id=469> We must ask for maximum progress to be made in this field in a coherent manner - as indicated in Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado' s excellent report - seeing reinforced cooperation as a last resort that would make it possible in all areas in which decisions are not taken by a qualified majority and also with regard to the CFSP and defence, for the permanence of the single institutional framework to be guaranteed, for a sufficient critical mass of countries to take part in it and, of course, for it to be open at all times. </seg>
<seg id=470> I hope the Treaty of Nice is achieved and seen to be a success and that closer cooperation is included as a welcome move in the direction of flexibility. </seg>
<seg id=471> Mr President, two brief observations regarding the reports on our agenda today. </seg>
<seg id=472> The Duhamel report contains important pointers on all these issues. </seg>
<seg id=473> Mr Gil-Robles' proposals on reinforced cooperation are, on balance, positive. </seg>
<seg id=474> (Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the Committee responsible) </seg>
<seg id=475> If there is an equality of votes and if the honourable Member did vote, even though her machine did not work, then the procedure in any parliamentary assembly is that amendment falls. </seg>
<seg id=476> With regard to the passage on work experience in companies, apprenticeships, joint work/training contracts, it aims to make more widespread a practice already adopted by many States which consists, on the pretext on helping workers or unemployed young people, of making a partially or completely subsidised workforce available to employers. </seg>
<seg id=477> MacCormick report (A5-0304/2000) </seg>
<seg id=478> Mr President, in the course of this discussion on the Klaß report, I have been unable to comprehend why some people have persistently confused the terms 'genotype' and 'genetic modification' . </seg>
<seg id=479> As far as the definition of the clone is concerned, it is inadequate because, basically, the clone is a sub-division of the variety with special characteristics which have to be made known and the definition given does not cover this. </seg>
<seg id=480> With regard to company mergers, which the rapporteur hopes that the Commission will assess, such an assessment should describe not only the competitive advantages and the additional benefits that companies gain from them. </seg>
<seg id=481> Tomorrow I am not going to work, I will become a pensioner, because my country, Italy, has a system of early retirement. </seg>
<seg id=482> In fact, one can recall that 40% grant aid is available for fixed investment costs for new businesses setting up within the Objective 1 region in Ireland. </seg>
<seg id=483> My final verdict is therefore positive. </seg>
<seg id=484> The intolerable situation being forced on workers by the choices made by large companies and the EU is already causing widespread reaction. </seg>
<seg id=485> Section VIII, Ombudsman </seg>
<seg id=486> When you then consider that the Commission would concentrate initially on cutting back the amounts outstanding in such a situation, which naturally we would also favour, there would, however, be far too great a risk of not being able to continue with a budgetary line deemed important by Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=487> We all know too, that it is no longer all that difficult for high-tech SMEs to acquire capital, because - and our initiative helped bring this about - the capital market situation of these companies has in fact improved considerably. </seg>
<seg id=488> This is irrespective of the EUR 180 million we transferred last night for emergency aid, for the remainder of the year, because this money has come from the emergency reserve and is only to be used for humanitarian aid, i.e. to help the Serbs get through the winter during the last few months of the year. </seg>
<seg id=489> With a total of EUR 980 million, the European Parliament' s budget, which I am submitting today, is the largest individual budget. </seg>
<seg id=490> We have made no change to the Council Budget, as per the agreement between Parliament and the Council. </seg>
<seg id=491> The Economic and Social Committee must get its own house in order if it wants to avoid jeopardising its continued existence for good. </seg>
<seg id=492> This corresponds, or rather, comes very close to what Parliament proposed during the previous budgetary procedure, i.e. EUR 196 million. </seg>
<seg id=493> In view of the decline in ECSC activities, and the conversion, it is debatable as to whether we can really still justify having an administrative budget of this size. </seg>
<seg id=494> We also asked the Council - with what success we do not know - to adopt a similar approach. </seg>
<seg id=495> This is a real record, which I hope will now lead to greater consideration of the financial constraints in our legislative activities. </seg>
<seg id=496> I would also like to emphasise the Council and Parliament' s common objectives, which will in my opinion enable these two arms of the budgetary authority to arrive at an agreement. </seg>
<seg id=497> Within this category of expenditure, however, the Council has adjusted the balance in favour of the Cohesion Fund: giving the Cohesion Fund an extra EUR 360 million over and above the preliminary draft budget, which has been taken away from the Structural Fund, as a result of the implementation estimates submitted by the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=498> At this stage the Council does not see the revision of the financial perspective as being a prerequisite for financing reconstruction in the Balkans. </seg>
<seg id=499> I must point out that the Berlin Decisions would allow for a 6.1% increase in payments as compared with the previous year, and no decision proposes an increase on that scale. </seg>
<seg id=500> If we want to improve - and that is our aim where the performance reserve is concerned - then of course we will need those posts. </seg>
<seg id=501> We also have the negative reserve instrument available to us in the course of the budgetary procedure. </seg>
<seg id=502> We also looked at the Court of Auditors' special reports. </seg>
<seg id=503> I think this is a mistake which must be set right. </seg>
<seg id=504> In fact, back at first reading, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market argued strongly in favour of rectifying this deplorable state of affairs and helping to reinstate the citizens' right to see their European laws upheld, and to avoid the EU falling into disrepute as a Community of law, on account of delays. </seg>
<seg id=505> Our citizens, not to mention this House, have had enough of this policy of merely paying lip service. </seg>
<seg id=506> I would like to pay tribute to the work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, in trying to resolve some very difficult questions this year because of the immense pressures that have been brought to bear upon the budget at a very late stage. </seg>
<seg id=507> That is a pity; it would be preferable if, in spending the budget, the actual objective were achieved, namely if the switch were made from countryside to multifunctionality and greater market orientation. </seg>
<seg id=508> Quality products must be highlighted, conservation standards, such as the observation of minimum fish sizes, must be circulated and we must explain to consumers the health benefits of eating fish. </seg>
<seg id=509> She sat in on our committee and, to her credit, took our committee' s proposals into consideration. </seg>
<seg id=510> We cannot and must not present the bill for this to the poorest countries. </seg>
<seg id=511> I would like to cite another amendment related to women' s organisations: the committee approved an amount for the European Women' s Lobby. </seg>
<seg id=512> In particular, this year we have asked - and I believe we will have the support of the House - to ensure that there is adequate money to see that we have a proper interactive database so that Members, staff and citizens can address their concerns and see how they are progressing through Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=513> We in Parliament should coordinate with the other two institutions on what we should be doing in terms of enlargement for translation, interpretation, buildings and personnel and we should work out a joint plan between us. </seg>
<seg id=514> As it turns out, the moderate face of conservatism has for the most part prevailed over the more ideological and unacceptable one. </seg>
<seg id=515> This is why we have called for a trialogue as soon as possible once this reading is complete, so that we can get down to the substance of the discussions. </seg>
<seg id=516> That is not our approach! </seg>
<seg id=517> We can approach this in two ways with these payments. </seg>
<seg id=518> It is right that the committee should have made a special point of focus the reduction in expenditure commitments that are in arrears. </seg>
<seg id=519> I must say that is how many people on the outside view the Council' s policy. </seg>
<seg id=520> We are also critical of the decisions taken with regard to the LIFE programme. </seg>
<seg id=521> This is a blind alley, which my Group is not ready to go down. </seg>
<seg id=522> Mr President, when one hears Mr Wurtz' s ornate, well-argued and well-considered reasoning, it is difficult not to agree with at least the underlying argument, if not the method he recommends. </seg>
<seg id=523> Mr President, one of the principles governing the budgetary process for 2001 is that of saving money. </seg>
<seg id=524> I also hope that the conditions attached to the establishment of 400 additional service posts within the Commission will actually be fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id=525> With a view to resolving current bottlenecks, a general reserve should be created under category 4 - a performance reserve - which will be used in proportion to the extent to which the various items are implemented. </seg>
<seg id=526> Kosovo, of course - which we had the problem with last year. </seg>
<seg id=527> My real worry is that, when the Commission and the World Bank come back with their report at the end of November or beginning of December, it will just be written off by the Council. </seg>
<seg id=528> That is something for which we should always be thankful. </seg>
<seg id=529> This is not some sort of Directory. </seg>
<seg id=530> As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 4 and 5 will be taken together. </seg>
<seg id=531> Following the international meeting on the Colombian peace process, held in Madrid on 6 and 7 July 2000, attended by Mr Solana, the representative of the 15 Member States and the Commission, the European Union is currently looking into practical opportunities for cooperation with Colombia. </seg>
<seg id=532> This is the problem, in addition, in many cases, to the actions of the paramilitaries, who force the peasant-farmers to move by means of indiscriminate killings. </seg>
<seg id=533> It is the duty of the President of the sitting to guide and interpret the questions and it is then at the discretion of the President-in-Office of the Council how to discuss or respond to them, except where the questions are nonsensical or have nothing to do with the subject. </seg>
<seg id=534> It is just that I am trying not to indulge in demagoguery. </seg>
<seg id=535> Would the Council be willing to consider establishing a 'Tobin area' at European Union level, i.e. imposing a Tobin tax on Europe' s financial markets, which account for 50% of world currency-exchange transactions? </seg>
<seg id=536> Firstly, I think everyone recognises that this tax, known as Tobin tax could operate properly only if applied at world level. </seg>
<seg id=537> Indeed we hope that this will prove to be one of the main practical achievements of this Presidency. </seg>
<seg id=538> The thing that astounds me is your claim that a minor amount cannot have a deterrent effect on speculation. </seg>
<seg id=539> Firstly, will he come and speak to us as a militant on a future occasion? </seg>
<seg id=540> I do agree with you, however, we could be discussing this for a long time to come. </seg>
<seg id=541> The Council has not received any Commission proposal on compensation for farmers. </seg>
<seg id=542> As usual, however, I can assure you that we shall give you a specific answer if you put a specific question to us. </seg>
<seg id=543> Regarding international traffic in transit, international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, stipulates, subject to certain reservations, that the vessels of all states have the 'right of innocent passage' in territorial waters. </seg>
<seg id=544> Finally, I also endorse the observation made in the Haug resolution that we need to pay bills on time as soon as possible, because the Commission will not come out smelling of roses if this situation continues for much longer. </seg>
<seg id=545> I would like to focus attention on the fact that there seem to be sufficient amounts of European Union money for financing political parties at European level, but not, for example, for the prevention of unemployment. </seg>
<seg id=546> Mr President, in the Haug report the sentiment is expressed that the Commission, in close cooperation with Parliament, is responsible for providing information to the European citizen about the policies of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=547> The efforts of the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, to incorporate the suggestions of our Group on that subject deserve a great deal of gratitude. </seg>
<seg id=548> There are three major issues which we should be concerned about in relation to the budget for other institutions. </seg>
<seg id=549> Real savings can only be made if the institutions work together. </seg>
<seg id=550> That is the sort of question we must ask ourselves when we study the Budget, for it is of course questions of this kind that our voters will quite rightly be asking. </seg>
<seg id=551> Another area I wanted to address is that of agricultural policy, where most of the savings have been made. </seg>
<seg id=552> A point not always made is that this sizeable budget provision is not just confined to support for farmers but is also a factor in the provision of cheap food for European citizens. </seg>
<seg id=553> I was able to experience this first-hand over the past two weeks when, during a trip in the Western Balkans, I visited Kosovo and Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id=554> The damage in the Balkans needs to be restored, but it should be paid by for those who were responsible for it. </seg>
<seg id=555> With these funds, we could show that Europe is the real partner in this region. </seg>
<seg id=556> I think that this distorts the legislative procedure for adopting programmes and, above all, the content of those programmes. </seg>
<seg id=557> In the same way, we need a careful analysis on the part of the Commission of how, in the course of the enlargement process, European administration is to be developed. </seg>
<seg id=558> Mr President, unlike Mr Bourlanges, I am not frustrated by this procedure but I must say that this must be the most mind-numbing budget I have known in the Committee on Budgets for years. </seg>
<seg id=559> The increase is inexplicably high in category 1, that is to say the EU' s comprehensive agricultural policy about which the Council of Ministers has the last word. </seg>
<seg id=560> A sector such as steel, thanks to technological research and development, has ceased to be an industry that only generates basic products and has become one that puts semi-processed products on the market with added value. </seg>
<seg id=561> During my time in the House of Commons not once do I recall any debate about the EDF budget and I doubt whether there is any debate in the Member States about the EDF budget. </seg>
<seg id=562> This is what I am asking you to do, and I am asking you to vote accordingly. </seg>
<seg id=563> I also have to make it very clear that we now have a fledgling new regional government in Northern Ireland of which my party leader, David Trimble, is the First Minister. </seg>
<seg id=564> Therefore, a rule laying down the right of everyone to the protection of personal data concerning him, which must be processed fairly for specific purposes on the basis of the consent of the person concerned and subject to control by an independent authority, has been included in Article 8 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=565> Mr President, the protection of personal privacy is a fundamental human right. </seg>
<seg id=566> Data protection on the telecommunications network ought also to be reviewed. </seg>
<seg id=567> The scope of the regulation adopted on the basis of the report is limited to the first pillar, i.e. to Article 286. </seg>
<seg id=568> This would increase the channels for protecting the citizens - an extremely important element - but also make it easier for them to act, to be active and to interact with the institutions. </seg>
<seg id=569> Amendment Nos 55, 56 and 59 differ from the Council text, but they were the result of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the Council Presidency. </seg>
<seg id=570> Amendment No 69 would seem to be acceptable to the Commission inasmuch as the wording does not entail a challenge to its right of initiative. </seg>
<seg id=571> The report published by the European Commission on 14 March 2000 is not, strictly speaking, a response to the demands of national and regional authorities in the outermost regions. </seg>
<seg id=572> Moreover, there is an urgent need to initiate an analysis of the impact of the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, signed in June 2000 in Cotonou, and other international trade agreements with a view to assessing their repercussions for the outermost regions and drawing up measures to compensate producers in those regions liable to face additional competition which they are unable to withstand. </seg>
<seg id=573> Nonetheless, it illustrates what I believe is a much more widespread problem about the relationship between reports and opinions, particularly those of a non-legislative kind. </seg>
<seg id=574> For those of us who are speaking here tonight on behalf of our native regions, this is a very negative view, and, of course, a deeply mistaken one. </seg>
<seg id=575> In our view these measures need to go beyond regional development policies, because our shortfalls and handicaps are structural, not temporary. </seg>
<seg id=576> Indeed I am convinced that the young people of our regions can actually glimpse a way out of the tragic unemployment which so drives them to despair, if we do manage to shift from a basically financial strategy, necessary, admittedly, but inadequate, to a more comprehensive strategy based on real recognition of our unique characteristics. </seg>
<seg id=577> The economic development of the regions must be supported through, for example, various direct and indirect taxation solutions. </seg>
<seg id=578> The experience of almost a decade and the new challenges created by developments in the common agricultural policy suggest that these programmes should be revised in order to sustain the ability of these regions to survive in the new climate of competition. </seg>
<seg id=579> We want to continue to be an area - or areas, in this case - that requires specific treatment. </seg>
<seg id=580> This, ladies and gentlemen, means that we, that is, you and I, must find a balance between complying with general regulation and adapting policy to the specific needs of the outermost regions. </seg>
<seg id=581> In Feira, we reported back on the progress of work and we shall, of course, do the same at the European Council in Nice. </seg>
<seg id=582> The Commission is also paying great attention to a number of other issues. </seg>
<seg id=583> Thank you very much, Commissioner Barnier. </seg>
<seg id=584> It has occurred to me overnight that if the result of a vote is declared and there is within the Rules no provision for the issue to be reopened at all, given the alarming frequency with which a whole range of machines do not work, this could create serious difficulties. </seg>
<seg id=585> If I had known that the total number of abstentions and votes against was going to be greater than the number of votes in favour of Mr Evans' report, I would have asked my Group to vote against that report and it would not have been adopted. </seg>
<seg id=586> New action is needed. </seg>
<seg id=587> We must be able to rely on the fact that salmonella is being tackled. </seg>
<seg id=588> Strict requirements and effective control are indispensable, but competition should be kept clean in the process. </seg>
<seg id=589> The second principle is that it is important for this Agency to be highly independent and we must guarantee that independence. </seg>
<seg id=590> I will mention briefly the key amendments which I commend to the House and the Commissioner and which I hope we can see voted through today. </seg>
<seg id=591> Mr President, Mr Bowis has done an extraordinary job as rapporteur on this major and complicated issue. </seg>
<seg id=592> This means that all inspectorates must work together well and, often, insufficient attention is paid to the inspectorates which inspect animal medicines; this is the pharmaceutical inspectorate in my country. </seg>
<seg id=593> The best case scenario is that it will work alongside the Environmental Agency, which does an excellent information job, but which freely admits that the environmental situation in Europe has not improved. </seg>
<seg id=594> Lastly, we must beware of standardising our food cultures. </seg>
<seg id=595> Risk assessment must start where the problems starts. </seg>
<seg id=596> This principle must be consistently adhered to when the planned review of EU legislation on food labelling is carried out. </seg>
<seg id=597> If we do not manage to modernise the early warning system and make it work, then there is little point in worrying about much else. </seg>
<seg id=598> We are now hoping for Parliament' s support, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will accept our proposals. </seg>
<seg id=599> Mr President, the sheer number of food scandals and the debate about using genetic engineering in food production have undermined the present food safety system. </seg>
<seg id=600> How this works in practice will become clear when the authority has to act. </seg>
<seg id=601> The establishment of an independent, high profile European Food Safety Agency is a substantial step which satisfies the need of all the citizens for guarantees on the quality and safety of food products. </seg>
<seg id=602> I will not dwell on the heart of the matter, since we are all agreed on that. </seg>
<seg id=603> However, having said that, I believe it is to the credit of this Parliament and Commissioner Byrne that food safety now dominates the European agenda. </seg>
<seg id=604> It also has symbolic meaning. </seg>
<seg id=605> But I also understand that the many crises in Europe, and I also refer to my own country, have shown that we mainly need something to hold on to. </seg>
<seg id=606> The agency must be located somewhere well-connected in terms of transport and information technology, and the area in question should have a good reputation in the area of food safety. </seg>
<seg id=607> I would also like to thank Commissioner Byrne for his cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=608> Consumers are quite right to demand food which poses absolutely no threat to their health and the quality of which meets certain criteria and specifications. </seg>
<seg id=609> On a final note, President Prodi created huge expectations in the run-up to his presidency, and Commissioner Byrne and rapporteur Bowis were asked to flesh these out in their White Paper. </seg>
<seg id=610> The limited quantity of food we still allow ourselves must first and foremost be healthy, taste good and be produced in an environmentally sound way in consumers' eyes. </seg>
<seg id=611> The selection found on overflowing shelves has long since made this a genuine option. </seg>
<seg id=612> It is driven by the desperate need to persuade a sceptical public that the European institutions are delivering something - anything - of value. </seg>
<seg id=613> There are many doubts and critical voices. </seg>
<seg id=614> Therefore, any legislative measure concerning a sector such as the food sector, which is one of the driving forces of European industry - accounting for 15% of the total output of the manufacturing sector and employing 2.5 million workers - must be evaluated on the basis of this twin consideration, since both principles are intended to guarantee the general well-being of the Community. </seg>
<seg id=615> Amendments have been tabled to that effect. </seg>
<seg id=616> In this regard, the Commission will adopt proposals for a revised control regime in the period ahead. </seg>
<seg id=617> I have previously acknowledged in Parliament and other forums what I regard as an important issue for the fullest acceptance of our ideas for a food authority: the role and involvement of Parliament itself in enacting the legislation establishing the food authority. </seg>
<seg id=618> This was one of the most rapid agreements to be signed in the history of international agreements: it is the only agreement to have been ratified within a year by forty parliaments, thus becoming operative. </seg>
<seg id=619> Mr President, even in common parlance the word 'mine' indicates danger, and if an Italian describes someone as 'una mina' they are calling that person a loose canon. </seg>
<seg id=620> But of course its authority in this field will be greater if the Council and the Member States explicitly state that the European Union will under no circumstances in its external relations use anti-personnel landmines or help in their use. </seg>
<seg id=621> But they also often destroy countries' long-term development potential by contaminating entire regions. </seg>
<seg id=622> It is the challenge of implementing that Convention to the full which led the Commission to reflect on how to reinforce the contribution of the European Union to the battle against landmines. </seg>
<seg id=623> Clearly, the granting of European Union mine-action support can work as an important lever to get potential beneficiary countries to sign up to the Convention. </seg>
<seg id=624> Instead, we are proposing to set up an expert group with participation from Member States, from non-governmental organisations and from the other relevant players. </seg>
<seg id=625> Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 8, 22, 23, 25 and 29. </seg>
<seg id=626> The anti-personnel landmine campaign should not be used as an opportunity to attack western governments, particularly the United States, western military establishments, or western industry. </seg>
<seg id=627> The Commission communication and the regulation on anti-personnel landmines are very useful documents, but they omit two key elements, which Parliament's amendments seek to correct. </seg>
<seg id=628> We do not want more bureaucracy or comitology; instead we want to create more room for you, we want things to be done efficiently, and I believe that our priorities in this respect are not a million miles apart. </seg>
<seg id=629> That is a mistake this Parliament is constantly making. </seg>
<seg id=630> When, for example, a country feels insecure along its border with another country, its government will take recourse, wrongly of course, to the easy option of a minefield. </seg>
<seg id=631> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I strongly support the Community's initiative against anti-personnel mines. </seg>
<seg id=632> The European Union is often the most important contributor to financing de-mining actions, and international actions are carried out in the relevant countries. </seg>
<seg id=633> Since various comments have been made, I would like to specify that although the Minister is not present, the Council is represented by senior civil servants, who will of course pass our words on to him. </seg>
<seg id=634> (The President cut the speaker off) </seg>
<seg id=635> I would briefly like to comment on one point, and this concerns our amendment to the motion for a resolution. </seg>
<seg id=636> I know there are still differences of opinion on this or that amendment. </seg>
<seg id=637> The history we share with our neighbour has often been full of anguish. </seg>
<seg id=638> Experts from Finland and Finnish clearance vehicles have taken part in clearance programmes in Cambodia for two and a half years, and in Mozambique and Kosovo for one year. </seg>
<seg id=639> (Interruption by the President to request silence) </seg>
<seg id=640> If Mrs Van Lancker' s proposals are adopted we shall definitely be stepping back light years in terms of our ability to achieve the important, ambitious and indispensable aims of Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id=641> The Commission must not be prevented from using its right of initiative in those areas in which it has the power to act and to propose compulsory instruments. </seg>
<seg id=642> It cannot arbitrarily be transferred to other areas, as specific procedures are needed. </seg>
<seg id=643> As for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the only reason the meeting of Heads of State and Government signed it was in order to be seen to make a statement. </seg>
<seg id=644> I voted for this resolution because in it Parliament wisely does not opt for the 'imperialist' theses of the large, populous European countries against the self-affirmation of the others. </seg>
<seg id=645> The resolution contains good sections on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Middle East and the EPLP supports the resolution overall. </seg>
<seg id=646> I am sure that pensioners and elderly people feel that Europe represents a future of peace, and we therefore support any step, however small, in that direction. </seg>
<seg id=647> We believe that the basis for cooperation in the EU should continue to be unanimity on the basic questions concerning the legal base on which the EU is founded. </seg>
<seg id=648> The Portuguese socialist MEPs do not, however, agree that ratification of this 'Constitution' should necessarily be carried out by means of a referendum. </seg>
<seg id=649> In the name of the democratic Europe we want to build, we reject the report. </seg>
<seg id=650> But a constitution is something else entirely. </seg>
<seg id=651> A future Constitution could set out in a clear and (relatively) concise way </seg>
<seg id=652> We have a constitution already in the form of the Treaties, in so far as they lay down the competences of the Union, its procedures and the composition and powers of its institutions. </seg>
<seg id=653> If, tomorrow, the Union wishes to embrace Europe in its entirety, the geographical Europe, extending even beyond the next wave of enlargement, it will need institutions that are fully mature in political and democratic terms. </seg>
<seg id=654> The ulterior motive is to be able to continue the development towards 'ever closer union' without being hampered by the enlargement to which the EU countries have committed themselves. </seg>
<seg id=655> These proposals are not acceptable; the need for cooperation within Europe is genuine, but also diverse and multiform, and it can no longer be locked into a uniform Community framework based on majority voting. </seg>
<seg id=656> We must point out that reinforced cooperation, as provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam, must in particular concern an area that does not come within the Community' s exclusive purview, must be aimed at furthering the objectives of the Union, must respect the principles of the Treaties and must be used only as a last resort while concerning a majority of Member States. </seg>
<seg id=657> Once again, if poorer and smaller countries of the European Union could not reform their economic structures they would not be able to meet the economic convergence criterion as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=658> That is why I am in favour of a minimum number of rules and limitations affecting reinforced cooperation between neighbours, as long as such cooperation is not intended to disadvantage third parties. </seg>
<seg id=659> On the other hand, we welcome the paragraphs in the report on promoting renewable energies and monitoring industrial activities which cause pollution. </seg>
<seg id=660> Most especially, this has resulted in the planned destruction of our banana industry, in Guadeloupe, Martinique, Madeira and the Canaries. </seg>
<seg id=661> On the other hand, we have serious doubts as to whether or not former colonies should be declared outermost regions. </seg>
<seg id=662> That independence also implies financial independence. </seg>
<seg id=663> This first step must not close our eyes to the serious work that still needs to be done on risk management, developing and improving the Rapid Alert System, but also on ensuring traceability and public information. </seg>
<seg id=664> Nor should the Commission appoint the scientific experts, even following what appears to be a rigorous selection procedure. </seg>
<seg id=665> So today we need to correct the adverse effects on public health of a policy very largely inspired by the Commission, as Mrs Thomas-Mauro quite rightly pointed out this morning. </seg>
<seg id=666> (The sitting was suspended at 2.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=667> Madam President, I would point out though that we still have not received an answer to one question, namely whether the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is prepared to withdraw its amendments. </seg>
<seg id=668> So, we have an additional 1.3 million for the Medicines Agency. </seg>
<seg id=669> Either this is a way of pursuing Liberal politics, where the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, or there is a lack of coordination. </seg>
<seg id=670> Section I, European Parliament </seg>
<seg id=671> Before the vote on Amendment No 60 </seg>
<seg id=672> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </seg>
<seg id=673> Contributions that are relatively minor for our richest countries could have a strategic role for peace and development in those regions, yet the choice has been to make significant cuts, which looks like a dangerous policy of burying our heads in the sand. </seg>
<seg id=674> No one in the European Parliament would support discrimination or violence against women; we must remember that to deny women a voice is a form of violence against them. </seg>
<seg id=675> Secondly: because the new items for the reconstruction of Yugoslavia - which we need and which should be more substantial - have been found by slashing items for food relief, agriculture, social spending, etc., rather than by increasing the budget, which is what the Member States of the European Union should have done, given that they perpetrated and aided and abetted the destruction of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id=676> The review of the Financial Perspectives that Parliament has been demanding for some time in order to honour new commitments in the Balkan region, including Serbia, also continues to cast its shadow on proceedings. </seg>
<seg id=677> Rühle Report (A5-0251/2000) </seg>
<seg id=678> As well as the new constraints imposed on staff, particularly in the commercial services sector, inequality in the treatment of users is going to get worse. </seg>
<seg id=679> Madam President, in this case, too, it was with deep regret that I had to vote against. </seg>
<seg id=680> The proposals for fruit and vegetables are part of the more general, anti-farming direction which the EU is taking, now that it has decided to persecute farmers. </seg>
<seg id=681> The present report puts forward amendments on a range of points that address the interests of European production in general and of Portuguese production in particular. </seg>
<seg id=682> Personally, as the representative of the Pensioners Party, I am concerned at the situation of the elderly in these countries. </seg>
<seg id=683> The Commission communication should have been entitled differently, given that it contains no specific policies or measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases; on the contrary, it confines itself, as the rapporteur rightly comments, to merely producing an organisation chart and a vague list of common policies and measures. </seg>
<seg id=684> The boom in the cheap transport of goods by road mainly leads to the polluting industry being relocated from the richer to the poorer countries. </seg>
<seg id=685> The draft resolution proposes to ratify the establishment of such a system, when 'the technical and legal aspects have not yet been investigated' and 'the functioning and effectiveness of the system must be tested' . </seg>
<seg id=686> That does not detract from the fact that I am delighted with the interest in this topic. </seg>
<seg id=687> Similarly, we need to activate the principle of prevention contained in Article 130Ñ of the EU Treaty (in order to control and withdraw known or suspected endocrine disrupters and develop alternative harmless substances). </seg>
<seg id=688> In my report, I have listed systems such as IBAN, SWIFT, STEP 1 and IPI. </seg>
<seg id=689> A very costly matter indeed which will be rendered completely redundant in one market with one currency. </seg>
<seg id=690> But in order to grant banks absolute certainty and clarity in their heavy investment programmes, I am expecting the Commission to change the directive by return of post. </seg>
<seg id=691> There is even talk of it being possible to reduce costs by 90%, although the financial services institutions impress on us time and again that the higher costs are linked to processing the transfers and not to the technicalities of making cross-border payments. </seg>
<seg id=692> The European Commission does not have the right to set the level of bank charges, but it can use its influence to bring down transfer fees. </seg>
<seg id=693> The idea that transfers in two participating euro area countries will no longer be considered as an international transaction incurring international costs but as a national transfer, will need to become universally accepted. </seg>
<seg id=694> This is not some fiendish ploy by the bankers, just a technical reality temporarily resisting resolution, but bound to evolve in the right direction in time. </seg>
<seg id=695> So now we are facing the consequences of the hard sell of the euro, and that brings me to a conclusion on this issue of cross-border payments, but also, Madam President, on the euro generally. </seg>
<seg id=696> Although we in the European Parliament now criticise the banks we have to understand that cross-border payments account for only a six-percent slice of all payment transactions, so development of this area is an expensive investment in the eyes of the banks in relation to the benefits gained, from the point of view of the banks at least. </seg>
<seg id=697> For me, the argument that nowadays very few transfers of euros are made to other countries in the euro area does not count either. </seg>
<seg id=698> That date must be considered as an extremely important and symbolic milestone in the construction of the European Union - and I am also addressing Mrs Villiers with this observation. </seg>
<seg id=699> It is, of course, our aim to increase this to 100%. </seg>
<seg id=700> (The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=701> Next, we should take care not to make access to capital for firms, especially the smallest ones, even more complicated. </seg>
<seg id=702> To this end it wishes to introduce a benchmarking exercise, which is certainly an interesting initiative. </seg>
<seg id=703> She has identified the points where there was a lack of clarity or significant slippage between statements and reality in the Commission' s text. </seg>
<seg id=704> In our Union, this should in the first instance translate into simplification of customs formalities, because the fiscal, social, administrative and regulatory disparities between the Member States in terms of costs constitute a substantial barrier to equal access to the internal market. </seg>
<seg id=705> Secondly, and without going through the measures set out in the report, which are, anyway, the result of an assessment made last year, you will note, all the same, that we are taking up the same old essential points: simplification of the assistance formalities, which are still too cumbersome, and even stifling for SMIs; help with finance and risk capital to ensure greater stability; aid for research into new technologies; establishment of a European standard through the BEST process; aid with communication and information. </seg>
<seg id=706> But STOA is not really that kind of organisation and we have specific proposals to make on the subject. </seg>
<seg id=707> Another of Mrs Montfort' s key points is the improvement, or rather simplification, of legislation and the regulatory structure in the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=708> For small companies, the three or six months which they have to wait for a piece of information to be forthcoming or for a programme to start is an endlessly long time. </seg>
<seg id=709> Furthermore, we must in practice set aside specific and ring-fenced amounts, under European Union actions, for small and medium-sized businesses, within the ambit of all those activities relating to research, innovation, the e-Europe project and so forth. </seg>
<seg id=710> Mr President, we need to highlight the priority which the new multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship gives to small and medium-sized businesses. </seg>
<seg id=711> This is something that the Committee on Industry needs to do on a regular basis from now on. </seg>
<seg id=712> Many amendments refer to micro-enterprises-enterprises and crafts. </seg>
<seg id=713> We are currently improving our advice structure so as to be able to remain in constant contact with these contributors. </seg>
<seg id=714> Obviously cooperation with third countries may help eradicate the causes of waves of refugees and migrants but this does not mean that endeavours in this direction release the Union from its international obligation to protect those in need or to provide help to combat the causes of migration. </seg>
<seg id=715> Finally, I should like to state that I support the preparatory work to conclude a stability and partnership agreement between the Union and Albania. </seg>
<seg id=716> On the other hand, positive efforts are being made to drive forward the democratisation process and to develop society, which we must and will support. </seg>
<seg id=717> It would, therefore, be valuable for the programme that we have before us, and which I feel Mrs Karamanou covers very well in her report, to be subdivided into measures that can be implemented swiftly, medium-term measures and those regarding a legacy of history that we have been combating for 500 years and which will persist for centuries to come. </seg>
<seg id=718> Our forefathers went to the United States to create a life in freedom, as they believed. </seg>
<seg id=719> There is also the threat that they will be picked up again by the traffickers and returned to the countries of destination. </seg>
<seg id=720> I think that we need to turn our attention to two - of many - basic issues. </seg>
<seg id=721> This is an ill-advised policy. </seg>
<seg id=722> It will be a long but necessary process to bring about reconciliation between the national groups. </seg>
<seg id=723> I welcome the fact that the report at last takes into account and develops two points to which we Italians attach great importance. </seg>
<seg id=724> Precisely in the case of Albania we see that it can affect any Member State. </seg>
<seg id=725> The Commission is playing an active part in compiling the report. </seg>
<seg id=726> You will remember the provisions recently presented to us on climbing ladders. </seg>
<seg id=727> Mr President, may I first, on behalf of my group, congratulate the rapporteur very warmly on his report, which certainly gives a very good, consistent and comprehensive picture of the situation as he sees it. </seg>
<seg id=728> All too often, however, we are forced to conclude that this European legislation is packaged in a language which is too technical, too legal and too complex, so much so that this European legislation becomes unusable, as a result of which the intended goal, namely to make legislation in the European Union transparent and unambiguous, is not achieved. </seg>
<seg id=729> For 2000 years or more people have been safely drinking the water from the burns (the little rivers), and now they are prohibited from doing so. </seg>
<seg id=730> A text like that needs revision when it no longer responds to its initial objective and has become out of date and inappropriate, otherwise it will be a source of disputes as harmful as they are unpopular. </seg>
<seg id=731> I should like to recall that in the seventeenth century a great Dutch lawyer, Hugo Groot, better known as Grotius, one of the founders of international law, warned theologians to stay out of legal matters with that famous phrase, 'Silete, theologi, in munere alieno.' </seg>
<seg id=732> Mr President, the truth is that with this report and a few opinions something has occurred that reveals how complicated it can be to legislate or even just deal with reports in this Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=733> Nevertheless I believe we have to insist that as it is in the Treaty it is a principle that can stand before the Court of Justice. </seg>
<seg id=734> This must be respected and taken into consideration by EU legislators. </seg>
<seg id=735> I hope that this report, which we Commissioners were given last year, will in future include subsidiarity, better regulation and assessment of alternatives, while respecting the legislative authority of the Council and Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=736> Since 1 January 1999, exchange rates have been irrevocably fixed. </seg>
<seg id=737> For the people living in our countries, the borders are simply maintained, even if the countries pass many of their powers to the European Union, and national banks merge across the borders. </seg>
<seg id=738> This is therefore doubly serious. </seg>
<seg id=739> I repeat, it would be a pity to dash so much hope for the future and so many possibilities for mutual understanding. </seg>
<seg id=740> The Commission is optimistic that it will be possible to establish a balanced partnership with Morocco. </seg>
<seg id=741> I think we banged our fists on enough tables last year and should proceed with caution. </seg>
<seg id=742> The Commission sent signals, not to the negotiators of the neighbouring country, but to European fishermen: too many cephalopod trawlers, a fleet with excess capacity, mixed enterprises, the need to negotiate by segments of the fleet, a ban on mentioning other types of trade and, of course, silence. </seg>
<seg id=743> The negotiations concerning a new agreement between the EU and Morocco have made slow progress. </seg>
<seg id=744> I find it odd that boats fishing in terms of the EU' s quota are able to land their catches in an occupied country. </seg>
<seg id=745> Champions of generosity and of the third world, they are discovering what Chairman Mao called 'the difference between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions' . </seg>
<seg id=746> At least, that is what we can hope for at the moment, and from this alone we can be confident that fisheries relations with Morocco will be re-established as soon as possible and in the best possible conditions for both parties, because a fisheries scenario for southern Europe is unthinkable without satisfactory relations between both sides of the Mediterranean, while the needless sacrificing of a fleet that has contributed so much to the development of fishing in Morocco is unthinkable too. </seg>
<seg id=747> I believe that this fact should be noted and made clear and doubts raised as to whether the Commission is capable of negotiating international agreements, especially having heard President Prodi request an international remit for the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=748> However, after a wasted year, and at a time when we are trying to put budgetary appropriations that were earmarked for the agreement under other headings, I must also express my deep suspicion about the Commission's commitment to protecting the legitimate interests of the shipowners and fishermen affected, and state my scepticism about the real will of the Union and of many Member States, amongst them Spain, to negotiate the agreement in the "general field of political and economic relations between Morocco and the European Union" as we propose in the resolution. </seg>
<seg id=749> It should also be pointed out at this juncture that the fishing agreement with Morocco is part of a broader partnership and cooperation framework under which the European Union also grants Morocco considerable trade concessions and considerable support for its development. </seg>
<seg id=750> The Union must prepare a programme for conversion of activities carried out by the operators affected, in order to give them a stable future. </seg>
<seg id=751> Mr President, a Czech bishop, Bishop Koukl, to whom I am very close, has a rather nice saying: "Loving thy neighbour would be so simple if only one' s neighbour were not right on one' s doorstep" . </seg>
<seg id=752> However, I should like expressly to criticise the anti-Moroccan undertones that have also been heard in this debate because they do nothing to help neighbourly relations and because they do nothing to help the fisheries agreement. </seg>
<seg id=753> As regards the appropriate measures to be taken if the agreement does not succeed, the Commission is bearing these in mind but, as you well understand, we think and we hope that it will be possible for the negotiations to move forward on Monday in a more decisive way. </seg>
<seg id=754> Mr Wieland has five minutes' speaking time on behalf of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi. </seg>
<seg id=755> I consider this action to be dubious. </seg>
<seg id=756> It is our view that freedom of movement enables European citizens not to be the victims of discrimination under national systems of law. </seg>
<seg id=757> Otherwise, this problem, which is political, not legal in nature, will arise again and could occur in other States of the European Union where laws governing university career paths and education are different from elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id=758> We have to ask why. </seg>
<seg id=759> That is a critical point because the Ombudsman said that the Commission acted wrongly in failing to communicate with the language lettori the fact that they were changing pleadings on an important and significant article, and the article on which the Commission changed its pleadings is the very point that Commissioner Busquin mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=760> Governments must understand that if they sign treaties then they must either abrogate them as sovereign states or abide by their terms in a rule of law. </seg>
<seg id=761> The diversity of cultures, which we see as a fundamental element of Europe, finds expression first and foremost in the diversity of languages. </seg>
<seg id=762> The Commission did its job in bringing the infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice and the Italian State changed the law. </seg>
<seg id=763> In my country, for secondary school teachers we have very strict and very hard recruitment competitions. </seg>
<seg id=764> I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 27 October 2000. </seg>
<seg id=765> The burning inferno on the funicular railway - a railway which was considered to be one of the safest - which leads to one of the most beautiful areas of the Austrian Alps, makes everything else fade into the background, and the readiness to share pain and grief becomes our only comfort. </seg>
<seg id=766> Since we were not given sufficient notice, it would make more sense to wait for the legislative proposals and only then have Parliament deal with this point so that we do justice to the problem. </seg>
<seg id=767> In order to group together the interventions by the President-in-Office of the Council, who has an extremely busy schedule, I propose that the statement by the Commission be inserted at the end of the joint debate on aid for reconstruction. </seg>
<seg id=768> If the European People' s Party is proposing that at the next part-session we should support having this question taken up, we may consider it; if it is just a delaying tactic, we will be against it. </seg>
<seg id=769> I would appreciate it if points of order really were points of order, and I would be grateful if you could begin by indicating, as, moreover, is stipulated in the Rules of Procedure, the rule on which each point of order is based. </seg>
<seg id=770> It is also contrary to Directive 99/62/EC which provides, and I quote, "that tolls and user charges may not discriminate directly or indirectly on the grounds of the nationality of the haulier, nor the origin or destination of the vehicle" . </seg>
<seg id=771> Mutual assistance in criminal matters </seg>
<seg id=772> The Republic of Portugal presented a draft Protocol amending Article 2 of the Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office, Europol. </seg>
<seg id=773> This contradiction conflicts with democratic values, particularly in regard to human rights, and especially in the field of data protection. </seg>
<seg id=774> By virtue of Article 2 of the draft Convention, the Member States can no longer decline to conduct searches or seize items by invoking the reservations set out in Article 5 of the Convention of 1959. </seg>
<seg id=775> I am therefore very grateful for the compromise formulation in the Roure report which was drafted here in committee, which has simply made it clear that this traditional protection of fundamental rights must continue to be guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id=776> We agree that there is an express and urgent need for effective judicial cooperation, but, at the same time, denounce a shift that contains the seeds of a Europol set up outside the control of Parliament or of any legal authority, and, in more general terms, a democratic deficit in a Europe that the Member States insist in confining to the misty realms of intergovernmental procedures, thus skirting the obligations, duties and control that derive from universal suffrage. </seg>
<seg id=777> Political unification, political control may be what we need to resolve these questions and, by extension, the reviews and harmonisation of the laws governing these issues. </seg>
<seg id=778> That is the main focus of the cross-party amendments which the Committee is putting forward. </seg>
<seg id=779> I should very much like to hear the Commissioner' s reaction to the idea that when we hopefully get the concept of enhanced cooperation accepted at the Nice Summit next month that we create a European FBI. </seg>
<seg id=780> However, this raises two important questions. </seg>
<seg id=781> At some moment, we will have to compile all these texts because, Mr President, you and, doubtless, all of us here know that for this to be implemented by judges - who are the ones that have to implement it while guaranteeing the right to a fair trial - with this scattered system we are, of course, very poorly guided. </seg>
<seg id=782> All of this illegally acquired money is, however, laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy. </seg>
<seg id=783> To this end, the Marinho report proposes that a guarantee should be given that specific measures will be adopted to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds from crime, requiring a joint mobilisation of police and judicial resources in order to ensure that criminals or the proceeds from crime can find no hiding place in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=784> The Bar Association has final and binding authority on issues of professional confidentiality and it falls to that body to decide whether or not to authorise - in exceptional cases - the disclosure of information at the request of the courts. </seg>
<seg id=785> The Karamanou report, on which I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur, proposes various amendments with regard to improving the democratic and judicial control of Europol. </seg>
<seg id=786> The perpetrators are ruthless and know nothing of borders, restrictions or rules. </seg>
<seg id=787> If the Council, the Commission and Parliament act in unison, the end result will be considerable added value in terms of law and security for the people of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=788> Well, as you know, the issue of competence and the limits on this competence are central to this Community harmonisation aimed at improving the justice system. </seg>
<seg id=789> I omit the word 'freedom' in consideration of the attitude of the Council and the Member States - I repeat, of the Council and the Member States - in strengthening Europe' s repressive framework, aided and abetted by Parliament which, lacking the due dignity of an institution elected by the citizens, is willing to endorse these proposals. </seg>
<seg id=790> For both these reasons, my own group cannot be expected to cooperate. </seg>
<seg id=791> I would congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on a good piece of work. </seg>
<seg id=792> It has to be said that either we subscribe to the democratic model with which we are familiar, one based on the division of powers, and one which recognises that the courts have supreme authority when it comes to guaranteeing individual rights, and we acknowledge that European judicial cooperation in criminal matters consists precisely of reinforcing coordination between European courts in their capacity of protectors of fundamental rights - and this is the model to which I personally subscribe - or we can choose not to subscribe to this model and, in that case, I fail to understand how one can see this initiative for developing a common judicial area as posing any threat to guarantees on fundamental rights. </seg>
<seg id=793> That means that investigations and criminal proceedings that can count on the involvement of Europol must be flanked and followed up by Eurojust, acting as a network of judges and public prosecutors at European level. </seg>
<seg id=794> I mentioned that the FAIR Programme investigated in the Court of Auditors' special report was unfinished business from the past. </seg>
<seg id=795> In addition, there were mistakes in the certified expenditure and insufficient sanctions, as well as links between experts and some of the organisations involved in the research proposals which, in my view, need to be queried. </seg>
<seg id=796> It is too long a delay and undermines the relevance of Parliament' s work in considering such reports. </seg>
<seg id=797> With the help of the scientific research which is, of course, an important part of our policies - in this case, fisheries policy - a prior assessment needs to be carried out of what is wanted and of how the resources are used, so that existing resources can continually be adapted to catch techniques and catch opportunities. </seg>
<seg id=798> It had come to an end by the time I took up my duties as Commissioner, but it is the responsibility of the present Commission, and my responsibility as Commissioner, to ensure that the lessons learned from your work are turned to good account and to respond to the Court of Auditors' recommendations on this issue. </seg>
<seg id=799> With regard to the annual monitoring of research programmes, which provides an independent opinion on the stage reached in, and the quality of, the implementation of our programmes, we have developed several measures aimed at improvement: an analysis of research management practices within the context of national and European Union programmes, with a view to exchanges of good practices and the promotion of mutual learning; the financing of studies aimed at assessing the socio-economic impact of the framework programme and the launching of pilot schemes aimed at evaluating the impact of completed projects, as you have, moreover, just emphasised in speaking of the need to gauge this impact. </seg>
<seg id=800> I can tell you, in this respect, that the Commission' s services have done everything within their power to recover the amounts in question, but the services responsible embarked on the appropriate legal procedures two years ago. </seg>
<seg id=801> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. </seg>
<seg id=802> Charter of Fundamental Rights </seg>
<seg id=803> I think that is reason enough for us to adopt this Charter, even though there are points at which it may be hard to accept that many rights, many basic rights which Parliament demanded for the people of Europe, and with good cause, have been left out of the Charter. </seg>
<seg id=804> For all that, however, today' s debate, in my opinion, is a far cry from being needless repetition. </seg>
<seg id=805> The Charter is primarily - and this is rare enough to be worthy of note, as I have seen particularly in the preparations for the IGC - a clear and well-organised document. </seg>
<seg id=806> These are criticisms put forward in a recently launched appeal from some Members of Parliament, especially Members of the European Parliament, calling for the Charter to be revised. </seg>
<seg id=807> The balance arrived at by the authors has met with general approval, and the Presidency has no desire to reopen the debate, no more than, I believe, your rapporteurs do. </seg>
<seg id=808> Allow me at this point to offer my warmest thanks and acknowledgement to those who represented us at the convention under the leadership of our fellow member, Mr Méndez de Vigo. </seg>
<seg id=809> In saying yes, we are instructing you, Madam President, to proclaim the Charter with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission at the EU summit in Nice in a few weeks' time. </seg>
<seg id=810> After Nice we will be able to start talking about the European constitution. </seg>
<seg id=811> Transparency was no substitute, however, for the democratic deficit, as the NGOs were only given five minutes to speak and their points were only rarely taken into consideration. </seg>
<seg id=812> It is not just our rights and our freedoms but our democracy which is at stake here. </seg>
<seg id=813> In fact, if it were possible to amend the Charter, if it were admitted that the Charter does not provide for duties and does not provide fully for rights, things would be easier: the Charter does not go far enough in protecting the natural family or safeguarding children; it disregards the need for rules to regulate every new global information technology; it discriminates between private and public education; with regard to safeguarding the environment, it disregards the protection of health and animal rights; it is too general with regard to consumer protection and leaves the door open to the marketing of extremely harmful foodstuffs. </seg>
<seg id=814> Whether we vote for this Charter, against it, or abstain altogether, nothing will change. </seg>
<seg id=815> Many new rights for children, the elderly and the disabled are mentioned, together - and I find this most interesting - with a new freedom to conduct a business which is almost tantamount to a sort of ban on socialism. </seg>
<seg id=816> Some say it was a balanced mandate, others that it was inadequate, but it was a mandate whose dynamic force we used to the full, and even almost exceeded. </seg>
<seg id=817> Access to a more open administration is one of the most practical improvements the Charter can offer our EU citizens. </seg>
<seg id=818> Perhaps the best we can do for the time being is get it mentioned in Article 6 but that will only be for starters. </seg>
<seg id=819> Finally, in spite of the innovative approach of the Convention method, which I have mentioned, things must be stated openly. </seg>
<seg id=820> I therefore think, and I am addressing my remarks to the Council Presidency in particular at this point, that if the governments meeting in Nice adopt the Charter as a political declaration, they should preface it with some introductory note to the effect that defining and developing citizens' rights lies, in all instances, within the exclusive remit of the national parliaments. </seg>
<seg id=821> Apart from the substantive problems already raised today, merely having national parliamentarians on board is no substitute for an in-depth debate of constitutional questions by the national parliaments. </seg>
<seg id=822> Mr President, allow me to say a few words on the effects of the Charter. </seg>
<seg id=823> Firstly, to say to the citizens: Europe is not simply something that happens to you, it is a community that gives you rights, that gives you guarantees, that gives you protection in certain circumstances. </seg>
<seg id=824> The divide between those who have much and those who have little or nothing is growing ever wider, while, precisely in the name of these sacred principles, those who have much are exacting increasing sacrifices from those who have little or nothing. </seg>
<seg id=825> In fact the bulk of the people in the United Kingdom are wholly opposed to further integration. </seg>
<seg id=826> I believe the court should particularly allow itself to be influenced by those paragraphs concerning freedom of trade, entrepreneurship and copyright. </seg>
<seg id=827> What, for me, was the deciding factor was an appeal from Europe' s fastest growing progressive democratic movement, the French Attaque, which characterises the Charter as an instrument de régression sociale or tool of social regression. </seg>
<seg id=828> It articulates to good effect the right to human dignity and integrity of the person. </seg>
<seg id=829> As you know, the social and economic fundamental rights are particularly dear to my heart. </seg>
<seg id=830> The European institutions have power and, for the sake of our citizens, we must set limits on this power. </seg>
<seg id=831> The European public would not understand if Europe were to move faster in making improvements to the market and the currency but more slowly in effectively establishing its rights of citizenship and its basic rights. </seg>
<seg id=832> I want to highlight a couple of important points. </seg>
<seg id=833> There is yet another effect it will have, and this is on our own working methods. </seg>
<seg id=834> We already see the effects of judicial activism in Britain taking powers from our national parliament. </seg>
<seg id=835> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could not possibly improve upon Antonio Vitorino' s speech, so I shall briefly speak to stress the quality of the debate in this House, which has no parallel except for the debate held within the Convention, and I should like to congratulate those Members of the European Parliament who participated in it, especially Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mrs Pervenche Berès. </seg>
<seg id=836> I think the criticism that the citizens of Europe were not sufficiently involved in the process to be unfair in part. </seg>
<seg id=837> The point I wanted to make in mentioning all this is that Nice is a vital stage. </seg>
<seg id=838> Lengthy debates will be needed, both in the European Parliament and in the national parliaments, and that is why it is generally accepted that the road will be long and difficult. </seg>
<seg id=839> There has been a huge temptation to impose conditions on loans to Turkey, with reference to issues of democracy, but there has been no opportunity, technically speaking, to do so in this report. </seg>
<seg id=840> I have taken note of your wish, as expressed most clearly by Mr Morillon, to be fully involved in the destiny of Euro-Turkish relations. </seg>
<seg id=841> Major prospects are opening up to us, and we know the task will be long and complex. </seg>
<seg id=842> I repeat: accession negotiations are out of the question until we are sure that the political conditions have been met; which is not the case at present. </seg>
<seg id=843> What all this means is that we still have a great deal of work to do. </seg>
<seg id=844> Here we are talking about establishing a special programme to consolidate the Customs Union, extending the mandate of the European Investment Bank so that it can cover new loans to Turkey in the 2000-2004 period amounting to EUR 450 million. </seg>
<seg id=845> On the other hand, a number of mayors have been arrested and the Hadep party have trouble in Kurdish areas in the south-east. </seg>
<seg id=846> Such a self-appraisal will amount to a veritable cultural revolution. </seg>
<seg id=847> There is another matter, and if we have to vote on it today, the majority of my Group will vote in favour of this resolution. </seg>
<seg id=848> The fact that the strategic aspects of the prospects of European integration have been addressed neither by the governments nor, Commissioner, by the Commission, and have not been discussed with Parliament in connection either with Turkey's candidate status or with current enlargement to the east is, in my view, unacceptable given the implications. </seg>
<seg id=849> Lastly I do not feel that questions have been asked concerning the size of the actual population represented by Turkey' s candidacy and the difficulties that this will cause, not only in terms of the Union' s geography but especially in terms of the already delicate balance between large, medium-sized and small Member States. </seg>
<seg id=850> Mr President, with your permission I would like to briefly take up three fundamental points in Mr Morillon' s report: the political influence exerted by the Turkish army, the Kurdish question and the aspect referred to earlier of 'tolerance for other religions and cultures' . </seg>
<seg id=851> VOTE </seg>
<seg id=852> Madam President, I feel it my duty to stress that we are being called upon to regulate, through the Paciotti report and other directives and regulations which will be tabled before us, a great power: the power of information technology. </seg>
<seg id=853> On the EU level, the threat of possible abuse of personal data is being countered by two directives, namely Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Directive 97/66/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. </seg>
<seg id=854> We had no choice but to take them or leave them. </seg>
<seg id=855> However, for most countries and in comparison with international provisions already in force, it represents a step backwards. </seg>
<seg id=856> Its inclusion in the Charter, like the inclusion of many other similar articles, casts doubt on the accuracy of Article 51(2), which states, "This Charter does not establish any new power or task for the Community or the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=857> At the same time, the Charter is far too reticent on the existence of national communities and their right to frame their own regulations. </seg>
<seg id=858> Since the ECJ, on the basis of the far more restricted text of the existing European treaties, has already displayed a worrying tendency towards judicial activism, this problem is likely to be especially acute. </seg>
<seg id=859> The Charter of Fundamental Rights is a document and a Charter shared by all the citizens of Europe! </seg>
<seg id=860> Europeans do have the 'right to work' (it would have been surprising if they did not); they have the right to take "collective action" to defend their social interests, "including strike action" . </seg>
<seg id=861> The citizens of Europe have scant need of a formal declaration on the fundamental rights they are entitled to because these are recognised elsewhere in international conventions and in national law. </seg>
<seg id=862> For all the above reasons, this Charter must not be incorporated into the Treaties of the European Union, and we cannot accept the text as it is currently worded. </seg>
<seg id=863> Secondly, the right to work is not directly stated. </seg>
<seg id=864> That makes including fundamental social rights even more important. </seg>
<seg id=865> In future, will its clauses have a merely symbolic value or will they become binding for Community institutions and, consequently, for the European public? </seg>
<seg id=866> . (FR) I voted, most decidedly, against the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights before us. </seg>
<seg id=867> Ultimately there is nothing European about the text of the Charter. </seg>
<seg id=868> We supported these initiatives in general, except where the European Parliament amendments were tending to introduce too much of a federalist bias. </seg>
<seg id=869> - (DA) Even if we support the fight against money laundering and can therefore also endorse the need to equip the relevant authorities with the right tools for the job, we cannot vote in favour of Mr Marinho' s report. </seg>
<seg id=870> - (NL) There is often a fine line between business activities and white-collar crime. </seg>
<seg id=871> We are looking to extend the remit of Europol - the European Police Cooperation Unit - to cover serious international crime. </seg>
<seg id=872> Roure Report (A5-0314/2000) </seg>
<seg id=873> In addition, the idea is that, on request, Member States should furnish details of all bank accounts held by suspects. </seg>
<seg id=874> I regret to say that it informs us that some of the members of the committees responsible for allocating the European funds for research in the sectors of hunting and fisheries also benefited from this research. </seg>
<seg id=875> All these factors go to show that Turkey' s application for membership of the EU is one of the most important issues for the EU' s future. </seg>
<seg id=876> The immediate Budget problem is that there is a danger of there being no margin left in the guarantee fund reserve. </seg>
<seg id=877> Something along these lines might have been more helpful, including for Turkey, because it would have sent a more accurate message to the forces in Turkey which really do intend to modernise the country and it would have supported their efforts to put conditions in place which guarantee its European prospects, giving them serious arguments with which to convince the many sceptics that those prospects are, in fact, well-founded. </seg>
<seg id=878> Muslims follow one of the three Abrahaminic faiths. </seg>
<seg id=879> The EU' s four freedoms cannot be applied to the whole of Cyprus following the partition. </seg>
<seg id=880> I agree with that entirely and I think that the report by the honourable Member shows how this can be achieved. </seg>
<seg id=881> Commission Verheugen has confirmed that the Cyprus issue plays a very important part in the discussions currently being conducted with Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=882> In other words, we are talking about increasing the degree to which Turkey is subject to the economic, political and military objectives of big business in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=883> I therefore think we must encourage the Turkish authorities to forge ahead in order to achieve the necessary compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria. </seg>
<seg id=884> Allow me to correct the erroneous impression, which one or two speakers are clearly under, that it is already a fact of life. </seg>
<seg id=885> The author of the questions - Mr Brok - would normally take the floor first, but he is in a meeting with the President and is on his way. </seg>
<seg id=886> In this respect, I believe that the 27 partners are resolved to adopt this text as soon as circumstances permit. </seg>
<seg id=887> In Marseilles, therefore, this new impetus we wish to give the process must be based on all its political and economic components which are, let me reiterate, complementary and inextricably interlinked. </seg>
<seg id=888> This is a major challenge for the Europe of the future, whose centre of gravity will, indeed, be shifting towards the East of the continent, but this need not happen at the expense of relations with the South. </seg>
<seg id=889> The current situation in the Middle East is making abundantly clear what measures are needed in the form of joint policies and cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=890> The Commission has been encouraged by the generally positive reaction to the proposals that we set out on reinvigorating the Barcelona process, both in the European Union and among the Mediterranean partners. </seg>
<seg id=891> I just want to say one more thing about MEDA and the reform of our external aid which is relevant to debates which Members are having elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id=892> The first concerned the preference shown for free trade, which is linked to the process of economic and commercial liberalisation in terms of codevelopment, economic integration, social policies, cultural dialogue and the training and enhancement of human resources. </seg>
<seg id=893> As Commissioner Patten indicated, it is clear that the lack of consolidated peace in the Middle East is distorting the whole process that was outlined at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference and, in particular, the appropriate and correct application of the MEDA funds. </seg>
<seg id=894> I strenuously urge all my fellow Members to set aside the appropriations needed for us to be able to take action and to be able to consider the projects. </seg>
<seg id=895> The Marseilles Conference could have been used to this end. The failure - or, at least, the relative failure - of the Charter for Peace and Stability proves that it is not possible to achieve Europe' s "security" on the basis of marginalising the South and closing borders. </seg>
<seg id=896> We can hypothesise as to whether a decisive, uniform EU policy in the Balkans might have prevented the Balkan war and the European Union might therefore have avoided the consequential costs of the war. </seg>
<seg id=897> It is continuity over time that can provide results, and positive results will be ultimately measured by the development of the countries of the southern Mediterranean. </seg>
<seg id=898> The Commission and the Council need to urgently undertake what was agreed in Feira and they need to make a common policy for the development of the Mediterranean region viable. </seg>
<seg id=899> This is one of the major issues of the French Presidency. </seg>
<seg id=900> Also, we cannot demand that European citizens properly implement their environmental policy and not apply this to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=901> I happened to be at a conference in Zagreb last week, when once again it became evident how important it is not to teach future generations of mini Balkans citizens - as it were - old stereotypes, or inculcate them with notions of 'the enemy' , and instead, to made a fresh start in this respect. </seg>
<seg id=902> I have drawn such positive conclusions from my various visits to the agency because as I see it, despite all - and I repeat, all - the mistakes that are made there, there can be no doubt that they have found a new and effective way to deliver aid. </seg>
<seg id=903> In doing this, of course, we are staking our credibility and our own stability. </seg>
<seg id=904> Mr President, I feel that the content of this important measure has been clearly and very well explained by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza. </seg>
<seg id=905> As we have seen in Bosnia time and again, the Americans manage to show themselves to good advantage with very limited funds. </seg>
<seg id=906> Mr Swoboda will say a little more, on behalf of my group, about what I would like to call 'efforts to reconstruct the EU' , which is also the subject of the reports under discussion today, courtesy of Mr Lagendijk and Mr Westendorp, to whom I offer my compliments. </seg>
<seg id=907> We must concentrate our energies in the physical reconstruction of former Yugoslavia, but this will only work if we manage to alter the people' s frame of mind too. </seg>
<seg id=908> I should like to speak in more detail about the priorities set by the Presidency-in-Office for the Western Balkans. </seg>
<seg id=909> The Presidency-in-Office, like you, would like this framework programme to implement the principles of the reform of the management of external aid: fewer procedures, greater coordination out in the field, fewer outstanding commitments. </seg>
<seg id=910> The European Union must not be afraid to say to these countries: yes, your place, your future is within the European family. </seg>
<seg id=911> Subject: Rapid Reaction Facility Why has this proposal not been discussed formally under the French Council Presidency, although work had certainly begun on this issue under its predecessors? </seg>
<seg id=912> Subject: Western Sahara On 13-15 September a delegation from the European Parliament' s Intergroup on Peace for the Sahrawi People, in which I participated, visited the Sahrawi refugee camps in South-Eastern Algeria. </seg>
<seg id=913> Thank you for your reply. </seg>
<seg id=914> Question No 4 by (H-0820/00): </seg>
<seg id=915> The Union is therefore closely monitoring contacts between Armenia and Azerbaijan with a view to finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which is why it welcomes the meetings that have regularly taken place between the two Presidents and hopes that they will lead to a political solution. </seg>
<seg id=916> Question No 7 by (H-0832/00): </seg>
<seg id=917> Would the Council also - and this is where I agree with Mrs Frahm - encourage the Member States to differentiate more clearly between asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants? </seg>
<seg id=918> . (FR) Mrs Theorin has drawn the Council' s attention to the issue of crimes of honour in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=919> Question No 9 by (H-0839/00): </seg>
<seg id=920> This, moreover, has always been the case within the European Union, as the sanctions taken against Austria were done so on a bilateral basis, which is something I should like to stress. </seg>
<seg id=921> The European Union has certain values, which make it difficult for it to accept some countries taking on particular responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id=922> Subject: Council reply to letter from the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Cem In a supplementary question (Question Time of 5 September 2000 - Question H-610/00) I had the opportunity to ask the President-in-Office of the Council about the Council's response to the letter sent by the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Cem, to the 15 Foreign Ministers of the European Union in which he sought to promote his own interpretation of the Helsinki Summit conclusions. </seg>
<seg id=923> It is in this spirit that we must proceed, and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will do everything possible to reach the right agreement. </seg>
<seg id=924> In this regard, the calendar for negotiations that was recently set included one meeting per week, so we can be fairly optimistic that negotiations will be swiftly concluded. </seg>
<seg id=925> Anyway, allow me to say that Mr Fischler is neither Mediterranean nor is he from the Atlantic, and what is more we are unfortunate enough to have a Director-General for Fisheries who is from the north Atlantic and only learnt about fisheries problems when he was recently appointed to that post. </seg>
<seg id=926> These meetings seem to have revived the negotiation process and led to another meeting with a Moroccan delegation on 30 October 2000, therefore very recently. </seg>
<seg id=927> . (FR) Yes, I simply wanted to say that it is precisely because we are sensitive to this issue that a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of criminal decisions is possible. </seg>
<seg id=928> In this context, the Council attaches the greatest priority to pushing this work forward in the following areas: the promotion of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, the security of energy supplies and the diversification of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id=929> However, it must be regretfully pointed out that the US Government has not yet taken any action regarding its own commitments under the agreement concluded at the London Summit in May 1998. </seg>
<seg id=930> If you do not see the difference between that and any other position, then perhaps there is a degree of misunderstanding, possibly intentional. </seg>
<seg id=931> Fourthly and finally, does he not think that his reply is an encouragement to Turkey, a candidate country for membership of the European Union, to continue its present policy of contesting the sovereign rights of Greece, a member of the European Union and that he has therefore indirectly admitted that there are border disputes which must be resolved, as we have said, on the basis of international conventions? </seg>
<seg id=932> I therefore propose, that not only should we leave these people in peace to get on with their job with the gusto and enthusiasm which they have shown so far, not only should we refrain from upsetting the modus operandi of the agency, although we should, of course, make it responsible for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and anywhere else it is needed, but we should also ask them to pass their know-how on to other committees whose work, as we all know, is so abysmal, so inefficient and brings in such poor results. </seg>
<seg id=933> These are the objectives we need to achieve with the funds and instruments which we are now creating. </seg>
<seg id=934> Anyway, enough of the bad news, now to the good news. </seg>
<seg id=935> The vulnerable countries surrounding the remains of Yugoslavia have weathered the crisis, and, what is more, Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia have even made economic progress. </seg>
<seg id=936> He is at least one other human being with whom I can share the distinction of having read Misha Glenny on the Balkans. </seg>
<seg id=937> This programme is going to ratchet up every day from now on: a contract for imports of EUR 30 million in electricity was signed today with the Serbian Electricity Company and should come on-stream within days. </seg>
<seg id=938> As Mr Staes said: We do not want people throwing spanners in the works. </seg>
<seg id=939> I can accept, too, those amendments which refer to the General Affairs decision of 9 October, to cooperation with NGOs, to the restoration of civil society and the rule of law, to the payment for services provided by the Agency, to third parties, to the possibility of creating further operational centres, to the responsibility of the director for the implementation of the work programme and the structure of the Agency's budget. </seg>
<seg id=940> We outlined our goals for ASEM III in our working party, we discussed it with the European Parliament before the summit on two occasions in the ASEAN working party and in the plenary which resulted, I believe, in your resolution of 5 October, the aims of which we not only took into account, but also managed to achieve in most cases. </seg>
<seg id=941> Human rights and the rule of law are embedded in the process; there was a clear understanding of the need for the early start of a broad-based WTO round but I am not sure that has been entirely reflected so far at the discussions at the APEC meetings in Brunei. </seg>
<seg id=942> You are quite right that the Asian Summit was somewhat dominated, in the positive sense, by developments in both North and South Korea, with the result that more time was spent evaluating and qualifying the rapprochement on the Korean peninsular than on a real in-depth discussion of the Asia process. </seg>
<seg id=943> We could have done so much more in terms of financial stability, trade and investments, and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id=944> In future the Commission must not confine itself to being a mere figurehead: it must unequivocally and specifically take up all aspects of the Community's participation in these regional organisations, representing it, monitoring the transmission and verification of data, participating in scientific fora, and in general guiding Community action, including monitoring the fishing carried out in the context of these organisations. </seg>
<seg id=945> I have been an observer in some regional organisations and I can assure you that it is pathetic to see two or three mid-ranking officials, exhausted and hardly getting any sleep, trying to react to problems that could be seen coming months earlier and facing high-powered delegations, which are high-powered either because they are from great powers like the United States or Japan or because they have followed an intelligent policy of forming alliances in advance. </seg>
<seg id=946> The fisheries management scheme would involve all interest groups in a particular region. </seg>
<seg id=947> They carry out statistical programmes and are responsible for inspections and the monitoring system. </seg>
<seg id=948> To some extent, those of us who are politicians find ourselves in the middle. </seg>
<seg id=949> It is in fact the Member States - in keeping with the basic structure of the European Union - which are primarily responsible for controls. </seg>
<seg id=950> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=951> Ladies and gentlemen, under these conditions, the problem concerns less the future of production than the future of producers. </seg>
<seg id=952> Mr President, the Commission proposal recognises that the pigmeat market in the European Union is subject to cyclical movements, with periods of balanced supply and satisfactory prices followed by periods of plentiful supply when prices plummet. </seg>
<seg id=953> Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Garot for his report, even if I do not agree with its content. </seg>
<seg id=954> If we were to apply the co-financing estimated here, i.e. 50%, to the other organisations of the market, for example in sugar, where the PPE is vehemently opposed to any change, that would instantly free up huge resources. </seg>
<seg id=955> Nor does this report offer any ready solutions; too much else needs to be done for that. </seg>
<seg id=956> Efforts cannot be made by producers alone. </seg>
<seg id=957> I would like to point out, however, that at this stage we should not be embarking on a regulated economy in the pig industry. </seg>
<seg id=958> While the policy is good, and while I pay tribute to it, we have to go back to the drawing board. </seg>
<seg id=959> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I should like to thank you, Mr Garot, as rapporteur, for your excellent report on the introduction of a compensation fund in the common organisation or the market in pigmeat. </seg>
<seg id=960> Plus, the weight of piglets various enormously, from 8 to 30 kg, and there is, as it were, no uniform price quotation system for standard piglets, meaning that there is no basis on which to support them. </seg>
<seg id=961> Perhaps you could explain. </seg>
<seg id=962> In each of the chapters the Court reports on the progress made in a number of areas on which it had reported in the past and I will return to some of these issues in my presentation. </seg>
<seg id=963> They mainly comprise non-compliance with eligibility rules, overclaims, insufficient justification and calculation errors. </seg>
<seg id=964> On the other hand, the Commission will be aware that it has now raised high expectations and that it is obliged to put into practice its good intentions and to produce results. </seg>
<seg id=965> The Court of Auditors also makes it clear in its report that the errors identified by the Court do not amount to fraud, nor are they detrimental to the budget. </seg>
<seg id=966> But we are now coming to a difficult stretch, where we need the support of the European Parliament, the Council and also the Court of Auditors. </seg>
<seg id=967> But if there is no closure, that means that no discharge can be given for budgetary management, just as we said back in January. </seg>
<seg id=968> However, I should like to know how serious the situation is regarding the 1999 accounts. </seg>
<seg id=969> Some unpalatable facts will emerge of course but, at the same time, we are demonstrating that transparency exists. </seg>
<seg id=970> They could perhaps be given a push in the right direction, if need be. </seg>
<seg id=971> There is also indeed a need for action in the regional and national parliaments, because it is the Member States themselves that are responsible for a great many errors. </seg>
<seg id=972> We in Parliament must also be vigilant in seeing that the Commission carries out this task. </seg>
<seg id=973> I especially appreciate the impartiality of his report, in which he points out the faults and praises the progress; for instance, he praises the fact that the Commission is getting moving. </seg>
<seg id=974> We must not forget that this report refers to the 1999 budget, the year when there was the forced resignation of the Commission, so it is clearly too early to judge yet. </seg>
<seg id=975> Without the facts we are fighting fraud with one hand tied behind our back. </seg>
<seg id=976> I think that if the Court leaves this much room for interpretation in its report, the result will always be critical headlines. </seg>
<seg id=977> I urge you, there really is some scope for improvement in the future - otherwise, your protestations that you want to adopt the right approach in tackling irregularities will merely be empty words. </seg>
<seg id=978> The report is positive about steps that have been taken by Parliament to remedy problems that have been identified by the Court, too positive in my view. </seg>
<seg id=979> We also still need to continue to question the implementing of fiscal harmonisation. </seg>
<seg id=980> In 1995, almost 40% of payments went to the top 3% of beneficiaries, whilst 57%, the smaller beneficiaries, received only 4.5% of payments. </seg>
<seg id=981> We will study that in detail, with your excellent secretaries. </seg>
<seg id=982> You are listening to a Member who, as rapporteur for the Committee on Development, was once responsible for naming not only two countries but two companies and where the Court of Auditors was taken to the Court of Justice because of that. </seg>
<seg id=983> I must comment, Mr Blak, on what you said. </seg>
<seg id=984> Mr President, unfortunately we cannot accept some amendments first tabled in the Committee on the Environment and now tabled here, which go against these principles. </seg>
<seg id=985> In light of recent experience, notably the European Court of Justice ruling on tobacco advertising, I can really only urge this House to heed the recommendations to plenary of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as the committee responsible for such matters. </seg>
<seg id=986> There are many countries that have their own regulations and safety standards which meet those countries' needs far better than standards currently in force in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=987> She may occasionally have found the eccentricities of British car boot sales hard to follow but that, too, came within the remit of her personal charity. </seg>
<seg id=988> The charity shops welcome the general protection of this directive. </seg>
<seg id=989> Two final remarks, the first of which relates specifically to a particular amendment concerning the Commission' s proposal that producers should inform the competent authorities immediately when they discover that a product is dangerous. </seg>
<seg id=990> We must give more consideration to this diversity in the directive on general product safety. </seg>
<seg id=991> Then, some years later, when I allowed my second daughter, who is six or seven years younger, to go out on her own, Elisabetta protested: "But Daddy, you never let me go out on my own and here you are, letting my sister out alone, and she is younger than I was! </seg>
<seg id=992> However, it would have been better to have an EU regulation providing for a general European system and eliminating the simultaneous existence of national regulations in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=993> First of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, the draftsmen, Mr Rübig and Mr Lehne, and the respective committees for their very comprehensive report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety. </seg>
<seg id=994> The notification is compulsory in the United States but not, so far, in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=995> Firstly, Amendments Nos 1, 8 and 18 propose to exempt second-hand goods sold by charity shops and non-profit organisations, private persons, flea markets and car boot sales, as Mr Whitehead has said, from the obligation to provide information and documentation on product risk and product origin. </seg>
<seg id=996> Amendments Nos 6 and 29 require the Commission to consider approaches or submit a proposal relating to the safety of services in Amendment No 29 before a specified date. </seg>
<seg id=997> This would also run counter to the objective of encouraging business to take proactive measures on its own initiative. </seg>
<seg id=998> The discussions in Council go in the direction of dealing with the services within the definition of product which is, in fact, acceptable to us. </seg>
<seg id=999> In addition, effective market surveillance cannot be carried out under the proposed limitations regarding confidential information. </seg>
<seg id=1000> Mr President, I have been a socialist in Italy and in international organisations for 30 years. </seg>
<seg id=1001> (The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.25 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=1002> We have highly qualified people assisting us with our work. </seg>
<seg id=1003> (Parliament adopted the resolution) Explanations of vote </seg>
<seg id=1004> It is in consideration of this dual responsibility that I tabled amendments referring to the governments of the Euromed States. </seg>
<seg id=1005> Mr President, I voted for this report, which lays down the action to be taken by the European Community in order to bring about genuine gender equality. </seg>
<seg id=1006> We are against the social regression represented by the authorisation of night work for women. </seg>
<seg id=1007> I have some reservations as far as the content is concerned. </seg>
<seg id=1008> Mr President, there are several reasons why I voted against the González Álvarez report but, in order to keep within the minute allowed for this explanation of vote, I will mention only one. </seg>
<seg id=1009> This report welcomes an improvement in current European law on product safety, but in my view the directive should not be applied to charity shops, a key feature in the British high street. </seg>
<seg id=1010> The European Parliament has rallied to the call of its old friend and has just voted for amendments in its favour. </seg>
<seg id=1011> So we must give President Rugova and President Kostunica a chance to negotiate democratically with each other. </seg>
<seg id=1012> The proposal is unnecessary and harmful because it introduces a new form of aid for a sector which has so far acquitted itself well without aid. </seg>
<seg id=1013> With regard to the overriding issue of the Community' s contribution to the fund, I also wish to point out that the proposals in the Garot report are an improvement as compared with the Commission' s position, but we still disagree with the idea of linking this contribution to the principle of CAP cofinancing which was, in fact, rejected in Agenda 2000. </seg>
<seg id=1014> The Commission is right to try and find ways in which to secure the income of pig farmers. </seg>
<seg id=1015> Franz Werfel had Jewish and German-Bohemian relatives. </seg>
<seg id=1016> As far as human rights are concerned, however, the report confines itself to 'encouraging the Turkish Government' , 'calling' on it to do better, without European countries ever threatening it, even if only to stop delivering arms. </seg>
<seg id=1017> - (FR) It was at the European Council meeting in Helsinki in December 1999 that the European Union decided to grant Turkey the status of candidate country for accession to the European Union and to establish an accession partnership and a single financial framework with a view to helping Turkey's application to progress in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria. </seg>
<seg id=1018> She wants the penal law changed, as do we. </seg>
<seg id=1019> The necessary changes cannot be bought outside by the governing powers; they must come from within. </seg>
<seg id=1020> I remember the exact text of the conclusions of the Presidency in Paragraph 12: "Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to candidate countries" . </seg>
<seg id=1021> Consistency and honesty should be the hallmarks of our dealings with any applicant country. </seg>
<seg id=1022> We cannot accept any of these approaches. </seg>
<seg id=1023> It is therefore important that this mandate is defined clearly in terms of time and content and that it is strictly monitored by the Council. </seg>
<seg id=1024> Things did not go as swimmingly for Parliament' s amendments from first reading, as the Council rejected most of them. </seg>
<seg id=1025> Finally, I anticipate our being able to tighten up the waste incineration directive in a few years' time, in close consultation with industry. </seg>
<seg id=1026> We all know that it has been a long and very difficult process putting together the requirements for the incineration of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. </seg>
<seg id=1027> The end result is that we now have a reasonably balanced proposal for imposing strict limits regarding the incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, improving the environment and enabling waste to also be used in the production of electricity and heat. </seg>
<seg id=1028> Genuinely sustainable alternatives must be funded and promoted and far more must be invested in research and in developing waste prevention, re-use and recycling. </seg>
<seg id=1029> The end result can be considered good, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id=1030> I am convinced that the joint text strikes the right balance - a view reflected in your speeches yesterday - incorporating a high level of environmental protection along with the legitimate interests of all stake holders. </seg>
<seg id=1031> Providing guaranteed access for all European citizens to high-quality necessary medical treatment within reasonable time limits is a primary objective towards which the efforts and financing of obligatory and supplementary systems must converge. </seg>
<seg id=1032> Mr President, I should like to thank the Committee Chairman, Mr Rocard, for his words of praise in connection with my opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1033> We are talking subsidiarity. </seg>
<seg id=1034> That is scarcely what you would call a responsible social policy. </seg>
<seg id=1035> Supplementary health insurance must be just that: supplementary, for example, for those who are willing to pay for an extra service, or designed to cover the costs of more ordinary and frequently occurring illnesses for which actuarial calculations can reasonably be made. </seg>
<seg id=1036> I am rather ashamed to admit it, but I chose that solution. </seg>
<seg id=1037> Let us not add to this a two-speed Europe of health. </seg>
<seg id=1038> Leaving aside for the moment the question as to whether these changes were for the better, one thing is for sure: far too little attention was given to the effects of these changes on cross-border workers, retired Dutch nationals living abroad, and for example, Germans and Belgians working in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id=1039> That means that the present statutory health insurance system, which has, up to now, been based on the principle of social solidarity, will be reduced to an "à la carte" health system. </seg>
<seg id=1040> His report is a useful contribution to that debate, though I hope he agrees in turn that the contributions made in committee, including those made on this side of the House, may perhaps have made it even more useful. </seg>
<seg id=1041> It is, moreover, a fact that social systems - protection systems - have been suffering from the influences and consequences of economic, demographic and public health situations, etc. And it is also a fact that economic recession, unemployment, social exclusion, the appearance of new diseases, the ageing of the population, as well as advances in research, improved therapies, the development of new techniques of diagnosis and treatment have all had a profound effect on the levels of mandatory social and health cover. </seg>
<seg id=1042> And so I and my pensioner friends call upon Commissioner Diamantopoulou to put on a doctor's white coat, to treat the European Union's poorly medical service and to make us better. </seg>
<seg id=1043> The better the statutory system, the less need there will be for supplementary health insurance, and the less significant it will be. </seg>
<seg id=1044> The new proposal before us is for a Green Paper. </seg>
<seg id=1045> However, it is essential to draw up an in-depth report on the situation and we can do this as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id=1046> It is crucial for the Council to keep the promises it has given, not only with regard to the programme, but also with regard to setting appropriate objectives and goals, to be agreed on by the end of this year, so that it meets the expectations it created with the Lisbon Summit conclusions on its commitment to combat poverty, unemployment and social exclusion. </seg>
<seg id=1047> This is not just a subject for discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is also of concern to us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because these 65 million people are not only excluded from access to financial and other resources, because they are not only excluded from social and cultural rights, but because they are also prevented from using their talents to help shape our society and because they are prevented from developing their own talents, gaining additional qualifications and skills and working in jobs they are suited for. </seg>
<seg id=1048> As you will remember, the Stability and Growth Pact stipulates close, on-going supervision of the Member States' budgetary position during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union. </seg>
<seg id=1049> Secondly, we shall also try to assess to what extent budget cuts and tax cuts are consistent, according to a number of principles which may enable us to adopt a common position on this point. </seg>
<seg id=1050> Because of this factor and, more importantly, better budgetary positions and stronger economic growth, there will be a clear tendency for the proportions of national debt to fall over the coming years. </seg>
<seg id=1051> Today, taking the average for the euro area, it has dropped back to around 1%, and we are moving towards balanced budgets, that is to say very much in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id=1052> When I mentioned overheating, I was referring more to the economies of the Netherlands and Finland than to the German economy. </seg>
<seg id=1053> It also emphasises that national debt reductions, insofar as they can reduce future deficits, may help to resolve the situation. </seg>
<seg id=1054> It is important to take stock of the situation with regard to the fight against BSE in the broader context of food safety developments in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1055> That is why the efforts that have been made since 1997 in terms of research will be extended and broadened. </seg>
<seg id=1056> Only the dangerously complacent or naïve could assume that we have safely put the BSE crisis behind us. </seg>
<seg id=1057> The consumer reaction to BSE has been variously described as a psychosis, irrational or driven by panic. </seg>
<seg id=1058> Extensive testing now appears to be the most effective means of providing such reassurance. </seg>
<seg id=1059> Many inspections by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office point to weaknesses in the implementation of these controls. </seg>
<seg id=1060> This includes in my view the responsibility not to mislead them into believing that there are magic solutions to a very difficult problem. </seg>
<seg id=1061> This proposal aims at putting in place a Community framework which will address all relevant issues governing the treatment of animal waste, especially its use in animal feed. </seg>
<seg id=1062> That is also why I wish to say here that the Commission must have powers at such times of crisis to take more rapid decisions in relation to infringements of Community law or when there is an imminent risk of such infringement, and that it should be in a position to take action in the public interest or if public health is threatened. </seg>
<seg id=1063> If you are serious about all this, then you do not need a token Food Authority, which might prepare legislation on food safety, but which is not in a position to deliver what we can: good legislation and controls. </seg>
<seg id=1064> Every food producer must be aware of this fact. </seg>
<seg id=1065> The Commission proposal to eliminate animal matter which cannot be consumed by humans from animal feed must also be implemented. </seg>
<seg id=1066> The current crisis has led to a significant slump in sales and to a fall in prices, which are hurting livestock producers and all those involved in the beef sector. </seg>
<seg id=1067> The facts stand, and they are appalling. </seg>
<seg id=1068> This test can be developed on an industrial scale very quickly. </seg>
<seg id=1069> Unless there is mandatory general testing, confidence will not be restored, for confidence cannot be restored by decree; it has to be earned. </seg>
<seg id=1070> These are the real causes of the crisis, and it is only by tackling these causes that you will be able to permanently solve this appalling problem, which you helped to create. </seg>
<seg id=1071> If France is now in the situation in which it finds itself, it is because it practises controls which do not exist elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id=1072> Production must be improved, and the budget of the CAP must be used to reorganise this policy. </seg>
<seg id=1073> You played no part in it whatsoever. </seg>
<seg id=1074> We have talked enough about the procedural aspect and the ins and outs of the whole BSE issue. </seg>
<seg id=1075> Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Commissioner Byrne for his customary vigilance and also the French Minister for being here today. </seg>
<seg id=1076> Lastly, we must make greater speed in urging the Council to act on our behalf. </seg>
<seg id=1077> Now, the Community cannot cultivate more than 5.5 million hectares of oil seeds, nor does it have the right to do so, even though our needs are in the order of 18 million hectares. </seg>
<seg id=1078> Only then can we say to the public "This meat has been tested and you can eat it". </seg>
<seg id=1079> It is not acceptable if Germany, for example, does not introduce universal testing, but just tests in North Rhine-Westphalia, for fear of no longer having BSE-free status. </seg>
<seg id=1080> Madam President, I am totally convinced that the Union in its entirety lacks the political, moral and educational authority to talk about the quality and safety of food. </seg>
<seg id=1081> In the Netherlands, the legislation governing the use of offal in animal feed is already relatively stringent as matters stand. </seg>
<seg id=1082> Madam President, I speak today both as an MEP and a beef farmer from the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id=1083> It is very difficult for a feed mill to guarantee that its production lines are completely cleared of meat-and-bone meal before they start manufacturing feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry. </seg>
<seg id=1084> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have listened with great interest to everything that has been said. </seg>
<seg id=1085> Rest assured that, when it comes to continuing the work in the Council and my exchanges with the Commission, I will bear all this in mind, in the full knowledge that reaching agreement within the institutions is one of the best ways of dealing with a problem as complex and universal as that of food safety. </seg>
<seg id=1086> You are therefore saying that the legislation that is in place is in some way inadequate or not being complied with. </seg>
<seg id=1087> This is a consumer protection measure and also a measure to enhance consumer confidence. </seg>
<seg id=1088> Mr President, in my contribution to a secular miracle, I wish to say that, with regard to the harmonisation of asylum policy, the main measures that the Union will be adopting are defined not only in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, but are also part of the scoreboard that the Commission presented to the Council and to the European Parliament, and will develop in two basic stages. </seg>
<seg id=1089> The list of examples given in the question is the result of selective memory, which I feel is hardly appropriate in these cases. </seg>
<seg id=1090> The Commission approved a pan-European policy to combat trafficking in human beings back in 1996, with particular emphasis on the issue of women, who are the worst hit by this scourge. </seg>
<seg id=1091> This operation consists of everything included under economic policy coordination, which has two basic aims: first, that the economic policies of the various Member States should not be incongruent with each other, and secondly, that they should not be incongruent with monetary policy either, generating a situation that could result in an over-restrictive monetary policy. </seg>
<seg id=1092> First of all, it is a fact that we have an internal euro effect and an external euro effect. </seg>
<seg id=1093> During the procedure the Greek authorities made known that the directive had now been transposed. </seg>
<seg id=1094> There is the possibility of using Community funding for establishing networks and for measurements in Greece. </seg>
<seg id=1095> Questions Nos 30 to 59 will be replied to in writing . </seg>
<seg id=1096> Therefore, Commissioner, I ask for a special effort to be made to eradicate this child poverty. </seg>
<seg id=1097> Fourthly, by helping to define guidelines and national action plans along the same lines as the Luxembourg procedure on employment, based, therefore, on indicators and objectives which are not minimal but of a high level of requirement corresponding to the idea we have of the European social model. </seg>
<seg id=1098> It would be interesting to hear from the Council, at some point, whether they are proposing to rectify this omission at the Nice Summit. </seg>
<seg id=1099> All these groups are threatened by social exclusion if very extensive measures of support are not provided. </seg>
<seg id=1100> If we do not reform the labour and welfare markets, re-establishing them on the basis of individual freedom and responsibility rather than on State and trade union paternalism, then I am afraid that our committees and our efforts at coordination will do very little for the poor of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1101> Between 1980 and 1995 overall inequality rose in Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1102> Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a quite excellent report. </seg>
<seg id=1103> We must nevertheless issue a warning about the inadequacy of the NGOs' financial control mechanisms, and demand a better system of financial management equal to the task of ensuring that public funds are spent in a sensible and rigorous way. </seg>
<seg id=1104> After the Treaty of Amsterdam and some months after the Lisbon council, we all know that a new context has been created for Community action in the area of social policies and social exclusion and social protection. </seg>
<seg id=1105> You know there is a political and theoretical discussion on the word "poverty". </seg>
<seg id=1106> Close cooperation between the contact group and the Social Protection Committee will ensure the exchange of views between the Council and Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1107> This is therefore the first legislative procedure in the field of renewable energy. </seg>
<seg id=1108> In The Hague, the western industrialised nations are currently again being pilloried because they are only implementing those commitments half-heartedly. </seg>
<seg id=1109> I hope that tomorrow this House will take a step forward on the basis of this proposed legislation and our opinion on it, and that you will be able to state, on behalf of the Commission, that you can accept our amendments and that the Council will then be next in line to do its bit! </seg>
<seg id=1110> Investments in the environment are neither cost-free nor do they come into the field of competition. </seg>
<seg id=1111> After all, on the one hand, this directive is an important element in the series of measures taken to enable us to honour the commitment the EU entered into in Kyoto regarding the reduction of greenhouse gases and, on the other, it is a praiseworthy attempt to reduce the European Union' s dependence on the oil-producing countries. </seg>
<seg id=1112> I do not want electricians to cause interference between the two systems and to sow confusion and doubt amongst investors in Europe by short-circuiting and manipulating the system of guaranteed prices. </seg>
<seg id=1113> Mr President, the Commission and the rapporteur are right to formulate long-term objectives for promoting electricity production from renewable energy sources, although what we need is a dynamic approach in these matters. </seg>
<seg id=1114> We see it as building on the work of our colleague, Mr Mombaur, in advocating a greater share of electricity and energy in the European Union from these sources. </seg>
<seg id=1115> The share should aim to be doubled in the next ten years; it could well be more than that. </seg>
<seg id=1116> There is a risk of renewables being stillborn or strangled at birth by the utilities that have a monopoly, if they can charge huge sums for grid access. </seg>
<seg id=1117> Since, at the same time, the EU has to adhere to the climatic targets set at Kyoto, it is especially important that we invest more and more in research into renewables. </seg>
<seg id=1118> Sustainable energy is often associated with small-scale solutions: solar panels on everyone' s roof and a windmill in every village. </seg>
<seg id=1119> The problem we have with different support systems in the Member States, referred to by Mr Chichester, is but one example of the need for a more common approach in this field. </seg>
<seg id=1120> The second problem is that of household waste: strictly speaking it is not a renewable energy, but one must guard against sending a negative signal as regards the incineration of household waste. </seg>
<seg id=1121> Lastly, I am aware that all this is easy to criticise and difficult to carry out, but if we do not act immediately, within a few generations we shall be in deep water, and that will lead us to disaster. </seg>
<seg id=1122> As I have said, we cannot take advantage of biomass in the case of unpolluted woods and we support Amendment No 24. </seg>
<seg id=1123> On the other hand, we could accept Amendments Nos 10 and 59, which state that investment aid to large hydroelectric plants would only be possible in the event that they contribute to improving the environment. </seg>
<seg id=1124> Conflicts are more likely to arise within rather than between States. </seg>
<seg id=1125> This is also apparent from a series of UN documents, most recently the resolution concerning women, peace and security adopted by the Security Council two weeks ago. </seg>
<seg id=1126> As, unfortunately, this is not regarded as obvious, this report makes a very specific demand for women to be integrated into these bodies and for them to be given a participatory role. </seg>
<seg id=1127> In terms of objectives, this resolution broadly resembles the proposal now on the table. </seg>
<seg id=1128> As regards women, since women are participants in history, they must now become players in the peace process. </seg>
<seg id=1129> The training of men in all aspects of gender-related issues would also be of real help to the situation. </seg>
<seg id=1130> When I listen to the various comments made, I find myself agreeing with those who recommend that we take a look at our priorities and then limit the number of aims we want to achieve. </seg>
<seg id=1131> These pacific qualities in women could provide an alternative solution, the basis for the foundations of a new civilisation, a civilisation of peace, in which dialogue is protected at all levels and from which war and violence are excluded as a means of resolving differences. </seg>
<seg id=1132> Women and men, and people in general, are all different. </seg>
<seg id=1133> My only consolation is that this says a great deal about Mrs Theorin' s parliamentary abilities. </seg>
<seg id=1134> I strongly object to the attitude of mind, expressed in this Chamber this evening, whereby one sex is made collectively guilty. </seg>
<seg id=1135> At the Commission's initiative, 5% of the resources may be provided for special projects, such as training civil servants at reception centres, the police and public hygiene officials in how to deal with the special needs of women refugees. </seg>
<seg id=1136> I have therefore tried to establish, in various countries, but also at European level, how many people - insofar as this can be established, because the people concerned are often working 'on the black' of course - work in this sector. </seg>
<seg id=1137> I now come to my final point, that of migrant women, which is, of course, a very specific problematic area. </seg>
<seg id=1138> Mrs Smet has done a wonderful job and of course we are going to support it. </seg>
<seg id=1139> Domestic work is often heavy, involving many places of work. Wages are too low, there is an increase in illicit work, and a situation often prevails in which women, often immigrants, are the first to be exploited. </seg>
<seg id=1140> Of course, both employers and workers - generally both women - are often happy with this state of affairs, which saves money. </seg>
<seg id=1141> Mr President, it is with tremendous pleasure, profound respect for you and the people of Yugoslavia, and with great hope for the future that is opening up in your country and in the new relations between us that the European Parliament welcomes you here today. </seg>
<seg id=1142> There is no better landmark for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in its state recovery and social development than the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1143> The democratic changes that began in Yugoslavia on 5 October have produced at miraculous speed extraordinary results on the international political plane. </seg>
<seg id=1144> It is important to say that Muslims and Albanians inhabit Serbia and Montenegro in significant numbers. </seg>
<seg id=1145> After all, Europe is a home we all share. </seg>
<seg id=1146> The Minutes of the previous day's sitting have been distributed. </seg>
<seg id=1147> The next item is the report (A5-0318/2000) by Mr Cashman on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents [COM(2000) 30 - C5-0057/2000 - 2000/0032(COD)]. </seg>
<seg id=1148> What we have before us is, in fact, the work of these two committees. </seg>
<seg id=1149> The report we are now examining in many respects takes the situation in a better direction. </seg>
<seg id=1150> The opportunity of gaining access to public documents creates greater confidence and legitimacy, something the EU has precious little of at present. </seg>
<seg id=1151> That is why we cannot accept the long list of exceptions set out by the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1152> I also hope that the Council and the Commission can give us a commitment today to continuing to deal with this issue in a positive way so that we might, as quickly as possible, start making the necessary changes to the business procedures in such a way as to benefit people and the image of the institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1153> We would also like to emphasis the important role the Ombudsman has played in the progress that has, nevertheless, been made. </seg>
<seg id=1154> It must be possible to appeal to the European Court of Justice, the Ombudsman or the relevant EU authority, and Parliament must always be able to question the grounds for confidentiality. </seg>
<seg id=1155> I would like to draw attention to the Internet and other possibilities which in the future may facilitate access to documents. </seg>
<seg id=1156> Mr President, a word about the position of the European Commission, because I have already talked about the Council. </seg>
<seg id=1157> It is a project which may lead to citizens being placed in a position in which they are co-players and active participants and are not just spectators or like pawns in interesting, large-scale games of chess. </seg>
<seg id=1158> The citizens have to be able to find out how their government has voted on highly important matters. </seg>
<seg id=1159> The regulation is marked by imprecision, which will produce legal uncertainty for the citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1160> Openness in legislative work and in public administration is, of course, crucial to our democracies being able to function. </seg>
<seg id=1161> It is now that we have the chance to make the EU more open and more democratic. </seg>
<seg id=1162> Fortunately, the Cashman/Maij-Wegen report represents an attempt to compile a document which lays down the citizen' s right to access to documents, and not the right of institutions to impose restrictions. </seg>
<seg id=1163> It is not just chance that we have heard almost only Scandinavians speak here, with very few speakers from Germany or Italy and, so far at least, I believe, none from France. </seg>
<seg id=1164> Naturally we have to finally decide on the sort of practices which would shed public light on the work of the Council, and no set of derogations must be allowed to let the Council retreat behind it in the way it did before. </seg>
<seg id=1165> At the end of the day, exchange of information is an essential foundation of modern democracy, which is nurtured by public debate, media and public control and the contribution of social organisations. </seg>
<seg id=1166> The Treaty recognises the citizens' right to have access to the documents of the European institutions in accordance with certain principles and conditions. </seg>
<seg id=1167> I am referring in particular to texts for internal use and to initial drafts and preparatory study documents for exclusively internal use by the institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1168> Therefore the principle that documents should be subject to a classification system does not raise any problems. </seg>
<seg id=1169> It is not for the Commission to tell political groups what decisions they should make on the amendments that have come from the different political groups and therefore the Commissioner should not be placed in this invidious position. </seg>
<seg id=1170> The Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Malta held its 14th meeting here in Strasbourg, yesterday and today, and focused its discussions on the EU-Malta accession negotiations, on the basis of the periodic report by the European Commission on the progress Malta has made in its preparations for accession, which, as you know, was published in November 2000. </seg>
<seg id=1171> We also accept that there is a need for regulators to have the power to impose particular and additional charges on particular banks. </seg>
<seg id=1172> Report (A5-0307/2000) by Mrs Figueiredo, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion [COM(2000) 368 - C5-0317/2000 - 2000/0157(COD)] </seg>
<seg id=1173> So I would be grateful if the Liberals could take a more pragmatic and speedier approach. </seg>
<seg id=1174> It is not in order for us to postpone the vote because some colleagues cannot be here in the evening. </seg>
<seg id=1175> Mr President, I am totally opposed to what is happening here in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1176> Mr President, I find, somewhat to my consternation, that the vote on the report I was to present in plenary and which is on this morning' s agenda has been postponed inadvertently without anyone noticing. </seg>
<seg id=1177> With regard to Friday, there do not appear to have been any further developments, and in any case, this will also be brought to the attention of the Conference of Presidents. </seg>
<seg id=1178> Today, complete uncertainty reigns in a climate of anxiety as to the risks in store, and neither consumers nor government authorities have any information on them. </seg>
<seg id=1179> Perhaps quality farming is a little more expensive, but the apparent savings gained by farming geared to productivity in fact end up as terrible costs for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id=1180> That is certainly a practical way of applying the precautionary principle. </seg>
<seg id=1181> The lack of consumer confidence is spreading and the agricultural markets are battening down the hatches. </seg>
<seg id=1182> It is unthinkable that we should be trying to run a single market without common rules for such a major sector as that of public health. </seg>
<seg id=1183> The time has come for a global debate. </seg>
<seg id=1184> We must strictly respect the wishes of those Member States that intend to put food safety and consumer health above all other concerns, their resolve to give priority to scientifically based decisions and to the precautionary principle in regard to any measures they take, while choosing the middle road between the positions of the various partners, and especially those who are most lax. </seg>
<seg id=1185> However, if more than 40% of the waste incinerated in plants of this kind consists of toxic waste or untreated, mixed municipal waste, the plant will have to comply with the more stringent standards of another annex on incineration. </seg>
<seg id=1186> Mr President, I voted for the Figuereido report on the eradication of social exclusion and poverty, to quote the actual text of the report. </seg>
<seg id=1187> . (FR) We abstained on this report, even the amended version. </seg>
<seg id=1188> Even though the unemployment rate has fallen, there are still 16 million unemployed in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1189> - (FR) There is 18% of the population of Europe, or 60 million people, living on less than 60% of the average national income (the low-income threshold used to measure relative poverty). </seg>
<seg id=1190> That is why we will vote in favour of the report on combating exclusion. </seg>
<seg id=1191> I fully endorse this innovative measure that has benefited many young people in particular, through strong action on truancy and school exclusion, sleeping rough, teenage pregnancy and providing support to 16-18 year olds not in education, employment or training. </seg>
<seg id=1192> Mr President, I voted for the report on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources. </seg>
<seg id=1193> If the Union wants to remain competitive in this sector, it will have to contribute by using and developing the technologies concerned, which implies major public funding. </seg>
<seg id=1194> . (DE) We all know that we cannot base the future of our energy supplies on the energy sources of the past. </seg>
<seg id=1195> There is still too little water, wind and solar power, which is what makes it comparatively expensive. </seg>
<seg id=1196> (The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=1197> Hence the motion for a resolution that we are tabling following a project that was started a while ago by Parliament' s delegation to Central America, chaired by Mr Salafranca, and which we have modestly continued with during our term of office. </seg>
<seg id=1198> Two fundamental objectives are to try to ensure that social differences are not made worse by the economic policies that currently prevail in that region and to try to ensure that the parliaments help with the integration of the area, which would be beneficial to all. </seg>
<seg id=1199> Mr President, through this resolution we therefore wish to express our support for, and solidarity with, the Central American Parliament and also to ask the Commission to decisively support the multiannual programme which Parlacen has presented to the Commission, since we believe that, as an institution, it legitimises the process of integration in Central America and serves as a symbol of a new era of dialogue and peace. </seg>
<seg id=1200> For the next multiannual programme, which will begin soon, we are considering an additional contribution of more than EUR 10 million in order to continue this activity. </seg>
<seg id=1201> (B5-0863/2000) by Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group </seg>
<seg id=1202> Côte d'Ivoire was driven into this widespread catastrophe because it was caught in the stranglehold of its financial commitment to lend credibility to its economic prospects and the cruel and indiscriminate fallout from international trade negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=1203> It is also vital for relations with the neighbouring countries, especially Burkina Faso, to be restored. </seg>
<seg id=1204> In the same way, I believe that the 14 parties that have been excluded must be reintegrated and play a full part in these elections. </seg>
<seg id=1205> Since it came into force, people of foreign extraction, and in fact we are talking in terms of a third to half of the population, have been the object of discrimination and even of attacks. </seg>
<seg id=1206> The unrest surrounding the elections produced a death toll of about 200, which of course places a heavy burden on the future of the new regime. </seg>
<seg id=1207> Conversely, we refuse to associate ourselves with the representatives of political parties who were or are involved in France' s Africa policy. </seg>
<seg id=1208> (B5-0853/2000) by Kinnock, on behalf of the PSE Group; </seg>
<seg id=1209> Aung San Suu Kyi herself has said that the constructive engagement approach by ASEAN in relation to Rangoon is not working. </seg>
<seg id=1210> Mr President, Commissioner, when Thursdays arrive and we deal with the situation of human rights in the world, I am put in mind, to some extent, of what the Wailing Wall must be like. </seg>
<seg id=1211> I believe we should have sanctions. </seg>
<seg id=1212> Please look at imposing sanctions. </seg>
<seg id=1213> The glass is not full in Vietnam. </seg>
<seg id=1214> So I believe this is an important resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1215> When it comes to saving lives, there are no bureaucratic obstacles. </seg>
<seg id=1216> Contrary to Amendment No 1 tabled by the PSE Group, I noted in a document published on 10 November, that Human Rights Watch regards the human rights situation as being grave on quite a number of counts. </seg>
<seg id=1217> Firstly, with regard to Myanmar, my colleague Chris Patten has already condemned before this House the constant violations of human rights by the military regime in Burma: executions without trial, the widespread imposition of forced labour, the enforced uprooting of local populations, hundreds of political prisoners in the country' s prisons and the clear hindering of the free functioning of political parties. </seg>
<seg id=1218> Furthermore - and I think this should be highlighted today - within the framework of the new constitution adopted in 1992, Vietnam has an elected national parliament, which has the duty of adopting legislation and to which the government must answer in relation to its policies. </seg>
<seg id=1219> Commissioner, I would ask you to take note of that and to be kind enough to reply to Mr Dupuis in the appropriate form - either in writing or orally. </seg>
<seg id=1220> We have an opportunity to make progress at The Hague in the discussions there this week and next. </seg>
<seg id=1221> In Britain alone the estimated cost of the damage is about GBP 4 billion, only half of which is covered by insurance. </seg>
<seg id=1222> The damage is considerable this time as well, people have died and the material damage has been enormous. </seg>
<seg id=1223> The first will deal with the security of the energy supply and the second with a revised common transport policy. </seg>
<seg id=1224> We now adjourn the sitting until the beginning of the vote at 5.30 p.m. </seg>
<seg id=1225> Mr President, I am in favour of postponing the vote out of respect for the rapporteur, Mr Rocard, who specifically asked this afternoon for the vote to be deferred. </seg>
<seg id=1226> Mr President, on behalf of rapporteur Rocard, I would like, in any case, to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 1. </seg>
<seg id=1227> Differences between insurance systems in individual Member States and obstacles to the free movement of people and freedom of residence in another Member State cannot be used as a pretext for privatising a large part - and later all - of the health care system. </seg>
<seg id=1228> . (DE) We are dealing again with an own-initiative report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which, although supplementary health insurance is a highly topical issue, is not totally endorsed by the committee or here in the plenary of the European Parliament since, after all, 12 members did not vote for it in committee. </seg>
<seg id=1229> People who have ordinary health insurance will end up on waiting lists and receiving second-rate care, whilst those who pay extra will be able to buy the right to priority treatment and luxury. </seg>
<seg id=1230> I regard that as major progress. </seg>
<seg id=1231> In particular, we must ensure that there are no major differences between Basel and ourselves in relation to timescales. Otherwise the institutions concerned would just face unreasonable burdens, additional costs or competitive disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id=1232> One cannot help feeling that Parliament, following the Commission, feels obliged to align its activities with those of the Basel committee, which, let me remind you, has no legitimate right to impose its views on the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1233> Another positive note in this regard is that it was clearly accepted that internal bank collateral mitigates risks. </seg>
<seg id=1234> I appreciate that the capacity of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has nothing to do with that of the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1235> In the second place, there would be a level of technical detail covering that area which will be most subject to change if we want the regulations to reflect best practice. </seg>
<seg id=1236> The next item is the report (A5-0293/2000) by Mrs Almeida Garrett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the modification of Parliament' s decision of 9 March 1994 on the regulations governing performance of the Ombudsman' s duties. </seg>
<seg id=1237> There is no doubt that in that role the position of Ombudsman is absolutely critical. </seg>
<seg id=1238> Only in this way can the office of Ombudsman, at EU level too, serve its important and more profound purposes. </seg>
<seg id=1239> The next item is the report (A5-0280/2000) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the special report from the European Ombudsman to the European Parliament following the own-initiative inquiry into the secrecy which forms part of the Commission' s recruitment procedures (C5-0082/2000 - 2000/2048 (COS)). </seg>
<seg id=1240> I have had to do it myself from time to time, looking at scripts in Italian or German as a native English - or at least a kind of English - speaker. </seg>
<seg id=1241> The recruitment procedures must be transparent to avoid all abuse; that is obvious. </seg>
<seg id=1242> The report by the Committee on Petitions states that the Committee approves the special report being discussed and, in particular, the point which states the desire to improve the impression the public gets of the institutions from our competitions procedures. </seg>
<seg id=1243> I call for all other institutions to follow this example. </seg>
<seg id=1244> Access to official documents by citizens of the Union is a hallmark of a responsible and fully functioning democracy. </seg>
<seg id=1245> Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Bösch on his report, to which the Commission accords a favourable response. </seg>
<seg id=1246> That was a very satisfactory finish to a very satisfactory debate. </seg>
<seg id=1247> Mr President, the French version of the Minutes for yesterday' s sitting state, on page 14, that we were to come back this morning to my request to postpone the voting on the Villiers report. </seg>
<seg id=1248> Mr President, this is an issue of principle. </seg>
<seg id=1249> What is totally unacceptable is for the supervisory authority - the Banca d'Italia - to have the power to establish a higher minimum requirement under certain conditions. </seg>
<seg id=1250> Mr President, we have spoken today about the importance and unimportance of reports. </seg>
<seg id=1251> In so doing, we are beginning to train the next generation of police officers to work and operate throughout Europe; in other words, we will be preparing them to implement Community law and joint and Community actions. </seg>
<seg id=1252> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like the previous speakers, I hope that this initiative will not be seen as the umpteenth European organisation, but that people will take this initiative seriously and, as a consequence, will give it enough of a chance. </seg>
<seg id=1253> We do not really have a common culture in Europe on these important points. </seg>
<seg id=1254> You speak about establishing public order. </seg>
<seg id=1255> We will vote for the amendments but against the legislative resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1256> As you can probably gather, I will not be supporting this report. </seg>
<seg id=1257> I come from a state where the police developed out of a chaotic situation - a civil war. </seg>
<seg id=1258> This week, the contribution made by President De Gaulle to establishing peace in Algeria was held up by Mr Posselt as a model for the role which Mr Kostunica will have to play in order to solve the Kosovo problem. </seg>
<seg id=1259> I should like to assure Parliament that the Commission is willing to continue to cooperate, both with regard to creating the Academy and to ensuring its smooth operation. </seg>
<seg id=1260> Combating crime is simply a pretext. </seg>
<seg id=1261> The amendments tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are pushing in the opposite direction, emphasising that this is a temporary structure, that the time period for revision must be short, and that a permanent headquarters must be found for the organisation. </seg>
<seg id=1262> Crucial to its operation would be the principle that a judgment made on visiting rights in one Member State is recognised throughout the EU. </seg>
<seg id=1263> In particular, we must take account of the fact that situations sometimes occur in which the parent comes from the other side of the Union, travelling thousands of kilometres, and so it is pointless to do this for a visit limited to one hour. </seg>
<seg id=1264> Often, couples go their separate ways in a civilised manner. </seg>
<seg id=1265> As the House knows, the Commission and the Council have the firm intention of adopting a programme of mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=1266> I think if there is a fear of abduction this can be handled by having supervised visitation. </seg>
<seg id=1267> Certain sports organisations claim that these conflicts can only be resolved by the inclusion of a reference to sport in the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=1268> However, let us not forget that football is of crucial interest to millions of our citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1269> This is a matter of the most obvious monopoly, that of television rights, which a certain contract has ensured will continue for a hundred years. </seg>
<seg id=1270> Mr President, the Commission is aware of the package of measures in the road transport sector that the UK Government announced on 8 November in response to the recent oil price increases. </seg>
<seg id=1271> I believe that this measure is certainly contrary to free trade even with the improvement that has been mentioned by the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1272> Mr President, with great respect I have to disagree with Mr Simpson. </seg>
<seg id=1273> The Commission has also quite clearly ascertained that the greatest problem on the roads at present is accidents. </seg>
<seg id=1274> I am sure the British government will be in discussion with the Commission in applying this vignette. </seg>
<seg id=1275> The Commission should consider coming forward with proposals in order to provide for a common system throughout Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1276> In the 1960s, you fought together, Mr Colom i Naval, for democracy in Spain. </seg>
<seg id=1277> You are perfectly entitled to do so pursuant to Rule 18, but it must not be thought that procedural motions have nothing to do with the specific, topical issues which the Members wish to raise at the beginning of a sitting, and it is important that Parliament should hear them. </seg>
<seg id=1278> With good technical progress on the rules for the Kyoto mechanisms and the development of a compliance system, final negotiations focused mainly on trade-offs between "supplementarity" and "sinks" . </seg>
<seg id=1279> The EU must review its positions on the key issues and, where appropriate, make new proposals. </seg>
<seg id=1280> My question to the Commissioner is: Does she feel that there is any flexibility likely to arise in the European Union position on "sinks" ; secondly, when does she forecast that the talks are likely to resume; and thirdly, was Mr Prescott' s statement to the House of Commons actually true? </seg>
<seg id=1281> Madam President, these negotiations were always going to be hard but Commission officials believed that a deal would be done at the end of the day because political leaders across the world simply had too much to lose by returning home empty-handed. </seg>
<seg id=1282> Progress was also made in the field of enforcement. </seg>
<seg id=1283> Only if equality is incorporated will the developing countries start to participate in the fight against climate change after 2012. </seg>
<seg id=1284> It is important for Europe to stick with a position taken up previously, even though it means that the United States will not be in a position to subscribe to an agreement of this kind for the period of the Bush administration. </seg>
<seg id=1285> It has already been said that the next meeting to discuss the issue of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will take place in Bonn, which will coincide with a publication by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change. </seg>
<seg id=1286> The intransigence of the European Union, led by the French Minister for the Environment, Mrs Voynet, stood in the way of a potential agreement. </seg>
<seg id=1287> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us not beat about the bush, the climate conference in The Hague was a flop, which is disappointing because it is becoming increasingly apparent that climate change is happening much faster than anticipated. </seg>
<seg id=1288> Clearly, however, there are many losers following a conference of this kind. </seg>
<seg id=1289> Madam President, we knew that this COP­VI would be of particularly great importance: it represented abandoning the stage of discussion in which we had been stuck since 1992 and moving on towards action. </seg>
<seg id=1290> This is only the start. </seg>
<seg id=1291> We now know what kind of questions we will have on the table for this last part. </seg>
<seg id=1292> There are some very important items on the agenda but even so they far from reflect all the work that has been done and all the results that have already been obtained during the last six months. </seg>
<seg id=1293> The role of the European Parliament is naturally one of the important elements in the debate. </seg>
<seg id=1294> There too, a solution will have to be found at Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1295> First, the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </seg>
<seg id=1296> I hope we can profit from it even more in the future, notably by opening it up to other European countries. </seg>
<seg id=1297> The European Council will thus be informed of the state of progress of the negotiations on the directive on the information and consultation of workers, and on the European company project, assuming these issues have not already been settled by then, as unfortunately they are running into persistent opposition. </seg>
<seg id=1298> Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, next week the European Council meets in Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1299> This is a subject I would like to dwell on for a moment, because the House made a point of highlighting it on today's agenda. </seg>
<seg id=1300> But this means that the right of codecision must also apply to fundamental matters of European agricultural policy, where majority decision-making already exists. </seg>
<seg id=1301> Then we will even be able to discuss - as suggested by President Chirac in the Bundestag, not here - the European Constitution. </seg>
<seg id=1302> I should like to say, with regard to a number of the specific points, that my group believes that, at this stage of evolution of the European Union, having one national for each Member State of the Commission still remains a sensible proposition and enhances the legitimacy of the Union. </seg>
<seg id=1303> However, it is important at this stage to discuss what is to happen post-Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1304> The moment of truth is approaching in Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1305> Another avenue must be explored, one that is more flexible and more respectful of the decisions of each Member State: the avenue of 'differentiated cooperation' . </seg>
<seg id=1306> The powers to be given to the EU by the Treaty of Nice treaty go beyond those exercised at federal level in many federal States. </seg>
<seg id=1307> The federalists can achieve their desire for more integration, and the governments in Sweden, Great Britain and Denmark can ease their countries into the new arrangements once the decisions, binding in practice, have been taken. </seg>
<seg id=1308> In view of the extent to which public confidence has been undermined with regard to the euro, people need to see that we are taking steps forward. </seg>
<seg id=1309> Mr Poettering condemned the responsibilities of parties on all sides. </seg>
<seg id=1310> Perhaps we should shift the focus to the issue of extending codecision with the Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1311> In my view, the most important thing to do at the Nice Summit is to set a timetable for when and how the EU is to become ready for enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=1312> The stadium is now in sight. </seg>
<seg id=1313> (Applause from the right and centre) </seg>
<seg id=1314> In order to make room for the newcomers, all Member States need to move a little closer together, but they only do so when they really cannot put off the evil moment any longer. </seg>
<seg id=1315> I have this to say to the Heads of Governments: making concessions at the forthcoming summit is not a political defeat but a political triumph: the triumph of the new Europe over the old. </seg>
<seg id=1316> Having said this, in my opinion, Nice needs to be an historic Council, for ourselves, our nations and the very future of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1317> In order to ensure that the institutions operate more efficiently, we called for Council decisions to be taken by qualified majority rather than unanimously, although we did, of course, exclude all issues of constitutional significance. </seg>
<seg id=1318> Mr President, the EU summit at Nice will hopefully be a further positive step on the road to European integration. </seg>
<seg id=1319> Every government is saying we need more qualified majority voting, but they all have their list of exceptions. </seg>
<seg id=1320> If this is working here let us make it work across the whole spectrum of legislation. </seg>
<seg id=1321> The common foreign policy needs to be fully integrated into Community procedure because only then shall we have the necessary safety valves. </seg>
<seg id=1322> I do not believe that failure is an option. </seg>
<seg id=1323> I would warn our Heads of Government against taking an over-minimalist stance in Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1324> I feel it is also up to the Council to try to act not just for the sake of national interests but also for the sake of the common European interest, because united we stand, divided we fall, and we had better not forget it. </seg>
<seg id=1325> I venture to doubt whether consensus will be easier to achieve in the new extended family than it is now. </seg>
<seg id=1326> I definitely intend to pass on the information to the President of the Republic, who will be chairing the Nice European Council, the Prime Minister, and my colleagues on the General Affairs Council next Monday. </seg>
<seg id=1327> We have to take it into account. </seg>
<seg id=1328> The same applies to qualified majority voting issues. </seg>
<seg id=1329> I would further stress that the Commission's determination will target not only the points we have just discussed but also the consideration and the attention that will be given to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </seg>
<seg id=1330> I wish to refer to the disgraceful demonstration that took place in the Foreign Affairs Committee of this Parliament yesterday morning when the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs was involved in discussions with us. </seg>
<seg id=1331> It was a dangerous situation. </seg>
<seg id=1332> She was unfortunate enough to utter a few words in the Kurdish language before coming to her national tongue, which is German. </seg>
<seg id=1333> Based on the findings of this report, the President will not hesitate to take the required measures and also to involve the organs of this Parliament that need to be involved, such as the quaestors or the Bureau, for example. </seg>
<seg id=1334> (The President cut the speaker off) </seg>
<seg id=1335> Mr President, when Mr Gorostiaga uses the word "dialogue" in his tribute to the murdered Ernest Lluch, he is insulting his memory and insulting the ideas for which ETA murdered him. </seg>
<seg id=1336> The next item is the joint debate on two reports and two oral questions: </seg>
<seg id=1337> The problems do not lie with them, but rather in the institutional ramifications, and we must try to keep such problems to an absolute minimum. </seg>
<seg id=1338> I already know the vote will not be unanimous and that is not surprising, because this is difficult ground where differing political options are expressed on the role of the European Union as opposed to that of its Member States, on the place of the soldier as opposed to the civilian, on the place of the European Union as opposed to NATO and the United States, on the role of the European Union in the world and the choice it has to make between pacifism and non-intervention, on the one hand, and the will to deal with crises, on the other. </seg>
<seg id=1339> Within the limits of operational security even the US Senate and House are closely involved with the operations of the Department of Defence. </seg>
<seg id=1340> The mechanism created as a result of these decisions will be complemented by establishing procedures for crisis management and the establishment of an operations centre in the Secretariat-General. </seg>
<seg id=1341> This applies to the actions of the traditional Member State administrations as well as to the specialist agencies. </seg>
<seg id=1342> Our policy is quite clear: we want, on the basis of principles of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and the market economy, to provide the most useful incentives and support for the huge changes undertaken by Russia, for it to become, eventually - and it will take as long as necessary - a great country, which is developing, which is modernising at every level and which is peace-loving, in short, the kind of country that we would be happy to have as our neighbour. </seg>
<seg id=1343> We decided to work on the content of our policy towards North Korea and, on 20 November, we adopted guidelines for that country and the European troika has been able to visit North Korea on the basis of this approach. </seg>
<seg id=1344> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I speak to you today, I am aware of taking part in a key turning point in the life of Europe, because this is, I think, the first time that a Minister of Defence has addressed your Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1345> We also now have a catalogue of forces that records the voluntary contributions of each Member State. </seg>
<seg id=1346> Our fifteen nations have set themselves the target of making this Force operational, I repeat, by 2003. </seg>
<seg id=1347> A Japanese-American political scientist wrote a book with the unhappy title of "The End of History" in 1989. </seg>
<seg id=1348> In the recent history of Bosnia, we saw a situation in which some of our soldiers were very often put in intolerable positions, not just militarily but morally as well. </seg>
<seg id=1349> On crisis management, the Commission adopted on 27 September a draft decision on the establishment of a Community mechanism for coordination of civil protection interventions in emergency situations. </seg>
<seg id=1350> Mr President, Mr Brok has made it perfectly clear what our group thinks of the progress achieved in the field of defence and of the distance that still needs to be covered here. </seg>
<seg id=1351> We do not rule out the possibility of increasing defence expenditure, but that will have to be assessed on its own merits, also in line with other priorities, for example in the social and economic field. </seg>
<seg id=1352> Naturally, the EU must take increased responsibility for conflict-prevention measures, crisis management, peacekeeping operations etc in the immediate vicinity of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1353> Last summer' s so-called Solana decision was criticised vociferously in this Chamber. </seg>
<seg id=1354> I have a very specific question for Mr Richard on that score. </seg>
<seg id=1355> Let us simply repeat what Mrs Mary Robinson said to the UN Commissioner for human rights: not more, but not less. </seg>
<seg id=1356> Then, and only then, will it have a chance to overcome its impotence in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean region. </seg>
<seg id=1357> Furthermore, as the French Minister for Defence pointed out, there has been progress in the field of defence policy. </seg>
<seg id=1358> There is, however, a European level of security policy, and the European Parliament acts as a budgetary authority for security expenditure at that level. </seg>
<seg id=1359> Yet the Union would be unrivalled in that domain if only it would improve the existing instruments and especially its present potential for civilian conflict prevention and apply them coherently. </seg>
<seg id=1360> Civilian conflict prevention, and I stress the word 'prevention', cannot be a mere appendage of military intervention. </seg>
<seg id=1361> I believe, Mr President, that if you were to ask the public for their opinion, you would find that they think we deal with foreign policy and security here in the European Parliament, and that this is also where the centre of gravity of our decision-making power lies, which is not the case. </seg>
<seg id=1362> Fifthly, the United Nations should be asked to convene a world peace summit, at which lessons can be drawn from the wars of the twentieth century so that the peoples of this earth will be offered the prospect of a peaceful twenty-first century. </seg>
<seg id=1363> Firstly, a key factor must be to maintain the consistency of the European Union's external policy. </seg>
<seg id=1364> It is an exciting debate we are having this evening. </seg>
<seg id=1365> I am very proud however of the Irish agreement and the Irish contribution. </seg>
<seg id=1366> Millions of dollars were promised and then given to the Taliban to enable them to remove, to pull up their opium crops: they pocketed the money and then promptly more than doubled their drugs production. </seg>
<seg id=1367> EU policy must always be based on the partnership approach which seeks to share NATO assets, particularly planning and intelligence as well as hardware, rather than duplicate the structures of NATO, particularly when we share common objectives. </seg>
<seg id=1368> On the question of duplication, let me point out that the resources, the military assets the nations have freely accepted to provide for this joint force, are the same capabilities most of these nations make available to the Atlantic Alliance. </seg>
<seg id=1369> As a result, public opinion and our parliaments, including this one, will begin to give deeper political thought to the issues involved in resolving crises by a whole range of means, of which armed force is but one component. </seg>
<seg id=1370> The need for reform is beyond doubt and the Commission must become a first-class administration in the service of our political objective. </seg>
<seg id=1371> The recruitment procedure must always guarantee equal opportunities to all EU nationals. </seg>
<seg id=1372> We are very much in favour of that. </seg>
<seg id=1373> But looking at the four reports as a whole, this period of consultation has allowed us to take both a broader and a closer view, which has increased the value of Parliament's opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1374> As the committee with responsibility for budgetary control, I highlight in the report approved by the committee the aspects of the reform concerning competence in this area. </seg>
<seg id=1375> The Court of Auditors also says that, on the express condition that the role of the contractor... </seg>
<seg id=1376> In the short time this evening I do not have time to go through all our specific recommendations in detail, so I want to centre on what I think is the key element of how these reforms must move forward. </seg>
<seg id=1377> A further document on the subject is being prepared by the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1378> The Committee on Constitutional Affairs calls for an overall study into the problem of the Union's external representation both in dealing with third countries in international negotiations and in international bodies, and to consider the establishment of a common diplomatic service. </seg>
<seg id=1379> My group does not reject the idea of this proposal on early retirement being obligatory. </seg>
<seg id=1380> Second, the setting up of a financial irregularities help-desk or panel as proposed in the White Paper is acceptable to my group only if it can be shown that such a help-desk will in no way undermine the ability of OLAF to do its work. </seg>
<seg id=1381> If there is more than one decision-maker, nobody clearly bears the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id=1382> The implementation of the budget is another area in which the Commission - and Parliament too, for that matter - must consider in future what to do about the problem of backlogs, how to ensure that we start to address the question of budgetary commitments in the implementation of new programmes too, so that we do not always have this huge discrepancy between commitments and payments. </seg>
<seg id=1383> Commissioner Kinnock is trying, by changing and improving the rules, to give the Commission officials an enhanced sense of responsibility. </seg>
<seg id=1384> The experts, as such, are specialists, but the legislator cannot be either their obedient servant or another expert: he must hear, consult, reflect and then produce on his own initiative, or else he may as well give up politics and leave law-making to the experts. </seg>
<seg id=1385> Amendment No 23 looks like it was an afterthought and while we are not against it, it should not replace the existing Paragraph 22. </seg>
<seg id=1386> That goal is enlargement and it is extremely difficult to achieve but we look to the Commission to be the driving force and we want to work alongside it. </seg>
<seg id=1387> The European public' s confidence was shaken and it is much more difficult to regain this now. </seg>
<seg id=1388> It will only be possible to achieve results for the citizens if the Commission is able to act swiftly and transparently, and be accountable to this public service, among other things. </seg>
<seg id=1389> Let us open a new book on a modern European public service that fulfils its constitutional role in the proper manner, is ready for the forthcoming enlargement and lastly, which embraces service provision for the European public as its new mission statement. </seg>
<seg id=1390> The more power you have over an issue, the later it comes in the night. </seg>
<seg id=1391> The provision of external channels will be a major and progressive change, which I am certain will work to the benefit of the institutions and their staff, the European Union and, of course, the public interest. </seg>
<seg id=1392> The main focal point of the reform is the effort to improve financial management. </seg>
<seg id=1393> Incidentally, I am delighted to note, Mrs Guy-Quint, that you are a specialist in this field who can be relied upon to debate the recast Financial Regulation in Parliament with competence and no doubt with passion too. </seg>
<seg id=1394> Thank you very much, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=1395> We fear that the origin of the absurdity lies in the internal debate within the Commission regarding who is who. </seg>
<seg id=1396> First let me remind you of a few statistics, to avoid any complexes about our current activities. </seg>
<seg id=1397> We want to see increased accountability for the public service and we want to see decentralisation. </seg>
<seg id=1398> We often talk about cancelling the debt of the less developed countries. </seg>
<seg id=1399> Let us give him the political responsibility to do the job. </seg>
<seg id=1400> . Chairman, this debate is timely as the Commission has in fact taken important steps, new steps in the reform of external relations. </seg>
<seg id=1401> Even if that reform were clearly insufficient, and this is beyond any discussion today, it did in fact lay the basis for a number of the changes which we are now pushing forward. </seg>
<seg id=1402> Report (A5-0343/2000) by Mr Watts, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 95/21/EC concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port state control) [COM(2000) 142 - C5-0174/2000 - 2000/0065(COD)] </seg>
<seg id=1403> Personally, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, that the fact that we are examining these proposals today is living proof that the European Parliament is an effective institution, which can take on board the concerns of our citizens speedily and effectively. </seg>
<seg id=1404> Indeed, citizens have the right to expect that ships are safe and that they can transport their cargo in an environmentally acceptable way without endangering the life and economy of people living on nearby coasts. </seg>
<seg id=1405> Finally, I wish to thank this House and in particular the rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, Ms McKenna and Mr Watts, for their understanding of the importance of the first 'Erika' package which is evidenced by the excellent work already done in such a limited time, and for the generally good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in the field of maritime safety. </seg>
<seg id=1406> We want black boxes in all ships as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id=1407> Not that this is a panacea, of course, as we saw with the Ievoli Sun, which was a new, double-hull vessel, from which we must conclude that this measure alone is not enough. </seg>
<seg id=1408> In this respect, there is a commitment to improving the quality of vessel inspections as a measure to prevent maritime accidents. </seg>
<seg id=1409> This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. </seg>
<seg id=1410> The definition of accidental marine pollution includes a reference to munitions dumping. </seg>
<seg id=1411> Nor let us forget, as Mrs McKenna said, that a large percentage of marine pollution is due to practices coyly described as 'operational' , that is, tank cleaning and other deliberate spills, against which the arsenal of deterrents must be intensified. </seg>
<seg id=1412> I can therefore only ask you to accept the directive and the regulation in the form in which Parliament adopts them at noon today. </seg>
<seg id=1413> I should like to express my very sincere thanks to the three rapporteurs and to say a few words on two or three specific points. </seg>
<seg id=1414> We must send out a clear signal to unsafe flag states, to shipowners, including those from the EU who use these flag states, to shippers who can then get cheaper prices, and to classification societies that are not doing their job properly. </seg>
<seg id=1415> This oil cake symbolises the enormous amount of work we have to do to make our seas cleaner and maritime transport safer. </seg>
<seg id=1416> The Hatzidakis report, whilst banning single-hull oil tankers on the same dates as the American bans, nevertheless introduces a whole raft of exemptions which do not go in the desired direction, notably with the proposal to extend the deadlines for the phasing-out of single-hull vessels. </seg>
<seg id=1417> Mrs de Palacio recalled a few days ago in Rennes that, in less than a year, the United States was able to unilaterally put in place a draconian law regarding maritime safety. </seg>
<seg id=1418> What I would ask though, is what percentage of the ships should be refused at the present time on the basis of these criteria? </seg>
<seg id=1419> No one in the Council of which you are the Chairman should be tempted to accuse of us of moving too slowly; we demand some minimums and everyone will understand that. </seg>
<seg id=1420> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their sterling work. </seg>
<seg id=1421> These countries must make the necessary resources available, people must be trained and so on. </seg>
<seg id=1422> Our political action must be powerful and commensurate with ecological urgency. </seg>
<seg id=1423> I am convinced, however, that it is vitally important in the context of maritime accidents to consider the whole chain of responsibility and to examine every aspect of the matter. </seg>
<seg id=1424> I would also like to point out that it is not enough that the Union alone should find solutions to increase safety at sea. </seg>
<seg id=1425> The Erika catastrophe in autumn 1999 caused many to react, which is a good thing. </seg>
<seg id=1426> Proposals have been made to prohibit ships which seriously endanger our seas from docking, to record voyage data so that conditions along a ship's course can be checked in the event of an accident, to gradually make double hulls compulsory and to improve regulations and standards governing ship inspection and control bodies. </seg>
<seg id=1427> Ladies and gentlemen, let us ensure that the "polluter pays" slogan does not remain just a slogan! </seg>
<seg id=1428> Allow me to make a comment on Portugal, which has been mentioned here. </seg>
<seg id=1429> Like my very good friend Mrs Langenhagen I am very worried about the situation in South Korea and I was glad to see that the European Commission will review this issue before May next year. </seg>
<seg id=1430> It is true that the subjects we are dealing with are sometimes complex and technical. </seg>
<seg id=1431> I would like to start with the proposal on port state control. </seg>
<seg id=1432> This is not reflected in the text of the directive where the refusal of access only concerns EU ports. </seg>
<seg id=1433> Amendment No 12 of the report says exactly the same, but it is more of a political commitment than a legal text. </seg>
<seg id=1434> This is why the Commission would favour Amendment No 28 now on the table which reintroduces the obligation for Member States to carry out their assessment and therefore rejects Amendment No 13. </seg>
<seg id=1435> I have two comments on issues raised by Mr Stenmarck about oil spills in the Baltic Sea. </seg>
<seg id=1436> Thank you, Mrs Wallström. </seg>
<seg id=1437> The vote will take place in a few moments. </seg>
<seg id=1438> Motion for a resolution on the preparation of the Nice European Council </seg>
<seg id=1439> If the author of the amendment agrees, we could proceed in that way. </seg>
<seg id=1440> Report (A5-0326/2000) by Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the White Paper on reforming the Commission (aspects concerning the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market) [COM(2000)0200 - C5-0446/2000 - 2000/2216(COS)] </seg>
<seg id=1441> I have talked to retired seamen, who tell me that they are all in favour of this programme, especially because it is a European programme aimed at keeping the seas clean. </seg>
<seg id=1442> We need to change the system of shipping registers by moving them from the private to the public sector. </seg>
<seg id=1443> It is significant that Mrs Vachetta has proposed that the level of manpower, the working hours, the pay levels and the training of sailors should be improved. </seg>
<seg id=1444> We therefore call on the Member States to make a real commitment to maritime safety. </seg>
<seg id=1445> Double-hull tankers reduce the risk of oil pollution, but do not rule it out. </seg>
<seg id=1446> In short, what is being proposed is to eliminate the lack of maritime safety without attacking its causes. </seg>
<seg id=1447> . The Erika and other recent oil spills form a continuing catalogue of disasters that have taken place in Community waters, including the Braer spill off Shetland and the Sea Empress of Wales. </seg>
<seg id=1448> Oil tanker traffic in the Baltic may now increase dramatically, since Russia is planning a number of oil ports along the Baltic coast, in the Gulf of Finland, in something approaching a major concentration of the Russian oil industry. </seg>
<seg id=1449> The quality of our environment is at stake. </seg>
<seg id=1450> It is a step in the right direction that the recognition accorded classification societies can be withdrawn, that liability is to be harmonised and that classification societies will always have to transfer their data to the competitor who takes over from them. </seg>
<seg id=1451> In particular, we reject calls for a European constitution, at least if it entails the subordination of national constitutions. </seg>
<seg id=1452> - (SV) We are voting in favour of the resolution, but we wish to comment on the following points: </seg>
<seg id=1453> That must not stop us, the people of the European Union, from seeking this justice in the here and now, here on earth. </seg>
<seg id=1454> It now remains to make a success of the Nice Summit and, as regards institutional reform, to persuade each of you to make the final concessions needed to achieve 'a good agreement' and a good Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=1455> . As a Member of Parliament representing Ireland I am deeply disappointed with the wording of the resolution which has just been adopted by this House on the 2000 Nice European Council. </seg>
<seg id=1456> The EU, within the framework of NATO, will take part in imposing a new world order which has little sympathy for the fate of the Palestinians and which is preparing to effectively endorse the liberalisation of rail transport and postal services. </seg>
<seg id=1457> On the other hand, the so-called reforms proposed by the Nice Summit resolution make little sense to anyone in the world beyond Brussels. </seg>
<seg id=1458> Need we remind ourselves that democracy does not boil down to having a vote? </seg>
<seg id=1459> . (SV) I welcome the aim to ease the enlargement process at the Conference of the European Council in Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1460> Nor can we support the conversion of the Community' s delegations into EU embassies. </seg>
<seg id=1461> The truth is that, far removed from the virtual visions which hold sway within this Parliament, diplomatic realities are entirely different and the CFSP hardly exists. </seg>
<seg id=1462> ' he told me. </seg>
<seg id=1463> . (FR) We have naturally voted against this report. </seg>
<seg id=1464> We feel that civil crisis management is a valuable instrument for preventing conflicts, something which we must unfortunately state has not been given sufficient attention in the report. </seg>
<seg id=1465> Workers have nothing to gain and everything to lose from this 'new' imperial design of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1466> I therefore cannot support the report. </seg>
<seg id=1467> The talk about being 'united in diversity' rings hollow, especially for the non-aligned Member States, if only parts of the content of the reports are put into practice. </seg>
<seg id=1468> A teacher marking such a piece of work would write "Does not answer the question". </seg>
<seg id=1469> Whilst I fully recognise and support the participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution, I must sadly vote against this rather confused report. </seg>
<seg id=1470> However, I am not very comfortable with some of the wording in it. </seg>
<seg id=1471> There is great demand for domestic help. </seg>
<seg id=1472> Finally, she wants Member States to link the issuing of visas for domestic employees working for diplomats to be linked to a guaranteed minimum level of working conditions. </seg>
<seg id=1473> It is just a fear: I am sure he will not do so, but I should like to emphasise this anyway on behalf of pensioners. </seg>
<seg id=1474> Madam President, I voted in favour of the Pomés Ruiz report. </seg>
<seg id=1475> The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, however, forcefully recalls that, as regards staff recruitment, the Commission reform must take account of the diversity of opinions and beliefs which are expressed in our countries regarding Europe, its past and its future. </seg>
<seg id=1476> The Commission should execute: it should be the executive power of the European Union; Parliament should be the legislative power. </seg>
<seg id=1477> This is absolutely essential! </seg>
<seg id=1478> I shall try to clarify the position. </seg>
<seg id=1479> Madam President, some of us were, of course, at the same meeting. </seg>
<seg id=1480> So I am in favour of postponing the resolution until January. </seg>
<seg id=1481> We have only just discovered that this text is not available, at least for the time being, but it might be in the next few hours. </seg>
<seg id=1482> Madam President, we voted on 4 December. </seg>
<seg id=1483> Does anyone from that group wish to support this request? </seg>
<seg id=1484> I will see what I can do about that. </seg>
<seg id=1485> Legislative procedures do not take place in a vacuum; as the negotiations for the framework agreement on tobacco control in the World Health Organisation have shown, there is a worldwide trend towards increasingly far-reaching control of what the World Health Organisation refers to as the tobacco epidemic. </seg>
<seg id=1486> If this can be settled in a legally conclusive manner by adding a reference to the legal basis of Article 133 of the Treaty then I feel we should all support this solution, and I would also hope that by so doing, we will not encounter annulment rights at a later stage. </seg>
<seg id=1487> To ditch, as someone has proposed, all this work and with it the opportunity to send a positive message to the citizens is, of course, a valid proposal, but at least let us have the courage to do it in the name of an explicit political reason and not hide behind formal homage to the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=1488> Fifty thousand deaths a year for decades, due to the consequences of using a drug with known side-effects for which doctors and hospital departments know there is only palliative treatment, and nothing is done apart from a few timid information campaigns. </seg>
<seg id=1489> We have a positive opinion of the contents of the report and support its main points. </seg>
<seg id=1490> That attitude perfectly sums up the defects of our European institutions, always ready to go to any lengths to achieve the ideological goals they have set themselves. </seg>
<seg id=1491> Tobacco consumption is discouraged on the one hand, yet on the other, in excess of EUR 1 billion is spent on tobacco subsidies annually. </seg>
<seg id=1492> The Commissioner today, for the first time, in his very brief intervention, has used the words "no doubt" at least three times and the words "clear" or "clearly" at least three times. </seg>
<seg id=1493> This judgment has several questionable aspects but, accepting the judgment as it stands - since we have no choice, given that the court of Justice is the highest body qualified to interpret Community law - there is nothing to prevent this Parliament from declaring itself in favour of the proposed legal basis of Article 95 with Article 133, and introducing the amendments to which I have referred, which include the rapporteur' s amendments. </seg>
<seg id=1494> Parliament should no longer be deluded in this matter; it should understand that it is now vital to show support for Mr Maaten' s excellent report. </seg>
<seg id=1495> Amendments approved by our committee were to increase the size of the general warnings such as "smoking kills", on the front of cigarette packages from 25 to 30% and to increase the size of additional warnings on cigarette packages from 25 to 40%. </seg>
<seg id=1496> It is a classic symptom of political correctness gone mad. </seg>
<seg id=1497> It is important to insist that the Commission draw up a proposal for a common list of additives by the end of 2004 at the latest. </seg>
<seg id=1498> As a relatively new Member of this House it struck me how strong the forces against this directive are in this Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1499> This does not help anyone to achieve their objectives because production is not reduced, it is just moved. </seg>
<seg id=1500> Only where these terms are part of registered trademarks which are already marketed could consideration be given to granting derogations. </seg>
<seg id=1501> I therefore urge you to support this compromise package. </seg>
<seg id=1502> People change from one type of cigarette to another under the false assumption that the 'light' cigarette is safer for their health. </seg>
<seg id=1503> In answer to the question on exports that Mr Bowis asked me earlier, it is quite clear that, in the unlikely event that the aspect of the directive that refers to exports is challenged and if the view of the Court - which I do not predict - is that it is not supported by the legal basis, it is clearly severable from the directive. </seg>
<seg id=1504> I do not agree with that view for two reasons: firstly, this would run counter to the concept of harmonisation, which is the justification for using Article 95 as the basis; secondly, even if Member States wanted to advertise in this way, it does not require any sanction or authorisation by legislation at EU level to do so. </seg>
<seg id=1505> Thus, the amendments that the Commission has accepted will make this a much improved text and take account of the main concerns expressed by Members. </seg>
<seg id=1506> In view of the changes that we will very likely be undergoing, it would not be a very good idea to introduce permanent arrangements now, with no opportunity for a review. </seg>
<seg id=1507> The first report will be drafted by 30 April 2007, at the latest. </seg>
<seg id=1508> The dates for starting and ending summer time were harmonised, finally, a few years ago so that they have been the same in all the Member States of the EU since 1996. </seg>
<seg id=1509> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as the darkest time of the year approaches it is heartening to speak of summer, or even summer time. </seg>
<seg id=1510> While these are all reasons militating in favour of adopting open-ended arrangements, as a precaution the Commission has made provision for drawing up, no later than five years after the first year of application of the directive, a report based on information supplied by each Member State. </seg>
<seg id=1511> Positions here in Parliament were very far apart, but they were equally divergent between the Member States and the different institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1512> Children's metabolisms have particular characteristics, which is why medicines which are administered to children also need to be tested on children in clinical trials. </seg>
<seg id=1513> Madam President, I would like to join Mrs Patrie in warmly thanking our rapporteur, Mr Liese, for all his efforts to find a consensus. </seg>
<seg id=1514> It was only, in my view, this amendment, tabled by us, that made this important debate possible. </seg>
<seg id=1515> Current differences between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in the Member States are creating obstacles to and competition between pharmaceutical companies in their bid to make new drugs quickly available to patients. </seg>
<seg id=1516> But I was keen to hear whether the Council could accept it, if that were perhaps possible. </seg>
<seg id=1517> So that is what we have agreed; we have agreed that the two programmes which expire in December 2001 will be extended for one year and we have also agreed on the amount, which is the same, in fact it is slightly less than the amount which the European Commission originally requested. </seg>
<seg id=1518> For example, even if the fight against AIDS is not fashionable, it still needs to be a priority because this tragic disease remains very present, particularly in the future candidate countries. </seg>
<seg id=1519> The Irish Government runs a very successful programme called "The Young People Facilities and Services Fund" which supports the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas. </seg>
<seg id=1520> I thank Parliament, particularly the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, for the great efforts made to ensure that this proposal can be adopted in one reading and in record time. </seg>
<seg id=1521> In this matter, we simply have to remember, for example, that in 1997, within the European Union, more than 200 million people crossed the borders of their State of residence into the territory of other Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1522> For this reason, the Citizens' Europe will not make sense unless we first adopt, amongst others, the necessary measures to improve and also take account of the rights of victims of crime, aimed in a global sense at safeguarding all their rights and interests, on the one hand, and, from a Community point of view, at harmonising the legislation of the 15 Member States on the other. </seg>
<seg id=1523> The Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with the rapporteur's view that this recorded evidence was not a suitable instrument in a State under the rule of law and therefore deleted video recordings from the relevant paragraph of the article concerned. </seg>
<seg id=1524> It is crucial that there should be a legal instrument that enables national legislation in the various Member States on the victim' s status to be harmonised. </seg>
<seg id=1525> By adopting this report, the European Union is giving an initial response to a call for justice which has hitherto been disregarded. </seg>
<seg id=1526> The study carried out by An Weghers within the framework of the Grotius programme provides the necessary basic information to this end. The useful information available in certain Member States concerning existing measures could play an important part in the harmonisation of a common package of measures. </seg>
<seg id=1527> So, together with the euro, I also welcome the advent of the statute for the victims of crime, so that a genuine European area of justice can be built. </seg>
<seg id=1528> I cannot support this sort of trend. </seg>
<seg id=1529> The Commission does not have any objection to the majority of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur. </seg>
<seg id=1530> At this stage, it is perhaps preferable to bring about a working relationship with the services for victim support, rather than putting in a text the principle of a 'green number' , which would be likely to have no future. </seg>
<seg id=1531> Are there any comments? </seg>
<seg id=1532> Moreover, as I said before, I hope that we will be able to vote on this proposal during the January part-session. </seg>
<seg id=1533> As the elected representatives of the people, we parliamentarians have acted in accordance with this proverb. </seg>
<seg id=1534> We now expect the Commission to start work at soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id=1535> I should like to have responded to long-term requirements with proper multiannual planning. </seg>
<seg id=1536> I think that we are on the right path and, as part of the budgetary authority - in this case as the budgetary authority because the Council does not play the most decisive role here - we shall help to ensure that this continues in the future. </seg>
<seg id=1537> Here the thing that we are not allowed to mention is 'revision of the financial perspective.' </seg>
<seg id=1538> I am thinking specifically here of research, the Trans-European Networks and culture or audiovisual creation, with the MEDIA Plus programme, on which an agreement was concluded on 23 November. </seg>
<seg id=1539> The credit for this result, which is proof of the priority given by the European Union to the development of small and medium-sized businesses and to employment must be given to your rapporteur, Jutta Haug, who is in the Chamber today. </seg>
<seg id=1540> Mobilising the flexibility instrument, which is one of the key innovations of the 1999 agreement, has therefore enabled us to conclude an agreement on the funding of the European Union' s external actions in 2001, whilst taking account of factors that may occur along the way. </seg>
<seg id=1541> I can assure you that the Council' s objective, throughout this budgetary procedure, has been to produce a budget for 2001 that will enable the European Union to respond to the crises that affect it within Europe itself but also those occurring beyond its borders. </seg>
<seg id=1542> I should like at this point to take the opportunity to thank Mr Kouchner for his splendid work in Kosovo; we were also able to provide huge support here from our budgetary resources. </seg>
<seg id=1543> The procedure for the flexibility instrument was laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement for the purpose, in exceptional cases, of funding specific expenditure over and above the ceilings agreed in Berlin, without calling the financial perspective into question. </seg>
<seg id=1544> I have two comments to make in connection with the document now on the table, and these are directed at the Council and the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1545> This must shortly find expression - as is clear from the debate - in the multiannual programme. </seg>
<seg id=1546> The amount for the common fisheries policy is scarcely 1% of the Community budget. </seg>
<seg id=1547> Turning to that for a moment, we have a lot of work in front of us and we await with interest the report by Mrs Schreyer, preferably before 30 June, so that we can use its contents for shaping up the 2002 budget. </seg>
<seg id=1548> It shows people that we take their problems seriously and are doing something about them. </seg>
<seg id=1549> Repeated use of the flexibility instrument also contradicts the Interinstitutional Agreement, because it was an instrument which this European Parliament secured in order to pay for contingencies and so that it could let it run up to EUR 600 million. </seg>
<seg id=1550> We wanted to secure the EU's ability to act and the confidence of the people. </seg>
<seg id=1551> I am also aware that this outcome certainly owes a great deal to the contribution made by the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1552> In deciding to abolish a second Commissioner, and in deciding on a varying upper limit for the number of Commissioners when there are less than 27, with a scrupulously fair system of rotation, the Treaty of Nice guarantees both the Commission' s task of embodying the interests of the Union and also its effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id=1553> This therefore provides us with a guarantee that Europe will be able, no matter what happens, to forge ahead rapidly. </seg>
<seg id=1554> Thirty new chapters were closed, including some in the most complex areas of Community legislation, and some countries, which have only just entered into negotiations, are already demonstrating their ability to catch up with the longer-standing candidates. </seg>
<seg id=1555> I realise how much importance your Parliament attaches to this Charter. </seg>
<seg id=1556> Over the last few months, the study of the Commission' s excellent proposals has made considerable progress. </seg>
<seg id=1557> The Member States then committed themselves to providing a contribution in terms of armed forces and military resources. </seg>
<seg id=1558> Here, however, in this Chamber, on my own behalf, on behalf of the French Prime Minister and Government, I wish first and foremost to thank this House for its contribution. </seg>
<seg id=1559> Moving on to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of Nice, I would first of all like to pay heartfelt tribute to Michel Barnier for his work. </seg>
<seg id=1560> and secondly because it has made the decision-making process even more complex, which runs counter to the legibility and transparency for which the citizens are calling. </seg>
<seg id=1561> For the European Parliament, which was the winner in Amsterdam, there has been no increase in codecision by the European Parliament and this is one of the great failings of the Nice Summit. </seg>
<seg id=1562> If we want the Union to reflect the interests of all of its Member States and all of its peoples as a community of values, according to the Community method, the institutions that can guarantee this are the Commission and Parliament, acting within the framework of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </seg>
<seg id=1563> After nine months, more than 330 hours of preparation in formal sessions, thousands of hours of preparation surrounding those sessions, it ended up in the spectacle of the extraordinary difficulty of the negotiators being stuck at the end still having to try to resolve everything because in all that had gone before, nothing of substance had been decided. </seg>
<seg id=1564> We would then have sent the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe a signal of incalculable political consequences. </seg>
<seg id=1565> Speaking mainly on behalf of the French members of my group, I will say that there is a permanent contradiction between the virtues attributed to this Europe and the aberrations seen in the daily workings of the Union. </seg>
<seg id=1566> The final result is preposterous. </seg>
<seg id=1567> We are told of parity between the larger States but the division is confirmed with 27 additional seats being allocated to just one country. </seg>
<seg id=1568> However, what is worrying in this situation, and this is something which both I and Mr Poettering have warned against, is that the instrument of reinforced cooperation may be used as a circumvention strategy in areas in which no decision can be reached by a qualified majority. </seg>
<seg id=1569> Not counting certain irresponsible troublemakers who, of course, turned up with intentions which had nothing to do with the progress of human thought, there was indeed excellent and extensive participation, for which the European Confederation of Trade Unions was largely responsible. </seg>
<seg id=1570> Not because I am opposed to the proposals in principle but because I want to safeguard the compromise with the Council and avoid risking a complicated and tricky conciliation procedure for the sake of an amendment. </seg>
<seg id=1571> Two-thirds of children' s medicines were in fact designed for adults. </seg>
<seg id=1572> I welcome the agreement to continue to begin summer time on the last Sunday in March and to end it on the last Sunday in October. </seg>
<seg id=1573> You are going to be surprised, Mr President, for this time, before I left for Strasbourg, it was Mr Carlo Fatuzzo the tourist who said to Mr Carlo Fatuzzo the MEP - we talk to each other sometimes in the mirror - "Seeing as you are going to debate the issue of the protection of victims, remember that last year I went to Spain on holiday and, when I got out my wallet in front of the Sagrada Familia to make a donation in order to make my humble contribution to the conclusion of the work on this structure, both wallet and all the documents inside disappeared. </seg>
<seg id=1574> I believe we have adequate protection for such victims under Article 6 of the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights, and this report is yet another example of unnecessary proposed European interference into an area which is already covered by agreements between Member States, as well as 25 other non-EU members of the Council of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1575> the statement by the officiating President of the Council on the French Presidency. </seg>
<seg id=1576> The results were heartbreaking. </seg>
<seg id=1577> The candidates cannot have been pleased at the sight of the scramble for national power and status among the prime ministers. </seg>
<seg id=1578> It reads, 'Everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others.' </seg>
<seg id=1579> For the fact is that what has been decided in Nice is enhanced cooperation, superpower domination, a Charter of Fundamental Rights, military development and the monitoring of democracy. </seg>
<seg id=1580> This method has seen its heyday, this system of a Europe of chancelleries is on its last legs. </seg>
<seg id=1581> In response to President Chirac, we are not calling for haste; we are asking not to have to take one step forwards and then one backwards, not to call for promotion of the drafting and proclamation of the Charter when we do not then dare to include it in the Treaty, not to call for the new wording of the Convention to be produced when we then do not even dare to suggest it as a potential post-Nice procedure. </seg>
<seg id=1582> Terrified of jeopardising France's equal voting rights with Germany, the Presidency docilely allowed its proposals to extend qualified majority voting to 40 or so subjects to be knocked down to less than half this number. </seg>
<seg id=1583> We know we should think about Europe differently and we know we need new institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1584> That is my main criticism of you. </seg>
<seg id=1585> Only those who have always believed in the strategic value of enlargement have a genuine right to rejoice with them. </seg>
<seg id=1586> Only the Belgian Head of Government, Mr Verhofstadt, was a notable exception. </seg>
<seg id=1587> Given the procedure described, new proposals for the Europe of tomorrow need to be drafted by political and social bodies - mainly the national parliaments and the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1588> I think confidence in Europe would have been shaken in economic terms, and operationally we would have lost several years of ground. </seg>
<seg id=1589> A safety net of Member States: any qualified majority must include a majority of the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1590> One can understand that Heads of State and Government are preoccupied with the sensitivities of their own public opinions and Parliaments. </seg>
<seg id=1591> Therefore, my first words should be to thank Mr Prodi, who has stayed. </seg>
<seg id=1592> Now that we have a population criterion in there anyway, it should have been possible to lower the threshold in terms of the number of votes. </seg>
<seg id=1593> No reform of the common agricultural policy, no reform of the development policies which are vastly wasteful. </seg>
<seg id=1594> These are challenges that cannot be overcome, Mr President of the Commission, with our backs to the people. </seg>
<seg id=1595> But I think that we should not do so until we have a clear and unequivocal promise from the Council as to how the process will operate from now on, i.e. with the close involvement of the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1596> Beyond the technical aspects of that reform, what concerns us most of all is the growing difficulty the Member States of the European Union have in making joint decisions, in accordance with the common interests of their citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1597> We must surely agree with him, although we know that this desire will only be able to be realised after many years have passed, if, as I believe will happen, national parliaments ratify the Treaty of Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1598> " "We cannot get this through the House of Commons. </seg>
<seg id=1599> Thank you very much, Mr President of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1600> In total, with about 1.09% of European gross domestic product, or even less, the 2001 budget will be one of the lowest of the last ten years, in relative terms, since it is well below the already very restrictive ceiling established under Agenda 2000 in Berlin in March 1999. </seg>
<seg id=1601> An agreement has just been concluded in Nice to make enlargement possible. </seg>
<seg id=1602> We are also aware of the assumption behind the Commission's Letter of Amendment No. 2, i.e. that around 900 million can be saved in Category I. However, this assumption no longer holds true. </seg>
<seg id=1603> The Commission's original proposal for a revision of the financial perspective to take EUR 300 million from category 1 for category 4 was a worthy idea: worthy of support and eminently sensible. </seg>
<seg id=1604> There are times when I foolishly assumed this year that once the Commission had made its proposals for a revision we could reach an agreement with the Council. </seg>
<seg id=1605> This year, the Haug report has taken advantage of this institutional declaration last year to discuss the need to revise the financial perspective. </seg>
<seg id=1606> I believe, in actual fact, that both the Member States and the taxpayers are grateful that the charges are not still higher. </seg>
<seg id=1607> We cannot just keep on issuing endless directives and regulations, often without sufficient background information, scientific basis and generally to unbelievably short deadlines. </seg>
<seg id=1608> We have overcome this to a considerable degree in foreign policy and I hope in the forthcoming budget debates that we shall take more decisions of substance and spend more time on the problems and less time haggling over national interests in this budget. </seg>
<seg id=1609> This requirement does not apply to the flexibility reserve. </seg>
<seg id=1610> After all, Russia too wants to be assessed by the same standards that we apply to ourselves. </seg>
<seg id=1611> We are hoping that the cooperation will extend to external policy. </seg>
<seg id=1612> Secondly, we must take great care to ensure diversity of production and supply in terms of energy. </seg>
<seg id=1613> What is important, I think, is that it should continue to be the political responsibility of the administrative staff and should not turn into project management. </seg>
<seg id=1614> Dozens of tons of waste plutonium have to be destroyed as a result of disarmament negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=1615> Nor do I think it acceptable that the European Union should fail to respond to the murders of journalists covering the war in Chechnya. </seg>
<seg id=1616> And yet Jawlinkski' s portrayal of Europe' s struggle with the phenomenon of Russia is very apt. </seg>
<seg id=1617> Despite all its contradictions, Europeans clearly see Russia as part of Europe and have a huge interest in a stable, democratically-organised Russian Federation with good economic prospects which plays a confident part in and helps to shape international policy. </seg>
<seg id=1618> Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Oostlander for his sterling contribution as rapporteur. </seg>
<seg id=1619> We have already laid the foundations of a period of cooperation with Russia during which the political leadership has changed. </seg>
<seg id=1620> The common strategy and Russia's medium-term strategy for relations with the EU have created a new dynamism. </seg>
<seg id=1621> The Commission has taken a leading role in the negotiation of an international agreement establishing the multilateral nuclear environment programme for Russia. </seg>
<seg id=1622> Just one further word about a point that was raised by a couple of speakers in the debate - and that is the question of Georgia and visas. </seg>
<seg id=1623> The Commission considers that once this new directive has come into force, it will make it possible to improve the current situation. </seg>
<seg id=1624> The Lisbon Summit declared that the European Union was to be the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world. </seg>
<seg id=1625> Question No 2 by (H-0871/00): </seg>
<seg id=1626> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we in Parliament have tried in vain to urge Mr Nielson, the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian matters, to visit Chechnya, not just for the sake of an official visit but to carry out a serious survey of the humanitarian situation. </seg>
<seg id=1627> This Question Time is clearly not satisfactory. </seg>
<seg id=1628> It also approved the summary of the report from the high-level group on fraud in the alcohol and tobacco sector. </seg>
<seg id=1629> This also refers to measures which might be undertaken in order to solve the specific problems of excise fraud. </seg>
<seg id=1630> This is imperative and is something that was explicitly called for at the Feira European Council following the tragic events in Dover. </seg>
<seg id=1631> The proposal provides for granting products from LDCs duty free access, amending the generalised tariff preference scheme currently implemented by the Community. </seg>
<seg id=1632> You mentioned the Cotonou Agreement. </seg>
<seg id=1633> Regarding the method of organisation and the criteria for the development of livestock farming, the Council would point out that, in the context of its decisions taken under the Agenda 2000 reform, emphasis has been placed on greater incentives for extensive production, particularly by means of bonuses. </seg>
<seg id=1634> At any event there is now, I believe, a general increase in awareness throughout Europe which will enable whatever measures necessary to be taken in order to combat this disease. </seg>
<seg id=1635> The bilateral political dialogue which the European Union is conducting with Algeria does indeed focus on the objectives you stressed in your question, i.e. restoring debate and a democratic political dynamic. </seg>
<seg id=1636> Consequently, on 20 November 2000 last, on the anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ministers of the Members States with responsibility for matters relating to children and a Commission representative met in Paris and adopted shared commitments which will contribute to enhancing European Union action in making preparations for this special session. </seg>
<seg id=1637> Does the Council intend to include in provisions regarding partnership arrangements stipulations regarding acceptance by Turkey of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice at the Hague and compliance by Turkey with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, in accordance with the unanimous wishes of the Council of Europe? </seg>
<seg id=1638> Question No 13 by (H-0897/00): </seg>
<seg id=1639> Regarding the specific cases you mentioned, mutual recognition will not lead to validation of a judgement which flouts essential rights such as the right to legal representation of one' s own choice or the right to the free assistance of an interpreter. </seg>
<seg id=1640> According to these, with a view to setting up an operation, the Political and Security Committee (COPS) may submit a recommendation to the Council on the basis of advice from the Military Committee. </seg>
<seg id=1641> Which taxes does the Council consider to have no bearing on the dynamic and competitive operation of the internal market? </seg>
<seg id=1642> (The sitting was suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.) </seg>
<seg id=1643> Mr President, the report on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement takes account of the new democratic developments in Croatia and highlights the European prospects for this country, which has managed in the course of the past year to achieve its aim of joining the international community of states. </seg>
<seg id=1644> The new Croatian government has not only recognised but actually supports Europe's Balkan policy. </seg>
<seg id=1645> Indeed, that is the precisely the yardstick by which we must measure Croatia's progress towards stabilisation. </seg>
<seg id=1646> There they found their property and possessions in ruins. </seg>
<seg id=1647> So I am delighted that we celebrate the end of the year by launching negotiations with Croatia for a stabilisation and association agreement. </seg>
<seg id=1648> We have a team of officials in Croatia this week to look at programming for next year. </seg>
<seg id=1649> With the start of these negotiations, Croatia has embarked on a new era in its relations with the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1650> The President is also still under fire over the Bulog and Brunei affair. </seg>
<seg id=1651> That sort of violence only stirs up feelings of hatred. </seg>
<seg id=1652> I have in mind sending UN observers to the crisis areas, where action is urgently needed, but also humanitarian relief action if necessary. </seg>
<seg id=1653> These facts can only concern us, and therefore the initial optimism that was so clear in the Commission' s communication should be reconsidered and tempered to some extent. </seg>
<seg id=1654> We can support the democratisation process, as we have been doing; what we cannot do is take the place of the protagonists in this process. </seg>
<seg id=1655> If these efforts should fall short of the mark, then we cannot afford to rule out the possibility of the international community becoming more actively involved. </seg>
<seg id=1656> It is of paramount importance that those guilty of human rights violations are not allowed to get away with it. </seg>
<seg id=1657> We must learn from this year' s experience, which has been a beneficial experience, and give a very powerful signal indicating the change that we want for Indonesia. </seg>
<seg id=1658> It was a recognition by the global community of the legality of the vote in Irian Jaya to become a permanent part of Indonesia and reaffirm United Nations Declaration 1514 of 1960 which prohibits any act aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a country. </seg>
<seg id=1659> That is why we must link development aid to progress in human rights abuses. </seg>
<seg id=1660> I listened with interest to the proposal made by the honourable Member towards the end of our discussion. </seg>
<seg id=1661> I remember having the distinct feeling that this great country was poised somewhere on the high wire between riot and reform and that we would be very lucky if the democratic process produced a government such as the one that has been produced today. </seg>
<seg id=1662> But above all, the legislation must be clearer, to prevent law-breakers from exploiting any loopholes. </seg>
<seg id=1663> The same applies to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1664> We know that the Commission discussed this question at its last meeting, without coming to a decision. </seg>
<seg id=1665> In her speech at the meeting last month of the justice ministers of Germany' s constituent States, Mrs Theato expressly said that the open frontiers facilitate criminal activities. </seg>
<seg id=1666> Fortunately this idea found very little support at Nice last weekend. </seg>
<seg id=1667> We must not forget that 85% of the money is spent within the Member States and we must also not forget that Parliament' s and the Commission's role is to take a pan-European approach to these things. </seg>
<seg id=1668> As Mrs Theato rightly points out in her report, OLAF occupies a crucial position in the Commission's anti-fraud strategy, which is why, and I want to stress that very strongly, the Commission is extremely keen to see this authority built up rapidly. </seg>
<seg id=1669> Reform of budgetary control procedures </seg>
<seg id=1670> So, where are the reforms from these guilty Member States? </seg>
<seg id=1671> Controlling the Commission's management and spending is the main justification for the existence of the European Parliament and the discharge procedure is the chief instrument by which this is done. </seg>
<seg id=1672> This also happens in many reports. </seg>
<seg id=1673> We must name countries, specific cases and institutions; all these things would make it easier to understand. </seg>
<seg id=1674> I hope this obligation will actually be applied if it comes to the crunch. </seg>
<seg id=1675> So let us understand that fraud is not a problem peculiar to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1676> Regarding access to documents for the discharge report, which is indeed an important issue, let me point out that the Commission's point of departure in its activities is the Interinstitutional Agreement reached in July this year, especially Annex 3 on access to confidential information. </seg>
<seg id=1677> Let me point out that I will take the opportunity to discuss these proposals at the next meeting with the Member States' representatives concerned with financial control. </seg>
<seg id=1678> For that simple reason the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I am presenting today includes a whole raft of amendments containing concrete proposals on how these issues could be resolved. </seg>
<seg id=1679> The only way to remedy these weaknesses is by deciding to opt for conciliation here by a majority of 314 votes. </seg>
<seg id=1680> Unfortunately, we believe that some of the proposed amendments do not improve it. </seg>
<seg id=1681> The third block contains those amendments that have been most controversial during the procedure. </seg>
<seg id=1682> Some of the amendments seem to be a covert attempt to introduce some elements of a company statute through the back door. </seg>
<seg id=1683> Mr President, the aim of this report - to establish common rules in Europe on takeover bids - relates only to a tiny minority of large corporations and their major shareholders, who dominate company ownership. </seg>
<seg id=1684> Anyone who wants to avoid such consequences has the opportunity to vote in favour of Amendment No 19, which makes it clear that it is the target company' s head office which counts. </seg>
<seg id=1685> But it should be pointed out that the situation has definitely changed since the first reading. </seg>
<seg id=1686> That is something that everyone in the European Union is going to have to tackle and this takeover directive, in the final form that comes through has to address that issue. </seg>
<seg id=1687> Much to its regret, the Commission is unable to approve the other amendments, and this is for a variety of reasons. </seg>
<seg id=1688> Lastly, the Commission would point out that should this House approve the proposed amendments, it could prove very difficult for an agreement to be reached between the Council and Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1689> It needs to be harmonised because although it already applies in many EU states, it has not so far been recognised in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland or Austria. </seg>
<seg id=1690> In addition, it is in the interests of both Switzerland and the USA to introduce a right of resale once we have adopted a harmonised right of resale in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1691> In addition, setting this type of precedent at a time when the European Union is set to double in size would be to give out the wrong signal to candidate states. </seg>
<seg id=1692> In the very near future we will have to make more effort to seek a dialogue with the collective management firms, we must jointly seek simpler and more transparent structures and ensure that the administrative costs of this directive do not become absurd. </seg>
<seg id=1693> Without an international droit de suite, the fact is that the European art market will go offshore. </seg>
<seg id=1694> I am afraid this leads me to the inevitable conclusion that we do not need this, and that without international agreement in place, it is one piece of internal market legislation that we can do without. </seg>
<seg id=1695> The third and final issue is that of the threshold, which Amendment No 6 brings back down to EUR 1 000 or, in other words, to the Commission' s original proposal. </seg>
<seg id=1696> Madam President, on a point of order. </seg>
<seg id=1697> It is actually scandalous that these are not available in time for our debate. </seg>
<seg id=1698> We in the reporting committee agreed on a compromise, namely that the same weight ceiling should apply to cross-border mail and national mail. </seg>
<seg id=1699> It is also guaranteed that cross-border mail will remain a service reserved for the postal services, and also, if VAT comes to be levied on postal services, that the tax should be levied at a reduced rate so as not to raise the price of stamps in the Community. </seg>
<seg id=1700> Madam President, I welcome the fact that in committee we managed to achieve a balanced compromise on this issue and I hope that Parliament will adopt that position in substance tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id=1701> Our group agrees with the Commissioner and with the Lisbon meeting of the European Council, though not that of Nice, that further steps need to be taken to open the market in postal services. </seg>
<seg id=1702> We also need to make the point made by Mr Jarzembowski: so many studies have been conducted by this Commission, yet we have never seen them. </seg>
<seg id=1703> Some people have said that we have liberalised telecoms and it was not a great problem. </seg>
<seg id=1704> The same holds true for the Netherlands, and when I talk face to face with other people from postal companies, they do not express these concerns either. </seg>
<seg id=1705> By putting operators in competition with each other in the most profitable areas, it would lead to the closure of a large number of post offices, job losses and insecure jobs and would result in social dumping. </seg>
<seg id=1706> They will ensure the economic viability of the rural post office network in my country and in other rural and peripheral parts of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1707> This would be in outright contrast with the goals the European institutions set themselves in Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id=1708> At the same time, it is the country where the highest number of letters are delivered the day after they have been posted. </seg>
<seg id=1709> Madam President, Council, Commissioner, I understand the desires expressed by some of my colleagues for an end-date and for moves towards greater liberalisation. </seg>
<seg id=1710> I do believe that the compromise which is now on the table takes account of the aforementioned criteria, and I am delighted that our rejection of the general liberalisation of express services and cross-border services has now been set down in black and white. </seg>
<seg id=1711> Quite the reverse in fact: the concept of universal services is ideally suited to solve problems encountered in rural areas and areas which are difficult to access, via agreements and, if need be, compensatory funding. </seg>
<seg id=1712> Madam President, allow me to address Mr Simpson. </seg>
<seg id=1713> The costs are not higher than in other countries. </seg>
<seg id=1714> The radical reform which the Commission proposed at the beginning of this year is threatening to turn the clock back by two hundred years. </seg>
<seg id=1715> In spite of this, the Commission chose to ignore the view expressed by the vast majority of Members of this House from various Member States and political groups. </seg>
<seg id=1716> Madam President, the service we are considering faces fierce competition from the new information and communication technologies. </seg>
<seg id=1717> Now, a self-styled 'soft' version of the Commission' s liberalising proposal is offered to us, particularly in connection with the price-weight threshold of 150 instead of 350 grammes. </seg>
<seg id=1718> However, the compromise proposal which was submitted by the two large parties to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism at the eleventh hour and brought about without the help of the Liberal Group, does not accommodate this view. </seg>
<seg id=1719> We have, alongside this, an absolute commitment to the universal service obligation. </seg>
<seg id=1720> All of them are backing Mr Simpson and opposing your party's views on this matter. </seg>
<seg id=1721> There are many possibilities apart from the one-stop shop where all government services are available to the local community, such as e-commerce and the Internet. </seg>
<seg id=1722> Mrs Peijs, this is not a point of order and this is not the correct moment in the debate to make it. </seg>
<seg id=1723> The degree of market opening as now proposed by Parliament would reduce the 20% of the Commission proposals to only 6% from the start of the year 2005, without any prospect of completion of the internal market in the postal sector and that, I am afraid, does not comply with the conclusions of the European Council, nor would it meet the needs and expectations of postal clients, both business users and individual households. </seg>
<seg id=1724> I call upon all of you not to shy away from your responsibility as elected legislators to do what is required and to support a dynamic process of change. </seg>
<seg id=1725> Most of the amendments adopted by Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism would, if accepted, lead to a situation where hardly anything would change. </seg>
<seg id=1726> However, it will not surprise Members of this Parliament that the Commission cannot accept the remaining proposed amendments. </seg>
<seg id=1727> If Members of this Parliament are of the opinion that whatever Heads of State or Government say is of no concern to them, that is not an attitude that I share. </seg>
<seg id=1728> At that time, the Commission proposed maintaining a non-discriminatory, fixed-quota system with a slight rating preference for the ACP countries and the transition to a 'tariff only' system in 2006. </seg>
<seg id=1729> Codecision does not mean that the system is fair, but it means that it is the only method compatible with the rules of the WTO. </seg>
<seg id=1730> These are differences, it is true, but now we are talking a similar language, which is radically different to the one we have used for years. </seg>
<seg id=1731> The Dary report is a difficult and intricate piece of work which is worthy of praise, and has allowed us to unanimously approve a report on a truly complex issue. </seg>
<seg id=1732> Therefore, the proposals in the Dary report, approved unanimously in the Agriculture Committee, refer to the need to take account of the structural problems of these outermost regions, which furthermore have a new legal basis in Article 299(2) of the European Community Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and which is currently awaiting the adoption of the relevant proposals by the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1733> But let us not turn our backs, as is suggested in Amendment No 11, on the idea that we must eventually move to a 'tariff only' system. </seg>
<seg id=1734> Frankly, I believe that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did the best it could, or what was within its power to do, in order to reach an agreement with the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1735> That was the thinking behind the COM in the banana sector, and that is the thinking behind our rapporteur, Mr Dary' s, counter-proposal. </seg>
<seg id=1736> I hope that the Commission will respond positively to the amendments, not with the blanket negative view of the last debate, and will acknowledge that each amendment represents legitimate concerns. </seg>
<seg id=1737> I trust that, with the passing of time, the system of distribution known as the 'regatta' system, in other words, 'first come, first served' , may be accepted by the banana-producing countries. </seg>
<seg id=1738> We must not take that as evidence of unanimity in any way. </seg>
<seg id=1739> It consists of four members of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, presided over by the Honourable Mr Jeymoon Chung. </seg>
<seg id=1740> (The President declared the common position approved) </seg>
<seg id=1741> Recommendation for second reading (A5-0368/2000) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on company law concerning takeover bids [8129/1/2000 - C5-0327/2000 - 1995/0341(COD)] </seg>
<seg id=1742> In this context, the amendment refers to Article 14 of the Berne Convention. </seg>
<seg id=1743> Report (A5-0364/2000) by Mr Baltas, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission report on the feasibility of negotiating a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Croatia [COM(2000) 311 - C5-0506/2000 - 2000/2244(COS)] </seg>
<seg id=1744> Mr President, I should like to inform you that, on 29 September this year, Portugal also ratified this Treaty unanimously. </seg>
<seg id=1745> Of course, if we want to be consistent in our approach, we should put similar warnings on products which are equally harmful to consumers, such as animal fats. </seg>
<seg id=1746> When I voted against the ban on the advertising of tobacco products in 1998, my vote was misconstrued in letters to the editors of Luxembourg newspapers as a vote against the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id=1747> Over 95% of the output of the Southampton plant is exported. </seg>
<seg id=1748> It is preposterous that the tobacco lobby is seeking to destroy this legislation. </seg>
<seg id=1749> It is important to avoid interruption and to proceed with the extension of the existing programmes in the field of public health that expire in the short term, given that their objectives are to complement national policies in protecting human health. </seg>
<seg id=1750> In my opinion, they should be privatised. </seg>
<seg id=1751> There must be more to this world than mere numbers and sterile computers: it must include artists - for as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id=1752> In various Member States, it has transpired that resale right is superfluous and causes distortions on the internal market. </seg>
<seg id=1753> I am concerned for their welfare not only because I have discovered that there is a Russian Pensioners' Party whose symbol is a heart, a red heart, while the symbol of the European People's Party, which I belong to, is a blue heart. </seg>
<seg id=1754> We can, therefore, only condemn the fact that Fanjo Tudjman was not charged before his death, in the same way as Slobodan Milosevic, since the newly opened archives prove the extent to which the two men jointly planned the ethnic dismemberment of the region. </seg>
<seg id=1755> I expelled them from the Pensioners' Party myself, but I do consult them every now and again and ask their advice. </seg>
<seg id=1756> We therefore welcome the Theato report and have voted for the creation of the office of a European Public Prosecutor. </seg>
<seg id=1757> The government's preference is to improve existing cooperation between Member States to tackle fraud and other serious crimes with a cross-border element. </seg>
<seg id=1758> In my constituency I have industries that are being forced out of business. </seg>
<seg id=1759> At the same time, it stresses how important it is for the Commission to listen to the European Parliament and consider the interests of all parties at every stage. </seg>
<seg id=1760> A second subject that has played a part in this debate is that of the reports. </seg>
<seg id=1761> A formal review of the compensatory-aid mechanism is therefore unnecessary, because the current regime permits full compensation for the income effects of price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id=1762> Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to update Parliament on preparations for the EU/US Summit in Washington next Monday. </seg>
<seg id=1763> We have made some progress in moving things in the direction I describe in recent summits and I hope we will be able to take this forward in Washington next week. </seg>
<seg id=1764> This then will be the last summit under this administration, the last such summit with President Clinton. </seg>
<seg id=1765> Another area relates to the aforementioned EU educational centres, which I believe have been highly successful. </seg>
<seg id=1766> Research from the development agency OXFAM has shown that when they have discussed what has changed since Seattle with the developing country delegations, the perceptions are that nothing has changed at all. </seg>
<seg id=1767> On every continent, a petition demanding the abolition of the death penalty is being signed by hundreds of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id=1768> I think I am right in saying that EU/US trade amounts to about EUR 1billion a day and the total worth of the sanctions applied by the United States against European goods represents about six hours' worth of trade. </seg>
<seg id=1769> Mr President, I shall just take a moment, with your permission. </seg>
<seg id=1770> The proposal which the Commission has referred to Parliament has, in my opinion, a priority objective: to remedy the discriminatory situation currently suffered by European e-commerce companies in comparison to companies from third countries. </seg>
<seg id=1771> Consequently, services provided by European companies to non-European companies would always be exempt from the tax, which would revive our international competitiveness. </seg>
<seg id=1772> Thirdly, and this I do agree with, the need - within the international framework of the ICAO - to make all the progress necessary to establish a tax which is world-wide, and therefore not discriminatory, on Community transport. </seg>
<seg id=1773> They disadvantage people inside the EU because they currently pay VAT for the supply of these services whereas those outside the European Union do not. </seg>
<seg id=1774> It may not be enough to rely on the good will of enterprises outside our reach. </seg>
<seg id=1775> Add to this the unruly increase in the number of flights, including short-haul flights, and the question arises as to where all of this will end. In business and leisure travel alike, people must be able to choose on the basis of honest competitive conditions. </seg>
<seg id=1776> The question arising here is whether VAT is levied when such items are the subject of a service which is provided electronically. </seg>
<seg id=1777> We are already familiar with the problems in the domains of VAT and energy taxes. </seg>
<seg id=1778> It is both an excellent and necessary ambition. </seg>
<seg id=1779> Mr President, I believe that the successive interventions of our fellow MEPs in the Liberal Group show the complexity of the problem. </seg>
<seg id=1780> Therefore, point 16 of the report concerning the renegotiation of the Convention is particularly welcome. </seg>
<seg id=1781> We would prefer a simpler levy on retail goods. </seg>
<seg id=1782> The sixth VAT directive must be simplified; if any limit is to be imposed at all on VAT rates, it should be an upper limit and certainly not a prescribed minimum. </seg>
<seg id=1783> The right to levy taxes and other charges is one of the foundations of any organised society. </seg>
<seg id=1784> American local sales tax may vary between zero and ten points, although the difference between neighbouring states is generally no more than five points. </seg>
<seg id=1785> Furthermore, it is not true that a moratorium on the taxation of electronic services has been introduced in the United States. </seg>
<seg id=1786> The main reason for this is the fact that different regions have different rules for night flying, a situation which affects cargo transport in particular. </seg>
<seg id=1787> I think that the real problem is that EU retail industries will continue to suffer the disadvantages that they are currently suffering. </seg>
<seg id=1788> Mr President, I wish to address my concerns this afternoon to the proposed taxation on aircraft fuel. </seg>
<seg id=1789> There are those, like Mr Titford, who vigorously defend their own national interest, preferring tax competition to European coordination. </seg>
<seg id=1790> If this can provide the basis for a compromise, it will probably be a good compromise as long as it is not used to reintroduce distortion of competition due to the different VAT rates applicable in our various Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1791> By focusing our attention too narrowly on only the activities which take place within the EU, we risk harming our industry without achieving much-needed progress in lowering emissions. </seg>
<seg id=1792> I believe we must ensure that no competitive disadvantages are incurred within Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1793> I would especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for his contribution and for the positive ideas which were put forward in his report. </seg>
<seg id=1794> As usual, we need to ensure that the solution we opt for does not give cause for concern outside the Community with regard to discrimination against suppliers who are not based in the Community. </seg>
<seg id=1795> However, it should also be pointed out that the current climate, where the conditions are not favourable for achieving further harmonisation of VAT rates in the short term, makes meaningful progress in the near future very unlikely. </seg>
<seg id=1796> A resolution issued by the general meeting of the ICAO which paves the way for an internal solution to the issue of tax on aircraft fuel or the use of other instruments with equivalent effects would be a crucial first step in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id=1797> It is obvious that one State of the Union on its own cannot have any real influence on maritime transport across the world and, on the other hand, the International Maritime Organisation is too slow and lacks effective means to adequately monitor the rules which it lays down. </seg>
<seg id=1798> Thus the Commission' s priority is to try to resolve these two problems, and the solution we propose is to supplement the existing funds through the creation of a European fund financed by the oil companies, which would offer the victims quick compensation of up to EUR 1 000 million, instead of the EUR 200 million - USD 180 million - currently granted by the international authorities. </seg>
<seg id=1799> If you tell us that experience has shown the voluntary fund to be inadequate, which would be unfortunate, we shall then try to sort out this issue. </seg>
<seg id=1800> Even the countries which have a lesser degree of safety with regard to their ships have some ships which are safe; therefore, in accordance with international laws, we cannot exclude them a priori. </seg>
<seg id=1801> Regarding the Erika II package, I shall confine myself to one question in the form of an observation, although there are so many to be made! </seg>
<seg id=1802> Provided that the implementation aspects of the charge in question do not introduce indirect discrimination either and they respect all other relevant specific rules governing the introduction of user charges in the European Union, such a charge seems at this stage to be in line with current Community law, that is Directive 1999/62/EC. </seg>
<seg id=1803> I have set out in the Commission's response the principles and the criteria and assured Parliament that the Commission will analyse and follow closely the development of the UK scheme, including its implementation in practice, and of course the absence of any discrimination be it direct or indirect will be a crucial reference point in such an assessment. </seg>
<seg id=1804> Mr President, given the evolution of the situation within the European Community, the Commission is writing to third countries drawing their attention to the measures taken in relation to BSE within the European Union and alerting them to the need to consider similar measures. </seg>
<seg id=1805> Subject: EU funding for the Palestinian education system It appears that a large number of school books issued by the Palestinian Authority contain anti-Semitic statements and incitement to hatred of Jews that would result in prosecution for 'incitement to racial hatred' , in any EU Member State. </seg>
<seg id=1806> Those are a few passages from the Palestinian schoolbooks used to teach children in the territories, an education service, moreover, which we ourselves are funding to a large extent. </seg>
<seg id=1807> That starts with the young people. </seg>
<seg id=1808> Mr Patten, sitting alongside him, must have been squirming when he heard that answer, because in the previous question we heard a great lecture on respect for human rights. </seg>
<seg id=1809> The report concludes, inter alia, that the aid received by our industry has not solved the Korean issue. </seg>
<seg id=1810> On a multilateral level, the Commission will pursue its efforts to establish a level international playing field for the shipbuilding industry within the OECD. </seg>
<seg id=1811> The Commission report has established that, as operating aid has not been helpful in solving the problems created by unfair Korean competition, we decided not to prolong those operating aids. </seg>
<seg id=1812> There are therefore unlikely to be harmful effects on employment and competition in the coke-using industry. </seg>
<seg id=1813> I shall answer both questions at the same time. </seg>
<seg id=1814> We are therefore prepared to monitor the effects of this initiative and its results very carefully and to examine, if need be together with the ACP States, the measures which might be required in order to preserve their competitive position in the Community' s markets. </seg>
<seg id=1815> The initiative is not therefore of a kind which will destabilise the highly protected Community sugar market. </seg>
<seg id=1816> As my colleague Bill Newton-Dunn said, we have a number of colleagues in the UK who are indulging in fairly standard if facile anti-European scaremongering on this proposal and they have got a large number of sugarbeet farmers extremely worried. </seg>
<seg id=1817> Programmes like Stop and Daphne have been earmarked by the Commission to allow child sex tourism to be fought as a form of sexual exploitation of children and violence against children in the candidate countries too. </seg>
<seg id=1818> The second area is technology. </seg>
<seg id=1819> I should like to point out that Munich is situated in the heart of Europe and is also very accessible. </seg>
<seg id=1820> If Mr MacCormick means a functional proliferation of courts of justice, I can see his point of view. </seg>
<seg id=1821> Those contacts have been successful to the extent that, over the past year, another three Member States have submitted their lists with courts of first and second instance for the Community trade mark. </seg>
<seg id=1822> Subject: Thessaloniki underground rail system After more than eight years, the Thessaloniki underground rail system - an infrastructure project designed to promote the sustainable economic development of the city - still unfortunately exists only on paper in the 2nd CSF, the local newspapers and the Ministry for the Environment, Regional Planning and Public Works. </seg>
<seg id=1823> What I want from you is a specific date by which you will reply to me, together with your interpretation of the European Investment Bank's action and whether its present refusal to fund the project is due to the fact that the project is currently bogged down at the Commission - this too is an accusation which you have not investigated. </seg>
<seg id=1824> If this is the case, then I thank you for that. </seg>
<seg id=1825> The directives apply to professions which do not fall within one particular directive. </seg>
<seg id=1826> obtaining a EU subsidy to support the unprofitable regional traffic network, </seg>
<seg id=1827> What is clear is that future action will include an examination of infrastructure across the narrows of the Gulf of Bothnia and therefore I am confident that due consideration will be taken of the situation faced by the ferry services. </seg>
<seg id=1828> Owing to the fast-changing nature of this sector, the EU needs to take immediate and concrete measures since the new communication technologies are already generating demand for content, products and services as well as having considerable social impact. </seg>
<seg id=1829> My reasoning is that I believe there is a greater potential for public/private partnerships as there is a huge commercial value to be exploited on the market in the interest both of companies and citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1830> In implementing the programme, I therefore want us to have a requirement for a definition of what may constitute digital content. </seg>
<seg id=1831> Although linguistic differences might mean extra costs, multilingual content is an important precondition of democracy in the EU. </seg>
<seg id=1832> We should actively seek such cooperation and develop joint strategies with the applicant countries. </seg>
<seg id=1833> The stumbling blocks of modern technology and the possible need to communicate in a foreign language can now be more easily overcome. </seg>
<seg id=1834> I also want to say how important it is for citizens of the European Union to be able to develop professionally, socially and culturally and how important it is to avoid, in this area, the creation of that digital divide to which we refer so often in our debates. </seg>
<seg id=1835> The budget proposed by the Commission is EUR 150 m over five years. </seg>
<seg id=1836> Thank you very much for your attention. </seg>
<seg id=1837> If a group would like to vote against, it has of course every right to do so, but we must also give others the opportunity to vote in favour and let the democratic process run its course. </seg>
<seg id=1838> The Commission now estimates that one in every three Europeans complains about noise. </seg>
<seg id=1839> The Environmental Committee has criticised the European Commission' s hesitation to propose EU noise standards. </seg>
<seg id=1840> As far as legislation is concerned, I would, however, like to prioritise and, initially, to opt for regulation of noise around airports. </seg>
<seg id=1841> The harmonisation of noise-measurement procedures and the production of action plans by the Member States are good things but are not enough to satisfy us. </seg>
<seg id=1842> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many citizens of the European Union for whom quality of life is just a mirage. </seg>
<seg id=1843> It is our duty as MEPs and as a European institution to do something about this. </seg>
<seg id=1844> But this mechanism is of no use, since, unfortunately, people do not sleep siestas all year in Spain and it is not even slept in the whole of Spain. </seg>
<seg id=1845> We have no intention whatsoever of pulling a fast one on the House. </seg>
<seg id=1846> We must know the precise levels at which exposure starts to harm people in the long and short term. </seg>
<seg id=1847> That is what we should be doing and how we should be handling it. </seg>
<seg id=1848> A particular problem is the noise around airports. </seg>
<seg id=1849> To conclude I would like to thank European Parliament for the detailed consideration it has given to this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been contributed. </seg>
<seg id=1850> According to all the scientific literature and the Scientific Committee for Human Food, this additive is innocuous, but it has a laxative effect which is considered to be negligible in the small quantity ingested. </seg>
<seg id=1851> We would not ask for peeled and cut carrots to be plunged into alginate, and support the rapporteur in his amendment. </seg>
<seg id=1852> In anticipation of the Council's discussion of the matter, the Commission has chosen to withdraw permission for the use of ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose. </seg>
<seg id=1853> Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that approval of the joint draft text will guarantee us a win tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id=1854> Furthermore, the results of the inspections will be imparted to the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1855> The PPE-DE Group supports the compromise that has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id=1856> But, anyway, the idea of sustainable urban development has grown into something significant in just the last few years. </seg>
<seg id=1857> There are many rural parts of the European Union that need to be developed and sustained in a positive manner. </seg>
<seg id=1858> One major challenge in creating an urban policy is to find the means of pursuing sustainable urban development objectives within the administrative structure of the city. </seg>
<seg id=1859> It is often in the municipalities and towns that they are most aware of their own problems. </seg>
<seg id=1860> Accordingly, we are strongly in favour of the establishment of a platform of dialogue with the key stakeholders to help determine the priority themes to be supported. </seg>
<seg id=1861> So, to conclude, the Commission can fully accept Amendments Nos 2, 5 to 8, 10 to 13, 15, 16, 18 to 20, 22 to 24, 28, 30, 32 to 35 and 37. </seg>
<seg id=1862> In order to explain the result I should like our Parliament to arrive at, I should like this evening quickly to underline two key aspects of this debate. </seg>
<seg id=1863> The European Union' s ambition is to guarantee its citizens a high level of protection where their health and the environment are concerned. </seg>
<seg id=1864> After all, let us remind ourselves that BSE was brought to public attention through a minority report. </seg>
<seg id=1865> We must avoid unknown risks. </seg>
<seg id=1866> It is a very positive sign that the Council text says that it considers that the WTO rules basically allow for account to be taken of the precautionary principle, and further that it calls on Member States and the Commission to ensure that, and I quote, "the precautionary principle is fully recognised in all trade fora to pursue that aim and ensure that it is taken into account at the same time, particularly at the World Trade Organisation". </seg>
<seg id=1867> Mr President, as the rapporteur points out very effectively, the cautionary or precautionary principle - even though the rapporteur differentiates between the two - is laid down in several international agreements, ranging from Rio 1992, to the protection of the North Sea and, more recently, in the Montreal Biosecurity Protocol. </seg>
<seg id=1868> Mrs Patrie' s opinion that the EU must clarify its stance on the precautionary principle, has my unqualified support. </seg>
<seg id=1869> By establishing clearly when and how the precautionary principle should be applied, it clarifies its use at a European level, making it more credible, and it mandates the European negotiators in the next round of the World Trade Organisation to inscribe the precautionary principle as basic and universal. </seg>
<seg id=1870> It is just a shame that it is not the scientific community but the internal market that controls what is released onto the market. </seg>
<seg id=1871> I also think that far too much emphasis is placed on the assessment of a matter by experts, toxicologists and economists. </seg>
<seg id=1872> We now examine how this resolution should be followed up. </seg>
<seg id=1873> To conclude, I would like to thank Parliament for its support in addressing this issue. </seg>
<seg id=1874> That is also why Parliament sides with your struggle. </seg>
<seg id=1875> Our organisation includes teachers and workers, public employees and private individuals, religious and lay people, trade unionists, businesspeople, militant pacifists, artists, people working in the media, very well-known individuals and many who are completely unknown. </seg>
<seg id=1876> There is daily extortion of traders and professional people, there are countless forms of harassment and threats against people considered to be 'españolistas' , that is to say, those who dare to publicly express their support for the rule of law that has come into force by constitutional means. </seg>
<seg id=1877> We shall now proceed to the signing of the budget. </seg>
<seg id=1878> I. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 on administrative cooperation in the field of indirect taxation (VAT) (COM(2000) 349 - C5-0298/2000 - 2000/0147(COD)), and </seg>
<seg id=1879> Instead of what is suggested by the words "of producers and artists, especially from the non profit-making sector", my primary intention was that we should include in this circle representatives of content providers. </seg>
<seg id=1880> Report (A5-0352/2000) by Mrs Patrie, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication on the precautionary principle (COM(2000) 1 - C5­0143/2000 - 2000/2086(COS)) </seg>
<seg id=1881> At the second reading of the budget, Parliament has just approved the full reinstatement to the Cohesion Fund budget line of EUR 360 million, which it had placed in reserve on the first reading. </seg>
<seg id=1882> The gravity of the situation has led our group to table a number of amendments highlighting the importance of earmarking the necessary funds for standardising screening tests and for compensation for them, as well as for massive aid to the cattle industry, which has been severely affected. </seg>
<seg id=1883> Here in Parliament we take every suitable opportunity, as well as some unsuitable opportunities, to adopt resolutions about the reunification of families. Yet we want to tear the families of our own officials apart, especially those in the D, C and B grades, who cannot afford expensive removals and all the other financial burdens such moves entail, on the basis of the spurious argument that we have to cut costs in this particular way. </seg>
<seg id=1884> However, the need for a long-term solution for future budget years remains. </seg>
<seg id=1885> Staes report (A5-0372/2000) </seg>
<seg id=1886> Moreover, we must break the tendency to import American incongruities into Europe in this area as in other areas. </seg>
<seg id=1887> We also consider it unjustifiable that countries in the EU compete in Sweden' s postal market, for example, when they are not prepared to allow competition in their own markets. </seg>
<seg id=1888> We are not asking Sweden to change its system, but we certainly do not want it to impose its system on us. </seg>
<seg id=1889> The compromise takes account of my amendment to this effect, which means that I can endorse the report with a clear conscience at this first reading. </seg>
<seg id=1890> I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report. </seg>
<seg id=1891> However, we are happy to see inter-state solutions in this area. </seg>
<seg id=1892> We must have the courage to continue to protect those areas of the European Union - and I refer in particular to the most remote areas such as the Canary Islands and other areas - which earn their livelihood from banana production and which need and have the right to be protected by the Union as a whole, including the States who do not produce bananas. </seg>
<seg id=1893> Exactly eight months ago, this House sent a very clear message to the Commission: the adoption of a wholly tariff-based system after a transitional period of six years would inevitably condemn banana producers within the Community and those from the ACP to bankruptcy and misery. </seg>
<seg id=1894> We must avoid lending any support to content which goes against the said interests. </seg>
<seg id=1895> This proposal for a Council decision is in line with the action intended to improve the networks of knowledge in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1896> We have already heard vivid examples in this Parliament of separatist Members who would rather speak in English than in the official language of their Member State. </seg>
<seg id=1897> It should, however, be emphasised that the strong endorsement of EU enlargement, highlighted by Amendment 1, which was adopted, I wholeheartedly subscribe to. </seg>
<seg id=1898> The Heads of State and Government locked themselves into short-term haggling, without any great vision of Europe' s future. </seg>
<seg id=1899> Germany will therefore find it easier than the others to reach the blocking threshold, by adding a few smaller countries to its sphere of influence. </seg>
<seg id=1900> On this point, too, we believe that a satisfactory result has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id=1901> That is natural. </seg>
<seg id=1902> The Nice Summit has sadly become known as a further step in the militarisation of the European Union and as a major threat to the sovereignty of the small- and medium-sized countries like Portugal, which, in general, are losing power and the ability to influence decisions. </seg>
<seg id=1903> This was domestic politicking for the sake of a forthcoming election. </seg>
<seg id=1904> We cannot, however, ignore the fact that the solutions found for the complex decision-making system in the Council and the corresponding vote weighting increase the gap between the more and the less highly populated states, which is something we regard as less positive because of our concept of a Europe of sovereign nations. </seg>
<seg id=1905> We therefore oppose the principal orientation of the Treaty of Nice and will vote against it. </seg>
<seg id=1906> Flying used to be expensive. </seg>
<seg id=1907> 'Oh no, God forbid! </seg>
<seg id=1908> For that reason, we should endorse the call for the responsible authorities at national, regional and local levels to ensure, by their own efforts and with the aid of all available EU support mechanisms, that the same terms and conditions are created throughout the EU for the acquisition of modern information technology by educational establishments. </seg>
<seg id=1909> We must avoid being too prescriptive and thus putting up artificial barriers which would prevent us reaching our goals. </seg>
<seg id=1910> There is a passage in Mr Markov' s draft, Commissioner, which I would like you to take into account and which says, and with this I shall end: "suggests likewise, given the scant budgetary allocation set aside for innovatory measures, that the Commission encourage the incorporation of this type of project in the regional operational programmes" . </seg>
<seg id=1911> We should spell that out very clearly. </seg>
<seg id=1912> Finally, may I too congratulate Mr Markov and wish everyone a Merry Christmas and an Innovative New Year. </seg>
<seg id=1913> We fought hard to keep the innovative measures within the new round of structural fund programmes and I am really pleased that we are here today, both confirming this and the EUR 3 million that is going to be available through agreeing the new guidelines. </seg>
<seg id=1914> Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to another aspect of the new policy proposed by the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1915> So these are the priorities. </seg>
<seg id=1916> However, I understand that this concern needs to be coordinated with other instruments, especially - as you suggested earlier Mr Markov - with the European Social Fund. </seg>
<seg id=1917> I am also positive that, even with these necessarily limited sums, we may still exercise a significant leverage effect and impact on all the Structural Funds programmes. </seg>
<seg id=1918> We in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomed the fact that the European Commission has taken steps to have the issue resolved by means of a dispute-settlement procedure before the World Trade Organisation. </seg>
<seg id=1919> The conclusions seem quite clear that the principal culprit is predatory pricing from the Korean shipbuilding industry. </seg>
<seg id=1920> What we are calling for, what I am calling for today is the full and - more importantly - the immediate application of the Council's conclusions. </seg>
<seg id=1921> And I do not believe that we are exaggerating because the different workers' groups have been claiming that over recent years thousands and thousands of jobs have been lost as a result of the restructuring of the shipbuilding industry. </seg>
<seg id=1922> I would like to thank Mr Langen for his work and hope that we do not have a re-run of the same debate at the end of next year. </seg>
<seg id=1923> But as soon as the capitalist groups whose interests they defend are in trouble on the markets, they call for governments or the European institutions to intervene, subsidise and protect the sector under threat. </seg>
<seg id=1924> There is a crisis in the fishing industry, and we Spaniards and Galicians know that only too well. </seg>
<seg id=1925> In reality, there are limited instruments available to the Commission and Member States in order to defend the EU shipbuilding industry. </seg>
<seg id=1926> Industry should seriously reflect about how these instruments can be used to adapt their activities in a way which will ensure the future of the sector on a lasting basis. </seg>
<seg id=1927> I do not think there is any need to add anything to what Mr Galeote has just said other than to assure him of our support and solidarity and I agree that, in future, we need to look at ways in which we can perhaps assist our colleagues in Spain. </seg>
<seg id=1928> But the director of the hospital did not authorise the admission. </seg>
<seg id=1929> Let us not wait any longer. </seg>
<seg id=1930> I can assure you that it was not due to a lack of will on the part of my Group. </seg>
<seg id=1931> After visits to the submarine by Spanish nuclear safety experts, we have heard that there is no danger, but we have had later statements indicating that they were not allowed to see, observe or inspect the actual site of the fault. </seg>
<seg id=1932> When I became a Commissioner I swore an oath to be completely independent in the performance of my duties in the general interest of the Communities, to neither seek nor take instructions from any government or from any other body in the performance of my duties. </seg>
<seg id=1933> The intervention plan is "drawn up by the interested parties, which include the British Ministry of Defence, the Gibraltar Government and the emergency services and is issued by the Chief Officer, Gibraltar City Fire Brigade, and the Commander of British Forces, on behalf of the Gibraltar Local Liaison Committee. </seg>
<seg id=1934> One might well ask whether the government of the United Kingdom has exercised its responsibility in that regard to keep its defence equipment properly maintained, and indeed whether people in the UK are aware that, because of this incident, and the withdrawal of other nuclear submarines, our shores are currently being defended - rumour has it - by a U-boat from Germany. </seg>
<seg id=1935> I felt, listening to the Commissioner's excellent report, growing confidence that the matter is being handled in the proper way. </seg>
<seg id=1936> But I must still point out that, however worrying, this affair also has its amusing side and, if nothing else, illustrates the current state of Europe, the Europe of Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1937> On the one hand we have a government with no connections to the armed forces and with a card-carrying member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, using the armed forces as a political tool to further its ambitions in Europe and apparently realising rather too late that the European Union defence scheme would indeed damage the NATO alliance and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id=1938> I am not being alarmist, I am not against nuclear energy, I would never defend, as I believe nobody in Spain would, the idea of a submarine being moved at any cost if that meant an increased risk, but it is not in the spirit of European democracies, nor of the European Union Treaty, for decisions to be taken which jeopardise human safety and cause a population to be put at risk for the sake of greater technical, budgetary and diplomatic comfort. </seg>
<seg id=1939> Repairing a submarine in situ remains by far the safest option available: towing it would not only be dangerous but would, in any event, require considerable repairs to be done beforehand. </seg>
<seg id=1940> The important thing at the moment is to ensure that we are provided with good, transparent information, with a sufficient scientific basis, on the scope and consequences of the repairs, and that there be a serious study of the possibilities and risks involved in a possible removal of the submarine, if that becomes necessary. </seg>
<seg id=1941> B5-0921/2000 by Muscardini and Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group; </seg>
<seg id=1942> At the same time, fewer and fewer countries are abiding by the agreements of the Geneva Convention. </seg>
<seg id=1943> The UNHCR is currently helping 5 million displaced persons and some 11.5 million refugees. </seg>
<seg id=1944> The Commission and the UNHCR therefore demonstrated, on 6 July, the strengthening of their partnership on asylum and refugees through an exchange of letters between Commissioner Vitorino and Mrs Ogata. </seg>
<seg id=1945> That is why I am extremely keen to see appropriate changes made in our new financial regulation to ensure that we can support programming so that UN bodies and other similar organisations can be sure some time in advance of a flow of funds to support work we are doing in common and to which we both attach priority. </seg>
<seg id=1946> B5-0920/2000 by Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group; </seg>
<seg id=1947> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on 25 December - Christmas Day - of last year, three prominent Albanian Kosovars started a three-week hunger strike in Brussels to bring to the attention of the international community the fate of these prisoners and especially of the many thousands of missing persons. </seg>
<seg id=1948> For all our delight at the changes in Belgrade, we still have to press for the earliest possible release of these victims. </seg>
<seg id=1949> What we need now are concrete steps to reach lasting peace. </seg>
<seg id=1950> Despite this, many Kosovar Albanians remain in prison in Serbia and there remain many missing Kosovar Albanians and Serbs whom the ICRC is still attempting to trace. </seg>
<seg id=1951> B5-0930/2000 by Di Pietro, on behalf of the ELDR Group, </seg>
<seg id=1952> B5-0936/2000 by Gemelli, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group; </seg>
<seg id=1953> The only thing we can do here is to support the Chilean Government at this time and, taking advantage of the presence of Commissioner Patten, to ask him, as the previous speaker, Mr Salafranca, did, for a new agreement to be sought with Chile which will help continue to strengthen democracy in that country. </seg>
<seg id=1954> We are happy that the situation has now changed. </seg>
<seg id=1955> Turkey </seg>
<seg id=1956> But it is also true that the hunger strike is taking place at a time when reforms are under way in the Turkish regime, and specifically in the area of prison policy. </seg>
<seg id=1957> May I also take this occasion to say that it is, of course, not only a matter of there being too many political prisoners - the fact that a country applying for membership of the European Union has any political prisoners at all merits outright condemnation - but that we are also aware of the way in which the existing prisons and the conditions that prevail within them have led to various criminal activities emanating from Turkish prisons. </seg>
<seg id=1958> This is no longer a question of attacks on the freedom of expression, association or assembly; now, freedom of movement, freedom of speech and the freedom to receive persons of one's choice are difficult to exercise in Tunisia. </seg>
<seg id=1959> The spokesman of the Tunisian National Council for Liberties, Professor Moncef Marzouki, is due to appear in court this week, on 16 December, and risks ten years in prison. </seg>
<seg id=1960> We in liberal camps are very concerned at this development. </seg>
<seg id=1961> However, this requires Tunisia to respect agreements entered into, including those which encompass clauses on human rights. </seg>
<seg id=1962> Any meeting, any gathering, such as the national conference organised by the Tunisian National Council for Liberties on 10 December, is effectively banned due to police violence. </seg>
<seg id=1963> The Commission is, and always has been, fully committed to respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights and that is why the Commission has lent substantial and tangible support to the process of transition to democracy in Chile. </seg>
<seg id=1964> Although I would not want to downplay it, the situation, despite being serious, does not appear to be out of control and there is some concern that outside interference could harm the chances of the two sides reaching some form of negotiated settlement. </seg>
<seg id=1965> Whatever the economic progress made, whatever the social progress in Tunisia, I know that Parliament will return to its concerns on these subjects as long as it has reason to express them. </seg>
<seg id=1966> We were delighted, Commissioner, at the departure of General Guei. </seg>
<seg id=1967> The traumatic events that have occurred there are a clear demonstration of the process of degradation that the whole of the African continent is experiencing. </seg>
<seg id=1968> That is exactly what has happened also in the Côte d'Ivoire, and in an even grosser way, as I understand it. </seg>
<seg id=1969> It is to France's credit that it is supporting its partners and allies in this healthy development. </seg>
<seg id=1970> The vote will be taken in a few minutes. </seg>
<seg id=1971> In that case, ladies and gentlemen, it is confirmed that the draft resolutions mentioned by Mr Wurtz have been withdrawn, and therefore this vote lapses. </seg>
<seg id=1972> I deeply regret that the French Government has not appealed to the Court of Justice against the European Parliament decision, but I have no doubt that this decision will be overturned sooner or later. </seg>
<seg id=1973> The next item is the report (A5-0319/2000) by Mrs Sbarbati, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication 'Towards a Europe for all ages - promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity' . </seg>
<seg id=1974> This approach must include the guarantee of a dignified, independent, self-sufficient lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id=1975> The solidarity of different age groups and actors involved in this field is vital in this regard. </seg>
<seg id=1976> Over the past decade in Central and Eastern Europe, we have seen a fall in life expectancy as soon as governments have withdrawn and left elderly people to their fate. </seg>
<seg id=1977> In the next few decades, an ageing and greying population will emerge, caused by a falling birth rate and an increase in life expectancy. </seg>
<seg id=1978> Here, too, individualism has taken its toll. </seg>
<seg id=1979> And the worker, who has given everything to society, has to sell his house to pay for healthcare, to use up all his money and to see his family reduced to scrimping and saving, at the very moment when one would expect the State and other people to be supportive, during the last years of one's life, when everything looks black and the only ray of light is the help of one's neighbour. </seg>
<seg id=1980> The communication needs to clarify the problem of the increased cost of services from new medical technologies which create new forms of inequality in the face of illness and death. </seg>
<seg id=1981> Almost all of the speakers have mentioned the "ageing workforce". </seg>
<seg id=1982> Consequently, I can only be delighted, today, at the issue of this communication and this report aimed at building a Europe for all ages and promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity. </seg>
<seg id=1983> Mrs Flemming has rightly pointed out that it is positive that people are able to live for longer and at the same time stay healthy. </seg>
<seg id=1984> As part of efforts to combat discrimination on the basis of Articles 13 and 137 of the Treaty, there is a campaign for measures to be introduced to ensure that older people are no longer excluded from the workplace, which is actually saying that the obligatory age limit and also compulsory early retirement are discriminatory. </seg>
<seg id=1985> Mr President, my father, Robert Purvis, is 90 and not too well just now. </seg>
<seg id=1986> Concerns about closing the age gap in Europe's performance balance sheet have been reflected very strongly in the employment process, from the guidelines to the recommendations to the NLP and peer review procedures. </seg>
<seg id=1987> In fact it is a precondition for our ability to find sufficient resources for those in need of care, so that the wealthy amongst us are willing and able to pay higher contributions and become more independent in old age. </seg>
<seg id=1988> The next item is the report (A5-0385/2000) by Mr Dary, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion for agricultural products on the internal market. </seg>
<seg id=1989> A coherent product promotion policy is one of the tools making it possible to put European farm models into practice effectively. </seg>
<seg id=1990> We need to emphasise the European aspects to the general public. </seg>
<seg id=1991> I believe that here too there is scope for us to take action with agricultural products. </seg>
<seg id=1992> And while such campaigns may achieve the desired objectives in relation to consumers, we must not for all that underestimate the concomitant impact they will have on the producers themselves, who will see them as a reward for their efforts and an incentive to continue them. </seg>
<seg id=1993> A simple truth, if people are now saying that we could not guarantee calf feed because there was no milk replacer feed, is that calves drink milk. </seg>
