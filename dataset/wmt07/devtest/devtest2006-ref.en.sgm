<DOC docid="devtest2006" sysid="ref">
<seg id=1> We know all too well that the present Treaties are inadequate and that the Union will need a better and different structure in future, a more constitutional structure which clearly distinguishes the powers of the Member States and those of the Union. </seg>
<seg id=2> These are, first and foremost, messages of concern at the economic and social problems that we are experiencing, in spite of a period of sustained growth stemming from years of efforts by all our fellow citizens. </seg>
<seg id=3> The current situation, which is intolerable, particularly for many independent haulage firms and for agriculture, does in any case need to be improved. </seg>
<seg id=4> An agreement on procedures in itself is a good thing, but we must make sure that the system cannot be used as a political weapon. </seg>
<seg id=5> They too now have a clear idea of the rights which they have to respect. </seg>
<seg id=6> I agree with him on the need to guard against a return to intergovernmental methods, which some find appealing. </seg>
<seg id=7> There are many of us who want a federation of nation states, which means that each state must find the position that best suits it. </seg>
<seg id=8> The rapporteurs have already stressed the quality of the debate and the need to progress further, and I can only agree with them. </seg>
<seg id=9> In reply, I would say that, before making a speech, one must identify all the major factors at work, familiarise oneself with them and weigh them up, for political discourse must always be realistic, respond to the real weight of the forces at work and relate to the aims we all set ourselves. </seg>
<seg id=10> I would like us to use closer cooperation to generate fresh potential for Europe. </seg>
<seg id=11> The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m. </seg>
<seg id=12> The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12. </seg>
<seg id=13> I will vote to approve the draft regulation. </seg>
<seg id=14> Indeed, the reports of the European Court of Auditors continually comment on understating of this type, from Greece to Portugal. </seg>
<seg id=15> We did not, consequently, vote in favour of this report. </seg>
<seg id=16> According to those in favour, such buses are not only cheaper and internationally deployable, they are also more environmentally-friendly because they use less fuel per passenger. </seg>
<seg id=17> He also calls for benchmarking to spread best practice across the EU. </seg>
<seg id=18> A binding and all-embracing charter with completely legally enforceable rights could result in difficulties at a later stage. </seg>
<seg id=19> I would thank both of them for their magnificent efforts. </seg>
<seg id=20> We do not, however, believe that the latter can be concluded in Nice in less than three months, for which reason alone we cannot vote in favour of incorporating the Charter into the Treaty at the Nice Summit. </seg>
<seg id=21> The CSU's Europe group welcomes the tabling of the final draft of the Charter of Fundamental Rights because it summarises and makes visible the fundamental rights which the public are entitled to in respect of the institutions and bodies of the EU. </seg>
<seg id=22> It is an accurate reflection of the liberal Europe which is being built. </seg>
<seg id=23> I would indeed have like to have seen a moratorium on this Charter to enable work to continue on it, as a great many non-governmental organisations in the various countries of the European Union have proposed. </seg>
<seg id=24> (A5-0248/2000) by Mr Queiró on Hungary (COM(1999) 505 - C5-0028/2000 - 1997/2175(COS)); </seg>
<seg id=25> That is why I should like to propose to you that from next year we in Parliament no longer present a general report at all but only country reports, to make it clear that we wish to see the negotiations proceed at differentiated paces. </seg>
<seg id=26> I feel, then, that on the basis of the work undertaken by previous presidencies and by the Commission, the French Presidency will be in a position, or so I hope, at least, to offer a quite precise overview of the accession process at the European Council in Nice. </seg>
<seg id=27> I have said, and I have no problem saying it again here today, that the French Presidency will not duck any of the problems that are raised. This does not, of course, mean that we shall have the time and resources to deal with each of them. </seg>
<seg id=28> This is, of course, a perfectly legitimate question, but it is one that must be answered quite properly and precisely. </seg>
<seg id=29> Enlargement is a wide-ranging goal which we must approach with a great deal of generosity and with vision. </seg>
<seg id=30> A specific outcome is needed from the Intergovernmental Conference if we are to do justice to the tremendous pressure for adaptation. </seg>
<seg id=31> The second major change which we are witnessing and to which Europe must adjust is the meteoric speed at which the economy is moving towards a global market and global competition. </seg>
<seg id=32> Fourthly: this results in another principle whereby the countries which joined later have a fair chance of catching up with those that began earlier. </seg>
<seg id=33> Where major, long-term investments are needed in order to attain EU standards, we must bear in mind that even the present members claimed long transitional periods in such cases. </seg>
<seg id=34> Border security and the fight against crime will also be governed by our standards and will benefit from European cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=35> Let us examine the trade flows between the European Union and the Central and Eastern European countries. </seg>
<seg id=36> I was pleased that the Commissioner at long last started to dispel the aforementioned fears of the people. </seg>
<seg id=37> But one point is clear - and I welcome the fact that Mr Verheugen has underlined this once more: there can be no transitional period for complying with democratic rules. </seg>
<seg id=38> We need the Commission's help here, because even though we have the will, we sometimes lack the ammunition. </seg>
<seg id=39> This is vital for us, the European Union, in order for us to be able to set targets for ourselves with regard to completing our own internal reforms. </seg>
<seg id=40> However, we disagree on some important issues. </seg>
<seg id=41> This damages the Union, its future independence in relation to the United States and also a common European defence and security policy, since it also introduces risks with regard to Russia and other countries. </seg>
<seg id=42> We hope that results will be achieved and that another Intergovernmental Conference will not have to be held in order to prepare adequately for enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=43> I shall be brief, as indeed I was earlier, since my first speech was three minutes under the allotted speaking time. </seg>
<seg id=44> It is very important, and therefore I am pleased that the Commission is working on an information campaign which Commissioner Verheugen wishes to make both extensive and decentralised. </seg>
<seg id=45> However, and this will be my last word, as I want to get my point across clearly: I am no pessimist on the subject, I do not want to do things by halves, I want to see a strong option with regard to enlargement - in order to be credible, we must also be serious, we must make ourselves clearly understood, and we must also be able to gain the allegiance of the nations, the peoples of the candidate countries and also our own peoples. </seg>
<seg id=46> For now, I see no need to discuss the financial perspectives in connection with enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=47> I cannot say that today of any one country. </seg>
<seg id=48> Which is also why they expressed their wish to join the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=49> The various rapporteurs will now speak. </seg>
<seg id=50> I have been entrusted with the task of acting as rapporteur where Estonia is concerned. </seg>
<seg id=51> As a conservative, I am incredibly thrifty with taxpayers' money. </seg>
<seg id=52> Only then, I think, can you have any notion of what the people of Latvia have achieved over recent years. </seg>
<seg id=53> It is not enough; the whole strategy needs to be geared more to the citizens. </seg>
<seg id=54> Lithuania has considerable potential for long-term economic growth. </seg>
<seg id=55> In the widest sense, what is at stake here is cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id=56> This brings us to another sore point: public support, both within and outside the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=57> As a result of clever fiscal policy, direct foreign investment topped EUR 5.45 billion last year. </seg>
<seg id=58> We should not interfere, especially we Germans! </seg>
<seg id=59> Slovak democracy is developing at a steady pace, which has not always been the case. </seg>
<seg id=60> In this speech, I propose to highlight and discuss the six aspects of Hungary' s changing situation with a view to its accession to the European Union, which warrant specific mention. </seg>
<seg id=61> I am therefore pleased to see that it has been addressed in Mr Brok' s general report on enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=62> This is nowhere more true than in the case of nuclear power, where legitimate concerns over nuclear and environmental safety are in danger of being hijacked by the anti-nuclear power lobby. </seg>
<seg id=63> The formation of a high level group is something that I commend to my colleagues. </seg>
<seg id=64> The report which it is my honour to submit, which was also unanimously adopted in committee, observes that the part of the territory controlled by the legal authority fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria. </seg>
<seg id=65> To this end, a key role will fall, without prejudice obviously to the Commission' s own role, to our High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Javier Solana. </seg>
<seg id=66> Malta' s main problem is still that the accession process is judged differently by the government and by the opposition, while the European Union just wants to be sure that the accession process progresses steadily. </seg>
<seg id=67> Even the levels between the USA and Mexico are closer together, which is why we are in favour of a considered, flexible strategy which does justice to the challenge in the area of the internal market. </seg>
<seg id=68> Allow me also to say at this point that I have a great deal of respect for the citizens of the central and eastern European countries who, ten years ago, had the courage to go into the streets and start this process. </seg>
<seg id=69> The information society is important to old as well as new sectors. </seg>
<seg id=70> We should not be blinded by the percentage figures of community law transposed into national legislation. </seg>
<seg id=71> The ten new countries in Eastern Europe can only dream of having a rich sugar daddy such as that. </seg>
<seg id=72> This also applies to the inhuman transport of live animals to slaughterhouses. </seg>
<seg id=73> Now we are moving to a requirement for health impact assessments for all major legislation. </seg>
<seg id=74> My report is also bound to discuss the European Union and has to demonstrate that the European funds for regional development cannot continue to be granted on the basis of a simple distribution of money between regions or districts. </seg>
<seg id=75> Elmar Brok rightly started his intervention by saying that we all stand to benefit from enlargement, especially those of us on this side of the current external borders. </seg>
<seg id=76> Internal waterway transport will be important for environmental reasons, because we must get heavy freight off the roads and, if it cannot be carried by rail, then we must use waterways. </seg>
<seg id=77> Egoism and, especially, populism have also played their part. Nor, certainly, has the falling rate of the euro helped things in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id=78> Our message to the accession candidates is the following: do not get overwhelmed by the number of reports and dossiers before us. </seg>
<seg id=79> Unfortunately, there are too many parties at the moment which have shed their ideological feathers and, as a result, display too little ambition and too much materialism. </seg>
<seg id=80> If there is a need to postpone the free right to acquire land and property for family use, then let us do that. </seg>
<seg id=81> It exists so far, but will possibly be jeopardised by a bureaucratic lack of transparency and the obvious, but not public resistance of certain governments. </seg>
<seg id=82> For where are the millions of jobs promised by the Maastricht Treaty? </seg>
<seg id=83> Now that we are engaged in reviewing the Treaties, some States are already calling for a new reform. </seg>
<seg id=84> The vast majority of international investigations point to macroeconomic gains in connection with enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=85> However, with the exception of insignificant minorities, no political group is questioning the principle objective of the Slovenian policy which is to join the European Union as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id=86> If the Union were to enlarge rapidly it would have to decentralise dramatically, as was stated in the ELDR Group' s position on enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=87> It is clear to me that the institutional, ordered regime which operates in that country results in many long-term health consequences for orphaned children. </seg>
<seg id=88> I would urge you to support the relevant amendments. </seg>
<seg id=89> And even the European politicians have insufficient insight into the negotiating process. </seg>
<seg id=90> Cyprus will be a sort of bridge with the countries in the area. </seg>
<seg id=91> I wish the negotiators continued success with their work in this important area. </seg>
<seg id=92> Of course the second form of communication we need is that between the Member States and the candidate countries, in order to convey what it is that is important from the European Union' s perspective. </seg>
<seg id=93> We cannot afford to lose more of the momentum that existed at the beginning of the Nineties. </seg>
<seg id=94> Mr President, first of all, as Socialist rapporteur for the report on Romania, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report. </seg>
<seg id=95> The institutions, the Member States, and all of us, have to live up to this challenge, also in relation to the fears of public opinion in our own countries and to rediscover the inspiration, the ambition and the vision of the founding fathers of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=96> Unfortunately, it seems to me, that for all the fine words and industrious opening and closing of chapters, the Council is not applying the political pressure needed to drive this enlargement process forward. </seg>
<seg id=97> Many countries have faced similar problems at some time in their development and can advise Bulgaria in order to help it to overcome those problems it is facing at the moment. </seg>
<seg id=98> Democracy is not just about majorities, more than anything it is about minorities being given commensurate codecision powers. </seg>
<seg id=99> The applicant countries must have equal status and their accession must depend only how much progress they have made. </seg>
<seg id=100> At the same time we should recognise the efforts made by countries like Lithuania to, as it were, make up for lost time. </seg>
<seg id=101> That being so, it is in our interests to extend our system of rights and freedoms as far as Romania, and this is certainly an argument we can use in a critical debate with our public. </seg>
<seg id=102> People do, however, rally in large numbers around one issue, namely that of enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=103> My group therefore supports the proposal to limit the transitional periods in the environmental sphere to a maximum of five years. </seg>
<seg id=104> Mr President, it is essential for us to adopt a positive approach to enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=105> Certainly, the debate over the order in which the countries are to join the Union remains open, partly because the state of progress of their internal reforms will have to be assessed. </seg>
<seg id=106> I am delighted that the report has turned out to be so positive and that Slovenia - and as leader of the delegation I was able to check this out repeatedly, and in fact the Commissioner was there with me on more than one occasion - has made truly enormous efforts to fulfil the criteria. </seg>
<seg id=107> I think the suggestion is worth looking into. </seg>
<seg id=108> Both the EU and the candidate states should now be doing their utmost to condemn and fight these forms of violence and the trade in women. </seg>
<seg id=109> Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to endorse the thoughts and concerns of many of my fellow members regarding the need for an assiduous and long-overdue examination of the question of the borders of Europe and, consequently, of the extent of enlargement, and the need, if any, for a special report on the subject by the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=110> The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed. </seg>
<seg id=111> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id=112> From time to time it is rightly said in this House that a citizens' Europe would be a Europe in which rights were properly enshrined in the law of the Union. </seg>
<seg id=113> I shall now put the request from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for a postponement to the vote. </seg>
<seg id=114> We know that the foreign substances in question are very rarely acutely poisonous substances, but are long-term and long-lived substances which can build up, such as dioxin and aflotoxin and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury. </seg>
<seg id=115> We cannot find the culprits. </seg>
<seg id=116> If this type of dilution is permitted, there must at least be a requirement to notify the monitoring bodies, and the fact that such dilution occurs must be made public, because the public also need to be aware of this problem and discuss it. </seg>
<seg id=117> One thing must be clearly emphasised: the dioxin crisis was the result of criminal infringements of the existing rules and regulations. </seg>
<seg id=118> Mr President, may I thank my colleagues who have already spoken. </seg>
<seg id=119> This was absolutely vital. </seg>
<seg id=120> The value limit for fish meal, for example, is different to the level proposed for non-marine animal derived products. </seg>
<seg id=121> It is time to break with a misguided interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity, which attempts to increase Brussels' s hold on our nations a little more each day. </seg>
<seg id=122> Like the rapporteur, I believe that there is a case for doing all these things and for looking at the substances she referred to when they are not in themselves toxic but show increases in the aggregated levels. </seg>
<seg id=123> Unfortunately, a lot of inherited knowledge and farmers' lore has been lost in industrial agriculture, where animals have been reduced to production units and commodities. </seg>
<seg id=124> The new regulations will merge, harmonise and simplify very detailed and complex hygiene requirements which were previously scattered over numerous directives. </seg>
<seg id=125> The number of those who seek precise details on ingredients is relatively small, according to my research. </seg>
<seg id=126> Secondly, for farmers, who are, of course, the producers of primary feed materials, there will in fact be a change, because in future they will have to destroy considerably higher percentages of their feed materials. </seg>
<seg id=127> Compensation is necessary, although it is obvious that farmers themselves are concerned about the wellbeing of their animals. </seg>
<seg id=128> Amendment No 18 explicitly proposes to include water in the definition of feedingstuff. </seg>
<seg id=129> On the basis of these scientific risk assessments the Commission will propose to the Member States appropriate measures to limit the presence of these substances in feedingstuffs. </seg>
<seg id=130> Considering the amendments tabled for adoption in this plenary session, I appreciate Parliament's support of the proposal. </seg>
<seg id=131> Overall therefore, the Commission can fully accept 15 of the 27 amendments. </seg>
<seg id=132> I assume that they will not succeed this time. </seg>
<seg id=133> The Commission has pledged itself to work on this list and has also said it is not something that can be done in a couple of days. </seg>
<seg id=134> Farmers quite simply have to know more precisely what is in their compound feedingstuffs, and they must also be able to find out, at least on request, the percentage content of each ingredient. </seg>
<seg id=135> Finally, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as well as to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for their contributions, and I hope that the Council will adopt a constructive position on this matter, so that we can jointly arrive at a transparent system of declarations for feedingstuffs. </seg>
<seg id=136> This is, of course, all due to the BSE tragedy that turned into a real saga, with several episodes. </seg>
<seg id=137> Contaminants which affect human and animal health are unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id=138> But let us begin with the good news. </seg>
<seg id=139> The present proposal is the first in a series of initiatives based on the White Paper on food safety. </seg>
<seg id=140> Thank you very much, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=141> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </seg>
<seg id=142> Report (A5-0248/2000) by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the European Parliament resolution on Hungary's membership application to the European Union and the state of negotiations (COM(1999) 505 - C5-0028/2000 - 1997/2175(COS)) </seg>
<seg id=143> Report (A5-0247/2000) by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the European Parliament resolution on Romania's membership application to the European Union and the state of negotiations (COM(1999) 510 - C5-0033/2000 - 1997/2171(COS)) </seg>
<seg id=144> Thirdly, perhaps the most difficult, that the Council agrees new institutional arrangements that allow the Community to function efficiently, effectively and democratically after enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=145> Even if one approves of the principles of Article 13, it is quite clear that derived legislation that the European Union may draw from it sometimes goes too far, and that there are no grounds for refusing candidate countries the right to cultural diversity. </seg>
<seg id=146> Lastly, I wish to stress the fact that the enlargement process must be a gradual one, following the pace at which the candidate countries are making the necessary changes. </seg>
<seg id=147> . (ES) In the current context and given that we are beginning to hear enlargement being questioned in certain quarters, it is important that this Parliament sends a clear political signal in support of it. </seg>
<seg id=148> . (FR) Since its inception, the European Union has sought to bring peoples closer together. </seg>
<seg id=149> The criteria laid down at the Copenhagen Council in 1993 on democratisation or the ability to withstand competition actually strengthen the hand of unrestrained, destructive capitalism, in the guise of acquis communautaire. </seg>
<seg id=150> A headlong rush into enlargement, under such conditions, would be liable to aggravate the sidelong shifts towards the populist and fascistic which are appearing here and there. </seg>
<seg id=151> It so happens that we have a report on equal opportunities for men and women on the agenda for this very sitting, a report which once more illustrates how stunted the body of Community practice still is in this particular area. </seg>
<seg id=152> For indeed, who could deny entry into the European House to States such as the Poland of Copernicus and John Paul II, the Hungary bullied in Budapest in 1956 or the capital that has become a symbol, Prague, when popular democracies threw the Head of State out of the window and crushed the nation of Jan Palach, sacrificed in the name of freedom. </seg>
<seg id=153> A larger Europe with more tasks and responsibilities will require fresh, increased financial resources. </seg>
<seg id=154> I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of Estonia, in the hope that we will look after their interests once they join the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=155> If Latvia continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Latvia should not be admitted to the Union. </seg>
<seg id=156> If Lithuania continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Lithuania should not be admitted to the Union. </seg>
<seg id=157> Progress is also evident in the field of the environment, where the 'National Fund for Protection of the Environment' has been implemented and the 'polluter pays' principle applied. </seg>
<seg id=158> In welcoming Poland to our common home, the European Union will be doing justice to a newcomer, justice that has been denied to it for far too long. </seg>
<seg id=159> I look forward to early membership for the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id=160> . I welcome the Queiró report on Hungary's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws. </seg>
<seg id=161> I look forward to Bulgaria joining the Union in the not too distant future. </seg>
<seg id=162> Poos Report (A5-0249/2000) </seg>
<seg id=163> This is a balanced and fair position, which the Council of Ministers must take into serious consideration. </seg>
<seg id=164> In this connection, I would hope that the talks conducted under the auspices of the United Nations will be able to come to a successful conclusion enabling the Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations to enjoy the advantages of membership of the European Union in the context of a reunified republic. </seg>
<seg id=165> . I warmly welcome Mr Poos' report on Cyprus's application for membership of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=166> Yet we consumers are the last stage in the food chain, and hence the final recipients of the abuses and counterfeits in the food industry. </seg>
<seg id=167> We are particularly keen to implement in a practical manner at European level this concept of food safety from the stable to the table, or from the pitchfork to the fork. </seg>
<seg id=168> It is precisely because we are in favour of developing genuinely fraternal cooperation relationships between genuinely equal partners, between all the countries of the world, that we have no intention of endorsing this double talk by voting in favour. </seg>
<seg id=169> The Council informed Parliament before the vote in committee, but only just before, deliberately ruling out any chance of further debate with myself or Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=170> In my report, I have called for greater representation and involvement of NGOs, greater accountability to Parliament, the production of an annual report to be debated by Parliament, the highest possible degree of transparency, promotion of remembrance of the past in the fight against prejudice and the recognition of multiple discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=171> At the same time, the workers' legitimate interests need to be considered. </seg>
<seg id=172> Since they are mainly responsible for settling questions of discrimination at the workplace, the social partners are best placed to work out viable solutions. </seg>
<seg id=173> Jenny was from the Access Charter, she was the coordinator for the group and I invited her to the hearings on Article 13. </seg>
<seg id=174> They also form part of a practical policy because directives and action programmes encourage the Member States to fight discrimination on the basis of the same guiding principles and because the Commission can fulfil its role as Guardian of the Treaties but also as a pioneer in the social debate. </seg>
<seg id=175> Although the present legal basis releases appropriations for new preparatory actions, their funding within this category could lead to a reduction in appropriations for other policies. </seg>
<seg id=176> Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a framework directive is necessary but not sufficient, and we will have the opportunity to improve its mechanisms once the implementation period is over. </seg>
<seg id=177> I hope the Commission will look carefully at gender discrimination legislation in the light of this new directive. </seg>
<seg id=178> I congratulate the Commission and my colleagues who drew up the report. </seg>
<seg id=179> I applaud the recommendation of the Mann report to offer ideological organisations the opportunity to prescribe the functions required of staff with this background in mind. </seg>
<seg id=180> The speed with which the institutions have deployed the new Amsterdam powers, Commissioner, show that the European Union is still in the vanguard of equal opportunities, and I would like to extend my express thanks to the European Commission for this. </seg>
<seg id=181> The fact that so many different forms of discrimination exist in our societies confirms the importance of the Action Programme that is the subject of Mr Cashman' s report. </seg>
<seg id=182> Mr President, on behalf of the Bonino List, I would like to express our great consternation at the Member States' approach to the issues of discrimination, racism and xenophobia. </seg>
<seg id=183> Could the Commissioner explain why the Commission is not taking this on board? </seg>
<seg id=184> My second point is the problem that NGOs, important as they may be, are being asked to be involved in implementing the programme regardless of their size, nature and activities. </seg>
<seg id=185> The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has assessed all this with positive results, particularly focusing on the activity of Parliament, which insisted, in addition and above all, on preventive action as well as good practice. </seg>
<seg id=186> That is a challenge to all of us because we all judge people on initial impressions. </seg>
<seg id=187> Mr President, combating discrimination and passing legislation against it means acknowledging that is exists and that many forms of it are in a sense 'decriminalised' because they are so commonplace. </seg>
<seg id=188> In Geneva in 1963, the first of these, UNCTAD, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, established the principle of compensatory inequalities or, in other words, discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=189> In fact, information and awareness campaigns are vital in this area: they must act as hammers to forge new mentalities and bring about a new way of thinking and behaving, in order to drive out those prejudices which are still widespread and to ensure equal rights for all citizens. </seg>
<seg id=190> It is therefore important to press forward with the two legislative initiatives that are now being debated, while improving them in certain respects and increasing the funds set aside for financing the programme, thus reflecting the political importance of this fight against discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=191> In particular the agreement of the principle of reasonable accommodation, pioneered in Sweden and Ireland, will now ensure that employers across Europe adapt their workplaces, acquire specialist equipment and amend their working practices so that disabled employees really do get a fair chance. </seg>
<seg id=192> Article 13 is the starting point for a new EU objective: to combat discrimination or inequality in the treatment of citizens for the reasons listed therein. </seg>
<seg id=193> The second thing I want to point out is that, with this first package, the Commission has unfortunately committed a serious error by itself putting reasons for discrimination in order of priority. </seg>
<seg id=194> Mr President, discrimination on religious grounds is as unacceptable as any other form of discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=195> As a confirmed secularist, I could not possibly endorse it. </seg>
<seg id=196> Yet even today the generous idea of granting each citizen the greatest possible freedom, provided it is compatible with the same measure of freedom for others, still comes up against obstacles - some de facto, others de jure. </seg>
<seg id=197> One of the directives has already been adopted in record time, and I am quite optimistic that the other one will be adopted during the French Presidency in November. </seg>
<seg id=198> Some are not in conformity with other legal requirements, for example the amendment concerning the committees' arrangements. </seg>
<seg id=199> On the contrary, I cannot accept Amendment No 38 which proposes to delete from Article 5 the list of differences of treatment on grounds of age, which could be justified. </seg>
<seg id=200> You have addressed the important question of contract compliance. </seg>
<seg id=201> It is the first time that we allow joint projects in this action programme. </seg>
<seg id=202> Clearly the more global the code the more effective it will be. </seg>
<seg id=203> Article 7 of the code commits Member States to prevent exports being diverted to undesirable end users. </seg>
<seg id=204> Mr President, I have to confess to a certain nostalgia for the times when the European Parliament - and the various pacifist movements and trade unions - used to call urgently for dedication and action in order to steadily reduce arms manufacturing, and we would discuss ways of converting military production into civilian production. </seg>
<seg id=205> In consideration of the situation of the world today and of this continent, following the end of the cold War and the breaking of the balance established by the dread fear of weapons of mass destruction, such an attitude would be highly irresponsible. </seg>
<seg id=206> In a sense, these arms have come to symbolise anarchy in many areas worldwide. </seg>
<seg id=207> CFSP covers crisis management activity outside the EU' s borders and nothing which can be described as a common defence policy. </seg>
<seg id=208> These aim at preventing the export of weapons to governments which abuse human rights, to areas of conflict or to regions engaged in arms races. </seg>
<seg id=209> The Commission, in close collaboration with the Member States, was actively involved in the drafting of the European Union joint action on small arms and light weapons. </seg>
<seg id=210> The next item is the Commission communication on the European research area. </seg>
<seg id=211> The introduction of types of intervention of longer duration; half-way houses between support for projects and institutional financing, the use of the variable geometry instruments available under the Treaty, and, more specifically, European Union participation in national programmes, as provided for in Article 169 of the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=212> This ranking is precisely the characteristic that we want to enhance, and it is dependent on the level of the method of intervention. </seg>
<seg id=213> You said that you have a total shake-up of the framework programme in mind. </seg>
<seg id=214> I feel that what is currently required is something that structures the European Research Area, which is to say something that goes beyond the framework programme and supplements national programmes; we need a structuring element, which means that we have to agree on certain rules. </seg>
<seg id=215> As concerns discussions with the STOA Unit, I feel that we have to act together, since this is something that concerns this House, the Joint Research Centre and the technological foresight institutes in the various Member States. </seg>
<seg id=216> The Commission appears to be moving quickly towards shaping the European Research Area. </seg>
<seg id=217> There will be an entire chapter on science, society and the citizens. </seg>
<seg id=218> Meetings have been held with the Greek, Irish and Portuguese authorities to ask the governments of these countries to speed up their presentation to the Commission of their Cohesion Fund projects. </seg>
<seg id=219> Perhaps the lack of staff you have just mentioned exclusively devoted to the Cohesion Fund - who did exist in the former Commission - prevented you from having more concrete details. </seg>
<seg id=220> My second question is this: besides the Cohesion Fund, there are also the Community Support Framework, the Structural Fund, regional programmes, etc. From which countries have you received definitive projects, and which programmes from which countries have you already approved? </seg>
<seg id=221> In 1989, the Commission submitted a new proposal which was to offer more flexibility. </seg>
<seg id=222> I appreciate the points Mr Bolkestein made and I know that the principal rule in the treaties prohibits charging foreigners more than home companies, but the general law of fair competition in Europe ought to apply and where levels of taxation are totally disproportionate we should look at the effect competition law can have on the situation, despite the general rule that these matters are the prerogative of Member States. </seg>
<seg id=223> If you want to conserve fuel, the way to do it is through fuel duty, not other forms of taxation. </seg>
<seg id=224> I should like to say to Mr Purvis that the matter of natural, regional disadvantages is probably a matter for the national governments since a part of their electorate lies in those outlying areas and peripheral regions. </seg>
<seg id=225> Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for that information. </seg>
<seg id=226> Last spring and summer the European Commission carried out a general review of its activities and human resources. </seg>
<seg id=227> Tasks of that kind do exist. </seg>
<seg id=228> These children are increasingly exploited by tourists and businessmen who, remarkably often, come from Europe. </seg>
<seg id=229> The Commission believes that all undertakings will be able to prepare themselves in time for the final changeover to the euro, including the adaptation of their computer systems and software. </seg>
<seg id=230> This philosophical political discussion is no longer on the agenda, but in general we can discuss the dangers of a referendum, but perhaps in some other context. </seg>
<seg id=231> This applies also to moose. </seg>
<seg id=232> A reminder has been recently sent to the French authorities. </seg>
<seg id=233> In relation to candidate countries I can tell you that meetings have taken place with them in relation to this issue of transport of animals and preliminary agreements have been reached. </seg>
<seg id=234> However, in this year's spring sowing season the Commission was informed of interceptions of imported seed of conventional varieties of different species including cotton containing traces of GM seed. </seg>
<seg id=235> However, having consulted with his services, I am in a position to inform you that essential safety requirements concerning computer equipment to be used privately or in the working place are prescribed by a directive relating to electrical products, the Low Voltage Directive, as well as by the Directive on Radio Equipment and Telecommunication Terminals. </seg>
<seg id=236> Would he agree with me that it is a false distinction to draw here, however, between safety in the workplace and safety in the schoolroom or safety for a child working at home? </seg>
<seg id=237> Perhaps he will shake hands with President Khatami. </seg>
<seg id=238> Today Aung San Suu Kyi is now under de facto house arrest. </seg>
<seg id=239> So I am reluctant to go further on trade or to advise further action on trade or investment. </seg>
<seg id=240> Question No 15 by (H-0769/00): </seg>
<seg id=241> They referred to some of the election meetings, for example, that they had gone to. </seg>
<seg id=242> Questions 16 to 44 will be replied to in writing. </seg>
<seg id=243> What we would like to see is a consolidated European report which should be published and scrutinised by this Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=244> We should be focusing on the conversion to non-weapons production instead of on how we will compete with the other weapons manufacturing countries around the world. </seg>
<seg id=245> The five permanent members of the Security Council, who are supposed to watch over our security, should listen to these proposals and negotiate an arrangement truly worthy of the twenty-first century as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id=246> Today's debate marks an important step in the reform process that was initiated by the Prodi Commission just over one year ago. </seg>
<seg id=247> I cannot help but feel that in the race to produce a proposal within the time limit set by the Reform White Paper, the Commission failed to focus properly on the detail. </seg>
<seg id=248> I therefore propose that both the financial controller and the internal auditor should produce annual reports detailing their activities. </seg>
<seg id=249> The Van Hulten report is right to define further the discrepancy put forward by the Commission and sets the right tone for exchanging best practices among institutions. </seg>
<seg id=250> I hope we will not see a repeat performance here! </seg>
<seg id=251> If we lay something down for large institutions, the neutrality principle proposed by the Committee of Independent Experts should then apply across the board. </seg>
<seg id=252> In the past we often found that excessively lengthy decision-making processes disappointed the applicants and led to a loss of confidence in the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id=253> I wish to say, Commissioner, that this report is only an interim measure, which means that it is the first step towards building a bridge between our present system of control and the system that we would like to achieve through the reform. </seg>
<seg id=254> That is the proposal before us. </seg>
<seg id=255> Only if they are able to do so will we revert to sampling, to selecting, which is often controlled. </seg>
<seg id=256> Therefore, we are all aware that, in practice, this is certainly not a simple undertaking. </seg>
<seg id=257> Of course I also think that we are not in a position, either as politicians or as technicians, to tackle this problem on our own. </seg>
<seg id=258> Fortunately, however, the vast majority of children and young people grow up in an environment free of all these types of problem. </seg>
<seg id=259> I entirely agree with the President of the Commission about the need to prepare such a list along the lines of a constitution, and I am quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforced and that the EU must therefore refrain from making policy on the wide range of areas in which the political problems are not of a cross-border nature. </seg>
<seg id=260> Information from all over the world and from every sphere of knowledge is delivered to the home in record time and our children can communicate all around the world on an everyday basis. </seg>
<seg id=261> Arrested very soon afterwards, they told the police, "It' s funny, they don' t get caught that easily on the telly. </seg>
<seg id=262> Legislators - and I have almost finished speaking now - cannot regulate everything, but they must occasionally remind everyone what their rights and duties are. </seg>
<seg id=263> I am also very aware of the remarks made about education, about training in the interpretation of images and about making younger people more aware of the need to approach the media in a critical frame of mind and not to watch any old thing, at any time and in any way. </seg>
<seg id=264> Nothing will be more damaging to their developing views, than if a report such as this fails to make progress or if it fails to deliver greater mobility or if it fails to at least start to demolish the barriers that confront educational mobility today. </seg>
<seg id=265> The problems to be resolved vary from country to country: for example, regulations differ on matters of social security, study grants, right of residence and taxation, and there is no system for the mutual recognition of qualifications and work placements. </seg>
<seg id=266> It is about time that Europe turned its attention once more to the sound implementation of programmes such as Socrates and Youth for Europe. </seg>
<seg id=267> When it comes to student and teacher mobility, experience shows that the real problems of mobility are not found so much in the area of educational administration, but with the social, tax and immigration authorities. </seg>
<seg id=268> The SOCRATES Programme was mentioned as one example of this. </seg>
<seg id=269> There must be clear checks and monitoring, even if only of a sample, and above all, a web site, where students can register their complaints. </seg>
<seg id=270> We therefore call for research workers to be included in the scope of the recommendations. </seg>
<seg id=271> It is easy to talk in a speech about removing obstacles, but less easy to remove them in practice. </seg>
<seg id=272> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=273> We would like to join with President Chirac and Minister Fischer in saying how much we value this move. </seg>
<seg id=274> The Union must present a completely united front in matters of foreign policy, defence and common security. </seg>
<seg id=275> We need a decision-making forum in order to address issues which are of primary importance to both sides of the Mediterranean, such as migration flows, the transfer of the factors of production and energy supply. </seg>
<seg id=276> The motion for a resolution on the Commission' s reports that you will be voting on later goes into great detail on the subject. </seg>
<seg id=277> The Finnish Presidency' s report on women and decision-making sets out clear indicators for evaluating the progress made. </seg>
<seg id=278> In addition to the Ministerial Conference and the Conference on Professional Equality, I should also mention two very important documents specifically devoted to equality, but within the area of competence of the Employment and Social Affairs Council. </seg>
<seg id=279> The second relates to the principle of non-discrimination, including that based on gender. </seg>
<seg id=280> In connection with the reports, I would also say - and the President-in-Office of the Council touched upon this, too - that one of the major problems in the EU is of course the big cultural differences. </seg>
<seg id=281> The reports we are dealing with here seem to reflect this mood. </seg>
<seg id=282> We must monitor whether the directive on equality is really being incorporated into legislation. </seg>
<seg id=283> I believe that this method, which Finland has introduced for the first time, works well in many areas and while it is part of the Commission' s strategy on equality there is good reason to expect much from it. </seg>
<seg id=284> In the name of equal opportunities, and thanks to Europe, French women have won the right to work at night. </seg>
<seg id=285> As a French woman and citizen, this vision of the world is particularly alien to me. </seg>
<seg id=286> In spite of these remarks, we shall vote for this report because we are naturally in favour of equal opportunities, but what equal opportunities means most of all is respect for everyone. </seg>
<seg id=287> Whoever denies mothers the freedom of choice to bring up their own children unpaid, will be presented with the bill later on in the form of youth crime and vandalism. </seg>
<seg id=288> I would remind you, in this connection, of our report on the splitting of pension rights in the event of divorce, as a result of which, payments for surviving relatives and the retirement age are to be included in the 1979 directive. </seg>
<seg id=289> The Polish women were very grateful to us for making it clear that the representative who was there at the time most definitely did not reflect the views of Polish women. </seg>
<seg id=290> Greater involvement by women at all levels of government and in all areas of life is essential for deepening democracy and achieving and maintaining peace. </seg>
<seg id=291> My final comment concerns the situation of women in the countries preparing to join the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=292> In this area therefore, the Council, especially its men, has a tremendously important job to do in leading Europe in the fight against the Mafia that trades in women, for this slave trade is not something that responsible politicians can push aside, shrug off or ignore. </seg>
<seg id=293> From the reports and speeches that we are considering today we can deduce, as many of us already knew, that the problem of equal opportunities is a structural problem and that in order to deal with it we need global strategies, because as women we are not a category or a homogenous social group or indeed any sort of group. </seg>
<seg id=294> I was indeed sorry to see that Maria De Belém Roseira was no longer the representative. </seg>
<seg id=295> Two of you mentioned new social rights, new fiscal rights. </seg>
<seg id=296> Thirdly, because they form the basis for strategy, both for the European Union - even in the Charter of Fundamental Rights the fact that we had a picture of the current situation played an important role - and at national level, given that the Member States are able to use the comparative assessment to set national targets. </seg>
<seg id=297> The joint debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=298> These amendments need to be considered in the new context of the interinstitutional agreement, and therefore, Parliament can agree to not insisting on these commitology amendments given that they have been superseded to a certain extent by the new interinstitutional framework. </seg>
<seg id=299> I personally continue to believe, however, that the text that was adopted by Parliament at the time responded much better to the new realities that had arisen from the internal market and the liberalisation of the markets, insofar as the elements of clarification and monitoring that were introduced by the amendments that were not adopted were a better guarantee that the rules would be complied with and that the same procedures would be followed when applying them. </seg>
<seg id=300> If we want third countries to accept commitments, the European Community must be the most zealous in ensuring that its own rules are being complied with, because if a country has the opportunity to place products in the Community by means of smuggling, why is it going to bother to negotiate with us for any sort of concessions? </seg>
<seg id=301> In the same way, the amendment tabled by Parliament regarding paperless declarations, adopted by the Council, will enable Member State customs authorities to have state-of-the-art automated administration equipment at their disposal. </seg>
<seg id=302> But it is too late now because you have just taken the vote and Members voted in favour of it. </seg>
<seg id=303> Vote (continuation) </seg>
<seg id=304> Report (A5-0198/2000) by Mrs Dybkjær, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on the Commission annual reports "Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union - 1997, 1998, 1999 (COM(1998) 302 - C5­0106/1999) (COM(1999) 106 - C5-0289/2000) (COM(2000) 123 - C5- 0290/2000 -1999/2109(COS)) </seg>
<seg id=305> This is not the first time I have expressed my views on mobility for students and teachers. </seg>
<seg id=306> This report is all the more important because it comes at a critical time for the European Union, a time of enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=307> Discrimination cannot be tackled by creating additional administrative bodies; but solely by changing people' s attitudes. </seg>
<seg id=308> I have not voted for the Mann report because, while it is indeed necessary to seek equal treatment for people in employment and occupation, it is also necessary to refrain from pushing zeal to the point of abandoning all protection of freedoms and all respect for the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id=309> As a confirmed secularist, I cannot associate myself with that. </seg>
<seg id=310> The SNP welcomes this directive and its aim to end discrimination in the workplace. </seg>
<seg id=311> If the directive is to be adopted and implemented, it must not be encumbered with a literary approach and wishful thinking, which have no place in a legal document. </seg>
<seg id=312> However the EPLP has strong reservations about the following areas. </seg>
<seg id=313> There are also elements which, we feel, should be left to Member States such as overall implementation, provision of training to particular age groups of workers, the nature of a mediation system, and how SMEs are to interpret the directive. </seg>
<seg id=314> In the interview, Mr Van Hulten is right in saying that we will not be able to draft a positive agenda until we have solved problems such as fraud, waste, but also a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making. </seg>
<seg id=315> The reasons of my vote on this report relate, in the main, to the question of closer European Union relations with NATO and also the onward rush to a common defence policy. </seg>
<seg id=316> Moreover, the report discusses European arms exports as a way of solving future local conflicts in the immediate vicinity of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=317> However, I cannot accept the introduction of the requirement of a common defence policy and a European security and defence policy within NATO. </seg>
<seg id=318> Children are the first victims of violence on television. </seg>
<seg id=319> I am delighted this study has been completed. </seg>
<seg id=320> A committee of experts will also be constituted at a European Community level with the mandate of drawing up a memorandum setting out general principles for the protection of minors in the media context. </seg>
<seg id=321> Report Dybkjær (A5-0198/2000) </seg>
<seg id=322> Interestingly, this is the first time that the need for the Commission' s annual reports to go further in its evaluation of the efficacy of political initiatives has been identified. </seg>
<seg id=323> Peru </seg>
<seg id=324> Mr President, Peru is currently going through a period of uncertainty, and we all cherish the hope that the current situation will be resolved through a process in which all civil and political rights are guaranteed, which will help to strengthen and consolidate democracy and peace in Peru, a country that has suffered 25 000 deaths in the last fifteen years. </seg>
<seg id=325> The term in question is the word 'democracy'. </seg>
<seg id=326> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the conditions under which elections were held in Peru in May this year, were unacceptable. </seg>
<seg id=327> B5-0793/2000, by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the position of women in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id=328> I therefore also think it good that the decision should include some clear and explicit points about the position of women in particular and should draw attention to how necessary it is for us to try to help prevent the Taliban regime from continuing with its wholesale discrimination against women. </seg>
<seg id=329> The EU has an important task before it in this respect. </seg>
<seg id=330> There can be no recognition by any Member State, as long as Afghanistan maintains its policy of violation of human rights, notably its systematic discrimination against women. </seg>
<seg id=331> And we do need to take this into account in the European institutions, as well as the fact that drug cultivation is used to buy arms. </seg>
<seg id=332> That said, it will give staunch support to the neighbouring countries, so as to improve their chances of tackling the drugs problem. </seg>
<seg id=333> I think this is a good time to highlight the need for the European Union to draw up a comprehensive policy on Latin America which could perhaps prevent these countries from regularly going through the crisis situations that some of them have experienced. </seg>
<seg id=334> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, in common with Parliament, welcomes the release of the Spanish Jesuit priest, Alejandro Matos Castro, last week. </seg>
<seg id=335> B5-0782/2000, by Mr Haarbyr, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Macedonia: law on higher education and universities; </seg>
<seg id=336> Therefore, we are all delighted that a genuinely sound solution is perhaps at last to be found to this problem of higher education. </seg>
<seg id=337> As far as I am concerned, it proves to all neighbouring countries that education does not only have to spread hatred, as is often the case these days, but that it can also serve as a cradle for a peaceful, multi-ethnic society. </seg>
<seg id=338> I would have preferred it if we could have found a solution that all the parties in Parliament could have voted for. </seg>
<seg id=339> Perhaps I could use this opportunity to say that the cooperation between the Commission and the High Commissioner, Mr van der Stoel, has already got off to a good start. </seg>
<seg id=340> We are not debating here merely in order to express our sorrow; the main subject of our debate is what happened, why it happened and how we can rectify the situation, how the Commission and the European Parliament can help from now on to ensure that the same does not happen again in the future. </seg>
<seg id=341> Be that as it may, Mr President, we have agreed to this joint proposal for a resolution, which we support as it stands, urgently, and we of course disagree with the amendments tabled, again urgently, for the reasons which I have stated. </seg>
<seg id=342> As far as my amendment on working conditions is concerned, there is a directive on this and the wording of the amendment is less satisfactory than the text. </seg>
<seg id=343> It is simply not acceptable to the northern and western isles of Scotland, nor for the potential North Sea to European mainland crossing which I hope will be established in the not-too-distant future. </seg>
<seg id=344> I am pleased that the Greek government has now nullified this exemption. </seg>
<seg id=345> The Commission therefore contacted the Greek authorities as soon as the Express Samina went down, requesting clarification of the application of Community law. </seg>
<seg id=346> The question which I wish to raise and which I would ask the Bureau to clarify is if, having done away with Fridays, certain parties are now trying to do away with Thursdays. </seg>
<seg id=347> I would also like to tell you that the European Union has put mechanisms in place so that, once the popular will of the Serbian people is respected, that is, once we have a government that is supported by the people who voted in the ballot boxes for Mr Kostunica, we can offer two things: firstly, an immediate lifting of sanctions and secondly, a package of economic aid that can help the Serbian people to rebuild their economy. </seg>
<seg id=348> The question of whether democratic change can now be introduced and if it can be introduced without violence will perhaps be decided in the next few hours on the streets of Belgrade. </seg>
<seg id=349> We condemn any action which deserves to be seen as provocation, especially in connection with the holy sites in Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id=350> And we have to offer them our hand in a very symbolic way - as Mr Solana said - with this meeting in Zagreb. </seg>
<seg id=351> These are bullets which, upon contact with the body, shatter into dozens of pieces. They are banned internationally, even in battles amongst soldiers; yet they are now used against citizens. </seg>
<seg id=352> In my opinion, Europe can and must do a great deal in this direction, and it must be clear and resolute. </seg>
<seg id=353> So we must do everything possible to douse the fire as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id=354> Provocations such as those initiated by Mr Ariel Sharon, must be refrained from. </seg>
<seg id=355> That is happening again today, and that is what will prevent, and has prevented Europe from acting as mediator in the Middle East all these years, leaving the United States to fulfil that role alone. </seg>
<seg id=356> We shall not sacrifice the Serbian people to our noble and moral objectives, because that would mean that perhaps thousands of people in Serbia and Yugoslavia might die for them. </seg>
<seg id=357> Finally, I would like to propose that a delegation from Parliament visit Serbia at the earliest opportunity, and once a new Yugoslavian government has been installed, so that we, in tandem with this new government, can make plans for the reconstruction of a new Serbia. </seg>
<seg id=358> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that today may well turn out to be a historic day in this Parliament, possibly ushering in the end of one of the last buttresses of a totalitarian dictatorship in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=359> Mr President, there is a problem with the German urgent debate file - I do not know if the same applies to the other language versions - in that it only contains the proposed amendments of the GUE group but none of the motions for resolutions and not even the joint text. </seg>
<seg id=360> Mr President, I just wanted to draw attention to the huge pile of documents we needed for voting this week. </seg>
<seg id=361> If Parliament could table amendments to the Council Decision it would certainly remind us of Croatia' s unemployment and social problems, which are the result of that country being put on a slimming regimen, but there is no legal basis here for such amendments. </seg>
<seg id=362> It is time to call for the same objectives with regard to the activities of the EIB. </seg>
<seg id=363> Mr President, last night we discussed the topic of Serbia and the revolutionary changes that are taking place there. </seg>
<seg id=364> I would therefore urge the fellow Members but also, and mainly, the Council, to stick as closely as possible to the Commission' s proposal during the next couple of months of negotiations on the budget for next year and subsequent years, the reason being that, in my view, the proposal still provides the best estimate of the total cost in Croatia, but also in other parts of the Balkans. </seg>
<seg id=365> Democratic elections were held there in 1990, which the international community deemed fair and free. </seg>
<seg id=366> I therefore say 'yes' to financial aid, and 'yes' to this guarantee, but, at the same time, would call upon the Commission most emphatically to lend massive support to this deeply European, and now truly democratic and constitutionally governed country, and to include it in the list of candidate countries, because I believe Croatia has earned our full support. </seg>
<seg id=367> Along with the rapporteur, I do wonder whether the funds will be made available in real terms, especially now it appears that Serbia will also be needing large funds shortly and the Union' s budget is not being increased. </seg>
<seg id=368> The delegations from the Croatian Parliament and from our own, have also called upon the Council to extend the EIB mandate. </seg>
<seg id=369> I hope that negotiations will soon get underway and, as with Croatia, that aid will also be granted to the Serbian people, who deserve our greatest respect. </seg>
<seg id=370> (The Minutes were approved) </seg>
<seg id=371> We will make an appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday and collect the names and signatures of those women who wish to be part of the delegation. Our intention is to build bridges of peace between women in places where violence prevails. </seg>
<seg id=372> All in all there has been more suffering for Basques and Spaniards; certainly the Spaniards and Basques are fed up with the present conflict. </seg>
<seg id=373> Madam President, you will recall that at the last part-session I raised the plight of the British democracy campaigner, James Mawdsley, who was held illegally by the Burmese authorities. </seg>
<seg id=374> Madam President, I have a genuine point of order. </seg>
<seg id=375> The fact is, this apparently technical report, which does not seem to make any great changes of a political nature, is extremely important insofar as it introduces the possibility of carrying out genetic engineering in viticulture and hence ending up with genetically modified viticulture. </seg>
<seg id=376> Not voting on the report will lead to delays. </seg>
<seg id=377> As you said, the Council of State rejected the appeal and we were duly informed of that rejection. </seg>
<seg id=378> However, the incident has been repeated again, and this time, although the Member concerned is a member of the European People' s Party, he is not from the same political party or persuasion as I am in Italy. </seg>
<seg id=379> Hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard, similar to the one already in use in the internal market, which details specific measures, expiry dates and deadlines. </seg>
<seg id=380> I hope, Minister, that the Council will be inspired by Parliament' s expectations, and I hope that you will succeed in setting ambitious goals at the Nice Summit for a European social agenda, which we can work towards together over the next couple of years. </seg>
<seg id=381> Following the informal Employment and Social Policy Council on 8 July this year in Paris, the Presidency invited all the parties involved, the European Parliament, of course, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, both sides of industry, NGOs, Council groups and committees, to submit their proposals. </seg>
<seg id=382> It is a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality, and Lisbon clearly established a twofold objective: more jobs and better jobs. </seg>
<seg id=383> Freedom of movement must be encouraged, while ensuring that career paths are safeguarded. </seg>
<seg id=384> We need to try to list and identify the gaps left in the system, and at least put them on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id=385> In our view, open coordination is the correct route to go down if we are to secure a social Europe. </seg>
<seg id=386> Implementing the ambitions for society declared in Lisbon calls for an effort on the part of the Community, an action plan to create jobs in services, especially those related to the information society. </seg>
<seg id=387> The Commission can obviously make an important contribution, but the social problems have their roots in local conditions and must be handled with great sensitivity for the practical conditions concerned. </seg>
<seg id=388> Social policy served to mitigate the most damaging effects of economic policies. </seg>
<seg id=389> The original Commission proposal was much better left unamended - congratulations Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=390> It is an ambitious agenda, and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that was made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection. </seg>
<seg id=391> I also think that it will be very positive in terms of helping women to reconcile family and working life. </seg>
<seg id=392> It sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection. </seg>
<seg id=393> What are the basic strands which make up the content? </seg>
<seg id=394> It is still hard for us to define European objectives which are equally valid for all the Member States because the situation on the ground varies. </seg>
<seg id=395> The Committee has submitted 49 amendments. </seg>
<seg id=396> One amendment is to the effect that it should be possible to hold an annual debate here in Parliament, together with the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=397> Furthermore, the Community must do more in the way of assessing the need for additional initiatives, including, where necessary, implementing legislation and equal opportunities, and fighting discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=398> There has not been a shortage of good ideas or good plans to achieve equality in the past but their implementation has often failed. </seg>
<seg id=399> It is not right for a handful of women, expert in making claims of society and living on intravenous injections of public monies, to monopolise the role of speaking on behalf of women. </seg>
<seg id=400> Equality between women and men in civil life, allowing women to fully enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms. </seg>
<seg id=401> I am expecting the male protagonists to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherited notions of gender roles and stereotypes. </seg>
<seg id=402> In any case, I feel that we should thank her for following the debate, especially since she was not scheduled to be present during this discussion as well. </seg>
<seg id=403> Competition policy </seg>
<seg id=404> We owe it to our companies to offer them the best conditions so that they are able to plan their production and, especially, their future. </seg>
<seg id=405> They must have a wide variety of high-quality, competitively priced goods and that, ultimately, is the reason for pushing forward with the single market and, along with it, free competition, because it is to the benefit of all our citizens. </seg>
<seg id=406> It concerns the subsidisation decision or non-subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry. </seg>
<seg id=407> Paragraph 16 of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s report talks of increased legal certainty where applications for mergers are concerned, together with more effective and shorter timeframes within which to appeal before courts. </seg>
<seg id=408> In all cases, these are public companies whose financial prowess derives from their past and present positions of monopoly rather than managerial expertise. </seg>
<seg id=409> We need to promote the citizens' awareness of competition policy, so that they recognise the advantages. </seg>
<seg id=410> They are especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment, and I hope that in future this can be made clear, so that these aids, these internal aids, which affect regional development and the regional economy, in which transport aid is a key example, might continue. </seg>
<seg id=411> This statement contains three important messages. </seg>
<seg id=412> A big thank you to Mr Evans as well, for his excellent report on the rules governing State aid to the steel industry and on the eighth survey on State aid in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=413> I would therefore like to assure Mrs Palacio, Mr Karas and the other Members who spoke on these points that the regulation takes their concerns into ample consideration. </seg>
<seg id=414> Otherwise we would be serving our purpose of helping competition and the consumers in a perverse way. </seg>
<seg id=415> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=416> The financial mechanism implements Article 119 of the EC Treaty, which only remains in force during the third stage of economic and monetary union for the Member States which are not participating in monetary union. </seg>
<seg id=417> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the fact that we are, after all, to have the opportunity to discuss the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine, and I also hope that tomorrow' s vote will have a positive outcome. </seg>
<seg id=418> On 5 July, some of these issued the Beaune declaration, expressing their great concern at the introduction of GMOs into their sector. </seg>
<seg id=419> The regulations proposed by the directive, moreover, favour the production of diversified plant material by offering the best health guarantees, which is a basic requirement, in order to effectively support the restructuring of the Community vineyard sector, which is a key point in the new COM in wine-growing. </seg>
<seg id=420> It must be said loud and clear, there was absolutely no need to stuff the articles of this directive with references to directive 90/220, which is currently being revised, unless the intention was to promote genetic manipulation in vines at all costs. </seg>
<seg id=421> I am happy to be able to inform you that we can also accept Amendments Nos 35 to 40, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, which are intended to reinforce the transposal of the safety and management requirements according to directive 90/220. </seg>
<seg id=422> I would simply like to point out that Parliament was not in itself called upon to give an opinion. </seg>
<seg id=423> Madam President, I speak with regard to Item 14 of the Minutes on the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity. </seg>
<seg id=424> Let me expand on the issue of qualified majority voting. </seg>
<seg id=425> Concerning the weighting of votes, the two well-known systems also remain on the table: a simple re-weighting, in favour of which a narrow, very narrow majority is emerging, or a double majority system, but with alternative options, a double simple or double re-weighted majority, in other words a type of 'demographic safety net' . </seg>
<seg id=426> Moreover, without prejudice to a needs assessment and the coordination of economic and financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which are to be the joint responsibility of the European Commission and the World Bank, the Biarritz European Council decided to grant the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia initial emergency humanitarian aid totalling EUR 200 million. </seg>
<seg id=427> But if I had to tell you spontaneously and very sincerely how I felt, I would say this: regardless of the sensitivity of these issues - the composition of the Commission and the voting system - they cannot be used as criteria for assessing whether Nice is a success or a failure. </seg>
<seg id=428> Also to be welcomed was the fact that the Heads of State and Government assented to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but I must also ask you to consider, Mr President-in-Office, how it was possible to achieve this. </seg>
<seg id=429> We must not kill the spirit of Nice with boredom, and we therefore have an essential priority in the remaining 50 days: to bring negotiations to a political level. </seg>
<seg id=430> In this respect I would also like to address my colleagues in the European People' s Party - and I would ask Mr Poettering to listen to me - because what we advocate in this Assembly, we should also advocate outside it. </seg>
<seg id=431> From what we know of the performance of the Prime Ministers and Presidents at Biarritz on the trickiest questions of Treaty reform, the Charter will probably become the greatest trophy at Nice. </seg>
<seg id=432> The Council would truly satisfy the expectations of European citizens if it were to launch a widespread consultation of individual communities and national parliaments, culminating in a charter that genuinely met people' s needs. </seg>
<seg id=433> We must therefore urge everyone to return to the roots of our Union, to have the courage that Giscard d' Estaing and Helmut Schmidt showed when deciding on the election of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage in 1976 and in 1979, and to decide that in 2009 we will finally have a President of the Commission who is also the President of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=434> In this respect I would like to respond to what Mr Poettering has said about the rift between the larger and smaller states. </seg>
<seg id=435> I would like to briefly return to matters of external trade policy, as this is a very serious matter. </seg>
<seg id=436> That really is something valuable, as was emphasised by all the members of the European Council. </seg>
<seg id=437> A second very positive thing was the adoption of the Charter in its entirety. </seg>
<seg id=438> Beyond this, it would seem to me that the Biarritz Council scored several points on this issue, which is crucial to the future of the European Union and its decision-making procedures, and we can only welcome that. </seg>
<seg id=439> I hope we can still convince people of this and make progress, in order to win the day on this issue at Nice. </seg>
<seg id=440> I can cite two practical examples: on the one hand we shifted the emphasis from the right to work to the right to engage in work and, on the other hand, a number of social rights that are covered in the revised Social Charter of the Council of Europe are not included in the Charter. </seg>
<seg id=441> It is clear from the debates that have been taking place across Europe, including those in Biarritz, that larger Member States are seeking, in part, to bully smaller Member States to reform the European Union in line with the direction taken by larger Member States and in accordance with their wishes. </seg>
<seg id=442> The negotiators see the fact that there are malcontents on both sides as proof that they are on the way to striking the right balance. </seg>
<seg id=443> The leaders of Europe have not formulated a clear vision. </seg>
<seg id=444> It would be short-sighted to envisage a Commission structured according to criteria based on the representation of the individual States. </seg>
<seg id=445> A Union of this kind would be centralised in character and give the small countries less influence than that which the United States' s two-chamber system gives to small federal states. </seg>
<seg id=446> Following the summit meeting in Sharm-el-Sheikh where all parties involved were present in order to find a way to freeze the violence and to re-open the dialogue between Barak and Arafat, we established that it is very difficult - even if, for a fleeting moment, it seemed as if it were possible - to halt the violence. </seg>
<seg id=447> Clearly, Mr Barón Crespo has been misinformed regarding Italy and my party. </seg>
<seg id=448> It is important to take a step forward on the European energy taxation front, such progress having been blocked hitherto by the unanimity principle. </seg>
<seg id=449> We must not allow things to reach a point where the smaller States fear that there might be recourse to solutions by decree. </seg>
<seg id=450> In my opinion, the Convention did sterling work and I am proud to have been part of this Convention. </seg>
<seg id=451> In the latter case, the question we must answer is when will this principle of a rotation which treats both larger and smaller states on a strictly equal basis come into effect. </seg>
<seg id=452> The extension of qualified majority voting and codecision to real issues, the preservation of Article 250 in its current form, the place and role of the Commission in closer cooperation, in respect of more than just the first pillar: these are some of the factors that will allow us see straight away whether we are talking of success or failure. </seg>
<seg id=453> Mr President, first of all, I wish to thank Jacques, Jacques Delors, and also Altiero Spinelli and Fernand Herman, I wish to thank everyone, from Vaclav Havel to Carlo Ciampi, from Joschka Fischer to Jacques Chirac, from Michel Barnier to Pierre Moscovici, from Chris Patten to Costa Simitis, not to mention Florence and the plethora of current Members of the European Parliament who, since 1999, have carried forward the great movement in favour of an European constitution. </seg>
<seg id=454> Let us not criticise commercial Europe too much, I speak as a Socialist: it provides greater wealth to all of us. </seg>
<seg id=455> Let us at least agree on this objective, and if we do agree, then let us state how to achieve it. </seg>
<seg id=456> Mr President, I have had the satisfaction of noting that the proposals presented recently at the Intergovernmental Conference coincide in the main with all or some of the criteria I have set out. </seg>
<seg id=457> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen of the House, you wanted us to have a debate, this morning, on those issues regarding which this House thought it necessary to add to the opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference that was issued in April. </seg>
<seg id=458> And so, while respecting the existing constitutional framework, I must say I think it would be difficult to envisage more than a procedure for an advisory opinion from Parliament when such measures are adopted. </seg>
<seg id=459> As you know full well, that presupposes our taking certain political decisions, with a scope that goes much farther than meeting the three requirements which I have just mentioned. </seg>
<seg id=460> I myself stressed that the method adopted for the Charter was an avenue worth exploring. </seg>
<seg id=461> But I understand that, behind the linguistic aspect, your question expresses another concern. </seg>
<seg id=462> So that is also why I wished to thank you, as well as to thank you for the form and the content of the initiative you have taken. </seg>
<seg id=463> The implementation of reinforced cooperation must not result in new bodies being set up to swell the ranks of the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id=464> It is time to review the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=465> The European Council is violating this fundamental consensus within Europe, by refusing to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, make it legally binding and denying the citizens, whose rights are being infringed, access to the European Court of Justice. </seg>
<seg id=466> Should we do otherwise, then I do not think a Europe of the citizens will be within our reach. </seg>
<seg id=467> Paragraph 8 states that the constitution will deal with, and I quote, the "issues not settled" . </seg>
<seg id=468> No one has been able to explain to me yet why things are any different now. </seg>
<seg id=469> Second, with regard to an inadequate agenda, which has left out issues that are particularly relevant to the future of the European Union and its citizens' interests. </seg>
<seg id=470> Minister, it is recorded that on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution - an event that was to have such desperate consequences throughout the world - the Russian Orthodox Church was engaged in complex discussions on the design of vestments during Lent. </seg>
<seg id=471> Cooperation must therefore offer all the guarantees proposed by the rapporteur, be open to all the Member States, respect the spirit of the Treaties and not undermine the acquis communautaire. </seg>
<seg id=472> At the same time, there is one point I would like to highlight. I do not think it is right that we should call for or move towards the requirement for a compulsory referendum in every Member State to approve the specific amendments that have been proposed. </seg>
<seg id=473> We have had an in-depth debate on two issues which, although different, converge at one point. </seg>
<seg id=474> We are ready to ensure that it can be put to the vote during the November part-session so that it may, in that way, also be possible for it to be adopted during the French Presidency. </seg>
<seg id=475> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </seg>
<seg id=476> What is the meaning of "the introduction of the opportunity to move towards retirement gradually, via part-time work" , if not a threat to the age of retirement, which is already far too high in many countries? </seg>
<seg id=477> As you know, pensioners, like children, love eating jam. </seg>
<seg id=478> I asked the pensioners who sent me here to the European Parliament to represent the Pensioners' Party whether they would like to drink genetically modified wine. </seg>
<seg id=479> Or even, by way of derogation, for standard material for vegetative propagation to be supplied when demand cannot be met from other categories. </seg>
<seg id=480> I therefore put it to you, Mr President: are not such discrepancies in contributions also a restriction upon free competition in the European Union? </seg>
<seg id=481> We therefore felt bound to vote against the report, which is what we did. </seg>
<seg id=482> Notwithstanding the move towards greater deregulation within the European Union, state aids can still play a constructive role in achieving social and economic progress. </seg>
<seg id=483> That aid could well be indispensable to the protection of the environment and public services and to guaranteeing equal income levels for people living in economically disadvantaged regions. </seg>
<seg id=484> There is a danger, once the EU is safely in control of large state aid, of its turning its attention to small-scale aid on the pretext of the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=485> Section VI, Economic and Social Committee; </seg>
<seg id=486> If you look at the budgetary implementation schedules for headings 2, 3, 4 and 7, then you will note that only an average 8% of all commitments are covered by payments. </seg>
<seg id=487> Three years ago, we launched our employment initiative, which involved helping small and medium-sized enterprises to acquire risk-bearing capital. </seg>
<seg id=488> Parliament' s preferred approach is twofold. </seg>
<seg id=489> Only then will the European institutions do justice to their task. </seg>
<seg id=490> I would like to take this opportunity to expressly thank the Vice-President, Mr Gerhard Schmid, who is responsible for budgetary issues, for his constructive cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=491> We want this committee to retain its viability, but it pays the least attention to Parliament' s demands as part of the budgetary authority. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue. </seg>
<seg id=492> In other words, the year 2001 will see the last full annual budget, and will also form the background to the assessment of the Commission proposal and the proposal that we are in the process of submitting to Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=493> In addition, we want there to be a review of the administrative expenditure. </seg>
<seg id=494> Since 1985 - and I did say 1985 - the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets has been trying to ensure that European Parliament procedures take account of the financial impact of the resolutions voted upon in plenary. </seg>
<seg id=495> I shall end, Mr President, by thanking the other institutions for their diligence in the handling of this joint declaration. </seg>
<seg id=496> You are called on today to decide on a budget that has already been amended at first reading by the Council. </seg>
<seg id=497> Concerning structural operations, overall, the amount set aside for these in the 2000 budget has been maintained. </seg>
<seg id=498> The Council is taking a calm approach to the revision of the financial perspective. </seg>
<seg id=499> If you look at these three different sets of figures, you will see that there are still considerable discrepancies, in purely quantitative terms but obviously as regards content too. </seg>
<seg id=500> I would point out at this juncture that following a long debate last year, a new decision was taken on the comitology procedure, in conjunction with the Council, and I hold out little hope of us being able to reopen this debate. </seg>
<seg id=501> EUR 8.1 billion were earmarked for the MEDA programme in the Berlin financial planning. </seg>
<seg id=502> I should therefore ask both the Council and the Committee on Budgets here in Parliament to think in terms of foreign policy and not only in terms of budget strategy when they concern themselves with foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=503> The second is for aid to victims of human rights violations in need of treatment in specialised institutions. </seg>
<seg id=504> Should a compromise solution be reached on this issue in the time remaining, which supports the important work undertaken by the EMAC Committee, then we can arrange things accordingly, otherwise our committee will keep an open mind on the matter. </seg>
<seg id=505> We only have to look at our television sets to see the difficulties in the Middle East to be reminded of that each and every day. </seg>
<seg id=506> And so I hope that when it comes to tomorrow' s vote, we will still achieve the majority required for the observation point in Dublin </seg>
<seg id=507> Mr President, on behalf of my Committee, I would like to make a few observations, starting with rural policy. </seg>
<seg id=508> We have asked an indicative appropriation of EUR 2 million to be approved for an information campaign on the CFP. </seg>
<seg id=509> The Commission in its executive capacity must negotiate with weighty arguments to achieve a reasonable agreement with Morocco and the Council and the governments concerned should provide a political impetus for this negotiation. </seg>
<seg id=510> Today, we are viewing the 2001 budget with the Serbian population very much at the forefront of our minds. </seg>
<seg id=511> All in all, we would like to see these amendments approved. </seg>
<seg id=512> An important way that the citizens can ensure that their concerns are addressed is by appealing either to the Ombudsman or petitioning Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=513> I turn first to Parliament' s budget. </seg>
<seg id=514> To the surprise of many in my delegation, we established a core strategy unanimously at the beginning of September and the 400 amendments introduced by some of my colleagues came as somewhat of a surprise to many of us in the Budget Committee. </seg>
<seg id=515> It is difficult to see how more posts will solve the problem of management if there are still antiquated and complex procedures both in the Commission and Council for dealing with the many programmes. </seg>
<seg id=516> Parliament has demonstrated repeatedly over the past few years that extreme financial prudence is the bedrock of our work. </seg>
<seg id=517> We cannot have a situation where we talk in a very relaxed manner about commitments over the years, and repeatedly make these promises, but then, when it comes to paying up, say that we are now unable to afford it and will have to cut back a bit in this area! </seg>
<seg id=518> If we only include a few million in the lines - that is about all we can manage - it is just a stalling tactic, because when the people actually come to need it, we withdraw it again. </seg>
<seg id=519> Like the budget before it, Budget 2001 had almost insoluble conflicts to contend with: on the one hand the pressure of consolidation and cost-cutting policy, as agreed under the Interinstitutional Agreement, in order to secure the financing of the enlargement process, and on the other hand, the acute financing needs of the Stability Pact for the Balkans. </seg>
<seg id=520> Demands for improved performance also imply a need for more staff. </seg>
<seg id=521> Had this amendment been adopted in its initial version, it might have started to deal the cards afresh, but the idea was rejected by the majority of the Committee on Budgets. </seg>
<seg id=522> But in that case, unfortunately, there are many examples: special treatment given to associations with declared federalist aims or to the many NGOs whose roles, philosophies and operations are highly questionable, the funding of European political parties, via the sums swallowed up in the Prince programme, in an attempt to convince the citizens of Member States of the validity of the euro at a time when the European currency is experiencing a loss of confidence widely shared by Europeans, from our Danish friends right up to the managers of the European Central Bank. </seg>
<seg id=523> Finally, Mr Heaton-Harris was right to refer in his amendments to the onesidedness of many European programmes, in which the citizen is treated to a propaganda-like tale on European integration, and at the expense of the citizens themselves would you believe. </seg>
<seg id=524> In addition, our administrative systems must be modernised, and it is our duty to lead by example. </seg>
<seg id=525> The MEDA programme, which focuses on the Mediterranean basin, a geographical area of the utmost strategic importance, is a good example of our inability to implement our programmes. </seg>
<seg id=526> When people talk about making reductions or finding the money within category 4 to fund certain priorities, do not forget that Parliament has its priorities, We made that clear in the vote in committee. </seg>
<seg id=527> So that figure will need to be clarified. </seg>
<seg id=528> Thank you very much, Mr Wynn. </seg>
<seg id=529> All it means is that there is a certain flexibility to enable specific policies to go ahead, even if some countries cannot, or do not wish to, participate, and what is true for the European Union' s Member States is also true for the candidate countries. </seg>
<seg id=530> I think Austria has no call for complaint regarding what has been done, quite the contrary. </seg>
<seg id=531> Recommendations from regional organisations and the experience of neighbouring countries will doubtless be able to assist in defining these means. </seg>
<seg id=532> In 1984, 0.2% of landowners in Colombia owned 32% of the land. </seg>
<seg id=533> The Council is not here to make comments on every aspect of this extremely sensitive and painful issue. </seg>
<seg id=534> At the same time, it is just not possible to undertake an ad hoc debate on matters like this, which are, let me repeat, extremely complex ones. </seg>
<seg id=535> Question No 10 by (H-0722/00): </seg>
<seg id=536> I shall therefore beware of giving a definitive answer to this difficult question. </seg>
<seg id=537> It is just that we get the impression, and your answer testifies to this somewhat, that the Council Presidency is not being very proactive in dealing with this issue. </seg>
<seg id=538> So, clearly, the revenue from this levy will not be zero. </seg>
<seg id=539> I also excuse them, but we shall apply the Rules of Procedure. </seg>
<seg id=540> The reason why we have been quiet here on the right is therefore that we have already examined these matters once and, in our opinion, we do not need to talk about the same issues over and over again in this Chamber and use up our precious time doing so. </seg>
<seg id=541> Moreover, in anticipation of adopting this directive on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a decision on the prohibition of the use of material presenting risks as regards these diseases was taken in June 2000, in order to stop any further spreading of the epidemic and in order to guarantee the highest possible health protection standards for the consumer. </seg>
<seg id=542> I do not have any information other than that I have already given you. </seg>
<seg id=543> We monitor, and we are familiar with, the work done by the Commission and the Council on the Erika 1 package, but regarding this strait, which is notorious in the two countries concerned and within the European Union as a particularly tricky passage, one often used by large vessels in order to gain just a few hours at the risk of some old tub' s running aground and causing a disaster, I should like to know, and more especially the inhabitants of Corsica and Sardinia would like to know, if it will be at all possible, and if you have any such plans, to issue a ban, pure and simple, on large vessels, containers, using the Strait of Bonifacio. </seg>
<seg id=544> I therefore believe that, in principle, we ought to support the Commission proposals for revising their staffing policy. </seg>
<seg id=545> New money is needed in the budget for Serbia and Kosovo. </seg>
<seg id=546> I hope, Mr President, and this is my concluding remark, that we are at least going to cut the EUR 50 million budget lines financing the Israel-PLO peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id=547> Therefore, in the European Parliament, we will propose new measures, not so much aimed at seeking new funding - which we already know cannot be implemented under current conditions - but at establishing new institutional commitments that will improve the quality of spending and ensure that not a single euro is wasted. </seg>
<seg id=548> Consider the fact that, in European policy, as in any other field, sometimes the moderate options cease to be the majority options. </seg>
<seg id=549> It is designed to obscure rather than enlighten and I have been disappointed by the attitude adopted today with respect to activity-based budgeting. </seg>
<seg id=550> When, however, expenses are allocated according to activity, this also paves the way for the Budget' s being seen more in terms of a political tool, in which the distribution of expenditure reflects clear political priorities. </seg>
<seg id=551> So let us therefore find a solution which will last for several years so that, next year and the year after that too, we do not have to go through this discussion as to how we are to find money for reconstruction in the Balkans. </seg>
<seg id=552> Those with an interest in developing a sustainable agricultural sector will be aware that the central thrust of recent reform as agreed in Berlin is a continuing move from commodity support to direct income support for farmers. </seg>
<seg id=553> A budget is always more than a mere juggling with figures. </seg>
<seg id=554> In the final analysis, it is immoral to cut spending on agricultural policy, on the MEDA programme and on the socially excluded, in order to find the resources to finance the European Union' s commitments in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id=555> To put it simply: the people of Serbia ought neither to freeze nor to go hungry this winter. </seg>
<seg id=556> I would also like to express my concern about the fact that the various Youth Parliaments have been included in the Socrates programme. </seg>
<seg id=557> It must also, of course, be made clear to the Council that it also has its share of responsibility for the deficiencies in the way that many external programmes have been handled. </seg>
<seg id=558> A stable solution is now required when it comes to these contributions and, to a still greater degree, to the long-term planning for the whole of the Western Balkans which is now necessary. </seg>
<seg id=559> I believe that most people are prepared to accept this, on the understanding that the money is used in the right way. </seg>
<seg id=560> I share the concerns and opinions that the rapporteur, Mrs Rühle, mentioned this afternoon regarding the sections on research and social measures. </seg>
<seg id=561> Two weeks ago we had the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly. </seg>
<seg id=562> At the same time, budget funds from the Research and Information Fund ought to be made available for the purpose of researching into alternative forms of production for farmers who at present cultivate tobacco, and this is something we want to see happen. </seg>
<seg id=563> I want to make it very clear that the European Union, insofar as Northern Ireland is concerned, has had the most direct and positive influence imaginable. </seg>
<seg id=564> In this model, respect for standards and procedures is guaranteed by an independent authority and final jurisdiction lies with the judges. </seg>
<seg id=565> Thus, for the first time, codecision will apply at the first reading to an extremely complex text which is full of technical difficulties on the particularly sensitive sector of the protection of civil liberties. </seg>
<seg id=566> The fact that their tasks have not been combined is extremely positive. </seg>
<seg id=567> Are you aware, for instance, that the Schengen system has amassed over ten million files on almost one and a half million citizens, and that Europol, whose sphere of competence is being incessantly expanded, has a central database of information from the various police forces of the fifteen Member States, all this supervised only by an authority with neither the powers nor the resources available to it to enable it to carry out another task properly. </seg>
<seg id=568> Having said that, I would like to take advantage of the fact that the Commissioner is here to say that it would appear appropriate to concern ourselves not only with protecting citizens in respect of new technologies but also with the use of these technologies to increase the European citizens' means of intervening and interacting with the European institutions. </seg>
<seg id=569> Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4 to 10, 12 to 40, 42 to 54, 57, 58 and 60 to 64 reflect the Council text on the points to which the Commission can give its assent. </seg>
<seg id=570> It goes without saying, then, that his opinion on the legislative proposals to do with the protection of personal data will be very valuable insofar as it will be a major contribution to the legislative debate between institutions. </seg>
<seg id=571> The Treaty recognises that the outermost regions have a difficult economic and social situation, aggravated by special handicaps which, because they are continual and combined, are extremely prejudicial to development in these regions. </seg>
<seg id=572> In this way it will contribute to promoting economic and social progress thanks to an increased level of employment. </seg>
<seg id=573> I therefore congratulate Mrs Sudre, and we wait with great interest for the Commission' s proposals to be developed into rules, so that the specific characteristics can soon be taken into account, as established in paragraph 2 of Article 299 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. </seg>
<seg id=574> For many Europeans, some outermost regions are nothing more than a holiday destination on the map. </seg>
<seg id=575> Our unemployment levels are among the highest in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=576> I am pleased to see that the committee has adopted the bulk of the amendment I tabled. </seg>
<seg id=577> In my opinion, it is very important that the outermost regions are integrated into the trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks. </seg>
<seg id=578> The unanimous approval by the members of the Committee on Regional Policy of the report presented by Mrs Sudre demonstrates the European Parliament' s adherence to one of its most important commitments. </seg>
<seg id=579> We cannot debate a whole series of circumstances and imagine that, once that ideal and idyllic point, let us call it, has been reached, it will no longer be necessary to adopt more measures for the treatment of these three areas and particularly of the outermost regions that we are discussing today. </seg>
<seg id=580> This article, ladies and gentlemen, although it does not enable us to do everything, at least allows us to step up or action, and I believe it is necessary to expand and improve our schemes. </seg>
<seg id=581> In terms of drawing up the necessary proposals, the Commission is, obviously, working in collaboration with the Member States and regions concerned. </seg>
<seg id=582> In these regions, as we know, there are long-term problems and I therefore believe that, objectively, in accordance with their actual level of development, they need long-term support from regional policy and special measures. </seg>
<seg id=583> It would again be possible to organise a meeting of this kind in 2001, by which time we shall have made more progress in carrying out the programme presented in March. </seg>
<seg id=584> The Presidency declared that closed and I fully accept that. </seg>
<seg id=585> I believe it is as well for Parliament to keep to the current Rules because, as another Member rightly said, very often it is not the machines that did not work but the Members that forgot to vote; if we were able to correct a vote after the event, we would never see the end of it. </seg>
<seg id=586> I am clearly what I eat. </seg>
<seg id=587> All in all, Commissioner, along with the authority, the relevant Commission services must, in collaboration and coordination with the Member States, establish a system of efficient, standardised controls throughout the food chain, and the network of food laboratories in the European Union must be improved and their work coordinated with the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=588> As duplication of the work and of scientific research must be avoided, we need to collaborate with national research institutes and the joint research centres. </seg>
<seg id=589> Today we are discussing a White Paper and it is useful to define a few first principles. </seg>
<seg id=590> Those procedures have now been amended and changed and we have our own Food Standards Agency. </seg>
<seg id=591> Finally, we will also be supporting a number of the new amendments, certainly Amendments Nos 11-13, 7-9 and we wish to have a free vote on Amendment No 14. </seg>
<seg id=592> It is against this background that I would first of all like to say that food safety guarantees hinge on strict inspections organised by the state, and those inspections are only as strong as the weakest link. </seg>
<seg id=593> The subject which we are debating clearly illustrates just how superficial and empty our debate on the political unification of Europe is. </seg>
<seg id=594> So let us entrust the European Food Safety Agency only with conducting scientific risk analysis, in liaison with our national agencies. </seg>
<seg id=595> If one charts the progress of the main food-borne diseases which currently affect Europe, most actually made their first appearance in the Americas. </seg>
<seg id=596> However, the conditions for appealing to the Agency must be drawn up so that efficient and swift action is guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id=597> It should also be said, as some of the previous speakers have done, and in particular Mr Whitehead and Mrs Gebhardt, that the White Paper is more than just another set of EU rules and regulations. </seg>
<seg id=598> Mr President, I feel very pleased today and grateful both towards the Commission, for having embarked upon the work on better food safety, and towards Mr Bowis and the whole of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </seg>
<seg id=599> I think that Amendment No 17 is particularly important, stating that the consumer organisations must be consulted. </seg>
<seg id=600> A further aspect is the organic revision of the labelling rules for both wholesale and retail selling, which will at last provide the consumer with correct information regarding products' traceability and make it possible to identify where responsibility lies in the event of risk or crises. </seg>
<seg id=601> In my view, drafting new legislation is not the right response to non-compliance with existing legislation. </seg>
<seg id=602> With the vote in the Committee on the Environment, we have succeeded in re-establishing a certain balance, including in the scope of the resolution nutrition issues and certain significant references to the role of small and medium-sized businesses in safeguarding diverse dietary habits. </seg>
<seg id=603> Mr President, I would like to join with other colleagues in complimenting the rapporteur, Mr Bowis for his very constructive and very logical approach to this particular problem. </seg>
<seg id=604> Mr President, the fact that the White Paper on food safety has no intrinsic legislative value does not in any way detract from the dual purpose which it undoubtedly serves. </seg>
<seg id=605> The rapporteur, along with many MEPs in the Committee, including myself, have placed the focus on the food authority and this is regrettable to some extent. </seg>
<seg id=606> Self-sufficiency and the independence of the unit will serve the interests of European consumers best. </seg>
<seg id=607> I have on many an occasion throughout this process thought that we were lucky when we chose him to draw up the report. </seg>
<seg id=608> Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on the huge effort which he made in his report to take account of everyone's view and for agreeing that we should also refer to the more general concept of food. </seg>
<seg id=609> Finally, the European Government should not escape its responsibility. </seg>
<seg id=610> Most important of all, it should gain the respect of its peers, the confidence of the public and the willingness of Member State governments to accept its conclusions. </seg>
<seg id=611> That is how I see the future role of a Food Safety Agency. </seg>
<seg id=612> We have the World Health Organisation in Geneva. </seg>
<seg id=613> I will not deny that when the White Paper was published, I spoke out against the Agency. </seg>
<seg id=614> We must therefore ensure that the European Union has the highest possible food safety standards, but in taking this approach - which we unanimously uphold - we must also analyse the economic implications for the sectors involved in production. </seg>
<seg id=615> The tasks will then involve independent scientific research, advice, independent inspections and a rapid alert system, but definitely coordination too, in order to restore confidence. </seg>
<seg id=616> As an aside, I can say of the speakers who referred to the need for sensitivity in relation to the promotion of local food specialities and traditional foods that this issue is addressed in the hygiene legislation. </seg>
<seg id=617> This will facilitate the Commission's task in bringing forward a balanced proposal that takes maximum account of the views of Parliament and the many stakeholders in the area of food safety. </seg>
<seg id=618> Far from it. In recent years, this issue was one of the driving forces which led to the signing of the Ottawa Convention. </seg>
<seg id=619> I restate my position opposing Amendments Nos 10 and 19, in the interests of budgetary cohesion and, with regard to Amendment No 29, I call for split voting in order to improve the formulation throughout the text, for I feel that it has suffered from some misinterpretation. </seg>
<seg id=620> This raises the first question: the need for the European Union, especially the Commission, to do everything possible to encourage non-signatory countries to sign the Ottawa Convention. </seg>
<seg id=621> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know what the consequences of anti-personnel mines are, even if there may often be important military justifications for them in individual cases. </seg>
<seg id=622> It was Parliament which first raised, in 1996, the issue of a horizontal budget line and of a proper legal base to provide a single platform for the wide range of actions that we undertake in this important field. </seg>
<seg id=623> But I cannot hide this fact: the Union's powers of persuasion in seeking to achieve this goal are obviously somewhat limited by the remaining difficulties of some Member States in signing and ratifying the Convention. </seg>
<seg id=624> Mine action is most effective when it is tailored to the conditions which are specific to each situation. </seg>
<seg id=625> Parliament knows that there are far too many of them already and as the House knows, under our proposals for the reform of EC external assistance, we hope to move away from the heavy handed scrutiny of individual projects and instead focus our discussion with Member States on overall strategies and programming. </seg>
<seg id=626> NGOs have sprouted up in response to the need and yet, some four years after the first United Nation's landmine conference in Geneva and over a year after the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention, we must recognise that many countries and thousands of people, usually in the poorest regions of the world, are still terribly afflicted by anti-personnel landmines and unexploded munitions. </seg>
<seg id=627> The Commission needs to improve both the quality of its programmes and their speed of implementation. </seg>
<seg id=628> I believe, however, that if you were to study them again with more care, you would find that there are a few amendments you quoted which, in my view, concern the awareness campaigns, transparency, access for NGOs, as well as things which are going well at the moment but which could run more efficiently. </seg>
<seg id=629> Mrs Bonino and Mr Patten are also right to say that Parliament and the Council should not interfere with the administration, and I listened carefully to Mr Patten' s remarks on this point for he obviously thinks we should interfere still less. </seg>
<seg id=630> Mr President, our group has a history of calling for the entire spectrum of measures and action needed, from suspending production to destroying stocks, stopping trading, clearing mine fields, rehabilitating victims and raising public awareness. </seg>
<seg id=631> Then it is up to the States to support the process in international fora. </seg>
<seg id=632> Mines are of course a great obstacle to reconstruction in these countries and to the return of refugees. </seg>
<seg id=633> At the current de-mining rate it would - as was mentioned earlier - take well over 100 years to clear the planet of anti-personnel landmines. </seg>
<seg id=634> The third area I have in mind concerns specific measures that ought to be proposed, examined and implemented. </seg>
<seg id=635> Every child that we can protect from death or terrible injuries because of mines, be it in Bosnia, Africa or elsewhere, makes all our efforts worthwhile. </seg>
<seg id=636> We must indeed put pressure on those European Union countries that have not signed it, like Finland, or not ratified it, like Greece. </seg>
<seg id=637> Ladies and gentlemen, just look at Finland. </seg>
<seg id=638> Lastly, I hope that among the future tasks of the European common military force will be the training of technicians, particularly of people with a local interest in the eradication of landmines. </seg>
<seg id=639> Nor is emphasis given to the fact that the list of countries most seriously affected mainly comprises developing countries. </seg>
<seg id=640> Parliament' s proposals could not be more at odds with the aims of Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id=641> Mrs Van Lancker wants Parliament to decide whether to alter the Commission' s proposal, mainly through, firstly, adding a number of areas to which legislation is applicable and, secondly, through establishing a number of rights at European level. </seg>
<seg id=642> For example, the Luxembourg process which applies to employment policy is to be extended to social protection and social exclusion. </seg>
<seg id=643> The major powers, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and, to some extent, Italy, are all agreed in their desire to dominate the small countries of Eastern or Southern Europe that are applying for accession to the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=644> However, for legal reasons we think that it is wrong to refer to it at this early stage in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, because it was not possible to reach formal agreement on it within the convention, reflecting its structure, and it therefore has no legal status. </seg>
<seg id=645> Inclusion of new text into the Treaties is likely to create legal confusion. </seg>
<seg id=646> Elsewhere, the rapporteur repeats the new theory in vogue in Brussels of the supposed dual legitimacy of the European Union: that of the citizens represented by the European Parliament and that of the States represented by the Council. </seg>
<seg id=647> The Swedish and Danish Social Democrats have today voted against Oliver Duhamel' s report on incorporating the Treaties into a constitution. </seg>
<seg id=648> To this end, it is essential that the European Union should move towards a Constitution that incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </seg>
<seg id=649> A constitution would be meaningful only if it formed the democratic framework for a genuine European federation, a United States of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=650> He told us that he, like the majority of politicians, had been given to believe that we would prefer our relations with other countries to be governed by international treaty. </seg>
<seg id=651> I welcome Mr Duhamel' s report as an interesting and constructive contribution to the idea of constitutionalisation of the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=652> We think a re-organising of the Treaties and their simplification would make it easier for citizens to see clearly the field of EU responsibilities - and their limits - as well as the procedures for exercising these responsibilities. </seg>
<seg id=653> Until the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, Europe was an intergovernmental super-syndicate. </seg>
<seg id=654> The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is voting against Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado' s report on enhanced cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=655> It reflects far too monolithic a concept of the Union, under which all forms of cooperation would have to operate within a 'single institutional framework' and would necessarily be directed towards the objective creating a super-state. </seg>
<seg id=656> So we must avoid slowing down the general pace and therefore allow some Member States to move forward by developing the mechanism of reinforced cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=657> The operating structures of the internal market have been a success ever since the early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id=658> European cooperation can be useful in solving cross-border problems. </seg>
<seg id=659> These regions could act as a wonderful laboratory in terms of sustainable development. </seg>
<seg id=660> The technocrats, the European judges, wanted to abolish the 'dock dues' , which provide resources for our municipalities in the French overseas departments and, in particular, protect our traditional workforce. </seg>
<seg id=661> France, on the other hand, owns overseas departments in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean. </seg>
<seg id=662> It is vital to its credibility that it is independent. </seg>
<seg id=663> Our vote has thus clarified the composition of the future European Agency, while also setting out our specific requirements regarding its funding and its independence. </seg>
<seg id=664> Secondly, the European agency must be completely independent. </seg>
<seg id=665> We have to bear in mind the type of practices employed in farming and the food industry, the problem of imported foodstuffs, the composition of the ingredients of animal feedingstuffs, the maximum levels of dioxins and pesticide residues, food additives and other matters, giving priority to food safety. </seg>
<seg id=666> We voted for Amendment No 15 because we are very strongly committed to defending the European cultural heritage in relation to locally produced food. </seg>
<seg id=667> We have no margins in virtually all the categories. </seg>
<seg id=668> There too we should now like to place 50% against the budget line and 50% in the reserve. </seg>
<seg id=669> Yet, I have noticed that proposals have also been moved here to reduce the budget. </seg>
<seg id=670> Report (A5-0300/2000) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2001 - Section III, Commission [C5-0300/2000 - 1999/2190(BUD)] </seg>
<seg id=671> Madam President, my name appears as a signatory to various amendments on this report. </seg>
<seg id=672> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </seg>
<seg id=673> The real surprise in this budget relates to external actions, where selfishness and stinginess are the rule. </seg>
<seg id=674> Funds can also be released through mobilisation of the flexibility instrument. </seg>
<seg id=675> I voted against the Haug report, just as I voted in favour of my group' s motion to reject the general budget for 2001. </seg>
<seg id=676> We refer in particular to the new pilot scheme to finance information measures in the fight against paedophilia. </seg>
<seg id=677> That, if anything, demonstrates the low level of motivation that this EU project has, even among politically active citizens. </seg>
<seg id=678> So 20 to 30% of the contracts will again be offered to private competition. </seg>
<seg id=679> Since this is not guaranteed in this report, I voted against it. </seg>
<seg id=680> Add the unacceptably low national thresholds which decimate subsidies to the proposed reductions in withdrawals to 5% for citrus fruits, 8.5% for apples and pears and 10% for other fruit and vegetables in marketable quantities, and it soon becomes clear that there will be no way of disposing of very large quantities of processable fruits and vegetables with the result that overall prices will drop and the crops will be left to rot in the fields and in the cooperative packaging shops, forcing farmers to uproot their crops. </seg>
<seg id=681> I voted in favour of this report because it lives up to the expectations of Portuguese organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector, which have called for a drastic overhaul of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables, which they consider to be extremely damaging to our national interests. </seg>
<seg id=682> Johan Van Hecke Report (A5-0296/2000) </seg>
<seg id=683> The root of the problem lies in the fact that everything, including the quality of the environment and the climate, is sacrificed to capitalist exploitation of wealth-producing resources and excessive profit. </seg>
<seg id=684> Kyoto' s guiding principle was that the rich countries would keep their own atmosphere clean, although they were allowed, up to a point, to add the emission which they were helping reduce elsewhere to their own table of results. </seg>
<seg id=685> The fight against the greenhouse effect is a major challenge for the industrialised countries and constitutes a specific duty in respect of the peoples of the developing world who are already paying for the consequences of global warming. </seg>
<seg id=686> The trick is to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a judicious manner. </seg>
<seg id=687> We also need to safeguard and strengthen efforts to identify substances which are suspected of being endocrine disrupters, perhaps within a legislative framework. </seg>
<seg id=688> The consumer and SME do not benefit enough from the internal market which was completed following the introduction of the euro. </seg>
<seg id=689> After all, banks have so far been obliged by the Member States to notify their central banks of any cross-border payments over EUR 12 500, for the benefit of balance of payment reporting statistics. </seg>
<seg id=690> Needless to say, these companies will be subject to the same strict conditions in terms of security and money-laundering. </seg>
<seg id=691> We even know of cases in which transfer fees for cross-border payments increased when the euro was introduced, and not only by a modest amount. </seg>
<seg id=692> The European Central Bank could help by creating a single European data format for credit transfers and by supporting moves to create a uniform European bank sort code within the international IBAN system. </seg>
<seg id=693> It is crucial for consumers to accept the euro. </seg>
<seg id=694> Madam President, Mrs Peijs' report on retail payments in the internal market takes up Parliament' s longstanding complaint about the high cost of cross-border payments within the Union. </seg>
<seg id=695> The Peijs report makes the point in recital D of the motion for a resolution, and I quote: 'the high level of charges for cross-border credit transfers is damaging the confidence of consumers in the euro' . </seg>
<seg id=696> We therefore have much to do in this area but the political resources and remedies politicians possess to deal with that are fewer than those we are able to employ to resolve this problem of Internal Market payments. </seg>
<seg id=697> In the future, the euro area will also feel like a domestic area and the public do not understand why in this area, in which there are no exchange-related risks and in which electronic payments with Internet banking are increasingly becoming a matter of course, transferring money from Munich to Salzburg is considerably more expensive than transferring money from Munich to Kiel. </seg>
<seg id=698> Both the Commission and Parliament will need to invest many more years of work in order to realise this objective. </seg>
<seg id=699> On that occasion, we will also be looking into reducing the implementation period for cross-border transfers, which Mrs Peijs calls for in her report. </seg>
<seg id=700> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=701> It does seem sound policy to favour a pragmatic and hands-on approach, putting the small business at the heart of the system, rather than a proposal merely producing balanced statistics that are quite impossible to use in practice, on the pretext of avoiding a scattershot approach. </seg>
<seg id=702> But I have three specific comments on this programme. </seg>
<seg id=703> Bear in mind that the first Community action programme in this area was adopted in 1983, seventeen years ago. </seg>
<seg id=704> In addition, I have always been an advocate of underpinning these goals with efficient and pragmatic policy. </seg>
<seg id=705> They are the true economic and innovation vanguard, in the front line and openly exposed to the risks inherent in this domain. </seg>
<seg id=706> We must take account of the results of and follow-up to the work of the Science and Governance Conference held last week in Brussels under the auspices of the Seville Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, because there is plenty of overlap with the subject we are dealing with today. </seg>
<seg id=707> The rapporteur has listed a number of key points in a bid to strengthen the European entrepreneurial climate. </seg>
<seg id=708> This is excellent for Europe because help can be given quickly and competently in the form of technically correct information. </seg>
<seg id=709> Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Montfort for the excellent work she has done. </seg>
<seg id=710> The importance is to strike the right balance, to avoid having a continual situation of people failing at the expense of other people. </seg>
<seg id=711> This is unjust and I therefore support this report. </seg>
<seg id=712> It is also the guiding principle of the Charter for Small Enterprises. </seg>
<seg id=713> The programme will ensure that the networks provide this information. </seg>
<seg id=714> Clearly, the basic objective of the plan is to stem migration towards the Member States of the European Union and repatriate illegal immigrants living in the Union. </seg>
<seg id=715> I particularly stress the need to take steps to improve internal security, strengthen dialogue between European officials and local authorities in Albania and, as far as the Commission and Council are concerned, to promote specific action involving cooperation with the Albanian, Italian and Greek authorities. </seg>
<seg id=716> The poor social, economic and political conditions combined with a lack of or insufficient legal certainty and organised crime are causing migration on a huge scale. </seg>
<seg id=717> Mr President, unlike Mrs Pack, I am of the opinion that the more groups that are involved in Albania the better. </seg>
<seg id=718> Clearly, there is no instant solution to be found to the entire problem, but in the slightly longer term it is a matter of creating a world of reasonable justice, of security and of opportunities for the future. </seg>
<seg id=719> There is also a chasm between the donors, that is to say all of us, Europe and the United States, who give money, organise projects and such like, and the actual people in the field. </seg>
<seg id=720> Let us make use of bilateral agreements to define jobs, periods of residency, places of residency, pay, hours, working and national insurance conditions clearly and legally, so that immigrants can prove their strength and help to improve our economies and build friendship and cooperation between peoples, rather than nationalist, cold-war aspirations. </seg>
<seg id=721> Some of the people being sent back have integrated well. </seg>
<seg id=722> The main area of focus must not be how the flood of immigrants and refugees may be brought under control, but how conditions in the region can be improved so that people can stay in their homes. </seg>
<seg id=723> Mr President, I agree with Mr Dimitrakopoulos that the central issue in respect of the problems in Albania - be these of an economic, social or internal security nature - continues to be that of helping that country to reinstate the rule of law, bring security to the citizens, and restore the credibility of institutions and local administrations. </seg>
<seg id=724> Like Mr Lisi, I believe that we need to incorporate burden-sharing in our policy on asylum and refugees. </seg>
<seg id=725> The action plan for Albania and its neighbouring regions was adopted in June this year and it is thus the sixth in order. </seg>
<seg id=726> There, frustration with, but also alienation from, European law becomes apparent from time to time, and we should like to urge Parliament, but also the other Community institutions, not to shy away from paying painstaking attention to detail here, to work with precision, and also to make the necessary time and staff available to do this. </seg>
<seg id=727> With this report we want to send out a signal to the public that we are taking their complaints about the deficient quality of lawmaking and the complaints about over-regionalisation and centralism seriously. </seg>
<seg id=728> It is of course quite a significant topic, although this is not immediately evident from the small number of members present in this Chamber to continue with the debate. </seg>
<seg id=729> In addition, and vitally, the report raises the issue of subsidiarity, which is in some measure controversial in this Chamber tonight. </seg>
<seg id=730> It would also be very worthwhile if the Commission could make an inventory of the existing body of law in the light of that principle, to make it simpler, more transparent, more effective and more relevant, and to repeal superfluous texts, as Paragraph 6 of this report invites it to do. </seg>
<seg id=731> Having studied the report with great care, I have come to the conclusion that it is not even a political principle: it is a theological principle. </seg>
<seg id=732> Observance of the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be guaranteed right down to the smallest communities, to autonomous units, to intermediate groups, social groups, families and citizens who are the only true sovereign power when it comes to legislative and administrative action. </seg>
<seg id=733> Let me, then, give an overall view. </seg>
<seg id=734> I give the floor to the Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=735> Is that an area where we should go for detailed regulation, with guarantees that will be implemented everywhere or should we consider whether a voluntary agreement, provided that it can be enforced and controlled, as an alternative? </seg>
<seg id=736> I voted in favour of the report, despite the fact that I did not get a number of amendments through, because it also concerns the excessively high exchange and transfer costs in the euro area. </seg>
<seg id=737> If, in 15 months' time, the same coins and notes are introduced in 11 Member States, it will be more expensive to get hold of that single currency outside the country in which you live. </seg>
<seg id=738> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by lamenting the fact that the Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr Fischler, cannot be here today. </seg>
<seg id=739> It must be an agreement which provides an impetus for fisheries cooperation and the Moroccan fishing industry, but which also fully satisfies the fisheries interests of the European fleets. </seg>
<seg id=740> Consequently, we have reached a consensus to work together with a view to achieving a responsible partnership, and Morocco will give its views at a meeting to be held, as you have already pointed out, in Brussels, on 30 October, that is, on Monday. </seg>
<seg id=741> A few weeks ago, I myself was in Algeciras on the southern coast of Spain, which is not far from Morocco. </seg>
<seg id=742> Time has taught us that this could turn from being difficult to being impossible. </seg>
<seg id=743> By means of the fisheries agreements, the European Union is able to engage in fishing operations and exchange fishing rights with third countries. </seg>
<seg id=744> I was reading in a Swedish fishing trade journal about how one of these boats lands its catch in El Aaiún, described as a Moroccan harbour. </seg>
<seg id=745> In fact, all our fishing agreements are being called into question not just those with Morocco, as there is also Mauritania and soon there will be Guinea among others to consider. </seg>
<seg id=746> It has taken eleven months to arrive at the inflexible positions that we have today and the meeting on the 30th, and in this respect we should value the latest measures from Commissioner Fischler, the results of his trip to Morocco on the 26th of last month and the high level meetings that took place, including the one with the King himself. </seg>
<seg id=747> However, I would like to convey a few brief messages to the Commission, which is worthily represented today by Commissioner Busquin. </seg>
<seg id=748> My question to the Commission is this: if an agreement is not reached with Morocco, or if this agreement is concluded under the terms indicated by the Commission, an agreement that stimulates Moroccan production, is the Commission planning to adopt structural measures to compensate for the losses that will occur in the regions affected. </seg>
<seg id=749> As we imagined, the difficulties in negotiating with the Moroccan authorities have been considerable. </seg>
<seg id=750> Lastly, in the undesirable event that negotiations should fail, the Union has a political and moral duty to support the fishermen and shipowners with a reasonable amount of aid that will ensure that they have the means to live. </seg>
<seg id=751> We have to resolve the overcapacity situation in the EU fisheries industry. </seg>
<seg id=752> That is why we need to forge close economic and political relations with Morocco as quickly as possible, while at the same time defending our European fisheries interests. </seg>
<seg id=753> That is why the Commission is working on the basis of a new partnership aimed at an interesting development between the two parties involving, on the one hand, the development of the entire Moroccan fishing industry, the fleet, aquaculture, commercial processing and research and, on the other, providing European fishermen with fishing opportunities. </seg>
<seg id=754> Rights of language teachers </seg>
<seg id=755> " It is not only in German that this makes a clear difference. </seg>
<seg id=756> In July 1999, the Commission brought this infringement procedure before the Court of Justice. </seg>
<seg id=757> Therefore, until we manage to harmonise the laws - which we hope to do - respect for the principle of subsidiarity for the moment means that it is impossible on the grounds of discrimination to do away with something which is in all probability a request for a privilege. </seg>
<seg id=758> We can perhaps accept that the previous Commission under Mr Santer was not the best, so that is why it went. </seg>
<seg id=759> Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market from all over the Union and from all the parties have come together to say that it is no use talking about rights, advocating charters of rights if you do not, in real cases when people's rights are denied, take effective action to get them recognised and to get them enforced, and that is the problem in this case. </seg>
<seg id=760> This is quite unacceptable in a modern Europe. </seg>
<seg id=761> Obviously education still comes under subsidiarity but, within the framework of the Treaties, the freedom of movement of workers and the ban on discrimination apply to everyone, although we - and I in particular, coming as I do from a highly federalist state - support the principle of subsidiarity as a principle of order in our dealings with the European Union and do what we can so that powers are divided as quickly as possible between the levels in Europe in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. </seg>
<seg id=762> In this context, it can no longer be a question of discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=763> Mr President, would you go for treatment to somebody who knows all the surgical terms in Italian, English, French and German, or would you go to a surgeon? </seg>
<seg id=764> (The sitting was closed at 10.56 a.m.) </seg>
<seg id=765> We extend our deepest sympathies to them. </seg>
<seg id=766> I will now give the floor to Mr Ceyhun, who will speak in his capacity as rapporteur and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. </seg>
<seg id=767> With regard to the statements by the Council and the Commission on the third Asia-Europe Meeting, the Council has informed us that it does not wish to speak for the moment. </seg>
<seg id=768> Therefore, under the Treaties and under the Euratom Treaty this issue falls within the competence of the Commission; it affects or may affect many citizens who are not just Spanish, because in this area and its surroundings - and there is no emergency plan in place - there are hundreds of thousands of European citizens from the fifteen countries of the Union as well as many people from outside, because this is the Costa del Sol. </seg>
<seg id=769> Madam President, it is sad but very enlightening to learn from the Spanish Minister of the Interior, Mr Mayor Oreja, that there is no point in talking with Basque nationalists, even if a new cease-fire were to take place in the future. </seg>
<seg id=770> May I ask that we consider, this week, a Commission statement on the decision of the UK government to introduce a discriminatory tax on non-British road hauliers. </seg>
<seg id=771> Since the allegedly liberal parties, including the European liberal parties, always tend to ally themselves with parties of xenophobic, racist, authoritarian inspiration, I feel that this is not only a serious danger for Italy, but also an indication of something which concerns the whole of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=772> The report also contains some criticism, however, of the French proposal. </seg>
<seg id=773> These requests are covered in Amendments Nos 2 and 4 of Mrs Karamanou' s report. </seg>
<seg id=774> The initiative from the French Presidency that we are examining today is aimed at improving the two blanket conventions on mutual assistance in criminal matters that I have just mentioned, specifically in the field of combating money laundering. </seg>
<seg id=775> In this respect, I can only say that if the concept of combating money laundering is damaged, then this is the fault of the Council and not of Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=776> We can but congratulate them on their work. </seg>
<seg id=777> The way forward, as Mr Marinho says - and I agree with him - is communitisation. </seg>
<seg id=778> Everybody who has spoken agrees that it is a very valuable initiative and we support what it says. </seg>
<seg id=779> What we need is for Europol to be given operational capability across frontiers. </seg>
<seg id=780> There is too much of that in our contemporary Europe and before I give my support to a headlong rush to mutual recognition, I would like to see common recognition of fair standards. </seg>
<seg id=781> I realise it is very difficult because here we have to construct something from a scattering of instruments. </seg>
<seg id=782> However, it is also necessary if we are to strengthen the attractiveness of the European Union as a location for business; moreover it is something which the public wants and we must respect their wishes because the people who live in the European Union have a right to security. </seg>
<seg id=783> In the European Union, we must continue to fight resolutely against money laundering, in the knowledge that, particularly after the creation of the single market and the liberalisation of the capital and financial services markets, there needs to be effective police and judicial cooperation between Member States which is as efficient as possible. </seg>
<seg id=784> There is no reason to assume that, if a lawyer is acting as a financial adviser, he or she is not exercising his or her profession. </seg>
<seg id=785> By the same token, I wish to say that I am aware of the sensitiveness of the issue raised by various Members about the conditions in which the confidentiality of the legal professions may constitute a justified refusal to cooperate in the fight against money laundering. </seg>
<seg id=786> This is especially true of serious, very serious and cross-border crimes. </seg>
<seg id=787> Overall the task is so great and so important that it cannot be overseen by the Council alone. </seg>
<seg id=788> It follows that citizens' rights must be reinforced by adopting an effective instrument and recognising the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, not least with regard to its right of interpretation and its power to decide on a case or not. </seg>
<seg id=789> Therefore, whilst I support more cooperation and coordination, I think making this a legislative system would be wrong and we would oppose it. </seg>
<seg id=790> The second point is also interesting, of course. </seg>
<seg id=791> This is a positive development, and it is therefore gratifying that there should be so much support for it in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=792> I will take the opportunity - since several Members have raised very delicate issues - to tell you quite frankly that, as Mr Coelho has just said, we primarily view this initiative as an opening initiative that demonstrates the political will of the Council to make up the ground lost in the field of judicial cooperation in comparison to police cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=793> And this is why I also see in this an important tool for ensuring judicial control of Europol. </seg>
<seg id=794> The FAIR Programme - Fisheries, Agriculture and Agro-Industrial Research - was part of the fourth Framework Programme which ran from 1994 to 1998. </seg>
<seg id=795> Given the importance of the research programme for agriculture and fisheries, it is regrettable that some problems were identified in connection with the organisation of the programme. </seg>
<seg id=796> The Court of Auditors' report on the FAIR Programme, from which the rapporteur' s report arises, was only published in March this year even though the sector letters regarding the audit were first sent to the Commission in December 1998 and February 1999. </seg>
<seg id=797> On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I should like to call attention to a fairly small number of points. </seg>
<seg id=798> You have underscored, and I would thank you for this, the spirit underlying this report, in your dialogue with the Court of Auditors and the Commission' s services and in the value you attached to it. </seg>
<seg id=799> This shows that the Commission has not been idle and that it is acting on the comments that you have made. </seg>
<seg id=800> I will now turn to the question that Mrs Morgan asked concerning the recovery of amounts. </seg>
<seg id=801> Thank you, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=802> The prize will be awarded to the 'Basta Ya' association in the course of the December part-session. </seg>
<seg id=803> It marks - and I am firmly convinced of this, even if many Heads of State and Government prefer not to admit it - the beginning of the constitutional process which this Parliament has called for so often and with such persistence. </seg>
<seg id=804> I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to address the House as part of an in-depth debate on this fine project to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union before Parliament adopts its final position on this text. </seg>
<seg id=805> I, personally, have no doubt that such an opportunity will present itself. </seg>
<seg id=806> It is true, nonetheless, that it has been possible to make a number of criticisms regarding the content of the Charter. </seg>
<seg id=807> I feel this is a significant statement - one that I welcome. </seg>
<seg id=808> It is a huge feather in this institution's cap - as is the fact that the groups stood side by side here - that we managed to secure 16 places for European Parliament representatives at the fundamental rights convention. </seg>
<seg id=809> The Charter before us is, to my mind, a huge success and may, as I read in one of the European broadsheets on 26 September 2000, become the calling card for Europe. </seg>
<seg id=810> Therefore, my Group still thinks that it is absolutely essential to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6(2) of the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=811> Many people thought that Europe at long last had the opportunity to emerge from the single free-trade area and the liberal rut in order to establish the foundation of a People' s Europe. </seg>
<seg id=812> At the European Summit in Nice, in December, civil society resolved to mobilise in order to make itself heard and to forcefully express its desire for a charter offering the citizens of Europe genuine guarantees. </seg>
<seg id=813> To this end, besides the signatures, it is important for there to be effective political undertakings implemented within the timeframe - every day - by all the countries and political forces. </seg>
<seg id=814> So let us either lament or pretend to rejoice, let us celebrate this great event which is actually just a perfectly empty great event. </seg>
<seg id=815> The convention did a grand job. </seg>
<seg id=816> So individual rights and citizens' rights are included, but also social rights. </seg>
<seg id=817> The right to good administration, which Mrs Malmström also talked about, is one of the most important advances of all. </seg>
<seg id=818> I am not sure yet, because I have not heard from them, how far Mr Blair's hounds will be let free from the leash to speak out for this brilliant project. </seg>
<seg id=819> Last time, you spoke of the glass being half full or half empty. </seg>
<seg id=820> Yet the Cologne Council, with the assistance of the Convention, doing a magnificent job of creating confusion, managed ultimately to make every one forget that this area lay within the jurisdiction of the national parliaments, and that jurisdiction is being gradually spirited out of the hands of these parliaments. </seg>
<seg id=821> Having too much in the way of fundamental rights protection is just as damaging as having too little. </seg>
<seg id=822> When listening to the speeches from some members, one realises that this information is more necessary than ever. </seg>
<seg id=823> The big question that now divides us is what this Charter is for. </seg>
<seg id=824> We will, of course, vote for the Charter, but we will do so with the feeling that it will not succeed in arousing that enthusiasm and that sense of participation by the citizens of Europe which are so necessary and, as usual, it will be the governments - and some governments more than others - who will have to bear the historical responsibility. </seg>
<seg id=825> According to the co-rapporteur, Mr Duff, this is a major step towards improving the quality of European integration. </seg>
<seg id=826> For those who feel the need to do so, I recommend reading the explanations in Convention 49 and also studying that case law from both courts which is bound up with the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=827> Mr President, I have long been among the sceptics. </seg>
<seg id=828> For the first time since the European Union was established we have here the basis of a constitution, a constitution for the supranational structure that is the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=829> It is a demonstration for a social and democratic Europe of the citizens. </seg>
<seg id=830> In the meantime, the draft Charter can serve as an interesting subject for debate amongst the parties, trade unions, environmental organisations, churches and the many other groupings in the Member States and the candidate states of the Union, regarding future cooperation between European nations. </seg>
<seg id=831> I wish to focus on three points that have already been raised by other Members here this morning. </seg>
<seg id=832> The Charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon. </seg>
<seg id=833> I shall, of course, add my voice to those of the men and women wishing to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6, and to actually incorporate the Charter itself into the Treaties at a later date. </seg>
<seg id=834> We have already seen the case of Bernard Connolly whose critical book regarding the Commission was suppressed by the Court of First Instance. </seg>
<seg id=835> This is an important amalgamation at a time when the European Union is required to define the legal status, in terms of rights and duties, of third country nationals legally resident within the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=836> Just like him, I am convinced, firstly, that it will have singular effects in the immediate short term and, secondly, that it will shortly become binding. </seg>
<seg id=837> In the course of this debate, I have heard a number of telling phrases: the Charter has been described as a bone thrown to keep the dog that is the European Parliament quiet, or indeed as a flimsy attempt to conceal the fights relinquished by a French Presidency that is on its last legs, seen especially in of the way in which it conducted the IGC. </seg>
<seg id=838> This is why Parliament has proposed the setting up of a Europe-Turkey Forum involving expert representatives of the Turkish community and appointed MEPs who would consider in depth the issues involved. </seg>
<seg id=839> Unanimity does not mean that we are all satisfied with the state of Turkish democracy or that country' s treatment of human rights; we are not. </seg>
<seg id=840> Having said that, I am of course aware that Turkey' s candidature continues to raise questions. </seg>
<seg id=841> The Presidency' s preference is for this draft to be adopted very quickly, indeed, if possible, as early as 20 November, the date of the forthcoming General Affairs Council, and, as I have already mentioned, for it to comply with the very specific decisions adopted in Helsinki. </seg>
<seg id=842> However, the Commission stands by what it has clearly stated in its progress report, i.e. that Turkey, like every other candidate country, must meet the Copenhagen criteria during the process of rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id=843> President Sezar clearly stated why Turkey had no alternative but to embark on this process of reform in his address to the Turkish Government last month and I fully endorse what the Turkish President said. </seg>
<seg id=844> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id=845> There have been a few vaguely positive signs here. </seg>
<seg id=846> We will resist the efforts, some of them fairly spurious, to upset the balance the report successfully achieves, especially those amendments which seek to set up the European Parliament as a tribunal upon the past. </seg>
<seg id=847> It is a clear fact, just as it is clear that Turkey, like any civilised society, should get used to the idea of facing up to its past, however terrible it may have been. </seg>
<seg id=848> Turkey's membership on this basis, rather than for the geo-strategic reasons put forward by the USA or NATO, would enrich the European Union and represent a significant step towards a united Europe. </seg>
<seg id=849> Have we forgotten that only a small part of Turkish territory falls within the European continent? </seg>
<seg id=850> We shall therefore vote against this report, just as we have voted against all the reports seeking to make Turkey a member of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=851> It will have done more harm if Turkey's expectations of accession have been raised and cannot be met because of the political situation. </seg>
<seg id=852> Report (A5-0310/2000) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors Special Report No 9/99 concerning research activities in the field of agriculture and fisheries (FAIR Programme - Fisheries, Agriculture and Agro-Industrial Research), together with the Commission' s replies (C5-0227/2000 - 2000/2133(COS)) </seg>
<seg id=853> . I welcome this report and will vote for it. </seg>
<seg id=854> Instead of pulling human rights and social rights up to a higher level, the Charter will enable actions that will effectively reduce them to the lowest common denominator. </seg>
<seg id=855> There is no doubt that its ultimate purpose is as a precursor to an impending European Constitution which, in turn, will be the jewel in the crown of the EU's attempt to become a federation in which the institutional arrangements are such that decisions are taken by the minority of strong members but apply to everyone, the main purpose being to serve the interests of private monopolies in the European Union, at the expense of the workers and the people in general. </seg>
<seg id=856> Article 2(2) provides a typical example, "No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed. </seg>
<seg id=857> There is no statement, despite our requests, to the effect that a family is made up of a man and a woman raising their children, and that that is the basic unit of society. </seg>
<seg id=858> To the extent that no one has elected the judges, this represents a diminution of democratic government. </seg>
<seg id=859> Admittedly, I would have liked to see it incorporated directly into the European Treaties! </seg>
<seg id=860> I nonetheless abstained from the final vote, because I feel that some social rights are expressed less clearly than the economic rights. </seg>
<seg id=861> The original idea behind the Convention was to have a text adopted by consensus which could subsequently be made binding by the fifteen Member State governments when it was incorporated into the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=862> In fact, the fight against social exclusion is relegated to the level of assistance, instead of imposing a requirement for basic rights binding upon employers and states. </seg>
<seg id=863> Personally, I am convinced that secularism is a liberating factor for the modern world. </seg>
<seg id=864> Similarly, the social responsibility of ownership has been left out. </seg>
<seg id=865> This document is clearly not one suited to become legally binding as it is not a legal text. </seg>
<seg id=866> Members of the Irish government have recently raised questions regarding whether Brussels threatens Irish identity and Mr Ahern, whilst affirming Ireland's EU membership as fundamental to its prosperity and economic success, firmly resisted any rapid movement to a more federal - centralised - Europe, as it would go well beyond what most Europeans currently wish for or are prepared to accept. </seg>
<seg id=867> No surprise as to what won the day. </seg>
<seg id=868> Let me point out in passing that seven of the reports presented during this part-session have been in response to national initiatives, proving that where this system is implemented, it is proving to be very productive. </seg>
<seg id=869> These proactive measures are absolutely essential in order to combat this phenomenon, which has continually grown and taken on an international dimension. </seg>
<seg id=870> Through this initiative the French Presidency proposes the adoption of a framework decision for the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering (e.g. tracing, freezing and confiscating funds). </seg>
<seg id=871> All Member States should treat money laundering as a criminal offence carrying a minimum sentence of four years' imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id=872> As money laundering assumes vast proportions throughout the world it is clear that Europol should have the powers to combat it, with a view to devising a European strategy for police and judicial cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=873> . I welcome Mrs Roure' s report on another initiative from the French Presidency - this time to step up cooperation in the legal area to ensure that no barriers are put in place to prevent the extradition of suspected criminals accused of money laundering or other related offences involving illicit funds. </seg>
<seg id=874> Madam President, this is the only report which I voted against. </seg>
<seg id=875> It would be the first Member State geographically to bridge the gulf between Europe and Asia and to have a mainly Muslim tradition. </seg>
<seg id=876> That particularly applies at this stage when we are progressively committing more and more of the EIB' s resources, but without fully covering the financial risks we are taking. </seg>
<seg id=877> In this context, I would like to reiterate the basic conclusion in paragraph 22 that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria and draw attention both to the fact that Turkey has been condemned on numerous occasions for acts and omissions in relation to human rights, democratic freedoms and its international attitude and to the European Parliament's recommendations that Turkey comply with the relevant European values. </seg>
<seg id=878> What is worrying is that Turkish officials and the Turkish press seems to be taking a reactionary stand, rather than encouraging Turkey to move in this direction. </seg>
<seg id=879> Eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nicosia is now Europe' s only divided capital. </seg>
<seg id=880> Too little progress has been made and Turkey must do better. </seg>
<seg id=881> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak in this debate in my capacity as the author of the report on the accession of Cyprus. </seg>
<seg id=882> Mr President, we cannot vote in favour of the Morillon report due because we are convinced that, contrary to what is being maintained and what many people in Turkey hope, the accession process will not improve the standard of living of the people. </seg>
<seg id=883> At the same time, however, I feel we must not paint the situation blacker than it actually is. </seg>
<seg id=884> In other words there is an internal link here. </seg>
<seg id=885> Euro-Mediterranean conferences in Marseilles </seg>
<seg id=886> Mr Brok, who has now rejoined us, asked questions specifically about the delays noted in negotiations. </seg>
<seg id=887> We Europeans have experience that we can profitably share. </seg>
<seg id=888> In fact, it is no longer just a matter, as it was in 1995, of restoring balance with Eastern Europe, but also of making ready for the future enlargement of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=889> Xenophobia and national and other forms of terrorism come under this heading and I hope that we shall have a chance to straighten things out here too. </seg>
<seg id=890> That is a fact that, alas, we have to live with. </seg>
<seg id=891> But here again we should be frank. </seg>
<seg id=892> All this shows that we are aware of how inadequate the results achieved thus far have been, although I feel that the responses are not yet sufficient to deal with the situation, even though it is true that five years are certainly not a very long time over which to judge such complex processes. </seg>
<seg id=893> This is why I feel that the debate taking place today could serve to make us aware that this policy is of key importance for the entire Union. </seg>
<seg id=894> We do not need to create competition between all these various needs but to find new resources. </seg>
<seg id=895> The spiralling violence in the Middle East, the war being waged so violently and resolutely against the Palestinian people, whose right to statehood is still being denied by Israel, are all threatening the future of the entire region. </seg>
<seg id=896> Mr President, in Nice the European Union will need to strike a balance between integration and enlargement and in Marseilles it will need to strike a balance between its function in central Europe and its responsibility in the Mediterranean. </seg>
<seg id=897> However, in all the evaluations that are now being made of five years of the Barcelona process, many people think that we can be satisfied simply that the process is continuing, due to the fact that there have been ministerial meetings attended by representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon, etc. And this is, perhaps, a sad consolation. </seg>
<seg id=898> There are many common problems that are currently affecting the Euro-Mediterranean area: illegal immigration, poverty, foreign debt, human rights, drought and terrorism, which mercilessly destroys the lives of innocent individuals and families, as we are tragically experiencing in Spain, Algeria and the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=899> We are willing to believe them, but the countries of the South need more than just promises and speeches, and it is up to us to give them those things. </seg>
<seg id=900> Europe has not produced any policies on desertification or on water that benefit the Mediterranean countries and we need to think about a Mediterranean environment policy that understands the location, the systems and also the climatic diversity of the Mediterranean. </seg>
<seg id=901> The proposals now on the table have been far more successful in striking this balance. </seg>
<seg id=902> Then there is the question of the agency in Kosovo. </seg>
<seg id=903> We must not disappoint them in their expectations, and now more than ever these countries need our help. </seg>
<seg id=904> I conclude by repeating the Commission' s own words - that these two proposals are the cornerstone of a process that should lead these countries, which have had and still have so many problems, to become fully integrated into the structures of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=905> In future, responsibility must be vested in a few people, including a director, if you like, so that really one person is responsible vis-à-vis the committee which selects the individual programmes. </seg>
<seg id=906> So my thanks to all my fellow members who see this as an important objective and I am delighted that we shall be able to bring these countries more in the way of content in the future. </seg>
<seg id=907> I read in some reports about the elections in Bosnia that the extreme nationalists have won at the parliamentary elections held in Bosnia Herzegovina. </seg>
<seg id=908> As you will be aware, the European Union, has contributed significantly to these historic developments. </seg>
<seg id=909> Examination of the reports by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza and Mr Lagendijk on proposals for a Regulation concerning a framework programme on the one hand, and the European Agency for Reconstruction on the other, provide us with an opportunity to assess the scale of the support that the Union intends to give the Western Balkans in relation to the Stabilisation and Association Process. </seg>
<seg id=910> The long-awaited victory of democracy in Croatia, and then in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, forces the European Union, as we are well aware, to take things much further. </seg>
<seg id=911> Question Time (Council) </seg>
<seg id=912> As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 2 and 3 will be taken together. </seg>
<seg id=913> Both parties have just been granted a new deadline of four months - by Resolution 1324 - to try and make some progress on both counts. </seg>
<seg id=914> I should like to ask about progress with the association agreement with Morocco. </seg>
<seg id=915> The stability and development of the Caucasus are one of the European Union' s strategic priorities. </seg>
<seg id=916> As regards discussions with Turkey, we have just held an important debate on this issue and you are well aware of the European Union' s position with regard to this matter. </seg>
<seg id=917> I just want the Minister to re-emphasise that this proposed legislation is aimed at those who exploit and make profit out of people in a desperate situation and is not aimed at further criminalising the immigrant or potential immigrant. </seg>
<seg id=918> There is a need both for legislation and measures to stimulate debate and increase awareness. </seg>
<seg id=919> In my view, we must indeed do everything within our power, absolutely everything, to combat such crimes, and I note that the Council, the United Nations General Assembly and the Turkish Government, as far as I know, are prepared to do this. </seg>
<seg id=920> It is precisely because the other 14 Member States disapproved that they imposed sanctions against it. </seg>
<seg id=921> If, for example, and here I am talking as a Minister, France was to elect an extreme right-wing party to office tomorrow, I would hope that the other countries would take measures against it similar to those taken against Austria. </seg>
<seg id=922> I personally wanted to talk about values: I have spoken about values as they appear in our texts and I have spoken about the values that appear in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I have spoken, in particular, it is true, about the fight against all forms of discrimination, as appears on the title page of all European texts and which is something we should ensure is respected. </seg>
<seg id=923> I should like to remind you that this political dialogue constitutes, along with the future Accession Partnership, one of the elements in Turkey' s pre-accession strategy, which was set out on this occasion. </seg>
<seg id=924> Question No 12 by (H-0850/00): </seg>
<seg id=925> This is what we shall endeavour to do and it is along these lines that we intend to proceed and no other. </seg>
<seg id=926> On this occasion, it must be said that Morocco did not respond to the offer made by the Community. </seg>
<seg id=927> These are citizens from Scotland where after 110 days of detention any person charged with an offence must either be brought to trial or released and never again charged with that offence. </seg>
<seg id=928> Have specific measures been taken (such as security of supplies and energy efficiency) to make the economies of the Member States less sensitive to external crises, and what are the Council' s methods and short-term and medium-term priorities for energy efficiency and energy saving? </seg>
<seg id=929> The position of the European Union on the extra-territorial measures decreed by the United States has not changed. </seg>
<seg id=930> Finally, I recalled that it was with concern that the European Union took note of the observations made by the United Nations' agencies and programmes on the ground and deplored the negative, and often tragic, repercussions of the US economic embargo as they affected the Cuban population. </seg>
<seg id=931> Does the Council not understand that this is a supremely political problem and that it is unacceptable for it to maintain a position which is equidistant from both the offender and the victim? </seg>
<seg id=932> This agency complies with the Commission's decision on decentralisation and is exceptionally efficient in managing the project for which it is responsible. </seg>
<seg id=933> We must combat illegal cross-border activities, be they in connection with the drug trade, cross-border cooperation or trafficking in human beings. </seg>
<seg id=934> It would be a good idea for Commissioner Patten, who has a great deal of experience - not to say wisdom - in managing international crises, to add to the visits which he has made to various regions of the Balkans by going to the headquarters of the Reconstruction Agency in Thessaloniki in order to see how this department works. </seg>
<seg id=935> But this region, the most troubled region of Europe, has never held such hope as it does now. </seg>
<seg id=936> I should like, first of all, to thank the House for its excellent and speedy work during its examination of these two draft regulations. </seg>
<seg id=937> We have achieved rapid results in Serbia too, where the Commission, in the space of just over four weeks, has drawn up an emergency assistance programme worth in total EUR 200 million. </seg>
<seg id=938> Naturally we can also accept the proposal that the guidelines which the Commission will adopt should reflect the search for greater efficiency that underlines our reforms. </seg>
<seg id=939> I hope that Parliament will understand the sense of the proposals that I put forward in May and will continue to work constructively with others on this very difficult issue but I cannot offer to support Parliament's amendment to remove the unanimity requirement which would contradict the view of the College. </seg>
<seg id=940> The challenge for the third summit in Seoul was to deepen the ASEM process both for governmental participants and for the broader public. </seg>
<seg id=941> In the related people-to-people field, the principle of opening the ASEM process to a larger segment of civil society was maintained, although the NGO initiative to establish a social forum could not be realised because of the resistance of certain Asian partners. </seg>
<seg id=942> In this respect we are extremely lucky that the summit in Seoul took place at all and that, with one or two exceptions, all the heads of government attended. </seg>
<seg id=943> In fact two concrete proposals have been adopted, notably the round table on globalisation and the duo fellowship programme, 4300 fellowships amounting to a total cost of USD 25 million. </seg>
<seg id=944> The Commission' s communication confines itself to dealing with those aspects relating to the powers of the Community and Member States in tasks arising from their participation in those organisations. </seg>
<seg id=945> When we think that, of all the coastal countries in the world, very few have the economic, judicial, legislative and political potential that the European Union has, that should tell us how much we should be asking ourselves what our responsibility is. </seg>
<seg id=946> Reform of the CFP will be critical but getting the right reforms will be even more important. </seg>
<seg id=947> There is hardly a fish in it which is permanently domiciled. </seg>
<seg id=948> Throughout the European Union and far beyond we are all well aware of that. </seg>
<seg id=949> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by thanking you for your support for our efforts to promote and strengthen the Community's participation in regional fisheries organisations. </seg>
<seg id=950> Some progress has already been made but our efforts must focus on better planning. </seg>
<seg id=951> The ongoing improvement of the productivity of pig producers is already generating a growth in supply and if this were to be accompanied by the unlimited extension of the apparatus of production, it would inevitably result, once again, in a serious imbalance in the market. </seg>
<seg id=952> Instead, it makes more sense if every pigfarmer sets up his own reserve, i.e. if every pigfarmer has his own piggy bank. </seg>
<seg id=953> Reference is also made to the need to encourage producer organisations, the prevalence of which varies greatly from one Member State to another. </seg>
<seg id=954> The way in which the organisations of the market have worked in the past has served rather than impeded the concentration process. </seg>
<seg id=955> The globalisation of the economy is a red herring here and cyclical crises have absolutely nothing to do with it. </seg>
<seg id=956> Producers from all over the European Union will be able to subscribe to this measure. </seg>
<seg id=957> Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Garot, has dealt with the Commission' s proposal for pig industry funding realistically and in precise terms. </seg>
<seg id=958> It is a question of balance. </seg>
<seg id=959> I am therefore bound to say that I have reached a different conclusion to that of Mr Garot, and whilst I am almost inclined to say that I could almost go along with the Commission proposal in its present form, since we also have a duty to be honest, I feel that, basically, it does not actually do anything to address the issues. </seg>
<seg id=960> Then there is the question of including specialist breeders in the proposed system, as stated in proposed Amendments Nos 7 and 13. </seg>
<seg id=961> Then what, pray, has the Commission presented to us? </seg>
<seg id=962> Firstly, there is an analysis of the budgetary implementation of the budgetary management practices within the specific financial headings. </seg>
<seg id=963> The Court repeats, consequently, its comments of previous years on the negative effects of this, for instance poor and hasty decisions, heavy workload creating a risk of errors and so on. </seg>
<seg id=964> The dramatic events of the recent past have clearly demonstrated the increasing importance of management and control issues on the European agenda. </seg>
<seg id=965> This means that conscientious Member States are financially penalised and less conscientious ones are financially rewarded. </seg>
<seg id=966> However, not only are we heading in the right direction, we have also already covered a significant part of the ground. One of the milestones we have already passed is the 2001 budget, which the Commission has, for the first time, presented using activity-based budgeting. </seg>
<seg id=967> The European Parliament now finds itself in an extremely difficult situation because earlier this year, in January, it declared that it could no longer accept a situation in which the 1999 closure was still marred by serious errors. </seg>
<seg id=968> I should like to draw attention to a number of problems, and I hope that Mr Karlsson will be able to answer my questions today. </seg>
<seg id=969> We must have more figures, and we must have more facts. </seg>
<seg id=970> I shall try as early as this year to see whether this can be done so that we can make a start on assessing the Directorates-General. </seg>
<seg id=971> Of course, we all know that the Commission is working on its programme of reform. </seg>
<seg id=972> This will diminish the level of errors. </seg>
<seg id=973> Therefore, now and in the future, the Commission will be held to account for non-compliance with the rules. </seg>
<seg id=974> Can I first of all thank Mr Karlsson because cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control this year has been much better than in previous years. </seg>
<seg id=975> I call on you also to publish a league table of those countries which have the worst record of maladministration in the EU and in what areas. </seg>
<seg id=976> Madam President, I too would like to very sincerely thank the Court of Auditors for its report and also for the assessment that the Court gave the Committee on Budgetary Control yesterday, in which it stressed once again the much-needed efforts being made at reform. </seg>
<seg id=977> The points Mrs van der Laan made earlier should be included, and I am pleased to say that we agree about that. </seg>
<seg id=978> That may require giving the President of the Court more power to take decisions on the Court's working methods and on the way it communicates. </seg>
<seg id=979> Rates differ from one Member State to the next; their make-up also differs from one Member State to the next. </seg>
<seg id=980> In what has been its most important work on the common agricultural policy, the special report on arable crops, the Court concluded that, from 1993 to 1997, the Community budget paid out a sum of more than EUR 13 billion more than could reasonably have been expected. </seg>
<seg id=981> Do not ask me questions that are impossible to answer. </seg>
<seg id=982> The Court of Auditors also has to change its working methods. </seg>
<seg id=983> There is always something to be happy about. </seg>
<seg id=984> This report was approved by a large majority in the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, and I shall therefore stand by the result of the Committee' s vote. </seg>
<seg id=985> My second point is about export bans, which have previously been so highly praised. </seg>
<seg id=986> I therefore have some very considerable reservations and wish to reject this particular provision. </seg>
<seg id=987> At second or third reading it is necessary to secure the famous 314 votes, and if the report is still in the same form as now that will certainly not happen. </seg>
<seg id=988> The Commission have begun to take a tentative but welcome step in that direction and perhaps the Commissioner will say more about that when he replies. </seg>
<seg id=989> We concur with the rapporteur where he has highlighted the importance of providing consumers with information about the risks, and the need for transparency, especially in the sphere of health and safety. </seg>
<seg id=990> I would have thought it would be better to take more account of subsidiarity. </seg>
<seg id=991> However, I do recall a substantial discussion which I had with my daughter, Elisabetta, when she was nine years old and wanted to be allowed to go out on her own. </seg>
<seg id=992> We need to ensure seamless consumer protection but without regulating the same things more than once or even in contradictory ways. </seg>
<seg id=993> Then I would like to stress the importance of the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which increase transparency towards the end consumer and apportion responsibility to distributors as well as producers in the event of products deemed dangerous being withdrawn from the market. </seg>
<seg id=994> This also means that when new sectoral legislation is devised it supersedes the corresponding provisions of this directive. </seg>
<seg id=995> Many of the proposed amendments of the report are an improvement on the text and can therefore be accepted by the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=996> Thirdly, Amendment No 4 proposes adding, in a preamble, a requirement that Member States draw up factual reports with the cooperation of competent and independent public or private institutions. </seg>
<seg id=997> Although the Commission is in favour of cooperation and common principles, the proposed wording runs counter to subsidiarity. </seg>
<seg id=998> No problems have been reported to the Commission with the existing wordings and the changes would weaken the provisions. </seg>
<seg id=999> Amendments Nos 39 and 44 propose that information on dangerous products should only be available to the public once a banning or withdrawal decision has been issued and that exchange of information protected by professional secrecy should not be possible between market surveillance authorities. </seg>
<seg id=1000> Mr Martelli, normally you can only speak at the end of voting time, but I shall, exceptionally, give you the floor for a few moments. </seg>
<seg id=1001> Report (A5-0294/2000) by Mrs Eriksson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005) (COM(2000) 335 - C5-0386/2000 - 2000/0143(CNS)) </seg>
<seg id=1002> Mr President, my question relates to the order of the votes on the amendments concerning Paragraph 10, in other words, the genocide in Armenia. </seg>
<seg id=1003> (Parliament adopted the resolution) </seg>
<seg id=1004> The responsibility is dual, lying with both the governments of the countries of the Union and the governments of the Mediterranean partners as well. </seg>
<seg id=1005> This aid is more than justified in the light of that tragedy. </seg>
<seg id=1006> The ban on night work for women was one of those rare areas in which, by protecting women, the social legislation of certain countries was further advanced for female than for male workers. </seg>
<seg id=1007> I very much hope that in future, by producing an annual review in good time, the Commission will enable this House to carry out a more in-depth analysis and hold a more thorough debate. </seg>
<seg id=1008> Regretfully therefore, I have voted against. </seg>
<seg id=1009> It is important that our products are safe, but we should not go over the top with extreme actions. </seg>
<seg id=1010> Today, the European Agency for Reconstruction is administered by a Governing Board on which the representatives of the Member States and the Commission each have one vote and on which decisions are adopted by a two-thirds majority. </seg>
<seg id=1011> I believe that Serbia's "Algerian problem" is Kosovo. </seg>
<seg id=1012> - (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have voted against a report designed to introduce aid for pigmeat producers in the EU. </seg>
<seg id=1013> The problem is that, even if the French Presidency has shown a degree of openness, we know that the Commission has rejected these proposals and there does not appear to be a majority within the Council in favour of approving them. </seg>
<seg id=1014> A slight variation in the supply is enough to spark a crisis situation. </seg>
<seg id=1015> Mr President, the Armenians' genocide was the first of many genocides in the twentieth century, which might indeed be called the century of genocide. </seg>
<seg id=1016> Because Sweden is not prepared to participate in a common military defence but only in civil crisis management, we cannot support Paragraph 15 which "welcomes Turkey' s determination to contribute to improving European capabilities within the framework of the common European security and defence policy" . </seg>
<seg id=1017> But beyond the duty of remembrance which we must demand from all democracies, and the people of Europe know just how difficult and painful a task this is, so difficult in fact that some European countries have not yet completed it, it is incumbent on us to ensure that such acts of barbarism, which destroyed lives for ethnic, religious and cultural reasons and which offend the conscience of the world, never recur. </seg>
<seg id=1018> This is, of course, a different debate to the one we are having today. But, given the importance I attach to Turkey, I wanted to restate my case today. </seg>
<seg id=1019> Since the people are no longer prevented from exercising their right to self-determination, this has enabled peace to take hold. </seg>
<seg id=1020> I voted today for the amendments calling for this acknowledgement in order to keep this testimony alive and to acknowledge a people' s suffering. </seg>
<seg id=1021> That event took place during the time of the Ottoman Empire. </seg>
<seg id=1022> The Jové Peres report would not only like to regularise this situation for existing regional organisations and those that are in the process of being established, it would also like to reinforce it by putting paid to the Commission' s habit of calling on the support of technical experts from different Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1023> My comments naturally apply to the issue before us today, the representation of the European Community within regional fisheries organisations, but they apply equally to talks conducted for example within the World Trade Organisation. </seg>
<seg id=1024> My suggestion that we should include them in one directive was supported by the then President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Trittin, and by the Commission, which meant that Parliament' s motion to amalgamate three directives did not meet with a great deal of opposition. </seg>
<seg id=1025> I will give you an example: PVC comprises 0.7% of the total amount of incinerated waste. </seg>
<seg id=1026> Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is satisfied by the work that has been carried out during the course of the third reading. </seg>
<seg id=1027> Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Blokland for preparing this subject. </seg>
<seg id=1028> Incineration is not recycling. </seg>
<seg id=1029> The report by Mr Blokland, now at its third reading, was for many members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, elected to Parliament for the first time, the first real test of learning with regard to parliamentary practice. </seg>
<seg id=1030> Stricter emission-limit values have been introduced for new cement kilns that co-incinerate waste, as Mrs Evans pointed out. </seg>
<seg id=1031> However diverse national situations may be, one can recognise in all Member States a more or less general reduction in statutory cover, an enhanced role for supplementary health insurance schemes and a marked increase in discriminating factors. </seg>
<seg id=1032> There should also be a proposal for a directive to include the following points: a prohibition on the use of personal medical data, such as genetic typing, a key point; ensuring that persons joining a scheme are not in principle required to undergo a medical examination; the introduction of an obligation to provide lifelong insurance by the insurer; undertaking to reimburse persons working and moving within the European Union in a more coordinated way and, finally, introducing a mediation procedure. </seg>
<seg id=1033> We are really coming round to the idea of cross-border care and so market forces are becoming increasingly applicable to health care. </seg>
<seg id=1034> For example, although we often take the United States as a model for the free market economy, it would be a fatal mistake to follow their lead in health policy. </seg>
<seg id=1035> It would be wrong if the EU were to devise rules concerning, for example, data relating to health, or requiring everyone to be insured and, in that way, destroy the multiplicity of supplementary health insurance schemes which exist today in many countries and operate on actuarial principles. </seg>
<seg id=1036> It then appeared that there was in fact a way of getting in. </seg>
<seg id=1037> The same applies to the health of all the citizens of our Member States and the cohesion of our territories. </seg>
<seg id=1038> It is not by chance that I am particularly used to facing such problems by virtue of my Dutch background. </seg>
<seg id=1039> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rocard is calling on the Commission to define a framework for basic statutory health insurance systems in a Green Paper. </seg>
<seg id=1040> This is a major concern. </seg>
<seg id=1041> Mr President, those of us who have devoted ourselves all our lives to studying social issues will remember that the old manuals used to include a definition of social protection as a set of state protection measures to cover economically assessable risks affecting individuals or families which individuals - family units - could not cover themselves. </seg>
<seg id=1042> Well then, this means that we need to reflect at great length upon the reasons why public health care is in such a state. </seg>
<seg id=1043> Supplementary health insurance presupposes a statutory system of entitlements and provisions. </seg>
<seg id=1044> By trying to eliminate discrimination on the grounds of health status, Mr Rocard would have killed the goose that laid the golden egg. </seg>
<seg id=1045> The Commission will act immediately in the framework of its competences and I will try to reply to the conclusions of your report. </seg>
<seg id=1046> I also hope that the amendments seeking to ensure that qualifications and integration into professional life are given particular attention will be adopted, which is why it is important to take account of the ever-increasing phenomenon of social exclusion and poverty despite paid employment. </seg>
<seg id=1047> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report. </seg>
<seg id=1048> The next item is the Commission recommendations for a Council opinion on updating the stability programmes in Germany, Finland and the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id=1049> This has given us a different idea, making us wonder whether this Stability and Growth Pact has run its course, having achieved the quantitative objective of a particular final figure, or whether it is worth introducing other aspects relating to the quality of public finances in future programmes. </seg>
<seg id=1050> Our basic message is, therefore, that the margin for making tax cuts must be counterbalanced by strict public spending controls. </seg>
<seg id=1051> I believe that, overall, the message here is a positive one. </seg>
<seg id=1052> They state that, in one of the largest countries - which is also one of the most important countries for the European economy, namely Germany - there is a risk of jumping into something resembling overheating. </seg>
<seg id=1053> Mr President, thank you, Mr Della Vedova. </seg>
<seg id=1054> I understand that you wanted me to address you today regarding these two aspects, in other words, the state of play in the fight against BSE in Europe and related developments in France. </seg>
<seg id=1055> We propose that the Commission and the European Union should thus undertake to extend these tests at a European level, in the light of scientific recommendations. </seg>
<seg id=1056> As a result, effectiveness, independence and transparency will be the key principles guiding the assessment of food risks in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1057> I will return to this point later. </seg>
<seg id=1058> However, it is necessary to put in place such tests on a much larger scale. </seg>
<seg id=1059> Active surveillance measures, including random testing, are in progress to prevent cases of BSE from entering the food and feed chains. </seg>
<seg id=1060> In the situation confronting us it is always tempting to look to a magic solution, a solution which can, in one step, both eliminate risk and restore confidence. </seg>
<seg id=1061> I will be asking Member States on Monday if there are concerns that weaknesses in the implementation of controls over the past several years, in contravention of the Community legislation in the matter, are a factor in the current increased incidence of BSE. </seg>
<seg id=1062> Surely it is possible both to act quickly and to do the job properly. </seg>
<seg id=1063> It is up to you to deliver this legislation quickly. </seg>
<seg id=1064> This is an extremely important requirement, especially where the specific issue of BSE is concerned. </seg>
<seg id=1065> Our group is calling for an immediate ban on MBMs for all livestock as long as Member States are unable to guarantee the implementation of laws preventing BSE and the strict application of European directives. </seg>
<seg id=1066> I do not know if this is a panacea, Commissioner but, in line with the precautionary principle, it seems to me that experience behoves us to ban, as of today, the use of animal meal in feed for livestock, including pigs, poultry and fish. </seg>
<seg id=1067> I find the debate that is underway in this Chamber, which consists in finding out which institution out of the Council, the Commission or Parliament has done the most and which the least, rather unnecessary. </seg>
<seg id=1068> Firstly, as others have said before me, we must have systematic screening of all cattle slaughtered for consumption by European citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1069> By displaying courage and ambition, we can combine the health interests of Europeans and the economic interests of our producers, and thereby restore confidence. </seg>
<seg id=1070> These people are in no way responsible for the crisis, which is why the European Union must show solidarity with them. </seg>
<seg id=1071> I too do not accept the arrogance of certain Member States which, since they do not apply the tests, are not pushing for regulations. </seg>
<seg id=1072> European solidarity must also play a role, because our policy has exposed its inconsistencies: set-aside, animal meal for cattle, nitrates, pesticides. </seg>
<seg id=1073> Then Mr Gollnisch turns round and tells this House that his group has been spearheading the BSE debate. </seg>
<seg id=1074> We also feel that it would be appropriate to ensure that every outbreak of the disease is contained and to place a ban on the export of meat until such time as it is proven to be safe to eat. </seg>
<seg id=1075> On no account should we fail to give this priority its due from the political perspective. </seg>
<seg id=1076> I am glad that we are still looking at the extension of testing on an experimental basis. </seg>
<seg id=1077> But if we introduce generalised screening tests, if we destroy MBMs, if we impose the slaughter of an entire herd for just one sick animal, we must demand strictly equivalent health standards from the third countries who are our commercial partners and who seek to export live animals, carcasses and meat products to the Community. </seg>
<seg id=1078> The causes are to be found somewhere else altogether. </seg>
<seg id=1079> Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commission is finally making a strong case for universal testing, because as the situation in France demonstrates "he who seeks shall find"! </seg>
<seg id=1080> What is preventing us from acting and why must there always be a crisis for us to come here and confirm that we, the European Parliament, believe that public health is the number one priority? </seg>
<seg id=1081> The link between feeding cattle bonemeal - which is, as it happens a very unnatural way to feed animals - and BSE is now clear to everyone. </seg>
<seg id=1082> Therefore I would ask the Commission to work towards a degree of harmonisation on this score too. </seg>
<seg id=1083> I call upon the European Commission to carry out a total review of the systems that are in place in France to deal with cases of BSE. </seg>
<seg id=1084> As a result, the poison goes into the system and, as it does, it destroys the system. </seg>
<seg id=1085> It is indeed difficult to have national legislations and a European legislation existing side by side. </seg>
<seg id=1086> In addition, there is legislation in place setting out how the meat-and-bone meal, how this feed, is to be processed - another safeguard that is introduced into the system to protect public health and food safety. </seg>
<seg id=1087> It has been said that this will be very expensive, will involve a large number of carcasses and so on. </seg>
<seg id=1088> These instances include the 'pillow technique' which led to the death of a female immigrant in Belgium, the use of strong sedatives in Spain, the transporting of immigrants in cramped conditions in the holds of ships in Italy and Spain, the tragic case of the 58 Chinese immigrants found dead at the UK port of Dover after they had been detained on a number of occasions on European soil, and the widespread use of various forms of coercion and intimidation against expelled immigrants. </seg>
<seg id=1089> That is my commitment, for which I accept responsibility. </seg>
<seg id=1090> Violence against women takes many forms: there is violence in the home, a crime which does not speak its name, there is sexual exploitation and there is trafficking in women, i.e. trafficking in human beings. </seg>
<seg id=1091> Mr President, I would say to Mr Nogueira that clearly, in the model that we have defined, monetary policy is the responsibility of the Central Bank and it is the European Central Bank that takes action in line with the criteria established in the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=1092> Mr President, from a public relations point of view, I believe it is very important to distinguish between internal and external effects, and I would be interested to know if the Commission intends now, with the physical introduction of the euro not far off, to launch a campaign to explain the difference between the internal and external effects of currency stability to the public? </seg>
<seg id=1093> Without action being taken from the Greek side we will pursue the procedure already underway. </seg>
<seg id=1094> What we do is to guarantee that there is a system of monitoring and measuring. </seg>
<seg id=1095> In the same decision, the Commission undertook to review the aid schemes in all the Member States on the basis of the specific compatibility criteria approved until 2004, the date on which the validity of the authorisation for the French support scheme will expire. </seg>
<seg id=1096> To achieve a Europe that encourages integration, in the words of the Lisbon European Council, requires joint effort and joint action. </seg>
<seg id=1097> Secondly, by making it possible to take better account of the experience of operators in the field, NGOs, local authorities, social organisations and of people who are themselves being excluded. </seg>
<seg id=1098> There are many elderly people who would agree with that, as would those who had worked for hours for low wages which do not provide a decent living - farm labourers, for example. </seg>
<seg id=1099> It may be true of people with mental difficulties and of large groups of people who do not have a good enough knowledge of the language in order to get jobs. </seg>
<seg id=1100> In the United States, a more flexible labour market means that periods of poverty and unemployment are only very short. </seg>
<seg id=1101> In my own country something like 75% of those who are working and living below the poverty line are women. </seg>
<seg id=1102> Well then, we must endeavour to implement this major undertaking, at least in part. </seg>
<seg id=1103> This budget should be increased, bearing in mind the processes and the realism that are necessary in this field. </seg>
<seg id=1104> Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mrs Figueiredo and I would like to thank the other Members of Parliament who are not here and who have expressed the opinions of the other committees. </seg>
<seg id=1105> I also agree to highlight the importance of NGOs as well as of regional and local actors as you suggest, and of better reflecting their experience on the ground. </seg>
<seg id=1106> We have already agreed that the Social Protection Committee would meet on a regular basis with the contact group of Members of Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1107> The next item is the report (A5­0320/2000) by Mrs Rothe, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on a European Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (COM(2000) 279 - C5­0281/2000 - 2000/0116(COD)). </seg>
<seg id=1108> We need binding targets right now. </seg>
<seg id=1109> Another vital point that the committee agreed on was the problem of connection to the grid and access to the grid for renewables. </seg>
<seg id=1110> In the specific case of my country, Spain, these guidelines would be responsible for an additional 225 billion tonnes of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere between now and 2010 and for our being unable to meet the Kyoto targets. </seg>
<seg id=1111> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s proposal to create a framework enabling the proportion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the European Union to be considerably increased in the medium term, can only be welcomed. </seg>
<seg id=1112> But there may still be a threat from seeking compatibility with the internal market. </seg>
<seg id=1113> Waste is not a renewable natural resource, although there is more and more of it produced every day. </seg>
<seg id=1114> So this directive is unintentionally topical right now. </seg>
<seg id=1115> But I warmly support this proposal. </seg>
<seg id=1116> Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for an excellent report which is very timely this week when we are struggling with the crisis of climate change. </seg>
<seg id=1117> Promoting the use of electricity from renewable energy sources is a very worthwhile endeavour. </seg>
<seg id=1118> We need radical technological adaptation. </seg>
<seg id=1119> Instead, proposals related to energy are submitted one at a time and without much consistency. </seg>
<seg id=1120> I would like to conclude simply by mentioning three problems which have come up time and time again throughout this debate. </seg>
<seg id=1121> Furthermore, for the sake of coherence, the targets I have mentioned when converted into national parameters must be binding or else the directive will lack content and substance. </seg>
<seg id=1122> For the same reason we can accept Amendment No 3, in part, but not Amendment No 7, which is too technical to be included in the text of the proposal. </seg>
<seg id=1123> However, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot accept the parts which prejudice the application of rules on state aid. </seg>
<seg id=1124> The next item is the report (A5-0308/2000) by Mrs Theorin, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution (2000/2025(INI)). </seg>
<seg id=1125> While formal peace processes are almost exclusively a male domain, international experience and declarations show the importance of women' s participation in resolving conflicts and building peace. </seg>
<seg id=1126> Decisions on implementing relief programmes are the responsibility of crisis teams, and the specialist knowledge and expertise of women is often not recognised or not given due respect by such teams. </seg>
<seg id=1127> They obviously want to keep their powerful position in matters of foreign policy and defence for themselves, yet feel that men can promote women' s interests. </seg>
<seg id=1128> Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my interest in this report and to underscore its excellence. </seg>
<seg id=1129> Furthermore, there must be financial resources to help women who are victims of this situation. </seg>
<seg id=1130> Mr President, a great deal has already been said and I am not about to lapse into repetition. </seg>
<seg id=1131> Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Theorin on her excellent own-initiative report, which deals with an important and topical issue, i.e. how the fundamental participation of women in negotiations to resolve conflicts can change the world and turn the dominant culture of confrontation and violence into a culture of peace, dialogue and democratic conflict resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1132> I therefore support the demands made in the report for women to be given the right to diplomatic influence. </seg>
<seg id=1133> This is a very well informed, in-depth, and rigorous report, which is capable of stating fundamental principles with the clarity demonstrated in Paragraph 17. It is audacious but, at the same time, contains considerable practical sense and very necessary proposals. </seg>
<seg id=1134> I for my part want to condemn all rape and all slavery. </seg>
<seg id=1135> The fifth point is the role of ECHO, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office, which has been invited by Parliament to help evaluate the gender dimension. </seg>
<seg id=1136> The problem is that millions of people, particularly women, undertake this type of work, and there is a huge demand for it, but it is not subject to any regulations whatsoever. </seg>
<seg id=1137> I believe the best thing to do would be to spur the Member States on to regulate the sector, via the employment guidelines, as has already been called for in Parliament' s opinion on these guidelines. </seg>
<seg id=1138> The immigrant population is usually a significant group in this sector, and this requires special measures, such as specialised reception centres, which provide the necessary assistance. </seg>
<seg id=1139> This is an issue for the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1140> Demand has risen many times over in recent years, and yet this fact has scarcely been taken into account in general working life and as regards the rights and duties involved. </seg>
<seg id=1141> (The sitting was closed at 12 midnight) </seg>
<seg id=1142> (Sustained applause) </seg>
<seg id=1143> Not only are we to create the internal system of freedom and peace, but also harmonise it with the rules and customs that the European Community and the European Union have maintained for decades. </seg>
<seg id=1144> The first step ahead of us in a bid to restructure the federal state constitutionally is to define a framework for the broadest possible democratic dialogue about the character of relations between the two republics. </seg>
<seg id=1145> You, the representatives of the European Parliament, who directly represent the citizens of its member countries, the citizens of Europe, are best placed to understand why the very possibility of entry into Europe seems extremely uncertain to us, the citizens of the present-day Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id=1146> Let us resume our session. </seg>
<seg id=1147> This is a very important matter for the public, and one that is of interest to them, and it would be only right to get a decision on the matter this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id=1148> The latter then announced that it would produce a concrete proposal within six months, and it has kept its word. </seg>
<seg id=1149> At the moment in the European Union there already exists the practice of public access to documentation, and we should remember that brave citizens and many progressive Member States have been fighting for increased transparency for many years. </seg>
<seg id=1150> Parliament still needs to work on this report more, and for that reason I believe that it must be improved upon still here. </seg>
<seg id=1151> We are glad that the report repeats a crucial principle that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control also vehemently support. </seg>
<seg id=1152> Now, they will be given the opportunity also to acquire some insight into circumstances which do not receive the special attention of the mass media and special interest groups and, in that way, they will be better able to participate in the open and democratic debate which is so important to confidence in the EU. </seg>
<seg id=1153> The Committee on Petitions would like to see shorter waiting periods before documents are released. </seg>
<seg id=1154> As soon as confidentiality is no longer justified, the document must naturally be made publicly accessible. </seg>
<seg id=1155> I would also like to emphasise that all citizens must be guaranteed access to documents in as many forms as possible. </seg>
<seg id=1156> The doctrine of political responsibility must not be confused with the citizens' rights to openness. </seg>
<seg id=1157> I would therefore urge the rapporteurs to delete any reference to the rights of parliamentarians from the provision concerning public access to documents, and I call upon all my fellow delegates to make very sure that their interests are not played off against those of the public. </seg>
<seg id=1158> Access to documents is not guaranteed in these sectors and is denied not only to the citizens, but even to the European Parliament. Moreover, Parliament is neither kept formally informed nor consulted regarding fundamental documents. </seg>
<seg id=1159> But one serious cause for regret remains. </seg>
<seg id=1160> Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Cashman for the splendid work he has done on this report. </seg>
<seg id=1161> This is a very important report, which forms an important part of what we might call the EU's new principle of public access to official documents. </seg>
<seg id=1162> (Technical disruption) </seg>
<seg id=1163> It is not just a matter of the principle of unrestricted access to all documents but also, of course, of finally managing to open the doors of Council meetings, so that in future the Council can no longer take lonely decisions in camera à la Metternich and then go in for cheap 'Brussels bashing' . </seg>
<seg id=1164> Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the work on derogations. </seg>
<seg id=1165> Our people regard Europe as being undemocratic, a place where decisions are taken behind closed doors. </seg>
<seg id=1166> In accordance with Article 255 of the Treaty, the proposed regulation must be adopted before 1 May 2001, that is to say, two years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. </seg>
<seg id=1167> I now wish to address certain problems that currently prevent the Commission from accepting certain amendments. </seg>
<seg id=1168> As I pointed out previously, in certain cases we can agree in principle to the amendments, but we have to work together from a technical and administrative point of view, for example with regard to the amendments referring to the classification of documents and the register. </seg>
<seg id=1169> We have no written document before us and, in future too, I would like the Commission to inform the Members of its recommendations in writing. </seg>
<seg id=1170> Welcome </seg>
<seg id=1171> We welcome the enhanced status accorded to credit risk mitigation, particularly the collateral which may be offered by small businesses. </seg>
<seg id=1172> Report (A5-0321/2000) tabled by Mr Blokland, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the incineration of waste [C5-0371/2000 - 1998/0289(COD)] </seg>
<seg id=1173> Mr President, might I ask the Liberal Group - I am also asking in my capacity as one of the co-rapporteurs - to take a slightly more pragmatic approach? </seg>
<seg id=1174> It is therefore a joint request from the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists to postpone the vote until November II. </seg>
<seg id=1175> I therefore move that we postpone the vote on the Villiers report until the November II part-session. </seg>
<seg id=1176> I followed the order established by the sessional services and the House did not make any changes. </seg>
<seg id=1177> As President on duty today, I have to tell you that, as your fellow Member, all I can say is that I agree with you. </seg>
<seg id=1178> Apart from the negativity which they demonstrated during the first stage, when the European Parliament called attention to the risks in Great Britain, action during the second stage, when the crisis was at its height in Great Britain, was basically limited to that country, and there was no immediate programme of strict controls or attempt to restructure animal feedingstuffs at pan-European level. </seg>
<seg id=1179> That is why we want to learn four major lessons which should be borne in mind for the future. </seg>
<seg id=1180> - (FR) We voted in favour of this joint resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1181> . (PT) The growing number of cases in Britain of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the current situation in France have placed the 'mad cow' or BSE issue even more firmly on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id=1182> For fear of spreading panic among the citizens or with a view to avoiding commercial disasters, certain governments did not provide the Commission with the necessary information quickly enough or did not immediately call a halt to consumption of the products in question or ban their export at the first signs of danger. </seg>
<seg id=1183> The farmers cannot tackle this crisis without help: we need to draw up a support plan for stock-farmers and introduce measures to restore consumer confidence. </seg>
<seg id=1184> Because of the inability of all the European institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, to define an appropriate Community policy that responds to the safety needs of the Member States most directly concerned, problems will arise in deciding whether it is the constraints of the single market or the health and safety needs of our people that come first. </seg>
<seg id=1185> After extensive discussion with the Council, we achieved what we wanted on several points. </seg>
<seg id=1186> The days of landfill sites are now coming to an end and must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies. </seg>
<seg id=1187> social agencies, especially representatives of the vulnerable groups targeted by the programme, are involved in the procedures, </seg>
<seg id=1188> Indeed, while we welcome the return to growth and the fall in unemployment, we must not close our eyes to the fact that inequalities are still with us, if not getting worse. </seg>
<seg id=1189> I believe that the rapporteur is right when he calls for greater participation of public authorities, social partners and civil society in measures to defeat poverty and social exclusion at this time. </seg>
<seg id=1190> The 'working poor' , most of them women, working part-time, for a pittance and in the most insecure jobs, join the trail of poverty so loftily ignored in the official speeches about economic recovery. </seg>
<seg id=1191> Three years ago, the Prime Minister set up the Social Exclusion Unit which coordinates government action to reduce social exclusion by producing joined up solutions to joined up problems. </seg>
<seg id=1192> We now have a plant with more than 60 rotors, taking up as much land as 1000 football pitches. </seg>
<seg id=1193> At present, the Union is dependent on outside supplies for about 50% of its energy, and that figure may well rise to 70% by the year 2020 unless we develop renewable energy sources. </seg>
<seg id=1194> Obviously we have to observe more progressive and effective safety and security rules when using nuclear energy and when storing nuclear waste. </seg>
<seg id=1195> So we must go in search of energy that is already present in nature, but which has remained unused because no one has developed the technology to tap into it. </seg>
<seg id=1196> The preparation of ASEM IV must be used as an opportunity to set out our requirements for democracy, on the one hand, by ensuring that the elected assembles and civil society are kept informed and able to intervene - which involves, in particular, the establishment of a social forum - and, on the other hand, by adhering fully to social, environmental and human rights. </seg>
<seg id=1197> The Central American parliament appears to have recently been the subject of certain misunderstandings and even criticism. </seg>
<seg id=1198> We saw that Parlacen was going through the same changes that this Parliament went through at the beginning, since it had to fight and continues to fight to have more competences, more resources and more presence and to be recognised as representative. </seg>
<seg id=1199> The Central American Parliament, like the European Parliament, must gain prestige, credibility and legitimacy on the basis of the activity of its political groups, because the life of the parties is, or at least should be, a faithful reflection of the societies they represent. </seg>
<seg id=1200> With regard to human rights, we have, since 1990, been supporting the cooperation programmes in favour of respect for human rights by means of education and raising awareness in this area. </seg>
<seg id=1201> (B5-0855/2000) by Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group; </seg>
<seg id=1202> The extreme confusion that has characterised the electoral process over recent weeks in Côte d'Ivoire, which had looked like a model economy until now, is symptomatic of a country in crisis, reflected by an economy in crisis, social despair and, consequently, political chaos. </seg>
<seg id=1203> The political, military and religious leaders must pull out all the stops to make national reconciliation possible. </seg>
<seg id=1204> The debate on nationality Ivoirian - that confused debate that tends solely towards introducing discrimination in favour of a country' s own nationality, something we are combating in our own countries, and whose logical conclusion is the practice of ethnic cleansing - must be used to totally oppose any reference or connotation to Ivoirian nationality and to have these removed from the Ivoirian constitution. </seg>
<seg id=1205> He also supported the amendment to the constitution, with the intention of cutting out his most significant opponent, Watara, on the grounds that one of his parents is not an Ivoirian national. </seg>
<seg id=1206> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even if Côte d'Ivoire used to be a bastion of stability and democracy compared to other states in western and central Africa, for a long time now it has seen ethnic and religious tensions and, most recently, the abuse of power by the former government under President Bedié, which eventually led to the violent military coup. </seg>
<seg id=1207> We condemn the ethnic violence and in particular the political leaders who fomented it with their demagogic rhetoric. </seg>
<seg id=1208> The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: </seg>
<seg id=1209> The forthcoming EU/ASEAN meeting in Laos in December offers us a crucial opportunity to demonstrate our condemnation of this regime in the strongest terms. </seg>
<seg id=1210> In any case, I would not trust our own ministers to raise the matter there. </seg>
<seg id=1211> ASEAN has become, in every sense of the word, a paper tiger in its failure to deal with the awful events in Burma. </seg>
<seg id=1212> The junta has said that it is their intention to try and smash the party as a whole. </seg>
<seg id=1213> It is historically charged and naturally it is an awkward situation. </seg>
<seg id=1214> These slight improvements - which we certainly do not owe to the author of the Socialist Group amendments, Mr Sakellariou - have come about over the last few years and given rise to a situation that is certainly no longer tragic but that remains disastrous and in any case still is no match for the real issues of modern-day Vietnam. </seg>
<seg id=1215> Mr Swoboda, the European Parliament is flexible and efficient. </seg>
<seg id=1216> It would be better still though, if the President were not just to concentrate on reinforcing mutual cooperation, when he visits Hanoi, but if he were to make this very cooperation conditional on the extraction of firm promises from Vietnam to drastically improve the prevailing lamentable human rights situation. </seg>
<seg id=1217> I urge the Council and the Commission to protest in robust terms against this flagrant abuse of freedom of worship by the Vietnamese authorities. </seg>
<seg id=1218> Furthermore, the process has led to the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Commission and Vietnam in 1995. </seg>
<seg id=1219> Of course those are points that were contained in the motion for a resolution we tabled. </seg>
<seg id=1220> I agree that we need to do all that we can to assist them, but we would help most by changing the situation that has caused their misery and that of countless others throughout the world. </seg>
<seg id=1221> The issues that are being discussed are for the medium and long-term. </seg>
<seg id=1222> Mr President, Commissioner, the floods which have affected various areas of northern Italy and other European countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland and France in recent weeks once again raise the issue for Parliament both of an extraordinary, urgent intervention to alleviate the distress of the people, communities and companies affected, and a longer term policy to prevent the repetition of natural disasters of this scale. </seg>
<seg id=1223> Given its anticipated continuous growth - of more than 38% in the next decade - the transport sector will be that which requires the more important measures. </seg>
<seg id=1224> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=1225> Perhaps that is established practice here in Parliament, but I think it is very chancy to give the impression that the European Parliament as an institution is committing itself on a subject such as this one and considering entrusting the Commission with this kind of task, given the very low attendance here. </seg>
<seg id=1226> (Parliament rejected the request for deferral). </seg>
<seg id=1227> The economic and social policy of the ÅU, which has resulted in the reduced purchasing power of and facilities available to workers, as regards the payment of contributions, the emergence of new diseases and the unaccountability of pharmaceutical companies, have caused health costs to spiral. </seg>
<seg id=1228> For the rest, this opens the door wide to private insurers, on condition only that they do not (from the outset) select the patient and the insurance premiums by type of disease. </seg>
<seg id=1229> People who do not earn or spend much no longer count for anything. </seg>
<seg id=1230> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased to be able to speak today in the presence of a group of visitors from my lovely constituency, whom I welcome very warmly. </seg>
<seg id=1231> However, that also means that these institutions must be given enough time to prepare for the new rules. </seg>
<seg id=1232> The report refers to a growing consensus that the present framework fails adequately to capture the changes in the financial sector over the past ten years. </seg>
<seg id=1233> We are in favour of putting more emphasis on risk mitigation techniques; and we are also in favour of broadening the basic concept of the Basel Committee. </seg>
<seg id=1234> We also think that this report makes an important and satisfactory contribution to the whole process. </seg>
<seg id=1235> And finally, and this is a key point, we are entirely alert to the fact that we ought to respect the institutional balance established in the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=1236> The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m. </seg>
<seg id=1237> Before I finish, Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the rapporteur, Mr Söderman, and congratulate him on his work on fighting maladministration and thereby also bringing European citizens closer to the life of the Community institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1238> Mr President, in accordance with the Nordic public service tradition, the European Parliament has, positively enough, claimed that the Ombudsman's position should be strengthened and consolidated. </seg>
<seg id=1239> The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m. </seg>
<seg id=1240> After all, access to documentation is a fundamental civil right and no documentation is more important to a candidate than documentation in relation to examinations. </seg>
<seg id=1241> We thought it legitimate for candidates to have access to their marked test papers, since access to documents is a fundamental right and one that is also recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights we adopted this week. </seg>
<seg id=1242> And that is how it should be. </seg>
<seg id=1243> The example should be followed by all other institutions and bodies, as the Committee on Petitions has recommended. </seg>
<seg id=1244> Citizens of the European Union should receive a positive impression when encountering the Community institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1245> And the something new in this case is that it must apply best practices and avoid anything which experience tells us will damage its credibility within the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1246> With regard to other institutions, it is they themselves who will decide whether the procedures proposed in this report or in the requests by the Ombudsman are adopted. </seg>
<seg id=1247> The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed. </seg>
<seg id=1248> If they are prevented by some unavoidable catastrophe that is a breach of democracy, but if they do not bother coming, they do not deserve the vote. </seg>
<seg id=1249> I endorse the criteria of greater prudence adopted, but other aspects of the matter must also be taken into consideration, particularly the solvency ratio, which is a weighting factor according to the type of counter-party used to estimate the credit risk associated with a bank's assets. </seg>
<seg id=1250> Provisional establishment of the European Police College (EPC) </seg>
<seg id=1251> This police cooperation is crucial if we are to achieve the very important objective of affording European citizens a high degree of security within the European area of freedom, security and justice. </seg>
<seg id=1252> The enlargement of the European Union, which will extend the space in which citizens are free to move, should be accompanied by supplementary measures ensuring safety and peaceful co-existence among the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1253> From what I see, conditions in French and Portuguese jails are very different. </seg>
<seg id=1254> In other words, if you want common standards, you have to start by defining these. Otherwise, you end up with training that may be completely different in form from area to area. </seg>
<seg id=1255> However, Mr Posselt's work has resulted in provision at last being made for police training to include human rights and the right of defence, and the proposal is also important and appropriate at the moment to create a virtual police college which would take advantage of the potential offered by the Internet. </seg>
<seg id=1256> But here we are in Strasbourg in a near-deserted Chamber hearing that which is almost unbelievable. </seg>
<seg id=1257> It is a good idea and in the European Union where people have freedom of movement, freedom of trade and the right of establishment, where travellers from Scotland can go to Sicily or Greece, it is only logical to expect to develop a common system of maintaining the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id=1258> In the Netherlands, the police are trained in the de-escalation of conflicts and in repressive tolerance whereby the existence of subcultures and ethnic minorities, the organisation of political protest and the use of churches as ports of refuge for illegal immigrants are seen as normal social phenomena. </seg>
<seg id=1259> Whoever believes that the solutions that they advocate are good should not have anything to fear from exposure to other people' s solutions. </seg>
<seg id=1260> I hope that, in this area, the College will provide a starting point for the future. </seg>
<seg id=1261> This is a good illustration of what we are starting to call 'Network Europe' , a Europe which puts nations in contact with each other directly, without the need to maintain pointless superstructures. </seg>
<seg id=1262> Most of the cases of child abduction are actually handled very efficiently and appropriately by the central authorities in all Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1263> It is therefore crucial that this loophole must be plugged for reasons of fairness, of realism given the way society is changing and for the sake of equal rights and obligations for all of the European Union' s citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1264> Meantime, we welcome this measure and we will vote heartily for it. </seg>
<seg id=1265> Because we support the goal that has been set, we are voting for the proposed measures. </seg>
<seg id=1266> The point about the one day clearly refers to people who often travel right across the world to see a child. </seg>
<seg id=1267> The European Parliament' s statements on this matter and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, confirm the validity of the approach adopted by the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1268> I know that FIFA have played for time already and has waited far too long before coming up with any response to the Commission's formal statement issued back in 1998. </seg>
<seg id=1269> It is only natural that the member of the Commission responsible for sports should represent the Union in WADA in the future. </seg>
<seg id=1270> UK decision to impose a levy on non-British hauliers </seg>
<seg id=1271> Ireland, is obviously a very small but open market, yet most of what we buy comes from the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id=1272> In conclusion, we are being premature in the European Parliament in holding this debate, but I welcome the fact and the statement from Commissioner Vitorino which clearly indicates that the UK government has the right to introduce a euro-vignette system provided it keeps within the rules and regulations already in place. </seg>
<seg id=1273> Mr President, taxes and tolls are obviously sensitive matters, and I can confirm this specifically on behalf of Austria where we are always having this discussion and where, of course, good traffic solutions are constantly being sought. </seg>
<seg id=1274> This is not discriminating against every other driver or road haulier in Europe to the benefit of British drivers. </seg>
<seg id=1275> He is paying over the odds for his vignette unless there is some special dispensation on a per diem basis. </seg>
<seg id=1276> On 22 November, the very day of the 25th anniversary of the coronation of King Juan Carlos, which paved the way to democracy in Spain, one of the key figures in this democracy has, in turn, paid with his life for his belief in freedom, tolerance and respect for the rights of others. </seg>
<seg id=1277> So please keep them safe until then. </seg>
<seg id=1278> The European Union negotiating position concentrated on safeguarding the environmental integrity of the Kyoto protocol in the areas of land-use change and forestry, the "sinks" issue, the relation between the Kyoto mechanism and domestic action, known as "supplementarity" , and compliance. </seg>
<seg id=1279> With a view to preparing this next session, the EU should not reopen discussions on all issues, but focus on key priorities, notably "sinks" mechanisms, "supplementarity" and a strong compliance regime. </seg>
<seg id=1280> Mr Prescott is now holed below the water line and we do not know how long he will remain afloat. </seg>
<seg id=1281> My final comment is that I find it right and proper that you have remained firm on the issue of "sinks" , primarily because it is extremely difficult to measure "sinks" accurately. </seg>
<seg id=1282> Nuclear energy has no chance of making a comeback. </seg>
<seg id=1283> But we must press on, and equality must be incorporated in Bonn, in May 2001. </seg>
<seg id=1284> We will still need to find a compromise of this kind at the follow-up conference due to take place in May 2001, in Bonn. </seg>
<seg id=1285> The challenge facing us in the issue of climate change is clearly one of the greatest challenges in the 21st century, if we are all to have a planet to live on in the future. </seg>
<seg id=1286> The same applies to the partial inclusion of the CO2 sinks, such as the additional planting of forests. </seg>
<seg id=1287> The Conference in The Hague is to be resumed, as you have informed us, Commissioner, next spring in Bonn. </seg>
<seg id=1288> Madam President, thank you, Commissioner Wallström, for your intervention. </seg>
<seg id=1289> If there is one area in which there has been no lack of unity, it is in this relationship. </seg>
<seg id=1290> Failing to achieve an agreement at the next COP6 meeting is not an option. </seg>
<seg id=1291> We were very constructive and we negotiated until the last minute of these talks in The Hague. </seg>
<seg id=1292> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have the floor. </seg>
<seg id=1293> Some countries still have major problems regarding the coordination of social security systems, tax, asylum, visa and immigration matters and trade negotiations on services - a very important issue. </seg>
<seg id=1294> Let me add that we have not yet reached agreement on the distribution of seats in the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1295> Finding an agreement which will enable the Union to operate after the new accessions currently in active preparation is vital for the future of the European Union and indeed the enlarged Union. </seg>
<seg id=1296> Your President is invited, of course. </seg>
<seg id=1297> It will be forwarded to Nice, where we naturally hope it will be endorsed. </seg>
<seg id=1298> You can see that we have a very full discussion programme for Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1299> In a Union of 27 or more Member States, the unanimity requirement will, quite simply, paralyse progress in every area where it is maintained. </seg>
<seg id=1300> You spoke of codecision by the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1301> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=1302> That challenge is the reunification of our old continent; that challenge is an enlargement unparalleled in scale and that is what Nice must prepare us for. </seg>
<seg id=1303> Madam President, the most important aim of the Nice Summit is enlargement of the European Union and the EU' s preparation for this enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=1304> Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I do not believe that the Governments of the 15 Member States have covered themselves in glory. </seg>
<seg id=1305> This is not an appropriate method. </seg>
<seg id=1306> It is now proposed that decisions should be made by qualified majority voting in 49 of these areas. </seg>
<seg id=1307> Majority decision-making will destroy the right of veto for the Member States as parliamentary democracies, but the EU will not itself become a parliamentary democracy. </seg>
<seg id=1308> Mr President, Europe needs leadership, clarity, choices and decisiveness. </seg>
<seg id=1309> We do not find the principle of blackmailing into proclamation acceptable with regard to the conclusions the Biarritz European Council, even if it was an informal one. </seg>
<seg id=1310> Yes, we do think that the Nice Council conclusions should include a request that the Commission should draw up a framework directive in this field. </seg>
<seg id=1311> I shall adopt a position on the Treaty of Nice when I see the outcome of the negotiations, but there is a somewhat schizophrenic feel to the debates here. </seg>
<seg id=1312> In Amsterdam, the Heads of State and Government failed their exams, and now they have to go to Nice to resit them. </seg>
<seg id=1313> If the disparity between the large and the small members of the Council becomes too great, we face the risk of a legitimacy crisis within the European Union in a few years' time, because the small countries will no longer feel comfortable in the Council, fearing that they might become unable to defend their own identity. </seg>
<seg id=1314> The French President and the First Minister seem to be more obsessed with their own political future than with that of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1315> In failing to incorporate the text into the Treaty and only subscribing to it in political terms, we are opening the door to major problems of legal interpretation. </seg>
<seg id=1316> On the other hand, I would stress the considerable importance of providing our Europe with strong institutions to fill the institutional void being created by progress on the economic front with the euro. </seg>
<seg id=1317> The stated aim of this review is to design more efficient institutions which will be able to cope with an enlarged Europe and, at the same time, to reduce the democratic deficit which certainly exists. </seg>
<seg id=1318> But it also means restructuring the Committee 133 itself: making it far more accountable; ensuring that its agenda and conclusions are accessible and that its composition is broad and inclusive. </seg>
<seg id=1319> Mr President, I am speaking not just to the President-in-Office of the Council but also to all the governments of the Member States when I say that if agreement is not reached in Nice on these difficult issues those issues will not go away. </seg>
<seg id=1320> The working of the codecision procedure over the last year shows that it works. </seg>
<seg id=1321> So I think that, as a first move, it should already be agreed that trade policy needs to come under qualified majority voting. </seg>
<seg id=1322> As a seven year-old girl she was forced to flee her country before the advance of the Red Army, a fugitive hiding in ditches to avoid being strafed by Soviet aircraft. </seg>
<seg id=1323> Mr Méndez de Vigo has just made reference to the Charter, and rightly so. </seg>
<seg id=1324> We can expect no better of him. </seg>
<seg id=1325> As the days go by, it is becoming ever likelier that the agreement the ministers will reach, while not representing the lowest common denominator, will be a rather low common denominator, indeed a very low common denominator. </seg>
<seg id=1326> Mr President, I wish firstly to thank the Members of the European Parliament for a very high standard of debate. </seg>
<seg id=1327> So it is not at all a case of not proclaiming it, and it is not a problem of transparency. </seg>
<seg id=1328> Equal rotation affects big countries too, as actually at any given time they might not have a commissioner, just like everyone else. </seg>
<seg id=1329> I think Parliament will be able to witness the establishment of the improved institutional mechanisms needed to handle the future development of the European Union which unites us all. </seg>
<seg id=1330> The vote will take place tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id=1331> Mr President, I should like to endorse Mr Van Orden's statement. </seg>
<seg id=1332> I am totally opposed to anyone at all threatening an invited Minister, even a Turkish one. </seg>
<seg id=1333> It goes without saying that we in this house of European democracy must guarantee the safety of all our guests and anyone who spends time within these four walls. </seg>
<seg id=1334> On the grounds that pills do no harm and that "Marijuana is a treatment for tumours", the Minister for Health undermined the dignity of the individual by calling for the drug to be legalised. </seg>
<seg id=1335> This is, at the very least, poor manners with regard to the European Parliament, if not an outright snub, and, allowing for the possibility that the Members of the European Parliament have nothing to say about human rights, even though they have voted, by a very large majority, in favour of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, they will be absent from this European Union forum which many of them attended last year in order to debate with NGOs and institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1336> We have now said enough on that score. </seg>
<seg id=1337> In point of fact, before Amsterdam both the European Parliament and the Commission took the view that it would be best to have a Vice-President of the Commission with responsibility for foreign policy who would also assume the role of the High Representative and would have a special obligation to and link with the Council. </seg>
<seg id=1338> On 15 June before the Feira Summit, the European Parliament passed a resolution, and tomorrow, on the eve of the Nice Council, it has to vote on a text summarising its position. </seg>
<seg id=1339> The development of the ESDP is a major new departure for the European project and therefore needs to have the existing institutional framework clarified. </seg>
<seg id=1340> At Nice, the European Council is due to adopt several decisions, which I shall now discuss. </seg>
<seg id=1341> For the first debate, at the beginning of next year, the Commission will draw up a scoreboard, country by country, for the past budgetary year, which will show the current state of commitments, payments, and outstanding amounts for the main programmes funded by the Community budget and by the EDF. </seg>
<seg id=1342> We also applied ourselves to the issue of regional cooperation, an idea that met with a degree of resistance from the countries in the region that do not wish to be locked into a past from which they have broken free, and I think I can say that, as a result of this summit, they understood that there was no contradiction between regional cooperation and their progress and rapprochement in relation to the European Union, largely through the stabilisation and association process which was confirmed and laid down on that occasion. </seg>
<seg id=1343> Previously, a summit was held with India, under the Portuguese Presidency, and a ministerial meeting will be taking place with ASEAN. </seg>
<seg id=1344> This is not, however, going to put us off. </seg>
<seg id=1345> I would remind you of the wide range of tasks that this covers: humanitarian aid, the evacuation of nationals, conflict prevention and also the separation by force of the warring parties. </seg>
<seg id=1346> It is underpinned, of course, by the independence of the European Union' s decision making and by the acknowledgement of the voluntary and political nature of the commitments that have been given. </seg>
<seg id=1347> He has done more than most as a personalised version of conflict resolution in a part of the world which I know well and has been properly commended globally for his efforts. </seg>
<seg id=1348> I find some of the coverage that the creation of this force has received in the country I know best quite extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id=1349> I would like to thank the honourable lady, Madame Lalumière, for highlighting the report on conflict prevention, which the Commission is preparing together with the High Representative for the Nice European Council. </seg>
<seg id=1350> Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. </seg>
<seg id=1351> That will be the real test for the European Union in my view. </seg>
<seg id=1352> Impatient citizens complain that the wheels of European bureaucracy turn infinitely slowly. </seg>
<seg id=1353> However, citizens too must, as far as possible, be given access to information and documents. </seg>
<seg id=1354> It is still completely unclear in the current proposals as to what that role should be. </seg>
<seg id=1355> If you fly a European flag on your car, you can go anywhere, even into the most miserable refugee camp. </seg>
<seg id=1356> That is why I believe that Europe must decide to act now. </seg>
<seg id=1357> If we as Europeans cannot play a responsible role in the resolution of this conflict, independently of the United States, we must assume that we shall not be trusted to act as a mediator in any other regional conflicts either. </seg>
<seg id=1358> However, your personal commitment must not be seen as a substitute for democratic legitimisation of the European security and defence policy. </seg>
<seg id=1359> I cannot accept certain details of Mrs Lalumière' s report, and in the final vote I shall support its rejection. </seg>
<seg id=1360> Neglect of this wide range of instruments of non-military conflict prevention would turn out to be a mistake in the long run, and in that respect I am dissatisfied with the Council's statements to the effect that we have already taken decisions, but that things will move in this general direction. </seg>
<seg id=1361> As I am sure you will have understood, we intend to vote against both reports and we promise to fight tooth and nail against policies which express ... </seg>
<seg id=1362> Thirdly, a nuclear-free corridor, such as Olaf Palme once suggested, should be created from the Baltic to the Black Sea. </seg>
<seg id=1363> Could I congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her report. </seg>
<seg id=1364> Mr Brok' s report also discusses the post of High Representative for the CFSP. </seg>
<seg id=1365> What a pity, I say to my colleagues Van Orden and others, because my colleagues just across the pond, the Irish Sea, have so much to offer in this area: the tradition, the experience and the practice. </seg>
<seg id=1366> The European Parliament, working together with the national parliaments, is, in my opinion, the most appropriate body for this task. </seg>
<seg id=1367> I believe that the lessons we learn in this latest development will serve us well in the future as we come to terms with the need to establish a European defence policy and capability, which in my view is as much an essential component of European integration as is the single currency. </seg>
<seg id=1368> I also think that the European Union has the specific ability to combine these various instruments and that what we must do, if this policy progresses and becomes consolidated, is to develop a genuine European culture of conflict prevention and management. </seg>
<seg id=1369> I believe we will see a positive dialogue developing. </seg>
<seg id=1370> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resignation of the Commission in March 1999 highlighted the need to reform its structures and working methods. </seg>
<seg id=1371> Although it may be led from the top, the reform must be clear and visible to the unions, to all the staff, who must be effectively associated in this whole process. </seg>
<seg id=1372> That measure will take time, but it is inevitable and crucial to the reform. </seg>
<seg id=1373> The reform of the Commission is crucial to the future of our institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1374> In drawing up my report, I have been able to study not only the White Paper, but also the second report of the committee of independent experts and the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 19 January, proposed by Michiel van Hulten, on the work of the aforementioned committee of experts. </seg>
<seg id=1375> The Court of Auditors indicates in its report that it is not opposed to the removal of prior approval provided that it is replaced by other procedures, which offer guarantees that are at least equivalent, and can thereby involve parties other than the financial controller. </seg>
<seg id=1376> Big organisations everywhere now are becoming more open; they are becoming more transparent; they are using information technology in new ways; they are moving away from traditional vertical forms of organisation, sharing information across organisations and between each other. </seg>
<seg id=1377> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite its scope the contents of the White Paper presented by Mr Kinnock do not directly raise any institutional topics. </seg>
<seg id=1378> We discussed that during this afternoon's debate on the common foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=1379> Finally, we must deal with the thorny issue of the proposal on early retirement. </seg>
<seg id=1380> The de-centralisation of financial control to DGs is an important step but it will only work if staff are properly trained, if sufficient resources are available, and if the responsibility of line managers is properly enforced. </seg>
<seg id=1381> An institution and its directors must have clear scope for the best possible administrative practices. </seg>
<seg id=1382> As for disciplinary procedures, pledges have been made here too, but no clear rules have been formulated so far, nor have we seen or heard any clear statements as to how such rules would be enforced, nor has the question of external agencies been conclusively resolved. </seg>
<seg id=1383> This process of transformation is necessary to be able to truly serve God and cannot be enforced by rules. </seg>
<seg id=1384> As in the case of anything new which changes established situations, care and precision are clearly necessary. </seg>
<seg id=1385> We shall however be withdrawing Amendment No 6 and asking for a split vote on the latter part of Amendment No 15 as we do not believe the current system within the ECB lends itself to this situation. </seg>
<seg id=1386> When I was previously in this Parliament, the President of the Commission was Jacques Delors and he worked alongside Commissioner Brittan and before him Commissioner Cockfield. </seg>
<seg id=1387> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we are monitoring this reform with justifiably high expectations. </seg>
<seg id=1388> Issues such as the BSE crisis, oil prices, and the greenhouse effect have a distinctly European dimension. </seg>
<seg id=1389> The public must also be able to feel that the Commission is truly accessible and transparent. </seg>
<seg id=1390> For the European Parliament, reform is a vital matter on which it has decisive effect as a budgetary authority and as a legislature. </seg>
<seg id=1391> It defines many clear procedures in several channels for reporting alleged wrong-doing inside and outside an official's employing institution. </seg>
<seg id=1392> I am therefore sure that we will have the pleasure of hearing you in the future. </seg>
<seg id=1393> Let me say briefly, Mr Garriga Polledo, that the categories used in the Financial Regulation have been retained. </seg>
<seg id=1394> The staff of the Commission are also agents of the reform process, so it has to meet with their acceptance too. </seg>
<seg id=1395> We believe that a cosmetic reform makes no sense in these times of profound change. </seg>
<seg id=1396> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by emphasising the quality of Mrs Sauquillo's own-initiative report on the reform of the Commission and its impact on the effectiveness of the European Union's relations with the developing countries. </seg>
<seg id=1397> We want to work towards a culture of greater accountability. </seg>
<seg id=1398> Before we start to talk about aid to projects, we should try to remove all the existing causes of exploitation, identifying and bringing to justice those who have exploited and abused peoples which are in a state of need. </seg>
<seg id=1399> It is precisely because Mr Nielson is loyal to that collegiate responsibility that he will doubtless defend the proposal tonight. </seg>
<seg id=1400> What seems to us even more serious in the Commission' s proposal is the territorial separation, which is maintained. </seg>
<seg id=1401> In 2001, for instance, financial responsibilities will be deconcentrated to 22 delegations, 15 more delegations will see their computer facilities upgraded and 40 additional posts of officials will be allocated to external services. </seg>
<seg id=1402> Safety at sea </seg>
<seg id=1403> But the Erika and the Ievoli Sun were not French ships. </seg>
<seg id=1404> In fact, it has been among the highest priority items on the Commission's agenda ever since the fatal sinking of the Erika 11 months ago. </seg>
<seg id=1405> We hope and expect that the Transport Council, on 21 December, will add their part to the common determination among the European institutions to bring about a real improvement in maritime safety by the adoption of common positions on all three texts. </seg>
<seg id=1406> I think it is within sight but we need to be sure that this agreement will be enforced. </seg>
<seg id=1407> I understand and I welcome the minister's efforts to expedite these two reports as quickly as possible and I therefore consider that, in principle, his proposal to discuss the matter, if possible in December, is a positive one. </seg>
<seg id=1408> As a result of all of this, we have drawn up a parliamentary report amending the directive, which suggests improvements in various aspects aimed at strengthening the classification system, as a means and a valid tool for guaranteeing the safety of maritime traffic. </seg>
<seg id=1409> However, the legacy of the years when materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us, often with very severe consequences. </seg>
<seg id=1410> To this end, publication of information is a vital component in the establishment of a way for the general public to obtain information, emergency phone contact numbers, etc. </seg>
<seg id=1411> I expect a great deal from the second series of proposals and from the establishment of a European maritime safety agency. </seg>
<seg id=1412> I believe your intentions are honourable, but we can only discuss negotiating outcomes that have been examined by the Council. </seg>
<seg id=1413> We know, of course, that port state control has not been a potent guarantor of maritime safety in the past, we know that the classification societies have not all discharged their duties as shipping inspectorates properly and conscientiously and that some of them have tended to be slipshod, and we know that tankers without double hulls are floating time bombs. </seg>
<seg id=1414> We are working to establish new credibility; we should not jeopardise it by letting the Commission take the wrong course of action. </seg>
<seg id=1415> Those who are not prepared to take on this responsibility must stay out of our waters and our ports. </seg>
<seg id=1416> The Watts report intensifies the measures against ships posing serious risks or flying flags of convenience without abolishing them altogether. </seg>
<seg id=1417> Nonetheless, I am delighted that the Commission proposals have taken on board the main demands formulated by the elected representatives of the coastal regions: the banning of single-hull oil tankers, strengthening port controls, and the assessment of classification societies. </seg>
<seg id=1418> I also support his demand for compulsory voyage data recorders. </seg>
<seg id=1419> The guarantees of the seaworthiness of vessels required that considerable measures be adopted on the societies responsible and on inspections, as has already been said. </seg>
<seg id=1420> In short, measures are an informal way of trying to bring safety to the desired standard. </seg>
<seg id=1421> Everyone has stated - and I absolutely agree - that the current 25% inspection rate necessary for port state control has not been achieved yet. </seg>
<seg id=1422> The time has long gone for simple compromises, which some, moreover, are saying will be difficult to achieve. </seg>
<seg id=1423> As far as the classification societies are concerned, it is my duty and my wish to re-emphasise on this occasion that the main focal point of the present discussion seems to be liability. </seg>
<seg id=1424> It is important to tighten up regulations regarding the control of harbours and ports even further, and enhance its effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id=1425> Laxness towards large companies is indeed a sign that they are more powerful than elected institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1426> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the issue of safety at sea, in other words, the safety of human life and environmental protection, is a very serious issue. </seg>
<seg id=1427> The reports that have been presented are a move in this direction. </seg>
<seg id=1428> We agree with imposing a lower limit for personal injury or death and material damage, leaving the Member States free to raise these limits. </seg>
<seg id=1429> Presenting new technologies and making improvements to the vessel design are part of this important work. </seg>
<seg id=1430> We must move forward towards consensus upon maximum maritime regulation and safety. </seg>
<seg id=1431> I am glad to say that the Commission will support many of the amendments put forward in these three reports. </seg>
<seg id=1432> The Commission can accept Amendment Nos 6, 7 and 8, but can only partially accept Amendment No 1. </seg>
<seg id=1433> It is expected that the IMO will formally adopt the phase out schedule at its April meeting next year. </seg>
<seg id=1434> The Commission' s task is to confirm that the classification society continues to meet the qualitative criteria in the directive and to monitor the performance of the classification societies. </seg>
<seg id=1435> The Commission appreciates the support for its originally proposed limit. </seg>
<seg id=1436> Once again, this demonstrates how urgent the adoption of strengthened, preventative and restoratory Community measures for the protection of our seas is. </seg>
<seg id=1437> Mr Turco, I have understood what you had to say and I will give the matter some thought. </seg>
<seg id=1438> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) </seg>
<seg id=1439> Madam President, I should like to move that the amendment be altered so that it begins with the words "urges, in this respect, the Council and the Commission". </seg>
<seg id=1440> Report (A5-0329/2000) by Mr Pomés Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the White Paper on reforming the Commission (aspects concerning the Committee on Budgetary Control) [COM(2000)0200 - C5-0445/2000 - 2000/2215(COS)] </seg>
<seg id=1441> McKenna report (A5-0336/2000) </seg>
<seg id=1442> The unaccountability of shipowners is being bolstered by the privatisation of shipping registers, which shipowners now control, and by the lack of any basic inspection controls or other form of involvement on the part of government authorities. </seg>
<seg id=1443> I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteurs Watts, Vachetta and Piétrasanta have endeavoured to close the gaps still present in the Commission proposal. </seg>
<seg id=1444> The responsibility for putting these measures in place rests therefore with the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1445> We must not allow single-hull tankers to carry on sailing in our waters when they are no longer present elsewhere after 2005, 2010 or 2015. </seg>
<seg id=1446> Yet Mr Hatzidakis makes proposals which restrict the scope of the Commission proposals. </seg>
<seg id=1447> Promoting more stringent regulations at an international level must continue to be the fundamental objective of our maritime safety policy. </seg>
<seg id=1448> It is particularly important that it is made clear that the polluter-pays principle must apply in full. </seg>
<seg id=1449> This Community action must be accompanied by the reactivation of the IMO which, endowed with genuine police power to enforce the International Safety Management Code, would be an effective instrument on a par with Interpol. </seg>
<seg id=1450> As long as it costs less to transgress rules than it does to comply with them, companies that have maximum profits in their sights will carry on making the wrong choices. </seg>
<seg id=1451> Preparation for the Nice European Council </seg>
<seg id=1452> Instead of raising human and social rights to a higher level, the Charter will make it easier to bring them down. </seg>
<seg id=1453> Unfortunately though, I do not see any evidence of this notion in the motions for resolutions. </seg>
<seg id=1454> While, like many others, I have at times during this semester regretted that we have heard so little from Prime Minister Jospin himself due to reasons of 'cohabitation' , I am aware of the strong impetus he has always given to his ministers and I should like to state as much. </seg>
<seg id=1455> In the social sphere, the proposals are too timid and do not even effectively flesh out the commitments adopted at the Lisbon Summit, particularly as regards the need for strengthening economic and social cohesion. </seg>
<seg id=1456> In this sense, no decision about the development of the EU should be taken which risks alienating the citizens of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1457> British people want reform of the EU to make it more accountable and more efficient. </seg>
<seg id=1458> This text uses the future (and ever more distant) enlargement of the European Union as a pretext to call for the reinforcement of a system which has already run out of steam. </seg>
<seg id=1459> Now, there are squabbles not only between the 'larger' and the 'smaller' but among the 'larger' too. </seg>
<seg id=1460> . (SV) We welcome and support the report, which touches on many important trends in the development of the common foreign and security policy. </seg>
<seg id=1461> As every year, this ritual report prepared by the European Parliament, which is in principle devoted to the annual general budget of the CFSP, employs the well-known method of gradual shifts which work on a federalist crevice found in a given area in order to extend this breach with scant regard for the Treaties or the decisions of the European Councils. </seg>
<seg id=1462> While chatting to me he learnt that a military force of the States of Europe is being organised, a force ready to intervene to keep the peace in and around Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1463> Nor, furthermore, is it a task for the European Parliament to define what capacity a European rapid reaction force should possess and whether or not it should, for example, include a capacity for intervention by air and sea. </seg>
<seg id=1464> Future conflicts will not be solved through military intervention but rather via a policy for social, economic and ecological justice. </seg>
<seg id=1465> We are radically opposed to this European army as we are to NATO and to our own national army. </seg>
<seg id=1466> For example, the wording is far too far-reaching in respect of CESDP and NATO, in respect of the use of "threats of the use of force" as a means of applying pressure in conflict prevention activities, which directly contravenes the UN Charter. </seg>
<seg id=1467> Now, in the decade following the upheavals in the East, we think that, with these reports, 'the European peace project' is sending an unhelpful signal to the applicant States. </seg>
<seg id=1468> A mere six of these paragraphs contain statements relating to the title of the report. </seg>
<seg id=1469> Sadly, there is clearly an aim at overriding national abortion laws or even punishing or suppressing faith traditions opposing abortion. </seg>
<seg id=1470> Many tens of thousands of women in the European Union who provide domestic help in the informal sector of the economy would no doubt be delighted that we are dealing with the regulation of such activity, if only they knew. </seg>
<seg id=1471> Smet proposes, amongst other things, that a European definition of domestic work be introduced. </seg>
<seg id=1472> The needs of domestic workers should be considered when employment legislation is being drafted. </seg>
<seg id=1473> They have given their pension contributions to the various national governments, which have quickly made them vanish like clever magicians. </seg>
<seg id=1474> Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group forcefully recalls that the citizens of the European Union expect more than ever that reform measures and staff recruitment must take account of the diversity of opinions and convictions which are expressed in our countries. </seg>
<seg id=1475> As far as human resources are concerned, the quality of employees and greater transparency in staffing policy in general must become the strong points of the new administrative reform. </seg>
<seg id=1476> During this explanation of vote, I must emphasise the fact that Parliament does not, unfortunately, have all the powers it should have. </seg>
<seg id=1477> I would like to close with a procedural motion. </seg>
<seg id=1478> The reports are certainly contradictory, Mr Barón Crespo. </seg>
<seg id=1479> It is not what the Group of the Party of European Socialists wants. </seg>
<seg id=1480> That is exactly why we have a problem: this is an important summit and everything we say counts. </seg>
<seg id=1481> I must point out that the Committee is to meet tomorrow afternoon, firstly to try to really get to grips with what the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference were. </seg>
<seg id=1482> (Parliament approved the proposal) </seg>
<seg id=1483> I should be grateful if you would agree to that request. </seg>
<seg id=1484> I, personally, was horrified by the murder of a sympathiser on hunger strike by a detachment of the Grey Wolves in Rotterdam a few days ago. </seg>
<seg id=1485> This would have been completely unnecessary, of course, if the Council had taken more notice, or indeed any notice, of our first reading and the amended proposal from the Commission, which went some way towards our goal. </seg>
<seg id=1486> Thirdly, we must check whether the stipulations we approve will really help to improve the functioning of the internal market and whether they are commensurate with the goal to be achieved. </seg>
<seg id=1487> The second concern, of a specifically legal nature, has, on the other hand, encouraged us to increase the interdependence of the harmonisation of the market and the protection of health even further, by meticulously following the recommendations arising from the Court of Justice' s reasons for recently setting aside the Directive on advertising, reasons of which only a biased reading could lead one to conclude that the two aspects are incompatible. </seg>
<seg id=1488> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 80 fatalities in Europe from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Europe, its Council of Ministers, the Commission and Parliament decide to ban meat-and-bone meal and exclude cattle over 30 months' old from the food chain without prior testing. </seg>
<seg id=1489> We feel it is self-evident that Article 95 should form the legal basis for this directive together with Article 133, as the committee are now proposing in Amendment No 1. </seg>
<seg id=1490> The Court held that a total ban on tobacco advertising cannot be justified in the name of the proper functioning of the internal market. </seg>
<seg id=1491> I still feel that messages such as 'low-tar' , 'mild' and 'light' are misleading, so I will, in fact, oppose Amendments Nos 10 and 30. </seg>
<seg id=1492> I would also like to talk about the obligation inherent in the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=1493> The rapporteur, Mr Maaten, has, with good reason, proposed reinforcing that legal basis with a reference to another article, Article 133 on external trade, and furthermore has proposed a series of amendments to some of the articles with the aim of preventing this directive being challenged on the basis of the case-law established by the judgment of the Court of Justice. </seg>
<seg id=1494> I am sorry that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also expressed opinions that the Court ban on tobacco advertising would in some way render this directive null and void. </seg>
<seg id=1495> Indeed, as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy I have been strongly lobbied by various groups about the need to regulate more strictly the sale and presentation of tobacco products in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1496> Yet, ironically, I do not see in this directive any prohibition on growing tobacco within the Community - even when in countries such as Greece the tobacco grown is so strong that under this directive it would become a criminal offence to use it for manufacturing. </seg>
<seg id=1497> I also think there is reason to thank Mr Byrne for a very clear presentation of the legal basis. </seg>
<seg id=1498> More than half a million people die needlessly each year in the European Union and the number is set to grow if we do not act now. </seg>
<seg id=1499> This legal basis, too, is completely worthless in my opinion, and that is why the unions, companies and colleagues here are right to refer to job losses. </seg>
<seg id=1500> I want to see the photographic warning option, sensible listing of ingredients, Europe-wide research, health promotion measures to help children to remain smoke, tar, nicotine and addiction free. </seg>
<seg id=1501> There was also a readiness to compromise within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </seg>
<seg id=1502> The exemption would apply to Article 3, as I understand the amendment, i.e. tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels. </seg>
<seg id=1503> Given the general nature of the directive, we cannot sever one from the other and, therefore, we have to strike it all down. </seg>
<seg id=1504> The creation of a maximum-sized warning label for some large packs would be a proportionate solution. </seg>
<seg id=1505> Finally, a total of 54 amendments have been tabled in the report and of these I am pleased to inform you that the Commission can accept 33, either totally or partially. </seg>
<seg id=1506> The main argument in favour of these amendments and of a report at the end of five years actually concerns enlargement of the European Union, which, following the Nice Summit, is particularly apposite and appropriate. </seg>
<seg id=1507> Summer time definitely seems to go hand-in-hand with better quality of life, as the positive effects of the summer time period are far more significant than the transitional problems linked to the change itself. </seg>
<seg id=1508> Summer time is not the problem for our common European House. </seg>
<seg id=1509> A one-off review by the Commission in five years' time will suffice. </seg>
<seg id=1510> There are also the requirements of manufacturers of computers or electronic tachographs and producers of calendars and diaries. </seg>
<seg id=1511> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, medical research which is essential for patients must be approved quickly and with minimum bureaucracy, but at the same time ethical boundaries must be strictly respected and the subjects must be given maximum protection from abuse. </seg>
<seg id=1512> This is an important condition which we make here in our report. </seg>
<seg id=1513> So, although there are still some points of disagreement with the Council, I would like to remind you that the result we are seeking to obtain through the adoption of this directive is the outcome of lengthy and fruitful compromise negotiations between Mr Liese, our rapporteur, whom I thank and congratulate on his inclusive and constructive approach, and the Council, which has proved cooperative and open to the amendments adopted at second reading in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </seg>
<seg id=1514> I am particularly thinking of cancer research, but there are many others. </seg>
<seg id=1515> Unfortunately, although the right measures are taken, they are unable to prevent new risks and diseases from emerging which the drugs available are unable to treat, and the medical community is obliged to find modern, more effective ways of meeting these challenges. </seg>
<seg id=1516> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m. </seg>
<seg id=1517> What we have agreed with the Council and the Commission and, of course, with Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, so as to avoid a second reading and allow these programmes to continue without a break, thereby avoiding any gaps, is to extend the four programmes by two years, as the Commission has requested; however, the money will only be released a year at a time, so that if the new health programme is approved and enters into force in the meantime, there will be no need for an extension and the money can be used for the second year. </seg>
<seg id=1518> In general, it is high time the Member States agreed to give the European Union a greater margin of manoeuvre and a more substantial budget, on a legitimately supranational issue: diseases know no frontiers. </seg>
<seg id=1519> International organisations such as Europol have estimated that the importation of drugs into the Union is actually increasing. </seg>
<seg id=1520> Public health is national policy and should stay that way. </seg>
<seg id=1521> The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0355/2000) by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic with a view to adopting a Council Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal procedure [9650/2000 - C5-0392/00 - 2000/0813 (CNS)]. </seg>
<seg id=1522> Another international initiative is the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power adopted by General Assembly Resolution 40/34 on 29 November 1985. </seg>
<seg id=1523> You may remember the debate on the so-called Di Pietro report, which was held here in this House some time ago. </seg>
<seg id=1524> This initiative targets three basic aspects: the victim' s right to information, access to justice and their right to compensation for damages. </seg>
<seg id=1525> However, the most significant aspect, in my opinion, is that people are finally becoming aware, at Union and other levels, of the need to change opinion on State intervention with regard to crimes. </seg>
<seg id=1526> Member States should be compelled to set up special police units for victims of crime. </seg>
<seg id=1527> Italy has repeatedly requested the extradition of this multiple murderer from France, where Mr Lojacono lives freely, so that he can finally serve his time. </seg>
<seg id=1528> The victim must always have priority. </seg>
<seg id=1529> As you noted, the draft framework decision contains three different types of measures: firstly, it enacts minimum rules with regard to the victim's rights; secondly, it enacts specific rules aiming to take into account the individual situation of those people who are victims of an offence in a Member State other than their State of origin and, thirdly, it encourages the States to develop measures for victim support. </seg>
<seg id=1530> It already works to support the networking at European level of the national services for victim support in order to ensure appropriate care of victims, particularly if they do not reside where the offence took place. </seg>
<seg id=1531> Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting </seg>
<seg id=1532> Mr Varela, chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, the committee responsible, has the floor again. </seg>
<seg id=1533> So well done everyone! </seg>
<seg id=1534> We put the final touches to a joint declaration by the Council and Parliament in a trilogue last Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id=1535> So, as you can see, we have cobbled together a solution for the 2001 budget. </seg>
<seg id=1536> We must consider internally how all the present requirements can be developed into transparent procedures in the area of promotions policy. </seg>
<seg id=1537> We asked what is was called and they said, "It is the unmentionable. </seg>
<seg id=1538> The Council has therefore proceeded to its second reading of the budget, taking account of the agreements concluded with the delegation from Parliament, with the ever-present desire to vote for a budget that will enable us to fund all of the European Union' s priorities and a budget that matches up to real needs and to our true ability to make use of appropriations. </seg>
<seg id=1539> The third important aspect of this Council second reading concerns the agreement reached on the allocation for the "Spirit of Enterprise" programme, which continues and complements the "Employment initiative" for the years 2001 to 2005. </seg>
<seg id=1540> More generally, I wish to emphasise that the budgetary procedure that will be completed in a few days has clearly demonstrated the interest in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999. </seg>
<seg id=1541> The discussions were at times frank, but were always relevant and underpinned by ongoing exchanges of views, which enabled us better to understand each other and therefore to more easily conclude an agreement, which I hope everyone will find satisfactory. </seg>
<seg id=1542> What is important is that no country in the Balkans will now be offered less aid than originally planned before developments in Serbia due to the democratisation of Serbia. </seg>
<seg id=1543> In fact, the repeated use, two years in a row, of the flexibility instrument could be considered, wrongly in my opinion, to be a form of revision of the financial perspective. </seg>
<seg id=1544> We have heard from the Council today that it is prepared to improve the record by 3.5%. </seg>
<seg id=1545> I would particularly like to extend warm thanks to the Commission and the Council for this. </seg>
<seg id=1546> Mr President, I would also like to thank Mrs Haug for her excellent work. </seg>
<seg id=1547> I suspect that, to put it simply, flexibility is for small amounts and revision is for large amounts, but we will see in the next few years how that will go. </seg>
<seg id=1548> We are now at the point at which we must decide whether or not we can vote in favour of this budget next Thursday. </seg>
<seg id=1549> But the Interinstitutional Agreement between the three institutions is also a valuable item and should help us to achieve joint planning security. </seg>
<seg id=1550> The main sources of this pressure are unemployment, the BSE crisis and the Balkan stability pact. </seg>
<seg id=1551> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I am delighted to be with you here today to present an assessment of the French Presidency of the Union and also to consider the progress that has been made over the last few months. </seg>
<seg id=1552> As we promised, there are no leftovers from Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1553> This concerns the procedure for enhanced cooperation, which has, to a large extent, been made possible under the first and third pillars. </seg>
<seg id=1554> It is both a huge challenge and an historic milestone on the path towards the reunification of our continent. </seg>
<seg id=1555> As a result of this Charter, our Union will be stronger and have greater guarantees of the values of dignity, freedom and solidarity that are its cornerstones. </seg>
<seg id=1556> A few weeks ago, the chemicals tanker, the Ievolo Sun, sank just off the Channel Islands. </seg>
<seg id=1557> We set objectives for ourselves and they were achieved. </seg>
<seg id=1558> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I think that today I can say that in the last six months, our Union has gained strength from the process of preparing to welcome new members, to reunite the family now that we are all assured of being able to work together, to gain a firmer place in the hearts of our citizens in the fields of values, growth and employment, of solidarity, security and the preservation of the European social model and finally, to grow stronger and gain support on the international stage. </seg>
<seg id=1559> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=1560> This was inevitable given the approach taken, but the outcome was regrettable for two reasons: firstly because it made a qualified majority more difficult and a blocking minority accordingly easier, whereas logically, in an expanding Union, the exact opposite is required; </seg>
<seg id=1561> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=1562> (Applause) </seg>
<seg id=1563> The ambition which was taken to Nice was the greatest European ambition for a summit meeting now for many years. </seg>
<seg id=1564> Madam President, Mr President of the Republic, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my group takes a very dim view of the Fifteen following the rather unappetising spectacle they put on for the European people, who were probably amazed to see on that occasion, and at first hand, the real common vision, sense of solidarity and mutual trust that exists between the major European leaders. </seg>
<seg id=1565> Any clear-thinking person can see that they herald the very serious consequences to which the project of a Federal Europe of 27 or 28 Member States is leading us. </seg>
<seg id=1566> Mr President, I also wish to emphasise that, after Nice, France appears once again to have been the clear loser. </seg>
<seg id=1567> Madam President, Mr President, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities regrets the fact that the Presidency has not followed up the message that was sent to it in July. </seg>
<seg id=1568> Many still have no sight of the port into which the European Union is supposed to sail one day. </seg>
<seg id=1569> There are, therefore, also constraints that must be appreciated. </seg>
<seg id=1570> I think they reflect the views not just of these three groups but of other groups which have refrained from putting their name to them for technical reasons. </seg>
<seg id=1571> Promoting the development of medicines in the Community is desirable because that makes it possible to give patients a better chance of benefiting from high-performance treatment. </seg>
<seg id=1572> I congratulate my colleague Mary Honeyball on her first report for the European Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1573> Somewhat surprisingly, Mr Fatuzzo has the floor; I wonder which pensioner has said something to him this time. </seg>
<seg id=1574> The victim must be treated as a person in a particular situation of disorientation and distress - factors that are likely to be all the more acute if the crime happens to the victim in a Member State other than his/her own. </seg>
<seg id=1575> The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on: </seg>
<seg id=1576> It was heartbreaking to see the debates concentrating on who would get one vote more or one vote less, and who would gain - Germany or France, the Netherlands or Belgium, Portugal or Spain. </seg>
<seg id=1577> So we welcome the prospect of a new method and we trust that, with the hope offered by the possibility of enhanced cooperation, Europe will continue to advance and will be capable of drafting a constitution for tomorrow which restores our fellow citizens' confidence in this tremendous project that is the European adventure. </seg>
<seg id=1578> The States preparing for accession will copy the example of our own Member States' egoism. </seg>
<seg id=1579> Some are happier than others about this, but the main message is clear: Europe can now be unified in an enlarged democratic EU which is also close to the people, thanks to the Treaty of Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1580> Individual interests have prevailed. </seg>
<seg id=1581> We managed to avoid an open crisis which would have threatened enlargement by coming to a last minute agreement on the Treaty, but we are left with a latent crisis which will have to be dealt with. </seg>
<seg id=1582> In my opinion, it is not more realistic to fight for one's own national prestige than to fight for the efficient functioning of the Union, and I would not say that huge numbers of European citizens came out to follow the naval battle fought by their leaders at Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1583> And what a fine project, eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall! </seg>
<seg id=1584> At that time, this applied to half of Europe; now we must develop it for all of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1585> Thanks to Nice, the institutional barrier can no longer be invoked. </seg>
<seg id=1586> Firstly, institutional imbalance: a great deal for the Council and not much for the Commission and Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1587> This method has had it. </seg>
<seg id=1588> The consequences of that for Europe would have been totally incalculable. </seg>
<seg id=1589> For example, in the early days of the European Union, as you know, two so-called 'big' countries could achieve a blocking minority, and today it takes three. </seg>
<seg id=1590> The milestones are in place, enlargement is possible, the European Parliament will have its place in the debate and in going deeper into the routes and ideas. </seg>
<seg id=1591> The European public interest, of which none of us is sole guardian - Mr Moscovici is right about that - cannot be based on the addition of national interests which are growing and becoming neutralised and in that regard Prime Minister Verhofstadt had a salutary message for us all. </seg>
<seg id=1592> We recommended that they be ratified. </seg>
<seg id=1593> I personally believe that the re-weighting of votes must take account of population, as is done in the European Parliament and should have been done in the Council also. </seg>
<seg id=1594> But Nice, Mr President, is not the end of the road, but the starting point for a new phase with many challenges. </seg>
<seg id=1595> I should therefore like to come back to something which has been touched on a few times today already. </seg>
<seg id=1596> In fact, while we seem to have succeeded in avoiding total paralysis of the future enlarged European Union, it has not been possible to convert the ambitions of the French Presidency into a new draft of the Treaty. </seg>
<seg id=1597> Mr President, as far as I am concerned, the Nice Summit simply failed to make the grade. </seg>
<seg id=1598> I do not know whether the Commission will reply at the end of this debate but I wonder, in the absence of the Council, whether the Commission is equally confident that by 2004 this European Parliament will contain Czech, Hungarian and Polish Members of the European Parliament and Members from the Baltic States. </seg>
<seg id=1599> We have made no bones about the need to continue with the same force and the same determination as before Nice, to achieve our objectives along the road to enlargement, which will be our greatest historical moment and which it is the responsibility of Parliament and the Commission to bring about in the coming years. </seg>
<seg id=1600> In addition, and above all, the problem of financing for the Balkans will still be there in its entirety for the years ahead. </seg>
<seg id=1601> I, in my turn, would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the Council and the Presidency on the work that has been accomplished, and the conclusion of this agreement which will allow us to vote for the budget for the year 2001. </seg>
<seg id=1602> It is also good that, as the main source of employment, small and medium-sized enterprises have been allocated additional funds. </seg>
<seg id=1603> In football terms it is like a l-1 draw. </seg>
<seg id=1604> Just because we have a budget and we have agreed a deal at conciliation, let us not imagine that all our problems have disappeared. </seg>
<seg id=1605> We do not gain this importance out of nowhere, but from the Treaties, although sometimes the Council finds it hard to admit it. </seg>
<seg id=1606> This should go hand in hand with a commitment from the College of Commissioners to a fair and efficient distribution of human and material resources for the management of the various policies, that is, they must remember the political priority of Parliament and the management priority of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1607> Which is why safeguarding and regenerating the environment is a job which has to be done at European Community level. </seg>
<seg id=1608> There is much talk of post-Nice. </seg>
<seg id=1609> You are, of course, quite right to keep reverting to this question. </seg>
<seg id=1610> Fear of military violence or of a dictatorship that might advance further, is a thing of the past. </seg>
<seg id=1611> If you take a close look, then roughly speaking, Russia is slightly ahead of Morocco in terms of budgetary importance, which cannot be right to my mind. </seg>
<seg id=1612> It would be a very dangerous situation if the Europeans were to become logistically reliant on Russia. </seg>
<seg id=1613> And programmes such as TACIS can only be of limited help here - more to the point, they barely scratch the surface. </seg>
<seg id=1614> The birth rate is dropping, the mortality rate is going up, and the net loss in Russia' s population amounts to a million a year. </seg>
<seg id=1615> Mr Putin himself - and we would not even be going as far as him - said that the issue of the future status of Chechnya is not the main issue. </seg>
<seg id=1616> It makes no odds to the west what is happening with Russia, its people and society. </seg>
<seg id=1617> Mr President, in recent years the European Union has finalised various documents relating to the Russian Federation which form a good basis for close relations with it. </seg>
<seg id=1618> And indeed, what does freedom mean for the Chechen people? </seg>
<seg id=1619> That will be the first step, after which attempts will be made to achieve respect for the law, which will be the second step, and then, economic development will bring more stability, all of which will bring about the features of civil society we expect. </seg>
<seg id=1620> But it is an excellent report which, like the common strategy itself, underlines the importance that we attach to the relationship - the strategic partnership - between the European Union and Russia. </seg>
<seg id=1621> This means concentrating our efforts on key areas like the environment - which has been referred to by a number of Members - and nuclear safety, on Kaliningrad itself and on improving coordination between different sources of funding. </seg>
<seg id=1622> We must avoid the mistake to which an honourable gentleman referred earlier, which was made at the start of the last century, when Russia was effectively excluded from European affairs after the Leninist revolution in 1917 with disastrous consequences. </seg>
<seg id=1623> As you know, the Council adopted a common position on the revision of Directive 90/220/EC. </seg>
<seg id=1624> I therefore believe that this is where you will find an answer to your questions. </seg>
<seg id=1625> I am therefore perfectly willing to propose that such a debate be held, on condition that the most appropriate forum is chosen. </seg>
<seg id=1626> I do not have information exact enough to enable me to answer your supplementary question. </seg>
<seg id=1627> How can he say he does not have any precise information? </seg>
<seg id=1628> The Council would remind the honourable Member of the conclusions adopted at the Council meeting of 19 May 1998 regarding fraud in the alcohol and tobacco industries. </seg>
<seg id=1629> All the Member States have confirmed their determination to intensify the fight against fraud both internally and in their relations with others. </seg>
<seg id=1630> The European Union has, on many occasions, stated its absolute respect for the right of asylum. </seg>
<seg id=1631> In this respect, the ACP-EC partnership agreement signed in Cotonou in June 2000 stipulates that the European Community shall by 2005, at the latest, allow duty free access for essentially all products from all LDCs. </seg>
<seg id=1632> The Presidency is not here to express the opinions of any given individual or any given government but rather to state what the position of the Council is at any moment 'x' or time 't' . </seg>
<seg id=1633> A purchase and destruction system is to be set up for such non-tested bovine animals, in order to compensate livestock farmers at the market price. </seg>
<seg id=1634> The French Presidency has, from the very outset, been concerned to bring about a European response to this crisis, which is a crisis in terms of foodstuffs, society and health. </seg>
<seg id=1635> Under the Barcelona process, Algeria endorsed a number of principles including respect for the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id=1636> . (FR) I have already had the opportunity, a few weeks ago, to express my comments to you on the preparations for the UN General Assembly Special Session devoted to reviewing the results of the World Summit for Children which is to take place in September 2001. </seg>
<seg id=1637> Subject: Turkey's obligations under EU-Turkey partnership arrangements In its proposal regarding partnership arrangements between the EU and Turkey, the Commission indicates that the European Council is to re-examine the situation regarding unresolved differences, particularly with regard to their impact on accession procedures, so as to help ensure that they can be resolved within the International Court of Justice before the end of 2004 at the latest. </seg>
<seg id=1638> Does the Council intend to discuss this issue with the Turkish Government within the context of this partnership which you have referred to? </seg>
<seg id=1639> Are the rights of defence being adequately honoured and will mutual recognition do anything to help? </seg>
<seg id=1640> It is, furthermore, up to each Member State to take a sovereign decision at national level whether or not to commit their national forces to the operation. </seg>
<seg id=1641> Subject: Bearing of taxes on the operation of the internal market In an article in the Financial Times in November this year, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, affirmed that he does not want to see tax harmonisation and common tax levels in the EU by stating that tax rates 'are in the hands of the national parliaments and must remain so'. </seg>
<seg id=1642> Question Nos 23 to 32 will be answered in writing. </seg>
<seg id=1643> The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia has come along at just the right time. </seg>
<seg id=1644> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me congratulate Mr Baltas very warmly on his report, in particular for the fact that he drafted it so quickly, for it was both important and correct to react quickly to the changes in Croatia as Mr Stenzel said. </seg>
<seg id=1645> That means it really has made quite positive progress here. </seg>
<seg id=1646> In 1991/92 more than 250 000 Croats were expelled from Kraijina, from western and eastern Slavonia. </seg>
<seg id=1647> This has of course been a historic year for south-east Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1648> I do not think that is a bad record for a year. </seg>
<seg id=1649> This is an important point for us and we will, I hope, be able to count on Parliament's support when we come back to consult you formally once we have negotiated the agreement. </seg>
<seg id=1650> Here is a great deal of opposition to the Wahid government and the process appears to have come to a standstill. </seg>
<seg id=1651> There are still some Papuan leaders under lock and key too. </seg>
<seg id=1652> We also ask the European Commission to follow this policy line in our resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1653> Thus the terms of the Commission' s communication at the beginning of the year are justified, even if it is marked by a certain euphoria surely resulting from those changes. </seg>
<seg id=1654> The justice which is not being done and the refugee camps which are becoming permanent are areas for confrontation between the old and the new powers in Indonesia and reveal the fragility of the democratisation process. </seg>
<seg id=1655> What gives most cause for concern is the situation in the Moluccas, where Jihad fighters are left to their own devices in a manner which is insupportable. </seg>
<seg id=1656> Irian Jaya is also suffering the effects of migration policy. </seg>
<seg id=1657> To this end, we must learn to choose priorities: we cannot mix environmental issues, social policy issues or economic policy issues all at the same level as the key problem of respect for democracy and human rights, which clearly has to be a political priority in our relationship with Indonesia. </seg>
<seg id=1658> That resolution categorically affirms that Irian Jaya is part of Indonesia. </seg>
<seg id=1659> The situation has improved and we must encourage President Wahid, but there are still horrendous problems. </seg>
<seg id=1660> Clearly it is unacceptable that tens of thousands of East Timorese refugees are still held hostage at the mercy of armed bandits who, in the name of Indonesian patriotism, try to get away without punishment for their criminal past. </seg>
<seg id=1661> It matters because of its size - the world's fourth largest country in terms of population; it matters because of its economic scale; it matters because of its regional role; it matters because of its environmental impact. </seg>
<seg id=1662> That is why we must bring together police, administrative and criminal law resources and instruments, both between the Member States and with the EU. </seg>
<seg id=1663> (The President cut the speaker off) </seg>
<seg id=1664> Mrs Schreyer, you have repeatedly emphasised to this House that as the Commissioner responsible for fighting fraud you see it as your special task to guarantee OLAF's independence. </seg>
<seg id=1665> It is the very establishment of a form of economic administration at EU level that creates the problems, because those models for redistributing EU taxpayers' money which have been established by the so-called 'Community' are poorly designed and in many cases quite unwished for. </seg>
<seg id=1666> I would very much like to congratulate the rapporteur - someone I like and admire as a person and politician - on this report, but unfortunately I cannot. </seg>
<seg id=1667> The report deals with the protection of the Community's financial interests and how we deal with that and these are the major questions. </seg>
<seg id=1668> Since time is short I will present the individual points briefly. </seg>
<seg id=1669> The debate is closed. </seg>
<seg id=1670> We have EU laws to protect business from such mismanagement and the Commission has now promised to introduce its own regulations to ensure prompt payments. </seg>
<seg id=1671> We have other mechanisms to highlight previously undetected instances of fraud. </seg>
<seg id=1672> Mrs Schreyer, you have just mentioned the Council, saying that there was a Member State that opposed the creation of a European Prosecutor. </seg>
<seg id=1673> I therefore feel that Parliament would be well-advised to let the Court of Auditors know exactly what it expects from these reports. </seg>
<seg id=1674> Neither the Commission nor the Member States will be able to absolve themselves of responsibility, certainly not by passing the buck from one to the other. </seg>
<seg id=1675> He said that quite honestly and regretted that it was so. </seg>
<seg id=1676> You took a very useful and I believe also a very self-assured step in involving the Commission as also the Court of Auditors in your deliberations before drafting the report. </seg>
<seg id=1677> You can see from what I said that I think it would be useful to discuss these proposals further in order to find out how to assign responsibilities more clearly here. </seg>
<seg id=1678> The first crucial weakness is the lack of harmonisation. </seg>
<seg id=1679> That is why I believe we must also improve Article 4. </seg>
<seg id=1680> Within the single market investors, be they private, corporate or pension funds, should be able to exercise the rights of ownership to the benefit of the companies in which they invest and for those investors in them. </seg>
<seg id=1681> We cannot close our eyes to reality: when there is a takeover there is staff restructuring, redundancies and so on, in short, measures which affect jobs. </seg>
<seg id=1682> But what are we in danger of doing as a Parliament, by virtue of the amendments tabled? </seg>
<seg id=1683> That is the principle on which perhaps we will divide tomorrow: what should be the over-riding concern of a law regulating takeovers. </seg>
<seg id=1684> It would, however, be easier to solve the problem of which supervisory authority is to have jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id=1685> The rapporteur's amendments create confusion in the area of litigation and it would be wrong of us to vote for confusion in potential litigation cases. </seg>
<seg id=1686> A point I want to make with regard to this takeover directive is to bring the argument very firmly back to millions of electors in my country and millions of people who have pension plans and savings that are based upon investments in the stock market. </seg>
<seg id=1687> However, this procedure, which already exists in certain Member States, does not just affect the field of public takeover bids but extends much further and could, if necessary, be studied more closely as part of the general review of company law undertaken by the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1688> On a final note, may I remind you that this is a framework directive, as requested by Parliament at an earlier stage. </seg>
<seg id=1689> Right of resale is the unassignable and inalienable right of creative artists to receive a share of the profits made from the selling on of their works. </seg>
<seg id=1690> On the one side, UK lobbyists fear job losses. </seg>
<seg id=1691> The agreement reached by the Council is no longer an accurate reflection of the Commission' s initial proposal, which was widely supported by Parliament at its first reading. </seg>
<seg id=1692> I also hope for the Commission's support, at least on one of the three major points of dispute. </seg>
<seg id=1693> It is also an issue about the vitality and competitiveness of the European art market. </seg>
<seg id=1694> In another case, the item would undoubtedly have been sold elsewhere, i.e. in America. </seg>
<seg id=1695> However, this amendment can be only partially approved. </seg>
<seg id=1696> Competition between postal services </seg>
<seg id=1697> That is what I propose, Mr Savary. </seg>
<seg id=1698> Firstly, we must ensure that postal services are provided at affordable prices; secondly, we must ensure that the services are of a high quality, and, thirdly, we must ensure that we are able to guarantee the availability of at least a minimum range of postal services in all parts of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1699> The Committee on Legal Affairs has been even more demanding as regards price limits on services reserved for the universal provider, but it proposes the same 150-gramme weight limit and jointly rejects the 50 grammes laid down in the draft directive. </seg>
<seg id=1700> Finally, a new date for liberalisation is unacceptable until a prior assessment has been made. </seg>
<seg id=1701> You know how difficult this issue is; it is laden with ideological overtones, sometimes from both sides. </seg>
<seg id=1702> Therefore, whilst that may be welcomed in certain parts of this House, it would have had a devastating effect on postal services throughout the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1703> It will also lead to the closure of rural sub-post offices, because they rely on postal services for their very survival. </seg>
<seg id=1704> At this rate, we will need 100 years to bring about an open market for postal services in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1705> Madam President, I should like to make three remarks. </seg>
<seg id=1706> We should be clear on one specific matter when we are discussing this new directive. </seg>
<seg id=1707> This is and must not become the case. </seg>
<seg id=1708> In a climate of honest competition, monopolists can show what they are made of. </seg>
<seg id=1709> But when grandma is happy because she has a friendly postman, which is also a factor in the quality of postal services, we should not begrudge her that pleasure but be happy with her. </seg>
<seg id=1710> Anyone who is so ill-prepared to enter into negotiations, anyone who fails to present the requested report on the impact of the 1997 Directive, anyone who argues from an ideological platform - "We shall achieve these very aims you have identified by liberalising, liberalising and liberalising again" - need hardly wonder when he falls flat on his face! </seg>
<seg id=1711> Mr Bolkestein, the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties. </seg>
<seg id=1712> In other words, it is like calculating the average income of the richest and the poorest person, which of course gives a perfectly satisfactory figure per se but can hardly be deemed to be socially acceptable to the poorest person. </seg>
<seg id=1713> These are new times, Mr Simpson. </seg>
<seg id=1714> The governments which brought this about were not Socialist, but Conservative or Liberal. </seg>
<seg id=1715> It was evident to me when the proposal first appeared that it would never be acceptable in the shape in which the Commission presented it. </seg>
<seg id=1716> We all agree on the need for this opening up and liberalisation, but the pace is important. </seg>
<seg id=1717> The effects of the first directive have not been made public, for the consequences are obvious: job losses and poorer working conditions, public services of varying quality throughout Europe, especially in rural areas and working class districts. </seg>
<seg id=1718> The Commission proposal provides for gradual further opening and will, in my opinion, surely lead to better services for the consumer at a more competitive price. </seg>
<seg id=1719> That is essential for the development of the direct marketing industry. </seg>
<seg id=1720> I appeal directly to the British Conservatives. </seg>
<seg id=1721> Let me say this to An Post: if this happens, you will have been given a valuable breathing space. </seg>
<seg id=1722> All we can now do is hope that, one day, we shall be able to move on from the present stasis and give real impetus to the European project by overcoming the various forms of self-aggrandising corporatism. </seg>
<seg id=1723> Only 3% of the letter market has been liberalised. </seg>
<seg id=1724> It will be overtaken by technology and ignored by consumers who do not get service for their money. </seg>
<seg id=1725> Only the introduction of real competition in a controlled and progressive way, according to a fixed timetable, will assist them to do this. </seg>
<seg id=1726> Regarding Amendments Nos 60 and 61, I can agree with the principle of completing the internal market at a future date to be determined within a reasonable time frame. </seg>
<seg id=1727> The Commission will put forward the same opinion and therefore the Council will act on the Commission's proposal as it sees fit. </seg>
<seg id=1728> Now, however, Parliament is to deliver its opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1729> My second report therefore looks very much like the first and again takes up the amendments voted on in Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1730> Commissioner, it is true that we still have certain reservations and differences. </seg>
<seg id=1731> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dary, who has given us such a full explanation of the reform, its history and development - which I am not going to repeat. </seg>
<seg id=1732> It is a form of production which takes place in a range of special Community regions, the outermost regions, which suffer a range of difficulties in competing in the markets and one of whose few products is precisely this one - the banana. </seg>
<seg id=1733> It is actually an inhibition on chaos because it tries to institute rules which we all abide by. </seg>
<seg id=1734> It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the issues to which all the institutions have paid the closest attention. </seg>
<seg id=1735> We should continue to have no problem about giving these producers the means to live by purchasing what they produce as a priority. </seg>
<seg id=1736> Mr President, the rapporteur deserves thanks and some sympathy for handling this difficult report. </seg>
<seg id=1737> I would also like to thank the chairmen of the political groups in this Parliament who have accepted the stubbornness and obstinacy of the Members from the outermost regions so that this proposal for reform of the banana sector may be debated today in this House, and the mandatory opinion may be issued and can thereby arrive in time for the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which will take place in the coming days and we can therefore enter 2001 with a new reform of the COM in bananas. </seg>
<seg id=1738> A lot has been made in this debate of the apparent unanimity of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in supporting Mr Dary's report. </seg>
<seg id=1739> Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour to inform you of the presence in the gallery of a delegation from the Korean Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1740> This paved the way for a favourable decision on MEDIA by the Council. </seg>
<seg id=1741> Report (A5-0377/2000) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council extending certain programmes of Community action in the field of public health adopted by Decisions No 645/96/EC, No 646/96/EC, No 647/96/EC, No 102/97/EC, No 1400/97/EC and No 1296/1999/EC and amending those Decisions [COM(2000) 448 - C5-0400/2000 - 2000/0192(COD)] </seg>
<seg id=1742> Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to refer to the remarks made by the Commissioner at 0.15 this morning and to point out that Amendment No 1 imposes an obligation of the Commission. </seg>
<seg id=1743> (Parliament accepted the oral amendment) </seg>
<seg id=1744> Amendment No 2: </seg>
<seg id=1745> Parliament needs to reinstate and re-table most of the amendments on the size of the warning, the list of ingredients and the protection of consumers, especially the young. </seg>
<seg id=1746> Might there be two categories of people as far as a number of MEPs are concerned: those that are to be protected and those that are to be endangered for economic reasons? </seg>
<seg id=1747> I wish particularly to explain why I voted against the ban on export of tobacco products above a certain tar/nicotine level from the EU and supported amendments that sought to lift that ban. </seg>
<seg id=1748> Madam President, I would welcome the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health, like they do in Canada. </seg>
<seg id=1749> I consider all this to be positive although I would prefer - and I say so now on this occasion - much more to be spent on the prevention of diseases. </seg>
<seg id=1750> I would have preferred this piece of legislation to have been introduced by means of a regulation, which is more appropriate for any activity relating to citizens throughout the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1751> The amendments that Mr Zimmerling has tabled will deal a death blow to the vitality to the European art market, with loss of jobs and, I fear, very few living artists benefiting from this resale right. </seg>
<seg id=1752> . (NL) I would like to thank Mr Zimmerling for his work on this complicated dossier. </seg>
<seg id=1753> I therefore have no choice but to vote against this directive. </seg>
<seg id=1754> Moreover, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the CARDS programme and the European Investment Bank cannot constitute the main instruments for the European Union' s contribution to the economic and social development of Croatia. </seg>
<seg id=1755> The Indonesian government and the army have pledged to ensure the safety and to protect the lives of their citizens, irrespective of the religion they profess. </seg>
<seg id=1756> Consequently, we must establish the necessary instruments for more effective combating of fraud involving EU funds as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id=1757> It would establish the EU as a single legal area for the purpose of investigation, prosecution, trial and execution of sentences concerning this type of offence. </seg>
<seg id=1758> We seem sometimes to have lost sight of this fact. </seg>
<seg id=1759> Amendments Nos 11 and 13 propose that the quota scheme should not be re-examined until ten years have passed and that there should be no commitment now to the tariff system proposed by the Commission and demanded by several of our trading partners. </seg>
<seg id=1760> As for the recital referring to the ACP preference, we agree with EUR 300 per tonne here too, but we consider the word 'maximum' to be unnecessary. </seg>
<seg id=1761> Besides, there is probably very little chance of our trading partners accepting such an extension. </seg>
<seg id=1762> The next item is the Commission statement on the EU/US summit. </seg>
<seg id=1763> This is, I acknowledge, easier said than done, but we should try to resist the temptation - and I know that Secretary of State Albright shares this view - for these summits to get excessively entangled in the nitty-gritty of our daily political and economic relationships. </seg>
<seg id=1764> One of the main lessons was that the Europeans needed to shoulder more of the burden in promoting European security. </seg>
<seg id=1765> I should be grateful if you would deal in detail with these agreements in the communication which is scheduled for the spring of next year and if, besides the analysis requested by the other side of the House, you would also make proposals as to how we can achieve new aims in future in all domains - in the various dialogues, in our cooperation in the fields of foreign policy and security policy and even in practical everyday areas such as the mutual-recognition agreements. </seg>
<seg id=1766> I also know and welcome the Everything but Arms Initiative and would urge the Commission to use the occasion of the summit to press the US again to join in with this initiative. </seg>
<seg id=1767> It is therefore necessary to take action to prevent the irreversible fate that awaits those women and men who, like Mumia Abu-Jamal or Leonard Pelletier, have sometimes been on death row for years. </seg>
<seg id=1768> That is a useful idea and we will certainly follow it up. </seg>
<seg id=1769> Thank you very much, Commissioner. </seg>
<seg id=1770> I fear that I am currently trapped in my group' s own crossfire. </seg>
<seg id=1771> Thirdly, we must turn to simple formulae for recovering taxes and, specifically, the reversal of the taxable person. </seg>
<seg id=1772> The first conclusion is that little can be done until the international framework is modified. </seg>
<seg id=1773> Mr President, the first point the committee would like to make is that current arrangements disadvantage EU providers of these services: software, data processing, and computer services, web hosting, web design and information. </seg>
<seg id=1774> I was always told that one of the first rules or principles of a legislator should be: do not make law you cannot enforce. </seg>
<seg id=1775> I am thrilled by the fact that, partly thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a number of important elements are once again brought to the fore in the report. Due to events occurring at the time, these elements met with less than adequate support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. </seg>
<seg id=1776> At the same time, however, we must pursue the line of revising the Chicago Convention of 1944 so that we establish a different system in the international area. </seg>
<seg id=1777> By offering short-term location incentives, a government damages the economies of neighbouring Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1778> Mr President, Europe is to lead the world in the coming decade where use of the Internet is concerned. </seg>
<seg id=1779> Many are in fact asking themselves, Commissioner, why Europeans are always so quick to introduce taxes and new rules? </seg>
<seg id=1780> The Chicago Convention has become completely out-of-date on this point. </seg>
<seg id=1781> I do not see the introduction of a common system of VAT as a priority and I do not agree that the introduction of a common system is long overdue. </seg>
<seg id=1782> We must aim to streamline and simplify our tax systems and to reduce the rate of taxation, not increase it. </seg>
<seg id=1783> The preferable option by far is to zero rate European e-businesses to put them on the same playing-field as American and other businesses around the world. </seg>
<seg id=1784> Fiscal competition is in the interests of the people and of the economy. </seg>
<seg id=1785> Therefore, in order to ensure that operators from outside the Union are subject to the same tax obligations as domestic operators when providing services to consumers, they must be registered for VAT purposes in a Member State of their choice, with the VAT rate of the State they choose being the one that applies to their operations. </seg>
<seg id=1786> But the situation is not quite as straightforward as that. </seg>
<seg id=1787> The source where the tax should apply is a matter of concern, and the discussion around the number of countries which would qualify to have companies registered in them is something which I believe will be burdensome and of course provoke the USA to a complaint in the WTO. </seg>
<seg id=1788> It makes no sense at all that I can travel from London to Brussels return for just £89 by Virgin Airways, for example, yet when I use Eurostar, which produces far fewer greenhouse gases and is a much more pleasant way to travel, I have to pay the equivalent of around £250 for a similar journey. </seg>
<seg id=1789> Mr President, some old shibboleths have resurfaced in this debate. </seg>
<seg id=1790> Finally, the French Presidency' s proposals were discussed, according to which tax should be levied at the point of consumption, with a requirement for service providers to be registered in all the Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1791> European aircraft carriers would be disadvantaged compared to carriers from third countries and it would distort intra-EU as opposed to intercontinental fare structures. </seg>
<seg id=1792> It seems to me, however, that a solution which will avoid a flight of capital from Europe is only achievable within the OECD framework and not through a collection of individually negotiated bilateral arrangements. </seg>
<seg id=1793> I am aware that some Members have been swamped with opposing views. </seg>
<seg id=1794> This rules out the complexities which would emerge if macroeconomic or similar criteria were to be applied. </seg>
<seg id=1795> Allow me now to turn to the proposal on the minimum level of the normal rate. </seg>
<seg id=1796> Accordingly, no major groundwork has been done within the ICAO working parties and it is unlikely that the Chicago Convention will be re-negotiated at the forthcoming general meeting. </seg>
<seg id=1797> This feeling unfortunately still persists to this day in the mood of European public opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1798> And the final objective of this directive is to strengthen the management of emergency situations at sea, through the obligation to designate ports of refuge, the prohibition on taking to sea during high storms and greater powers of intervention at sea on the part of the coastal State in the event of a serious risk of pollution. </seg>
<seg id=1799> The oil companies tell us they have a voluntary fund. </seg>
<seg id=1800> I hope that after the impetus provided in Nice, the doubts and resistance of certain countries will have been reduced and that we achieve this. </seg>
<seg id=1801> We obviously have confidence in her ability to ensure maritime safety because she must know that not a week passes without our being asked what, as Members of the European Parliament, we are doing to ensure safety and to change the rules. </seg>
<seg id=1802> Mr President, the Commission is aware that one of the plans announced by the UK Government on 8 November 2000 was the introduction of some form of road-user charge such as a vignette payable by all road hauliers, British and non-British alike, for their use of the road network in the UK. </seg>
<seg id=1803> Secondly: If, as the minister originally intended, he proposes to put a tax on foreign lorries to subsidise hauliers of his own nationality, is that contrary to European law? </seg>
<seg id=1804> This imbalance of an economic nature between the charges and taxes imposed on hauliers in different Member States distorts the conditions under which hauliers of different nationalities compete in the UK. </seg>
<seg id=1805> On the question of the use of meat-and-bone meal: their export is covered in exactly the same way by the legislation that governs the production of meat-and-bone meal within the European Union, and also with the requirement for the removal, for instance, of specified risk material from meat-and-bone meal is covered in legislation and will be in operation from 1 March 2001. </seg>
<seg id=1806> The Jews are traitors and infidels. </seg>
<seg id=1807> I very much hope that in every country in the region we will find that educational services promote tolerance rather than intolerance. </seg>
<seg id=1808> That is not an unexpected answer from Mr Monti. </seg>
<seg id=1809> Question No 37 by (H-0900/00) </seg>
<seg id=1810> In addition, the Commission will, at the same time, propose a defensive temporary support mechanism, specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices for a period necessary for the conclusion of the WTO procedure. </seg>
<seg id=1811> This is a dramatic issue. </seg>
<seg id=1812> Coke-using industry employs a total of 70 000 people, but this product represents only a very marginal portion of its costs, in the region of 2%. </seg>
<seg id=1813> Question No 40 by (H-0889/00) </seg>
<seg id=1814> We forwarded our proposal to the ACP countries at practically the same time as to our Member States. </seg>
<seg id=1815> I should like, moreover, to reassure you that this initiative is not designed to solve that problem, given that the additional amounts which might be imported into the Community market are so small. </seg>
<seg id=1816> In view of their situation, these countries unfortunately have no capacity for autonomous negotiation, and it is therefore a gesture which we ought, in my opinion, to make unilaterally, without anything in return. </seg>
<seg id=1817> The Commission's procedure for granting the desired financial support will soon be complete, and this also includes the funds which ECPAT requires for 2001. </seg>
<seg id=1818> We have three types of activities in this area. </seg>
<seg id=1819> The issue of the geographical location of the new tribunal is not discussed in the Commission proposal. </seg>
<seg id=1820> I am not sure what the honourable Member means by the word 'proliferation' . </seg>
<seg id=1821> Mr Berenguer Fuster' s question relates to trade marks. </seg>
<seg id=1822> I take it as a stimulus to renew our action and to see to it that Spain does what it ought to do just as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id=1823> You replied in answer to my previous question that Spain was to blame and that you would do what you had to do, but here it is you who are to blame. </seg>
<seg id=1824> It was a fine clarification of the reply I received earlier. </seg>
<seg id=1825> Directive 89/48/EEC pertains to higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration. </seg>
<seg id=1826> Subject: Transport links across the straits between Vaasa, Finland and Umeå, Sweden Shipping in the narrows of the Gulf of Bothnia is to be discontinued, since it is unprofitable now that shipping firms have no opportunities for tax-free sales. </seg>
<seg id=1827> For example, in Vaasa, the city I mentioned, 550 jobs have been lost in the last two years in the travel and tourism industry alone, which may have been the result of stopping duty-free sales. </seg>
<seg id=1828> This proposal reflects the goal of the Lisbon Summit by aiming to stimulate the development and the use of digital content. </seg>
<seg id=1829> Furthermore, I call on the Commission to conceive more efficient and faster implementation procedures in the field of calling in proposals. </seg>
<seg id=1830> If we include only content useful to businesses, particularly meteorological and geographical content (as is extremely desirable), it must not of course be forgotten that, where content intended for citizens is concerned, it is a much more complicated matter than of simply taking information useful to businesses. </seg>
<seg id=1831> Digital content, which is more quantity than quality, standardises and prunes cultural and social diversity. </seg>
<seg id=1832> The second point, which seems just as crucial to me, is that we must think about small and medium-sized enterprises, about business start-ups. </seg>
<seg id=1833> But if we make a virtue out of necessity and change the minuses into plus signs, if we consider our languages as bridges rather than obstacles, if we recognise and exploit the benefits they offer, they can form the foundations of a European market and lend us a certain independence. </seg>
<seg id=1834> I shall not go back and discuss all the objectives of this programme which consist in creating conditions favourable to the sale, distribution and use of digital content in such a way as to encourage economic activity, broaden the scope of employment and encourage exploitation of the potential of European digital content over and against that of digital content from the United States. </seg>
<seg id=1835> Thus having the right conditions in place for European multilingual digital content production is becoming increasingly important. </seg>
<seg id=1836> Some of them are indeed very valuable in themselves but are better placed in other instruments than in the present decision. </seg>
<seg id=1837> The different positions can be articulated, the vote has not been scheduled for this evening, and if the largest group in Parliament is of the opinion that the vote should not take place tomorrow, it seems more appropriate to me to submit such a proposal tomorrow when we have a full House rather than doing it this evening. </seg>
<seg id=1838> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, noise is disturbing an increasing number of people in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1839> It is left to the discretion of the Member States to determine when evening and the subsequent night fall. </seg>
<seg id=1840> I therefore welcome the Commission proposal, although I consider it to be an initial and - in my opinion - cautious step. </seg>
<seg id=1841> That is why the reduction and prevention of ambient noise will feature prominently in future European environment policies. </seg>
<seg id=1842> The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is happy to support him in this, although we would have preferred to take things one step further in our efforts to find appropriate solutions and tackle those making money on the back of pollution. </seg>
<seg id=1843> But allow me to say a few words on the bickering and the battle which has taken place recently behind the scenes, in and around, above and below, the committee, and which we witnessed in this Chamber a moment ago. </seg>
<seg id=1844> I will therefore not hide the fact that it will be very difficult for my country to accept the Commission' s proposal, unless it incorporates a sufficient mechanism for flexibility so that we can maintain the way of life that we inherited from our ancestors and, furthermore, which is so valued both by the Spanish themselves and by our foreign visitors. </seg>
<seg id=1845> I would nevertheless commend the report and of course the Commission's proposal to the House. </seg>
<seg id=1846> Secondly, we need daughter directives which establish quality standards. </seg>
<seg id=1847> I would fully support the need to harmonise noise indicators and assessment methods; the whole area of noise maps; the drawing up of action plans to reduce noise and protect quiet areas as appropriate and to broaden the whole scope for information to the public. </seg>
<seg id=1848> Secondly, this proposal uses a new approach to assess the overall noise situation in Europe in terms of numbers of people who are disturbed by noise. </seg>
<seg id=1849> The following amendments are acceptable in principle or in part: Amendments Nos 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 21, 22, 25, 28, 29, 32, 39, 42, 44 and 45. </seg>
<seg id=1850> Moreover, additives cannot, in general, be used, as in the present case, for unprocessed foodstuffs which have not undergone treatment involving a significant change to their original state. </seg>
<seg id=1851> Mr President, the PPE-DE Group voted in favour of the Lannoye report within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and it is, in fact, completely compatible with our wishes. </seg>
<seg id=1852> Nobody says that. </seg>
<seg id=1853> The next item is the debate on the report (A5-372/2000) by Mr Staes, on behalf of the Delegation of the European Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition. </seg>
<seg id=1854> As a result, I received from the French Presidency a very clear signal, a very clear message indeed, which was 'no pasarán' (they will not get through). </seg>
<seg id=1855> Now, after lengthy negotiations in the Conciliation Committee, an acceptable compromise has been worked out, involving a guarantee that safeguard measures taken by the Commission will remain in force until they are replaced by another act and an obligation on the Member States to provide full assistance to the Commission officials carrying out on-the-spot inspections. </seg>
<seg id=1856> I welcome this legislation. </seg>
<seg id=1857> EU structural funds, mainly through the ESF, as well as national exchequer finances, must always be focused on developing disadvantaged and poorer areas in our society. </seg>
<seg id=1858> Europe' s cities and towns are important economic, political and socio-cultural centres. </seg>
<seg id=1859> Clear legislation and careful control of this are yet other tools. </seg>
<seg id=1860> The Commission is also grateful for the substantial support which the European Parliament has provided for this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been put forward. </seg>
<seg id=1861> Given the nature of the activity, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 10 and 23. </seg>
<seg id=1862> I say 'celebrated' because it is a very fashionable subject, and you will no doubt agree with me that not a day passes without the press, at the drop of a hat, running a headline on the precautionary principle, either advisedly or ill-advisedly, but misleadingly, more often than not. </seg>
<seg id=1863> The maximalists attempt to block innovation and progress, while the minimalists advise having recourse to the precautionary principle only in the case of significant environmental and health risks, that is to say above a certain threshold, although it is not really clear how to define this. </seg>
<seg id=1864> Clarifying who should do what is an essential prerequisite for restoring the necessary public confidence in both the scientific community and public decision-makers - us politicians. </seg>
<seg id=1865> In those situations, a safety margin is imposed as a precautionary measure. </seg>
<seg id=1866> We also called for measures in the World Trade Organisation, perhaps a regulation, which would ensure that it is possible, in the context of the WTO, to invoke other obligations, such as those we have under multilateral environmental agreements, to extend the scope of the precautionary principle. </seg>
<seg id=1867> It is of course also important to increase the legal weight with the aim of making the precautionary principle an international standard. </seg>
<seg id=1868> Life is about being able to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a sensible manner. </seg>
<seg id=1869> Sometimes it overuses it, cheapening it, and at other times it uses it too little and provokes our indignation. </seg>
<seg id=1870> We have the example of phthalates in children's toys and we also have this strange idea of putting toys inside sweets, ice cream and other edible products. </seg>
<seg id=1871> The same applies to the Commission' s requirement of a thorough risk analysis beforehand. </seg>
<seg id=1872> The resolution calls on the Commission to use the guidelines adopted and to incorporate the precautionary principle whenever necessary in drawing up its legislative proposals and in all its actions. </seg>
<seg id=1873> It is not possible to provide a general de minimis threshold. </seg>
<seg id=1874> In awarding the Sakharov prize for the first time to those who are actively defending human rights within the European Union, the European Parliament is stating formally that any violation of these rights must be fought uncompromisingly. </seg>
<seg id=1875> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the 'Basta Ya' citizens' initiative wishes to express its gratitude to this Parliament for the honourable recognition it is receiving today. </seg>
<seg id=1876> We are not only talking about murders. </seg>
<seg id=1877> I therefore ask for your support and trust on this point. </seg>
<seg id=1878> (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) </seg>
<seg id=1879> Madam President, if the House permits, I should like to give an oral explanation of my Amendment No 51. </seg>
<seg id=1880> Report (A5-0334/2000) by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on the taxation of aircraft fuel (COM(2000) 110 - C5-0207/2000 - 2000/2114(COS)) </seg>
<seg id=1881> This agreement is attractive to a number of companies but detrimental to the environment and democracy. </seg>
<seg id=1882> The most significant event to have occurred since our previous budgetary debates is, of course, the "mad cow" crisis. </seg>
<seg id=1883> This would clearly violate the letter and spirit of the aforementioned decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government regarding the seat of Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1884> Parliament has succeeded in driving through a number of important prioritisations - including increased efforts in the struggle against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and equality issues, etc. We have voted against the right' s attacks on the LIFE programme and the European Women' s Lobby. </seg>
<seg id=1885> The size of the allocation that has been earmarked for Kosovo does not mean that there are not legitimate questions as to the real capacity of this region of Yugoslavia to absorb the EUR 350 million that were initially earmarked to be given to it in 2001. </seg>
<seg id=1886> There is no reason to give tax advantages to a particular form of distribution. </seg>
<seg id=1887> An end date would send a clear message to the players in the postal market and provide better opportunity for the national monopolies to prepare for deregulation. </seg>
<seg id=1888> Can we erase, with a simple decision, with a potentially small majority, the entire concept of the postal service, a concept whose roots and forms are bound up with the specific nature of each Member State? </seg>
<seg id=1889> The limits of 50 grams and two and a half times the public tariff are truly too drastic and would have had dire consequences for the providers of universal postal services. </seg>
<seg id=1890> Hence our unequivocal and steadfast opposition to the majority of its aims. </seg>
<seg id=1891> We do not consider that the postal service is an issue to be dealt with by the EU, even if the proposal following processing by the committee looks considerably better than the Commission' s original proposal. </seg>
<seg id=1892> Dary report (A5-0374/2000) </seg>
<seg id=1893> We nevertheless feel that the small producers who work their own plantations without exploiting anyone need to be protected from the consequences of this war, as do their incomes, whatever fluctuations may occur in the market. </seg>
<seg id=1894> Pursuant to Article 10, freedom of expression goes hand in hand with duties and responsibilities which can result in conditions, restrictions and sanctions. </seg>
<seg id=1895> We can only be delighted at such an initiative knowing as we do that the value of European digital content represents 5% of the European GDP and provides four million jobs. </seg>
<seg id=1896> In these circumstances, it is in large part the coherence and the unity of the United States that have guaranteed that country its pre-eminent position in this market of the future. </seg>
<seg id=1897> I also hope that the EU' s share of competences is reduced in 2004, applying the principle of subsidiarity so that the regions and autonomous communities may have adequate status within the Union. </seg>
<seg id=1898> We can only welcome such a move. </seg>
<seg id=1899> With regard to the trade negotiations mentioned earlier, for example, national parliaments will lose their last rights of ratification, and if a country is in a minority in the Council, it will no longer be able to say 'no' if negotiations threaten its interests. </seg>
<seg id=1900> We warned against this on repeated occasions and the events in Nice show with all the clarity one could ask for that a substantially broader agenda could have resulted in no result whatsoever being achieved this year, with catastrophic consequences for enlargement. </seg>
<seg id=1901> Given the fundamental importance of the decisions to be taken at the Nice Summit, credit must be given where credit is due. </seg>
<seg id=1902> In other words, what Parliament wants is control over taxation and social security issues. </seg>
<seg id=1903> These Council decisions, cobbled together in late-night sessions, do not constitute solid foundations; they are riddled with holes large enough for concepts such as transparency, the creation of a European identity, more democracy, popular participation and reformism to slip right through. </seg>
<seg id=1904> We must therefore see its conclusions as the result of a compromise in which nobody was entirely the winner or entirely the loser. </seg>
<seg id=1905> On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power. </seg>
<seg id=1906> You must therefore vote for this measure which further reduces taxation on aircraft, for this will bring the price of aeroplane tickets down and we will be able to travel much more frequently by plane. </seg>
<seg id=1907> 'Don't walk near blocks of flats or something might fall on your head!' </seg>
<seg id=1908> The complexity and diversity of technological change and the structural adjustment processes demand the involvement of all relevant players at the local and regional levels in development partnerships, rooted in strategic policy blueprints that must be drawn up for the development of each region. </seg>
<seg id=1909> We must therefore strive to avoid anything which would stifle or detract from these important three prerequisites. </seg>
<seg id=1910> It could be said that innovation is within reach of all the operators involved in the production process. </seg>
<seg id=1911> The fact is that the technological gap between prosperous and backward regions is considerably greater than the difference between their respective Gross Domestic Products. </seg>
<seg id=1912> As we all know, any bureaucrat's basic argument is the risk of error. </seg>
<seg id=1913> I do not know whether it is a direct consequence of this Risi initiative that three ladies signed the European budget today, but I should be delighted if this Christmas present on which we are deciding today could also continue to benefit women in the future. </seg>
<seg id=1914> It is also a mistake to reduce the budget in a chapter such as this which was being dedicated to pilot experiments, to new ideas in the field of local and urban development - with some more than satisfactory results - which have formed the basis of Community programmes as cherished at local level as URBAN and INTERREG. </seg>
<seg id=1915> As Mr Rack quite rightly said, I have never construed this regional policy and this cohesion policy as some sort of alms to the poorest regions and I never shall. </seg>
<seg id=1916> That is why, when I am involved in negotiations - as I am currently with regard to SPDs - I take great care to check, over and above the innovative measures - and I refer here to the mainstream - that each programming document includes a regional information society access plan, and I check the quality, over and above the scope of the regional programme, especially as relates directly to SMEs, education institutes and even farm holdings. </seg>
<seg id=1917> Mrs Schroedter, Mr Izquierdo Collado and Mr Ortuondo Larrea quite rightly raised the issue of financial packages. </seg>
<seg id=1918> The prices of new ships have plummeted in recent years, reaching an all-time low in 1999 because of this policy that South Korea is pursuing. </seg>
<seg id=1919> The committee had to vote especially to ensure that this item was on the agenda for debate today. </seg>
<seg id=1920> This approach is also in line with the Treaty, although I do not have time to go into this in greater detail. </seg>
<seg id=1921> However, the Commission' s proposal, which includes aid for research and development, the condemnation of what is happening in Korea to the World Trade Organisation - since they are working with prices which are even below cost - and the possibility that there be transitional aid measures until the case is settled, seems to us to be perhaps a rather weak solution, but at least it is a solution. </seg>
<seg id=1922> At the same time, pressure on Korea must be stepped up, and we must involve the OECD if necessary, by taking anti-dumping measures. </seg>
<seg id=1923> That is, while we are enduring unemployment, the Koreans are doing good business in their shipyards. </seg>
<seg id=1924> I feel that he has produced an excellent X-ray of the shipbuilding industry in Europe, a true X-ray. </seg>
<seg id=1925> This process will not give quick results and if it goes to its ultimate conclusion, it will take up to two years. </seg>
<seg id=1926> The mechanisms would apply until the outcome of that WTO procedure is decided. </seg>
<seg id=1927> I am sure that we are all now united in our vigorous and forthright defence of freedom in Europe, but I wish to say that, more than the solidarity of the Members of the European Parliament, we in Spain need their commitment. </seg>
<seg id=1928> While sailing through Sicilian waters, back in the month of May, its nuclear heart showed worrying signs of deterioration. </seg>
<seg id=1929> It would be alarming if we failed to act immediately in this situation. </seg>
<seg id=1930> In both, we express the need for the two Member States involved, the United Kingdom and Spain, to work together closely to find a safer solution for the repair of the submarine, while keeping the public fully up-to-date, of course. </seg>
<seg id=1931> We have had statements from the responsible parties in the British army to the effect that the fault was not significant, and others saying the complete opposite, that it was serious and required long and difficult repairs. </seg>
<seg id=1932> I know the House recognises that she would have been here if possible and it falls to me to answer in her stead. </seg>
<seg id=1933> The Commission is analysing this plan. </seg>
<seg id=1934> It is already happening, so let us be realistic about what options face the UK and Gibraltar authorities in dealing with it. </seg>
<seg id=1935> Calm cooperation is the method which our Union uses. </seg>
<seg id=1936> The British Government is acting just as the Russian Government did recently when one of its submarines was damaged. </seg>
<seg id=1937> Mr President, I too would like to extend my deepest sympathy to our Spanish colleagues in the face of the latest terrorist murder by ETA. </seg>
<seg id=1938> The Commission, in its clear response two months ago and in its reply today, has been responsible enough to recognise this, although it has not been recognised in the Group of the European People' s Party' s motion for a resolution, a fact which, together with other trivialisations of the affair, has prevented us from supporting it. </seg>
<seg id=1939> Chief Minister Peter Caruana has wisely asked a panel of experts to report directly to him. </seg>
<seg id=1940> This has been and, in our view, remains, the most coherent position and the one which safeguards the interests and safety of all the parties involved. </seg>
<seg id=1941> B5-0908/2000 by Maij-Weggen and Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group; </seg>
<seg id=1942> In 1980, the UNHCR looked after five million refugees. </seg>
<seg id=1943> We are paying our respects today to the UNHCR and to all humanitarian workers. </seg>
<seg id=1944> Mr President, the Commission of course wants to associate itself with the support given by Parliament to the UNHCR for its 50th anniversary. </seg>
<seg id=1945> I want to refer to a broader issue that is very relevant to what the honourable Member said earlier. </seg>
<seg id=1946> B5-0909/2000 by Pack and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group; </seg>
<seg id=1947> And the last problem to which I wish to refer relates to the dreadful occurrences at the border between Serbia and Kosovo. </seg>
<seg id=1948> It is there that Milosevic belongs and not at party conferences in Belgrade. </seg>
<seg id=1949> We believe that within Kosovo too, the mentality of ethnic groups which are still fighting each other should make way for mutual respect. </seg>
<seg id=1950> Without blowing our own trumpet, we can also say that the European Union has responded very rapidly to the new situation. </seg>
<seg id=1951> B5-0915/2000 by Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the PSE Group; </seg>
<seg id=1952> B5-0918/2000 by Napoletano and others, on behalf of the PSE Group; </seg>
<seg id=1953> The Chilean Government guaranteed that in Chile General Pinochet would have a fair trial and General Pinochet has indeed now lost his immunity and the Chilean judicial authorities are initiating proceedings against him. </seg>
<seg id=1954> And allow me to point out that it is important that we approve this joint resolution, now that Pinochet is in Chile, something that we were not able to do when Pinochet was in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id=1955> I say that in the knowledge that these are foundational beliefs for the parties of the European Free Alliance and for the Greens in this House. </seg>
<seg id=1956> Mr President, before beginning my speech I would also like to join in condemning the attack that cost the life of someone elected by the people, and of an activist and councillor of the Partido Popular in Catalonia in Spain. </seg>
<seg id=1957> That is why I welcome the fact that my political group and, I think, the majority here in the House, will not be tempted to bang a drum in order to milk the current crisis for all it is worth. </seg>
<seg id=1958> Their very life is in danger. </seg>
<seg id=1959> The human rights league has been suspended, its premises placed under seal and its president, Moktar Trifi, has been summoned to appear in court, as you have just heard, on 25 December. </seg>
<seg id=1960> Human rights activists, trade union members, academics, journalists and students report constant harassment by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id=1961> His condition is very, very serious. </seg>
<seg id=1962> Daily harassment and beatings of democrats are a standard occurrence. </seg>
<seg id=1963> I hope that in this case the Chilean justice system will continue to demonstrate independence and effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id=1964> We understand that the European Union heads of mission have been following the political situation in the country closely. </seg>
<seg id=1965> Lastly, I would like to mention the crucial role played by Parliament, which has contributed to raising awareness and intensifying dialogue in these issues through parliamentary visits and through public debates like this one. </seg>
<seg id=1966> Laurent Gbagbo needs to introduce a real policy of national reconciliation by ending the discussion on Ivorian identity, revising the racist constitution and holding democratic elections open to all candidates; otherwise the risk of secession and civil war can only grow. </seg>
<seg id=1967> Mr President, for months the news from Côte d' Ivoire has been causing justified alarm within European public opinion and the corresponding concern in our Parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1968> The conditions for this are: that no one should feel excluded, that the Supreme Court established by the military powers should disappear, and that the Head of State should be unequivocally involved in the process of restoring democracy and that the opinions of the Committee for national reconciliation should be heard. </seg>
<seg id=1969> The concept of Ivorian nationality would appear to me to be perfectly well founded. </seg>
<seg id=1970> Some half-a-dozen copies are now available from the President. </seg>
<seg id=1971> Mr President, on behalf of the Greens, we also withdraw our motion for a resolution. </seg>
<seg id=1972> Mr President, I can confirm what Mr Posselt has just said. </seg>
<seg id=1973> (The Minutes were approved) </seg>
<seg id=1974> The Member States must implement different policies to support these people, tackling both the issue of the care necessary and the issue of the reimbursement of expenses, especially for those invalids whose families are, in effect, unable to bear the whole of such a burden in the long term. </seg>
<seg id=1975> Mr President, I am very pleased to speak on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report. </seg>
<seg id=1976> Nowadays, an increasing number of people live longer thanks to better health care, provision of information, care, housing and pension schemes. </seg>
<seg id=1977> It is mainly the Member States' governments at federal, provincial and local level which can put many of these recommendations to good use. </seg>
<seg id=1978> The basis for this outlook on life is the family, in which each human being grows up. </seg>
<seg id=1979> It is a common occurrence, in the latter years of life, for a worker to become very seriously ill, often a total invalid, needing assistance from everybody. </seg>
<seg id=1980> I should like to close with a word on medical care. </seg>
<seg id=1981> Then, people also said that women must not work so that the men could. </seg>
<seg id=1982> That may appear to be a handicap as far as many people are concerned, in the first analysis. </seg>
<seg id=1983> We really will have to find the ways and means to achieve this. </seg>
<seg id=1984> The countless active elderly people should motivate us all to fight for a society in which the phrase intergenerational solidarity is not just empty words! </seg>
<seg id=1985> These measures will have to be appropriate to the different specific circumstances of elderly people in terms of standards of living and financial self-sufficiency. </seg>
<seg id=1986> Only a sustained and joint effort can help us to meet them. </seg>
<seg id=1987> There must be discretionary powers for individual preferences and decisions. </seg>
<seg id=1988> If anyone finds any of these missing objects, would they please return them to Mr Fatuzzo, especially his glasses, because, Mr Fatuzzo, Mrs Flemming was sitting behind you. </seg>
<seg id=1989> Finally, a reference to the possibility of actions to promote products of the most remote regions and their logo should be explicitly reinserted into the text. </seg>
<seg id=1990> Another aspect to be highlighted is the animal-friendly and environmentally-friendly production methods used in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1991> That is why I am also pleased that, this week in the European Parliament, we have set up a working group on biotechnology. </seg>
<seg id=1992> Of course, such institutional information campaigns must rather complement the advertising activities undertaken in particular by major distributors. </seg>
<seg id=1993> If Parliament's proposals to allow legumes and clover to be grown on set-aside land and be used for animal feed had been implemented - they have been passed by a majority three times here, but that shows yet again how powerless Parliament is - then we would have had more basic rations and more protein feed. </seg>
<seg id=1994> This is properly a matter for producers, retailers and trade associations, not the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1995> We have to ask ourselves why we failed in the past to get industry in the European Union to take up the money that was available. </seg>
<seg id=1996> Of course, if we can produce and promote food that is better for the environment and takes animal welfare into consideration, and sell that on world markets, then we will be really fulfilling the vocation for which the common agricultural policy was intended. </seg>
<seg id=1997> All we can say to Amendments Nos 9 and 22, which call for a special management committee to be set up, and Amendments Nos 7, 19, 23 and 27, where further procedural changes are sought, is that the Commission has to be consistent with its procedural provisions. </seg>
<seg id=1998> All those who say that you can still tuck in in style in Europe are right. </seg>
<seg id=1999> Mr President, there is scientific proof that moderate consumption of wine is one of the best ways of preventing cancer, strokes, Alzheimer's disease and many other illnesses. </seg>
<seg id=2000> I would like to commend the rapporteur on his work. </seg>
