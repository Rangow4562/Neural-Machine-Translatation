Taming Politicians on Both Sides of the Atlantic
Despite occasional grumbles from politicians, no one seriously doubts the European Central Bank's independence, or that monetary policy within the euro zone is therefore well insulated from political pressures.
But the recent death of the Stability and Growth Pact-killed off by Germany, its father, with France acting as co-conspirator and willing accomplice-reminds us of a key lesson: elected politicians find it hard, if not impossible, to relinquish substantial power in the area of fiscal policy.
The same is true across the Atlantic.
The US Federal Reserve Board is, of course, very independent.
But any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of America's Federal government in the manner of the Stability Pact-for example, the infamous Gramm/Rudman rules of the Clinton era-always collapse in the end in the face of presidential and congressional pressure.
Monetary policy can be used to stimulate an economy just as much as fiscal policy, if not more, in election years, which politicians will always want to do.
But reckless use of either mechanism for short-term goals may create long-term costs, justifying some restrictions on politicians' latitude in influencing macroeconomic policies.
When politicians can control inflation by exercising decisive sway over central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, avoiding the need for more taxation to pay it off.
This was the great lesson of the 1970's and early 1980's, when rampant inflation forced politicians to surrender this power to independent central banks, which alone could convince markets that price stability would be restored.
Yet monetary policy is not a unique species of economic policymaking.
Aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians in line.
Why not, for example, entrust an independent bureaucracy with some redistributive goals or control over the level of public investment or deficit management?
An independent fiscal authority could arguably implement a society's long-term goals in these areas better than politicians, who have their eyes on the next election.
Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is not clear why monetary policy and fiscal policy should be treated so differently, with one completely delegated to a bureaucratic agency and the other completely discretionary and in the hand of politicians.
So why do we see this large difference in reality in both America and Europe?
The answer is that fiscal policy is the key tool politicians use to attract and maintain the support of a winning coalition of voters, say retirees, public employees, and middle-class homeowners, while imposing the costs on the losers.
It is not necessary to please 100% of the voters, only enough to win.
The fiscal card is critical in choosing which groups of voters to buy.
Independent fiscal authorities-or fiscal rules such as the Stability Pact-stand in the way of this political use of fiscal policy, which is costly.
After all, if politicians could not win elections by taking money from some-including future generations, which will have to foot a portion of the bill-and giving it to others, they would have to work much harder to display some ability in producing public benefits for all.
This is far more difficult!
Of course, monetary policy also has redistributive effects.
Think about the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors.
However, monetary policy is a much more awkward, indirect and imprecise way of choosing winners and losers than fiscal policy.
Independent central banks can occasionally be a pain for politicians, but at least they can be used as scapegoats when necessary-a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of losing control over a useful tool.
These considerations should guide the choice of what will follow the Stability Pact in Europe.
It is now abundantly clear that national governments (especially those of large countries) will never accept substantial limitations on their fiscal discretion.
They may have suspended their freedom of fiscal maneuver long enough to launch the euro, but in normal times, national governments will reclaim their fiscal turf.
So the European Commission should stop fighting a rearguard battle that merely weakens its credibility, especially in the eyes of small countries, which are the only ones that can be bullied into accepting unwanted fiscal rules.
Realistically, all that the Commission can ask of European national governments is for transparency and clarity in their fiscal accounts.
Preventing the political use of fiscal policy is an impossible task.
But at least a country's fiscal actions should not be hidden in its budgets' obscure methodological footnotes.
Even this limited goal may not be easy to achieve.
A strategic lack of transparency is the bread and butter of shrewd politicians who want to please a lobby by hiding the costs of the public's largesse from the majority of citizens.
The rules that govern politicians' behavior must not be written as if disinterested, well-intentioned public servants will apply them.
Politicians are willing to go to great lengths to please their supporters and win elections.
The best that we can plausibly hope for is to ensure that the worst of what they do is done out in the open.
Will the EU Keep Faith with Turkey?
More than forty years ago, Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community.
With the Association agreement of 1963, a special relationship was established, culminating in the customs union of 1996.
During all these years, European governments consistently confirmed Turkey's eligibility for full membership, making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria.
Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life.
Should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled, it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005.
Not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU's credibility in the world.
In many parts of Europe, however, Turkey's admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size, relatively poor economy, fears of massive immigration, and, above all, cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam.
It would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges.
However, they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.
Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015.
This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms.
With 80 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states.
But the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU's decision-making process, because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power.
Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU.
Because of its weak economy, Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance.
The size of these transfers, however, would depend on the EU's financial policies at the time of admission, the outcome of accession negotiations, and economic developments in Turkey.
In any case, the EU's practice of "capping" its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey's accession.
Immigration should not be a cause for undue concern, either.
Human mobility is limited, and Turkey workers' would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period, possibly not before 2025.
Given the expected upswing of Turkey's economy and its declining birthrate, experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point.
Meanwhile, diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity.
Among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable, Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation.
It is Turkey's Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions.
Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture.
It is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state.
Unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey's deeply rooted secularism, such a risk cannot be totally excluded.
But the same is true for any other democracy, where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes.
Surely, the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey's democratic system, which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries.
As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a closed "Christian club" or an open and inclusive society, drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity.
Turkey's accession to the Union would give a powerful answer, one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world.
The need to refute arguments against Turkey's admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned: its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, Southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe's security; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy; and the great potential of the Turkish economy, with its young and dynamic labor force.
At the same time, the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account: the likelihood that the reform process would collapse, bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU's doorsteps.
Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges.
On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks.
Playing at Democracy
In Calcutta, when some younger kid came along and insisted on joining the game my friends were playing, we would let the new kid in, but only after whispering into each other's ears the words,
As a child, mastering the cruel art of
The technique of
What's true of children and adults is also true of international institutions.
Indeed, organizations that are officially committed to involving all nations in their decision making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations, while others merely go through the motions of participation.
The World Trade Organization (WTO), supposedly run on the principle of one country one vote, actually has its agenda selected behind the stage by a small group of nations.
It is now standard practice for international organizations publishing a report to involve all the "stakeholders" and to reflect their opinions.
So the evolving report is usually put up on a Web site and suggestions are invited from one and all--NGOs, trade unions, and other organizations of civil society.
This promotes a sense of participation, but as a friend, seasoned in such matters, informed me, the key in the end is to ignore all the comments received and to write up the report as if there were no Web site and no participation.
Increasingly, free expression of opinion does not influence or restrain how government behaves.
Consider the United States.
People expressed their opinion freely--in newspapers, on television, in Internet chat rooms--concerning George Bush's planned war on Iraq.
Never before was there so much opposition to a war
Part of what happened--or, rather what didn't happen--is admirable: almost no effort was made to muzzle criticism of the government, as happens in China and scores of dictatorial countries.
But the world's great democracies--the US, India, the UK, and others--are increasingly adept at not allowing freely expressed opinions to constrain what the government does.
The current war in Iraq is perhaps the strongest proof of this.
Leaving aside the immorality of this war--and immoral it is--I wish to draw attention to this increasing ability and inclination of democracies to "deal" with (meaning neutralize) public opinion.
They have embraced the
As democracies mature they become ever more practiced at managing opinion, and in many cases, at shaping opinion.
Every time Hans Blix commented on the UN inspections of Iraq that he was conducting, members of the Bush administration would paraphrase what Blix said.
The paraphrasing would subtly change Blix's comments to suit America's case for war.
By repeating the altered comments, it was hoped, mass opinion would shift in favor of the war.
Overthrowing a totalitarian regime and organizing elections may be hard, but the harder task is to go from voting to establishing a true democracy.
For people accustomed to living in a totalitarian state, learn what participation means is not easy.
Hence the popular belief that democracies, like wine, improve with age.
While this may be true, there is a downside to maturity.
Just as citizens in a democracy continuously learn to participate, democratic governments continuously learn how to get their way despite the participation.
It is no use denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize a sham.
We must recognize and confront this problem to prevent established democracies from atrophying and to help new democracies become more effective.
For it is not only morally wrong to leave nations and communities feeling marginalized and without voice; it is a recipe for frustration, rage, and terrorism.
Recasting Governance in Asia
Governance--the way in which decisions that affect the public interest are made--has emerged as a key factor in determining a country's pace of development.
Successful governance brings purposeful change.
Failure is punished by unrest, disaffection, and stagnation. On April 18
Today's Asian policymakers confront a very different environment from that faced by their predecessors fifty years ago.
Asia's population has more than doubled since 1950, with most of that growth coming in its poorest countries.
The political systems of these countries were tailored to small, static, rural populations.
Now these societies must cope not only with vast urban centers, but also with the very different talents and demands of urbanized people.
The global economy has changed dramatically, too.
Increased flows of goods, money, and knowledge around the world mean that foreign organizations and individuals become more influential, making it increasingly difficult for national governments manage their countries by themselves.
For example, international bodies such as the WTO have changed the framework within which economic decisions are taken.
Local economic change has been equally dramatic.
In parts of Asia, living standards have skyrocketed.
Foreign investment from within and outside the region has altered the structure of domestic economies.
Old models of economic growth, however, such as export orientation and selective use of import restrictions that worked well for East Asia in the last century, are less feasible under today's global trade rules.
So new rules of the game are needed.
In most Asian countries, formal rules need to be simplified and applied more fairly.
A "back to basics" approach is vital in three inter-linked areas, in which national governments must take the lead: minimizing corruption, enforcing property rights, and consistent application of the rule of law.
Few countries score strongly here.
Close links between business and governments were blamed by many for the financial crisis that struck Southeast Asia in 1997.
In parts of South Asia, violent conflict and the power of vested interests threaten the rule of law.
The result of such failures is that small elites benefit while the majority suffers.
A clear structure of formal rules is the best antidote to these flaws, for they bolster the informal customs on which so much in society depends.
Most business is not conducted in courts but in meetings where trust and reputation are essential.
As the social theorist Robert Putnam has explained, "social capital"--the networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate cooperation and coordination for mutual benefit--is as much a determinant as it is a result of economic growth.
Empowering as many members citizens as possible is likely to instill a widespread sense of purpose into efforts to move countries forward.
Government, the private sector, and civil society all have a role to play in strengthening social capital.
But successful interactions between these sectors cannot be wished into existence, and it is essential that the role of each is clearly defined.
Many Asian governments recognize the need to define their roles more clearly.
Following the 1997 crisis, the state withdrew further from markets, acknowledging the limits to what it can achieve and the importance of allowing private enterprise to flourish.
But governments retain a role in fostering an enabling environment within which markets operate.
Monitoring rules and enforcement are important, but different ways of working--say, through public-private partnerships--are also increasingly being considered in many innovative Asian economies.
The valuable role of civil society in giving voice to communities that governments cannot reach is also recognized, but its relationship with government and business is often characterized more by conflict than cooperation.
The private sector's role in decision-making, too, often needs to be clarified--where businesses have too much influence over government, their need to operate profitable may lead to policies that favor the few over the many.
The metaphor of a game--with rules and participants--leads many to think in terms of a competition between nations.
This is not entirely healthy, as our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game, where one country's gain is another's loss.
Indeed, countries do not compete against each other in the way that firms do.
Trade is potentially a positive-sum game, with all countries benefiting by exploiting their areas of comparative advantage.
Good governance can enhance this positive-sum game, and ensure that companies and individuals within countries partake of the benefits.
In another sense, however, it is valuable to think of governments as being in competition--providing a more effective service to their people than other governments.
International comparison of systems therefore plays an important role.
In this spirit, this month's UNCTAD-UNDP conference--"Governance in Asia: Underpinning Competitiveness in a Global Economy"--will bring together policy-makers from across Asia to discuss the governance challenges that Asia faces.
The role of government--the only actor possessing the legitimacy of a popular mandate--is fundamentally important in steering a society forward.
The private sector and civil society are, of course, increasingly important partners for governments.
How relationships among these stakeholders function will powerfully influence Asia's future development.
The Eighteenth Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger
Replacing a governor whom they re-elected only a year before with Arnold Schwarzenegger must have given Californian voters an enormous--if guilty--pleasure.
Some members of the opposition in Germany would dearly love to do the same to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, though they have not (yet!
) found a film star to replace him.
Several other European governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after being elected.
Beyond Europe this is true even for the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva, to say nothing of Mexican President Vicente Fox and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, the latter having called for a referendum to help arrest his sinking popularity.
Electoral success, it appears, fades fast nowadays.
So should every country adopt a recall procedure to maintain the legitimacy of governments?
Absolutely not.
Democracy, in the words of the philosopher Karl Popper, is about being able to remove those in power without violence; it is in this sense about trial and error.
But leaders must be given the chance to govern.
Indeed, they need a chance to make mistakes and to learn and recover from their errors, as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order itself.
Trial and error implies the opportunity to err before we try again.
Californian voters' first mistake is thus what may be called "the lure of the immediate"--none too surprising in a state where instant gratification is supposedly a core value.
But sometimes this desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere.
Indeed, democracy nowadays has embraced a pop culture of rapidly passing fads; today's hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow, and there are always more waiting in the wings.
In politics this can be dangerous, because it encourages basing decisions, no matter how weighty, on whatever popular opinion momentarily prevails.
The call for more referenda both reflects and fuels this trend.
Referenda are for the most part snapshots.
Switzerland, with its generally slower pace and its thorough political debates before votes are held, may be the exception.
As a rule however, referenda measure the popularity of political leaders at a particular moment, regardless of the issue at stake.
If and when Britain votes on joining the Euro, the result will most likely tell us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and about the European Union, but little about the merits of the common currency.
So the case for representative government remains strong.
Democracy is government by debate, by taking important decisions after thorough deliberation of the kind that--at least in large countries--must be conducted in a parliament through elected representatives.
Sometimes parliaments wish to act quickly, and perhaps must do so, but as a rule they take enough time to examine issues fully.
Parliaments talk before reaching conclusions; hence their name.
Consider Germany, where some leaders of the opposition Christian Democrats yearn to sink the Schröder government.
Clearly, the reforms proposed and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular, and there is little doubt that, a year after their re-election, the coalition of the Social Democrats and the Greens would not stand much of a chance at the polls.
But who knows what the electorate will think in three years, at the end of the government's full term in office?
By the time of the next regularly scheduled election, it could become clear that there were no real alternatives to Schröder's policies, and it could even be the case that the predicted beneficial effects of painful reforms will become apparent by then.
Leadership needs time to take and implement unpopular decisions as well as popular ones.
Leaders themselves need the nerve to take often precarious parliamentary majorities through the troughs of popularity.
This is why they should commit their cruelest deeds in the first year and soften up as the next election approaches.
The uneasy partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is a good example of this tactic.
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worth their position.
So California has set a bad example, and Californians will probably pay a heavy price for it.
They may not pay as heavy a price as France a century and a half ago, when the popularly elected Louis Napoleon transformed himself, via a wildly popular referendum, into Napoleon III--that vote being the last the French would enjoy until the end of the Second Empire.
Californians, of course, won't be disenfranchised, but their willfulness threatens to yield a wayward and irresponsible form of state politics.
To be sure, democracy implies limiting the time that the powerful have to exercise their power without challenge.
An effective democracy must give them enough time to win the support of those elected to legislate and to carry out their program.
These two imperatives are inherently contradictory, but the balance between them is still best achieved through representative, parliamentary democracy.
Anything else is likely to be about as stable as this week's top ten pop songs.
Herbert Hoover and the Stability Pact
In mid-July the great-and-good finance ministers of the European Monetary Union (EMU) gathered to consider the euro zone's economic condition.
They ruminated over the most recent economic forecast, which projects annual GDP growth in the euro zone this year at a pathetically anemic 0.7%.
Then, to a minister, without exception, they all but decided that their economies should suffer more of the same, if not worse.
They reiterated their commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact, which requires euro-zone countries to raise taxes and cut spending, putting even more downward pressure on their economies.
The Pact is already knocking Germany into recession, and Italy's government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts fast enough to keep up with falling output.
But none of this is apparently enough to force officials to re-examine their priorities.
Some EU finance ministers still view the Stability Pact as the ``cornerstone'' of EMU.
Others talk of the importance of obeying the ``rules of the game.''
Still others say that while it is clearly essential to restore economic growth, the recovery must occur ``within the spirit of the Pact.''
From the American side of the Atlantic, all of these rationales seem utterly bizarre.
The last time an American government tried to ensure a balanced budget in the face of a recession was over seventy years ago, during the presidency of Herbert Hoover at the outset of the Great Depression.
Since then the broad consensus in the US has been that cyclical economic distress requires the use of budget deficits to ameliorate suffering, stimulate aggregate demand, and hasten recovery.
Economists call these cyclical fiscal boosts ``automatic stabilizers.''
When private incomes fall, so do public revenues.
The reduction in tax collection can increase disposable income.
But, more importantly, when private incomes fall, government social-welfare expenditures rise, sparking a recovery in demand, output, investment, and employment.
The fall in taxes and the rise in spending do widen the budget deficit, but in a healthy and useful way.
On the American side of the Atlantic, the usefulness of these automatic fiscal stabilizers is unchallenged.
On the contrary, whenever recession threatens, political debate revolves around whether they need to be reinforced by
Nor is it even a fiscal discipline issue.
Whenever proposals have surfaced for some sort of balanced-budget amendment to the US Constitution, proponents have typically included exemptions not just for war, but also for recessions.
We know the origins of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Northern European countries--particularly Germany and the Netherlands--prided themselves on traditionally maintaining moderate debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively low interest rates.
These countries saw that Southern European countries--Italy and Greece were the biggest worries--traditionally had high debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively high nominal interest rates because of their perceived tolerance of inflation.
The Northern European countries feared that deficit spending by the South might ultimately create pressure for partial monetization of their debt through inflation of the euro--or, more precisely, their leaders feared that investors, fearing the same thing, would demand higher interest rates.
The Stability and Growth Pact was intended to keep the public debts of southern Europe low, and thus keep interest rates low by reassuring investors that national debts would never be allowed to rise high enough to generate serious inflationary pressures.
But if you look at the euro zone's economic problems today, the danger of high long-term nominal interest rates does not even rank among investors' top ten concerns.
At the very least, investors clearly do not fear that high debt will lead governments to stoke inflation by printing more money.
The EU's problems are stagnant output, high structural unemployment, weak productivity growth, the wasteful and unfair Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and the forthcoming structural adjustments from the expansion of the EU itself.
From one perspective, it is good that the euro zone's finance ministers are eager to keep their national debts low in the long term: it is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970's will not be casually thrown away.
But it is dangerous to become obsessed with the past.
There is no more certain route to economic disaster than to put on historical blinders.
As Herbert Hoover could attest, when we see only the economic policy problems of a generation ago, we risk missing the hazards that lie directly in front of our eyes.
The Ghosts of Economics Past
In Charles Dicken's great novel "A Christmas Carol," the soulless businessman Ebeneezer Scrooge is tormented by a visit from the Spirit of Christmas Past.
Today, economists are similarly troubled by unwanted ghosts, as they ponder the reappearance of economic ills long thought buried and dead.
From Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley to Paul Krugman at Princeton, to the Governors of the US Federal Reserve and the senior staff at the European Central Bank, to almost everyone in Japan, economists all over the world are worrying about deflation.
Their thoughts retrace the economic thinking of over fifty years ago, a time when economists concluded that the thing to do with deflation was to avoid it like the plague.
Back in 1933 Irving Fisher --Milton Friedman's predecessor atop America's monetarist school of economists-- announced that governments could prevent deep depressions by avoiding deflation.
Deflation --a steady ongoing decline in prices-- gave businesses and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and hoard cash.
It reduced the ability of businesses and banks to service their debt, and might trigger a chain of big bankruptcies that would destroy confidence in the financial system, providing further incentives to hoard.
Such strong incentives to hoard rather than spend can keep demand low and falling, and unemployment high and rising, for a much longer time than even the most laissez-faire-oriented politician or economist had ever dared contemplate.
Hence the Keynesian solution: use monetary policy (lower interest rates) and fiscal policy (expanded government spending and reduced taxes) to keep the economy from ever approaching the precipice where deflation becomes possible.
But if this is an issue solved over fifty years ago, why is it haunting us now?
Why is this menace a matter of grave concern in Japan today, and a threat worth worrying about in the US?
In the late 1940s, those present at the creation of the post-World War II international economic order tried to create an international monetary system that would (a) allow for exchange rates stable enough for producers and consumers to escape the risks of excessive and irrational exchange rate fluctuations, (b) allow countries to follow their own domestic macroeconomic policies, and (c) prevent the catastrophic panics affecting not just individual banks but whole countries that produced the destructive international financial crisis of the Great Depression.
The result was the fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate system of Bretton Woods, which over time mutated into the floating-rate system of the 1980s.
Then came the 1990s.
All of a sudden tremendously destructive herd-driven financial crises were back: Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Brazil, and so on looked like nothing as much as the US financial panic of 1873 or the Austrian Creditanstalt crisis of 1931.
Argentina's crisis at the end of 2001 looked remarkably like Argentina's Baring Brothers crisis of 1890 -- save that politicians and international bankers seem to have had a much better idea of what to do to minimize the damage in 1890 than they do today.
But if those who built the post-World War II international monetary system worked to guard against the dangers posed by panic-driven international financial crises, why are these financial devils back?
The truth is that economic policymakers are juggling sets of potential disasters, exchanging the one that appears most threatening for a threat that seems more distant.
In the US, the Bush Administration is skeptical of the stimulative power of monetary policy and wants bigger fiscal deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- low investment, slow growth, loss of confidence, uncontrolled inflation and exchange rate depreciation-- can be finessed, or will not become visible until after the Bush team leaves office.
In Europe, the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the costs of European employment that is far too high.
In developing countries, capital controls to prevent financial crises are feared as obstacles to attracting the finance necessary for industrialization, and as potential sources of corruption as financial flows somehow pass through the hands of the Vice Minister of Finance's nephew-in-law.
Flexible exchange rates, designed to allow the market to signal when confidence in the currency is declining, also put exporters at a competitive disadvantage against foreign-country producers whose prices aren't batted around by unpredictable exchange rates.
Even the import-substitution policies, now universally scorned, were originally adopted by the developing world for good (as well as bad) reasons: the protectionist shutting-off of developed-country markets during the Great Depression which had disastrous consequences for the developing economies.
The ghosts of economics' past return because the lessons of the present are always oversold.
Politicians and policymakers advance their approach to economics as the "One True Doctrine."
But what they are doing, however, is dealing with the biggest problem of the moment but at the price of removing institutions and policies that policymakers before them had put into place to control problems which they felt to be the most pressing.
Ebeneezer Scrooge's nocturnal visitors were able to convince him of the errors of his ways.
Let's hope that today's economists also learn the lessons of their unwanted ghosts.
In the D-Mark's Shadow
Getting Over the Irish Stew
Justifying Humanitarian Intervention
In 1998, I visited Central Asia's former Soviet republics for talks--concerning the democratic development that was--or should have been--taking place in those newly independent countries.
My hosts were former communist leaders who were now more or less democratically elected presidents.
Each spoke easily about institutions, democratic procedures, and respect for the rule of law.
But human rights were another matter entirely.
In each country, I presented lists of political prisoners and asked about their fates.
In one country, the president immediately decided to free a man accused of plotting a coup.
But even this seeming success was morally ambiguous.
The president had not made a political decision; he had bestowed a personal favor.
I was receiving a gift--itself merely another demonstration of the president's arbitrary exercise of power--not proof of respect for moral principles.
In one country, I spoke with a leader of the Islamic fundamentalist opposition, which had waged a long civil war against the government.
This man now styled himself as chairman of a "Committee of National Reconciliation."
Guards armed to the teeth surrounded him, yet he firmly supported the notion of democratization.
Indeed, he saw it as his surest route to power, because the vast majority of the population thought exactly as he did.
Democracy, he hinted more ominously, would enable him to "eliminate"--he did not dwell on the exact meaning of the word--those who did not.
In such democracies without democrats, "human rights" are more problematic to discuss than procedural formalities, because they are not thought of as "rights" in the legal sense, but merely as pangs of conscience, or else as gifts to be exchanged for something else of value.
This distinction matters because it points to the limited effectiveness of formalized legal norms as a means of promoting human rights.
This gap between human rights and the behavior of rulers has brought about the greatest shift in the conduct of international affairs in our time--the advent of "humanitarian intervention."
It arose initially outside established international institutions and the UN system, originating with the French group, Doctors Without Borders, which deemed human rights to be a value superior to national sovereignty.
Doctors Without Borders introduced the concept of "the right of intervention" in humanitarian disasters, bypassing the strictures of traditional international law.
The international system rather quickly adopted (and transformed) this notion, and numerous humanitarian
NATO's intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that US Secretary of State Colin Powell used to justify the war with Iraq.
But, however compelling the cause of humanitarian military intervention, such actions must be brought under the umbrella of the UN Charter.
Promoting respect for human rights was, after all, the guiding principle behind the UN's establishment.
Its tasks in this area were affirmed in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which give human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual states.
Yet a glaring contradiction exists between the universality and supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in states' internal affairs, which are also enshrined in UN documents.
One way to overcome this chasm is to introduce into the UN Charter a new chapter devoted to human rights and to reformulate Chapter IV, which concerns the use of force in international relations.
Moreover, the principle of sovereignty itself needs redefinition.
What the world needs is a system of legal injunctions--bilateral and multilateral agreements, as well as appropriate monitoring and supervisory institutions--to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons.
Legal restraints on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators too often use it to justify criminal aggression.
Adolf Hitler minted this strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia--supposedly in defense of the Sudeten Germans--and later when he invaded my homeland, Poland.
As Milosevic showed again in the 1990s, when he claimed to be defending innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, justifying military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much room for their distortion and abuse.
This is why debates about reforming the Security Council should focus not on changing its composition, but on its mission.
The Council should be made explicitly responsible for "human security" and be given a responsibility to protect it, in addition to its current role in safeguarding more traditional notions of international security.
The principle of non-intervention in a state's internal affairs was never absolute, and globalization confronts it with a radical challenge.
The term "international relations" assumes the Westphalian order of commitments among sovereign nation states, which replaced the medieval order of communities defined by personal fealty to a king.
But today it is the Westphalian order that is in decline, along with the significance of state borders.
In this wider and uncertain context, the need to regulate humanitarian military intervention looms large.
What Does America Want?
When the leaders of the world's richest nations gather in Evian, France, one unasked question will dominate: what does America want in the world?
So it may be helpful to outline the principles and ideas that guide US foreign policy.
First, inconsistency is no vice.
Indeed, in foreign policymaking, inconsistency is often a virtue.
I speak not of principles, but of policy.
The US does not have a "one size fits all" approach to the world.
What happened in Iraq should not be over?interpreted as a rigid template for US policy toward countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction, support terrorism, or deny people liberty.
In Iraq, the US used force as a last resort, against a country with a clear record of aggression, and after a large degree of international consensus had developed about what Iraq needed to do.
Different policies-tailored for local, regional, and international realities-will be needed to meet the challenges posed by North Korea, Iran, Syria, or elsewhere.
America's armed forces are an essential background to much of what the US accomplishes internationally.
But defense policy is only one component of foreign policy.
Not every threat to America's national interests can be addressed with military power.
If all you have to work with is a hammer, as the saying goes, every problem looks like a nail.
Success in foreign policy, as in carpentry, requires the right tools for the job.
Partnership is essential here.
For all of America's power, there is little that the US can do in the world that it can't do better with the active participation of others, be they governments, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations.
Partnership facilitates solutions to problems that defy purely national responses and means that burdens are shared.
America relies on partnerships in the global war on terrorism: foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers; private financial institutions help track the transfers of funds that sustain terror networks.
Beyond partnerships, international institutions add value-provided they are effectively organized, have realistic mandates, and contain members that are committed to common norms and aims.
Such institutions can and often do advance US national interests.
Indeed, it would be difficult to carry out critical dimensions of US foreign policy-from trade to non?proliferation to environmental policy-without them.
The World Trade Organization is a case in point.
It provides a forum in which to negotiate new trade liberalization agreements, seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies, and resolve disputes with trading partners.
But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities.
NATO, for example, is evolving from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to one suited to meeting today's security challenges wherever they may arise, such as in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq.
Multilateralism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values.
The UN and other global frameworks may sometimes be best placed to address US foreign policy goals.
When the UN or other bodies are unwilling or unable to move against dire threats, America reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible,
This flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon.
We ignore failing states at our peril, because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can offer a haven for terrorists, criminals, and drug traffickers.
One of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states.
Another is to assist countries that have collapsed into violence to begin the slow process of recovery.
One impulse behind America's international engagement, and one of the great sources of its global power, has been its enduring impulse to make the world a better place.
Any US foreign policy must combine interests and values, because the American public always insists that US national objectives be linked to national ideals.
The appeal of US leadership abroad rests in part on the attractiveness of America's political institutions, society, and culture, and its willingness to champion human rights and democracy.
At the same time, our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve US interests, owing to the hardheaded realization that democracies settle their differences peaceably.
Today's world lacks irreconcilable conflict among the main concentrations of world power: Europe, Russia, China, Japan, and the US.
This congruence of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising foundation for managing the common challenges that confront us all.
Our over?riding goal should be to create a world in which governments, organizations, and peoples embrace arrangements that allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values.
Everyone has an interest in a world in which force is used only as a last resort, terrorism is regarded as beyond the pale, weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used, free trade becomes the norm, citizens enjoy basic liberties, democratic values triumph, and the rule of law replaces the way of the gun.
Bringing such an integrated world may be optimistic, even idealistic, but it is hardly naive.
The Road to the Double Helix, the Structure of DNA
Fifty years ago, on April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the science magazine
A second major advance came a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and hemoglobin.
Since then, X-ray structural analysis of protein molecules has helped us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions.
Both discoveries--DNA structure and protein structure--were made at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory.
So why were these two foundation stones of the revolution in biology and medicine that dominated science in the second half of the 20th century uncovered in a British
The great breakthroughs of 1953 rested on the strength of experimental physics at Cambridge, beginning in the late 19th century.
This legacy shaped the intellectual environment in which the father-and-son team of William and Lawrence Bragg were trained, and where Lawrence Bragg--first as an undergraduate and then as a research student--developed in 1912 the ideas that led to X-ray structural analysis.
Although Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich, and Paul Knipping had discovered the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, it was Lawrence Bragg who understood how it could be exploited scientifically.
Reflection by "Bragg planes"--sheets of atoms that can diffract X-rays at specific angles that are determined by the separation between sheets--enabled the Braggs to calculate the exact arrangement of sodium and chloride atoms in a crystal of salt.
William Bragg graduated in mathematics in Cambridge in 1884, and became professor of physics in Adelaide, Australia.
In 1909 he returned to Britain to take up a chair at Leeds, continuing his work on the nature of X-rays.
He became director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he attracted some outstanding young scientists interested in the X-ray field.
Among them were two recent Cambridge graduates, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who became interested in the problem of protein structure--Astbury as a result of being asked by Bragg to provide X-ray diagrams of wool and silk.
Bernal moved back to Cambridge as a lecturer in structural crystallography in 1927, and in 1931 was promoted to assistant director of research in crystallography, by then a sub-department of the Cavendish Laboratory.
Bernal's main scientific interest was initially the atomic structure of crystals, metals, and minerals, then of hormones and sterols--and of some amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.
Astbury, meanwhile, moved to Leeds in 1928, where he also began working on amino acids and proteins.
Describing his unsuccessful attempts to obtain well-ordered X-ray diffraction patterns from crystals of the protein pepsin, he wondered whether Bernal could help obtain crystals of other proteins.
A friend of Bernal's named Glenn Millikan had happened to visit a lab in Uppsala, Sweden, where large pepsin crystals had been obtained, and he brought some of the crystals, still in their mother-liquor, back to Cambridge.
Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (later Hodgkin) obtained patterns of the dry crystals, as Astbury had, and with similarly disappointing results.
But when Bernal observed the crystals in a light microscope, he noticed that as the large amount of water in the crystal lattice evaporated, they became disordered.
They repeated the X-ray experiment, but with the crystal surrounded by its mother-liquor and sealed in a glass capillary, obtaining patterns with large numbers of crystalline reflections.
The results of this first defining moment in protein crystallography were published as a letter in
Max Perutz, a chemistry graduate from Vienna, arrived in Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with Bernal.
The next year, he was given excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best X-ray diffraction patterns to date.
But the observable diffraction pattern--the intensities and positions of the individual reflections--represents only half of the data needed to deduce the structure of the diffracting object.
In mathematical terms, it gives the amplitude, but not the phases--i.e., the stages in an oscillatory motion--without which the atomic positions could not be determined.
With simpler structures made up of small numbers of atoms, chemistry could provide considerable guidance as to the atomic arrangements, and a solution could thus often be found by trial and error.
But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this to work.
So despite the enormous amount of excellent data that was collected, the solution remained tantalizingly out of reach.
But the faith remained that detailed information about protein structure could be obtained from the X-ray patterns in some way, if only it could be discovered.
It was only natural that where chemistry fell short, physics--and its premier laboratory--showed the way forward, a way grasped by Watson and Crick in the epic breakthrough that we celebrate this month.
Worlds Apart
Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence.
Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next.
As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality, or to its consequences for education, health, and social welfare.
Of course, there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence.
But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability, threatening security.
Excluded and facing bleak life prospects, young people, in particular, often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior, including violence.
Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty.
Clearly, however, poverty arises from various complex conditions, and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach.
It is hard to imagine, for example, how to "make poverty history" without also generating enough decent work, educational opportunities, and healthcare for all.
To be sure, the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades.
Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced.
Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems.
Overall, however, the inequality gaps are large and, in many cases, growing.
The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries.
Meanwhile, growing unemployment, widening skill and productivity gaps, and the "informalization" or "casualization" of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide, as the number of "working poor" and the incidence of "jobless growth" has spread.
Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs, imposed since the 1980's, delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth.
Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries.
Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally.
But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels.
Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities.
The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions.
But they are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemployment, greater earnings disparities, reduced social protection, and environmental degradation.
International financial liberalization, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities.
In addition, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.
Meanwhile, free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends.
Developing countries' international terms of trade have worsened: prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures, as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture, and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights.
As a result, trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world, as in the case of garments this year.
And, while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters.
Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off.
The "retreat of the state" in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government, including the capacity to lead and sustain development, as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education, health, housing, and utilities.
The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start, and its consequences have become glaringly obvious.
Unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction, the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart.
Don't Follow The Fed
The US Federal Reserve faces a dilemma, for it needs to continue raising interest rates in the face of a hurricane-devastated economy.
The Fed's failure to raise rates earlier thus holds a powerful lesson for the European Central Bank: after a prolonged period of monetary stability at unusually low interest rates, waiting too long to raise rates to more normal and appropriate levels holds dangerous consequences.
The Fed was late in beginning the interest-rate normalization process, and it is now paying a price.
The ECB must not make the same mistake, even bearing in mind that the two central banks operate in different milieus and under different constraints.
Warning signs of impending inflation abound across the euro zone.
Money-supply growth has been well above target levels for some time now, indicating excess liquidity.
September headline inflation, at 2.6%, is above the ECB's 2% target ­ -- as is the latest forecast for 2006 inflation (updated forecasts will be released at the beginning of December).
"The period of wage moderation may be coming to an end," warns Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, implying that soaring energy prices may now be feeding through into the overall price level (so-called "second-round effects").
In these circumstances, there is no good reason to wait to raise interest rates.
The longer energy prices remain at their current lofty levels, the greater the probability that inflationary expectations will increase and that second-round effects will materialize.
Further procrastination on interest-rate normalization by the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation.
This would be disastrous for Europe's economic recovery, as the ECB would have no choice but to slam down hard on the monetary brakes.
No one wants this.
Better a 50-basis-point increase now -- thereby allowing the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation in check -- than triple or quadruple that figure down the road.
The old adage that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" applies with particular force to monetary policy.
Judging from the outcome of last month's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council, that "ounce of prevention" appears to be right around the corner for the euro-zone economy.
Indeed, the pace of ECB warnings about the risks of inflation has quickened in recent months -- the earlier "We are vigilant" became "We are particularly vigilant" in September, which became "Strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted" in October.
The Governing Council is in danger of running out of adjectives -- as well as credibility -- if it does not act soon.
The tone of ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's comments in the Q & A section of the press conference following the October meeting was unusually hawkish.
Trichet appeared to be calling for a pre-emptive approach when he said, "We must not allow second-round effects to materialize."
For the first time, the ECB president was willing to admit publicly that the Governing Council had discussed the pros and cons of a rate hike at the meeting.
Nonetheless, current interest rates were described as "still appropriate" in October, signaling that the ECB has not yet reached a decision to bite the bullet.
To be sure, an unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a strong rise in the value of the euro could postpone the inevitable rate hike.
But what seems clear is that the ECB used the October press conference to warn politicians, trade unions, and the markets that its long period of monetary-policy inactivity is coming to an end.
The exit process has begun.
Not everyone is happy with this news.
Politicians -- like Jacques Chirac in France, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and ECOFIN (the finance ministers of the European Union's member states) -- continue to press for fixed, even lower, interest rates.
But it's easy for politicians to be irresponsible about monetary policy.
They are not the ones who will be blamed for soaring prices, nor are they the ones who will have to force the inflation genie back into the bottle.
By constantly pushing for lower interest rates than the ECB can deliver, politicians set the central bank up as a scapegoat for Europe's poor economic performance.
Europe is doing badly, they argue, not because of their own failure to lead the structural reform process, but because interest rates are too high.
At the same time, the ECB does not need to go nearly as far as the Fed, which has raised interest rates in increments of 25 basis points at 12 consecutive meetings, with still more to come.
For the ECB, an increase of 50 basis points could do the job at this point -- after which rates could probably be put on hold for some time.
The Fed waited too long to start the normalization process, and, because it was more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the interest-rate cycle, it has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the upward phase.
This is not the type of volatile monetary policy that Europe wants or needs.
The West Versus the Rest?
The Madrid bombings have made Europeans feel the scourge of terrorism in their bones.
March 11 is now Europe's version of September 11 in America.
Yet America and Europe often do not seem to see the world through the same glasses: Spain's response to the terrorist attacks - a threat common to all democracies - was to vote in a government promising an end to pro-US policy on Iraq.
Does this mean that Europe and the US have dramatically different visions?
Part of the seeming disconnect on foreign policy emerges from a misunderstanding about what "Europe" is about.
The European project is a realist's response to globalization and its challenges.
It was initiated to create "solidarités de fait," promote political stability, and consolidate democracy and Europe's social model.
Having achieved these goals, Europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world developments.
This is not nostalgia for past glory.
An unprecedented degree of solidarity now exists across Europe, as was apparent in the collective mourning and outpouring of sympathy towards Spain; we must build on that huge potential to create a logic of solidarity in the world.
The US, also victim of a horrendous attack, feels drawn to the world but not to promote a similar model of cooperation.
Rather, in defending their values and security, Americans strive to defend the world, especially the Western world, from dark new threats.
The messianic idealism that liberated Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from communism is now directed at other enemies.
With all the attention devoted to strained transatlantic relations, it is easy to overlook how often our preoccupations overlap.
On issues such as terrorism, weapons proliferation, Iran, Afghanistan (where we jointly train the country's future army), and Africa (where French initiatives with American support recently succeeded in stabilizing Côte d'Ivoire and Congo), Europe and the US speak with a common voice.
But on some issues, such as the Iraq war, Europeans are not all ready to follow America blindly.
The world - Europe in particular - has fascination and admiration for the US.
But today we must move away from fascination and gratitude and realize that the pursuit of European integration remains in the best interest of the US, which has supported it for 50 years.
In today's world, there is clearly work for two to bring about stability and security, and in promoting common values.
In particular, the Franco-German "engine" of Europe should not be seen as a potential rival to the US.
France and Germany are not an axis aspiring to be some sort of an alternative leadership to the US.
Rather, the two countries form a laboratory needed for the internal working of the EU.
Anyone who thinks we are building a European rival to America has not looked properly at the facts.
Indeed, France and Germany do not get along naturally.
Much sets us apart: EU enlargement, agriculture, and domestic market issues.
So it is not the
So I do not believe that a lasting rift looms.
Most Americans still see in Europe a partner with largely the same aims in the world.
Most Europeans see in America a strong friend.
We are all allies of the US; our draft constitution restates the importance of the NATO link; our strategy for growth and our contribution to global stability depend on the irreplaceable nature of our relationship with America.
This is why the US should encourage the development of a common European security and defense policy, which is merely the burden sharing that America has been pressing on Europe for decades.
We must forge greater European military capacities simply to put in place a mechanism that allows us to stand effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other catastrophes strike one of our democracies, as just happened.
But we must also establish an autonomous European military planning capacity, because the EU might need to lead its own operations, perhaps because NATO is unwilling to.
We French are opposed to building a "two-speed" Europe.
But we want structured co-operation - meaning that some European states may press ahead in defense capacity - because we are not prepared to let the more cautious and hesitant dictate a recurrence of the Balkan tragedy of the 1990's, when Europeans couldn't act and Americans wouldn't (for a while).
The creation of such a capacity will make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner.
So it is hard for Europeans to understand why plans for closer European integration should be seen as anti-American.
The only way to arrest such fears is through closer and more frequent dialogue.
On defense and security matters, the EU's security doctrine provides a great opportunity to build on our common worries: terrorism and non-proliferation, but also the need to ensure sustainable development in all quarters of the world.
Europe and the US must pursue their aims in cooperation, while ensuring that such cooperation never becomes an alliance of the "West against the Rest."
Some in the West have tried to conjure a "Clash of Civilizations" out of our troubled times.
Our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against anybody in particular.
Is India Ready for Full Currency Convertibility?
India's political boldness in seeking peace with Pakistan in their half-century twilight struggle for Kashmir may soon be matched by economic moves equally as daring.
Indeed, India is edging toward a truly bold reform: full international convertibility of the rupee.
How it goes about this will not only effect India's economic development, but provide object lessons for China as it ponders convertibility in the years ahead.
Since 1991 India has been travelling on a path from rupee devaluation to full convertibility, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) relaxing a range of foreign-exchange controls.
Resident Indians can now maintain a foreign-currency account and invest in shares of foreign companies, while non-resident Indians can repatriate legacy/inheritance assets.
Indian companies listed abroad can buy property in foreign countries, and resident firms will be allowed to pre-pay external commercial debt up to US$100 million.
Limits on exporters' foreign-currency accounts will be removed, and banks may invest in overseas money and debt markets.
Is India ready for full convertibility?
The government is still lagging on its domestic economic reforms.
Structural reform and privatization have slowed, eroding investors' confidence.
But failure to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term.
Hence it would be premature for India to open up its capital account immediately.
Exchange rate stability is the key anchor when a country's reform process is underway.
There is, however, little evidence that capital account convertibility has a meaningful impact on a country's growth rate.
With capital-account convertibility, the rupee's exchange rate will be determined more by capital flows than by inflation differentials, as India's inflation rate remains broadly in line with the OECD average of around 3%.
Because India is still running a trade deficit, there could be some pressure on the rupee following any negative shock.
Although monetary growth is more than twice the rate of real GDP growth, the inflationary risk is probably low because substantial excess capacity exists.
Indeed, throughout the 1990s, despite rising output, deflation occurred, which means that India's potential output is expanding.
The moves towards full capital-account convertibility have proceeded in step with impressive growth in India's foreign-currency reserves.
Indeed, India's external liquidity position has strengthened dramatically in the past decade.
As a result of a current-account surplus and an interest-rate differential of 3-4%, foreign reserves reached $70.3 billion by the end of 2002--enough to cover almost 15 months of imports--up from only US$4 billion in 1990.
Following the 1991 balance of payments crisis, the rupee's exchange rate was devalued around 20%.
Exporters could exchange 30% of their earnings at the market rate.
This was subsequently replaced with a two-tier exchange-rate system making the rupee partially convertible--60% of export earnings could be converted at the market exchange rate, and the rest at the RBI's fixed rate (used by the government to finance essential imports like petroleum, cooking oil, fertilizers, and life-saving drugs).
The two-tier exchange-rate system acted as an export tax, but it did not survive for long, giving way to a unified exchange rate on the trade account.
Full convertibility on the current account followed in August 1994.
The policy debate then turned to capital-account convertibility, with the IMF and the World Bank strongly in favor.
In May 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility charted a three-stage liberalization process to be completed by 1999-2000, with an accompanying emphasis on fiscal consolidation, a mandated inflation target, and a strong financial system.
Then the East Asian currency crisis put further action on hold and raised serious questions about when--and whether--to proceed.
The sudden meltdown of apparently healthy economies served as a stark reminder that strong external liquidity should not be the driving force towards full convertibility.
The downside risk of capital-account liberalization, after all, is higher exchange-rate volatility, and even countries with sound liquidity positions could not prevent a run on their reserves.
The lesson for India is that, in the event of a domestic or external shock, full convertibility could prove to be a costly, short-lived experiment.
The fundamental question is whether full convertibility will encourage higher net inflows or outflows of capital.
The downside risk of higher volatility for the rupee is aggravated by some serious problems, including a deficit running at 6% of GDP and the strategic stand-off with Pakistan.
Short-term capital outflows--which might occur should either risk worsen--could create greater output volatility.
So it is vital for India to increase the inward flow of long-term capital, regardless of whether the capital account is closed or open.
In this context, it is noteworthy that China, with a closed capital account, has foreign-exchange reserves of US$286 billion, four times the size of India's, though China's economy is only double India's size.
Nor is full convertibility the key to attracting higher inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI).
China attracted FDI inflows of US$52.7 billion in 2002--the largest in the world.
India needs to attract higher FDI inflows to help soak up the economy's excess capacity.
This underscores the importance for India's financial stability of successful management of the capital account (monitoring inflows and outflows) following any move toward full convertibility.
But, in the near term, full capital account convertibility is not in India's interest.
Twilight of the Chancellor?
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's resignation as chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) will deeply affect the distribution of forces within the German government and its slim "Red-Green" majority in Parliament.
While it seems to be premature to speak, as some in Germany now do, of a "Twilight of the Chancellor" or to call Schröder's surprising step "the beginning of the end" of his tenure, it is perfectly correct to describe it as a dramatic loss of power.
The immediate winner is Franz Müntefering, age 64, the SPD's parliamentary floor leader who will succeed Schröder, as party chairman.
Both politicians will constitute a tandem, but Schröder will be more dependent on Müntefering's loyalty than Müntefering is dependent on Schröder's success.
Schröder has been representing a moderately left political platform and agenda, one comparable to British Prime Minister Tony Blair's New Labour philosophy or former US President Bill Clinton's centrism.
Müntefering, however, is more attached to traditional Social Democratic (or Old Labour) values.
In terms of leadership style, Schröder is a soloist; Müntefering a team player.
In Germany, the Chancellor holds the strongest position among the key political players.
However, the main source of any German Chancellor's strength is not to be found in the legal powers conferred upon him by the constitution; it is the actual support he holds within his own party.
With one notable exception in the 1950's, none of Germany's two main political parties - the Social Democrats and the moderately conservative Christian Democrats - has ever managed to win an absolute majority in Parliament.
As a consequence, German Chancellors usually preside over coalition governments, and their effective authority is based on the loyalty of the party forces they command within such political alliances.
Although the Social Democrats never really liked Schröder (they certainly do not love him in the way they did the unforgettable Willy Brandt), they willy-nilly followed him so long as they saw him as the only guarantor of electoral success after 16 frustrating years (1982-1998) in opposition to Helmut Kohl.
But this is no longer the case.
Since the end of 2002, Schröder and the SPD have been facing unusually low public approval ratings - and this pattern is not likely to change soon.
In 2003 alone, almost 40,000 Social Democrats left their party, a hemorrhaging previously unheard of.
If national elections had, say, been held last Sunday, February 8, a centre-right coalition consisting of the Christian Democrats and the Liberals would have won 57% of the vote, according to "Infratest dimap," one of Germany's main polling institutes.
With no more than 35% of the vote, Schröder's "Red-Green" coalition would have suffered a disaster.
At the beginning of what has been dubbed a "super election year" in Germany - with 14 elections, one at the European, five at the regional, and eight at the local levels - this is hideously bad news for the SPD.
Several times before, Schröder had been thoroughly energized by desperate situations when he stood with his back to the wall.
This quality is his greatest strength, and it seems he has now embarked on his riskiest counteroffensive ever.
It is based on the bet that there will be a considerable economic upswing from mid-2004 onwards until the next national elections in autumn 2006 - and that voters will attribute the expected recovery to the economic, labour market and welfare state reforms, called "Agenda 2010," that Schröder has made the hallmark of his chancellorship.
For a long time, Schröder's reformist rhetoric had not been matched by his politics.
Only after his re-election in autumn 2002, did he give up his previous populist stance, short-term responses and neo-corporatist ways of trying to talk trade unions and employers' associations into compromise.
In view of Germany's most pressing problems - an accelerating demographic decline, an overregulated labour market, and a cloudy and confusing tax system - Schröder's reform agenda may look far too timid, but many cuts have been perceived as extremely cruel by the SPD's core constituency, especially the powerful labour unions.
But, given Germany's economic distress, which looks likely to worsen given the country's demographic problems, the Social Democrats are now condemned to give wealth creation priority over redistribution.
Germany cannot afford to slow down or, worse yet, stop the reform process.
In the best case scenario, Schröder will therefore stick to the "Agenda 2010" philosophy, and Müntefering will patiently explain to a reluctant SPD that you have to cross the desert in order to make it to the Promised Land.
In the worst case, Schröder will lapse back into populism for the sake of short-term electoral success, and Müntefering will confirm that method so as to save the wounded Social Democratic soul from total despair.
Schröder's tragedy is that his power may further erode whatever way he chooses.
At the end of this current "super election year," we will know the answer.
The Great Man Syndrome
In our globalized age, vast impersonal forces are supposed to determine events.
Globalized markets, unfettered trade, militant Islam, China's awakening: these are the things historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny.
But most people don't see things this way.
Instead, most people still instinctively look at "great men" as the agents of history, the men (and women) who seem to forge events through their political vision, personal charisma, and the force of their moral claims.
By sheer force of conviction and personality, such figures, many of us believe, can carry the day, bringing a glimmer of hope to an otherwise detached and impersonal universe.
This yearning for providential men or women in our global age results from at least three factors.
The first concerns the complexity and vulnerability of our world.
The second, paradoxically, reflects our growing cynicism towards politics and politicians.
And the third is the result of our media culture, obsessed as it is with putting a "face" to events.
Confronted with the problem of bringing about positive changes in a domestic or international environment that seems to defy the power of "normal" leaders, one looks for new Alexanders to untie the "Gordian knot" and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism.
For example, structural reforms in Europe are thought impossible to enact unless imposed by some reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.
In the Middle East, everyone waits for a new Anwar Sadat to arise among the Arabs.
Disillusion with politics and politicians also is a key element of our yearning for providential leaders.
In France for example, the overly flattering commemoration of President François Mitterrand's death ten years ago primarily reflects widespread disillusion with his successor, Jacques Chirac.
Indirect criticism of the present is usually a key element in idealized views of the past.
The less we expect from a "normal" politician, the more we look for a hero.
With the world becoming a global stage, the media's role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential.
The public demands quick answers to complex problems that, unsolved, risk endangering the planet.
They need figures with whom they can identify, immediately recognize, and, above all, trust.
The emergence of an embryonic "world civil society" heightens demand for universal and charismatic figures, holding out the hope of global accountability, but also carrying populist overtones.
In a world searching for providential leaders, the case of Ariel Sharon is both symbolic and paradoxical, for this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades.
He has become a nearly revered figure in his country, and large segments of Western public opinion believe that his political demise represents a potentially fatal blow to any hope of progress in the region, even as he remains hated in large parts of the Arab and Muslim world.
Sharon's transformation from villain to hero within the space of a mere few years is a source of fascination for his people, the region, and the world -- all the more so because his ultimate intentions will remain a subject of endless dispute among historians tomorrow and among politicians claiming to be his faithful heirs today.
Was Sharon really convinced by demographers that the "Great Israel" that once seemed to be his dream would actually mean the end of a Jewish State, or did his disengagement strategy of "Gaza first" really mean "Gaza last"?
For those who support one or the other reading, Sharon will forever hold the benefit of the doubt.
That Sharon's stroke could be compared -- in terms of political consequences -- with the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates that his personality had become associated with hope and security.
The "bulldozer" had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too.
He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement.
In fact, one may wonder if the world has made of Sharon a providential man because it wanted so much to believe that there was still "hope around the corner" in the Middle East.
Was this wishful thinking or self-fulfilling prophecy?
We will never know.
What is certain is that the vacuum left by Sharon's departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the Gaza that Israel has vacated, and the collapse of the Palestinian authority before our eyes.
Nor will the emergence of another providential figure come easily.
Not all exceptional periods create their Bonapartes, and this is probably a good thing, for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have solutions, which is far from true.
The natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress "at the margin," but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs.
Many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by a providential man, with all the hopes -- and dangers -- that this entails.
The Fall of the UN
Saddam Hussein's reign of terror is about to end.
His Ba'athist government, however, will not go alone.
In a fitting irony, the United Nations is going down with him.
Perhaps the entire UN will not disappear.
Those parts devoted to "good works" (i.e., the low-risk peacekeeping bureaucracies or those that fight AIDs and malaria or protect children) will remain.
The looming chatterbox on New York's East River will also continue to bleat.
What died with the Security Council's unwillingness to sanction force to implement its own resolutions on Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction was the decades-old fantasy of the UN as the bedrock of world order.
As we sift the debris of the war to liberate Iraq, it will be important to preserve-the better to understand-the intellectual wreckage of the liberal conceit of security through international law administered by international institutions.
As free Iraqis document the quarter-century nightmare of Saddam's rule, we must not forget who supported this war and who did not, who held that the international community's moral authority was enshrined in pleas for more time for the UN arms inspectors, and who marched against "regime change".
In the spirit of post-war reconciliation that diplomats are always keen to engender, we must not reconcile ourselves to the timid, blighted notion that world order requires us to recoil before rogue states that terrorize their citizens and menace our own.
Decent, thoughtful, high-minded, the millions who marched against holding Iraq to account were catalyzed by the idea that only the UN Security Council has the authority to legitimize the resort to force.
A voluntary coalition of liberal democracies willing to put their own soldiers in harm's way isn't good enough.
It does not seem to matter that such troops are being used to enforce the UN's own demands.
If a country or coalition of countries other than the UN Security Council uses force, even as a last resort, "anarchy", not international law, would prevail, destroying all hope of world order.
Or so the protestors believed.
But this is a dangerously wrong idea, an idea that leads inexorably to handing great moral (and even existential politico-military decisions) to the likes of Syria, Cameroon, Angola, Russia, China, and France.
If a policy is right when the Security Council approves, how can it be wrong just because communist China or Russia or France or a gaggle of minor dictatorships withhold approbation?
Those who opposed the actions of the coalition in Iraq usually fall back on the answer that "order" must have primacy over "anarchy".
But is this right?
Is the UN Security Council the institution most capable of ensuring order and saving us from anarchy?
History suggests not.
The UN arose from the ashes of a war that the League of Nations was unable to avert.
The League was simply not up to confronting Italy in Abyssinia, much less (had it survived that debacle) taking on Nazi Germany.
In the euphoric aftermath of the victory in World War Two, the hope that security could be made collective was reposed in the UN Security Council-with abject results.
During the Cold War the Security Council was hopelessly paralyzed.
Indeed, the decision to defend South Korea from attack in 1950 was taken by the Council only because Stalin ordered his diplomats to boycott UN proceedings, which meant that no Soviet ambassador was around to cast a veto.
It was a mistake the Soviets would not make again.
In both 1967 and 1973, with war looming, the UN withdrew from the Middle East, leaving Israel to defend itself.
The Soviet empire was wrestled to the ground, and Eastern Europe liberated, not by the UN but by the mother of all coalitions, NATO.
Facing Milosevic's multiple aggressions, the UN could not stop the Balkan wars or even protect its victims.
Remember Sarajevo?
Remember Srebrenica and the slaughter of thousands of Muslims under the supposed protection of the UN?
It took a coalition of the willing to save Bosnia from extinction.
When the war was over, peace was made in Dayton, Ohio, not at the UN.
The rescue of Kosovo's Muslims was not a UN action: their cause never gained Security Council approval.
This century now challenges the hopes for a new world order in new ways.
We will not defeat or even contain fanatical terror unless we can carry the war to the territories from which it is launched.
This will sometimes require that we use force against states that harbor terrorists, as we did in destroying the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
The most dangerous of these states are those that possess weapons of mass destruction, the chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons that can kill not hundreds or thousands but hundreds of thousands.
Iraq was such a state, but there are others.
Whatever hope exists that they can be persuaded to withdraw support or sanctuary from terrorists rests on the certainty and effectiveness with which they are confronted.
The chronic failure of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions (with respect to Iraq) is unmistakable: it is simply not up to the task.
So we are left with coalitions of the willing.
Far from disparaging them as a threat to a new world order, we should recognize that they are, by default, the best hope for that order, and the true alternative to the anarchy caused by the dismal failure of the United Nations.
After Neoliberalism, What?
Two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results.
Latin America, the region that tried hardest to implement the "Washington Consensus" recipes--free trade, price deregulation, and privatization--has experienced low and volatile growth, with widening inequalities.
Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, few have caught up with real output levels that prevailed before 1990.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and World Bank.
The few instances of success occurred in countries that marched to their own drummers--and that are hardly poster children for neoliberalism.
China, Vietnam, India: all three violated virtually every rule in the neoliberal guidebook, even as they moved in a more market-oriented direction.
It is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus.
But the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development, without falling into the trap of promulgating yet another impractical blueprint, supposedly right for all countries at all times.
The record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term, and an institution-building strategy designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of adverse shocks.
The key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy.
Encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work.
An effective strategy must accomplish two tasks: encourage investment in non-traditional areas, and weed out projects and investments that fail.
For this, governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick.
Learning what a country is (or can be) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development.
The carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering, for example, that cut flowers, or soccer balls, or computer software can be produced at low cost, because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs.
The entrepreneur who makes the initial "discovery" can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates, as other entrepreneurs will quickly emulate him.
Consequently, entrepreneurship of this type--learning what can be produced--will typically be under-supplied in the absence of non-market incentives.
In turn, the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in unproductive and wasteful investments.
Implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country, depending on administrative capacity, the prevailing incentive regime, the flexibility of the fiscal system, the degree of sophistication of the financial sector, and the underlying political economy.
Time-bound subsidy schemes, public venture funds, and export subsidization are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented, but there are many others.
No single instrument will work everywhere.
Governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to mess things up rather than improve allocation of resources.
The job can be done, but economic growth requires more than eliciting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship.
It also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build resilience to shocks:
Market-creating institutions (for property rights and contract enforcement);
Market-regulating institutions (for externalities, economies of scale, and information about companies);
Market-stabilizing institutions (for monetary and fiscal management);
Market-legitimizing institutions (for social protection and insurance).
Building and solidifying these institutions, however, takes time.
Using an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can pay high dividends later on.
A key point here is that institutional arrangements are, by necessity, country-specific.
Discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation.
After all, institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate.
Reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others.
Such specificity helps explain why successful countries--China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, among others--usually combined unorthodox elements with orthodox policies.
It also accounts for why important institutional differences persist among the advanced countries of North America, Western Europe, and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector, the legal system, corporate governance, financial markets, labor markets, and social insurance.
While economic analysis can help in making institutional choices, there is also a large role for public deliberation and collective choice.
In fact, we can think of participatory democracy as a meta-institution that helps select among the "menu" of possible institutional arrangements in each area.
Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies.
It is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually country-specific and do not respond well to standardized recipes.
But it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted, relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic payoffs and start a virtuous cycle of growth and institutional reform.
Adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics--far from it.
Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy.
In both cases, it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other.
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics--only its misuse.
The Other Central Europe
A specter is haunting Central Europe as its countries prepare for EU membership.
That promising development is being endangered by a fevered electoral nationalism which seeks to gain votes by promising to reopen old wounds and settle old scores.
The clearest case of this comes from Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban demanded an abrogation of President Edvard Benes' decrees of 1945 (which confiscated the assets of and stripped citizenship from the German and Hungarian populations deported from Czechoslovakia at that time) as part of a re-election campaign that failed narrowly.
But Orban is not alone in seeing electoral advantage in summoning the memories of old ghosts.
Orban argued that revoking the "Benes decrees" must be made a condition for the Czech Republic (as well as Slovakia) joining the European Union.
The ill will Orban's gambit inspired brought to a halt much of the regional cooperation of the last decade.
In its place, an ugly new form of national populism is emerging across the plain that extends between Bavaria and the Danube.
The chain reaction of reawakening nationalisms is altering the political landscape in dangerous ways.
Since the election that brought the coalition of Wolfgang Schüssel's and Jorg Haider's parties to power in Vienna, Austria's relations with the neighboring Czech Republic have deteriorated over two issues: a demand that the Czechs shutdown the Temelin nuclear power plant on the Austrian border, and revoke the Benes decrees in which Sudeten Germans were deported from Czechoslovakia and settled massively in Bavaria but also in Austria.
When the nuclear plant issue was resolved, populist pressure was forced into a single channel, the demand to abrogate the Benes decrees.
Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that he, too, could play a demagogic nationalist card.
He described the Sudeten Germans as Hitler's "Fifth Column" and suggested that Israel could solve its Palestinian problem through resort to the Czech method of 1945: deportation.
Edmund Stoiber, Bavaria's leader, the conservative CDU/CSU candidate for German chancellor against current Chancellor Schroeder, and a staunch advocate of the Sudeten Germans, demanded that Schroeder cancel a scheduled visit to Prague in response to Zeman's outburst.
To defuse an electoral fight with his rival, Schroeder agreed.
That Orban seconded Stoiber's demands came as something of a gift from god to the Slovak nationalist Vladimir Meciar in his bid to become Prime Minister once more, as it allowed him to argue that his domestic opponents were preparing to surrender to EU pressure and force Slovakia to compensate the Hungarians expelled by Benes in 1945.
So Meciar pounced, denouncing the "Hungarian menace," undoing in a stroke four years of hard work by Slovakia's current government to integrate representatives of the ethnic Hungarian minority into Slovakia's government.
Questions about postwar Europe's juridical order go beyond the former Czechoslovakia.
Erika Steinbach, President of the Association of Deportees (from the East) and a member of Stoiber's CDU, argues that the issue of the deportation of German populations is one faced by Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenes, thus taking in most of East/Central Europe.
In the 1930s, the pet hate of some Central European countries was "the Versailles Order."
Today, it appears that the Potsdam declarations of 1945, which sanctioned the mass eviction of German populations, are the new enemy.
The worry now is that such demagoguery may incite a cycle of populist victories.
That worry was dented when Viktor Orban's Fidesz party lost in Hungary's recent parliamentary elections, but other politicians happy to demagogue national resentments - Vaclav Klaus in Prague, Edmund Stoiber in Germany, Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia - still see nationalism as an electoral plus despite Orban's defeat.
Linked to EU skeptics like Italy's Berlusconi and Austria's Schüssel-Haider coalition, the very nature of European politics may turn decidedly nasty.
Since its inception, the EU has sought to reach beyond past grief and, through cooperation, to build a better future.
Today, some politicians want to capitalize on Eastern Europe's desire to be part of Europe to reopen historical issues to their political advantage.
Two savage consequences are foreseeable: first, that there is no better way to turn parts of public opinion in the candidate countries against the EU than by allowing local populists to portray the Union as an agent of spreading German power.
An extended EU should represent a means to balance the asymmetrical relationship between Eastern Europe's small countries with Germany.
There's a chance that it would be perceived as a pointer to this asymmetry.
The second worry is that, as NATO and the EU expand, these ugly debates will infect relations within these international bodies.
Fear about this may be one reason why President Bush refused to meet Prime Minister Orban recently, and there are frequent suggestions that, had Orban spoken as he now does before Hungary joined NATO, his country's application would have been rejected.
What can halt this?
After 1945, Western Europe undertook painful debates about history, and these helped bring about Franco-German reconciliation.
Notions about "collective guilt" were put aside as having no place in a united and uniting Europe.
So President Vaclav Havel courageously argued during his first trip to Germany in January 1990, but his comments were mistaken for weakness.
As EU expansion looms, Europe's mission must not become undermined by the advocates of that old and "other" Central Europe, politicians who prefer to wallow in the past rather than think in responsible ways about building a peaceful and prosperous Europe.
Consequences of the Iraq War
The Iraq war's main consequences will not be on the battlefield.
They will come later, and will depend on whether George Bush and Tony Blair can justify their onslaught on a largely defenseless population.
They launched this war for certain declared reasons, all of which were heatedly debated around the world.
If they are vindicated, then the war could conceivably bring a safer world.
If their arguments remain unproved or are disproved, then the war will incite instability.
In that case, a critical step towards healing the world would be their quick departure from office.
The Iraq War was not and could not be justified on the basis that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant.
Justification, if it exists, rests on the danger Saddam's regime posed.
Bush and Blair made four claims:
Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction;
those weapons pose a grave, immediate threat;
UN inspections were not eliminating that threat;
the threat could best be eliminated by war.
The first claim should be the easiest to verify.
Bush and Blair talked repeatedly about stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, massive underground and mobile units to produce or launch such weapons, and active programs to obtain nuclear weapons.
It is incumbent upon Bush and Blair to prove their case, and to prove it in the face of worldwide suspicion that the US and UK security agencies might plant phony evidence.
For this reason, independent UN experts should assess any evidence that is uncovered.
If no evidence of such weapons is produced, then both Bush and Blair deserve to be finished politically, no matter what else happens in Iraq.
The second claim will be trickier to prove.
Bush and Blair must show that any weapons of mass destruction that are recovered posed a grave and urgent threat.
We know that Iraq at one time possessed chemical and biological weapons, because the US sold them to Iraq.
The test is not whether traces of those weapons remain, as such traces will be found at disposal sites, but whether those weapons were poised for use in threatening amounts.
If the Iraqis launch an attack with such weapons, this would demonstrate that the weapons were ready for use.
Whether they posed any real threat outside Iraq's borders, or would have been used in the absence of the current war, must still be assessed.
The third claim is hugely contentious.
Bush and Blair should demonstrate that the UN inspection process was failing.
This can be done by showing that the Iraqis were simply hiding the evidence at sites visited by the inspectors and declared free of weapons.
There should be a systematic review of sites that were visited.
There should also be an explanation, if weapons of mass destruction are uncovered at other sites, as to why the inspectors could not have found such weapons in a realistic period of time.
The fourth claim will be subject to wild propaganda on both sides.
Was the war justified in terms of costs and benefits, and was war really the last resort?
This will depend on an objective assessment of the costs of the war in terms of loss of life, destruction of property, economic impact within Iraq, spillovers into other forms of violence such as terrorism, and geopolitical consequences.
To date, Bush and Blair have failed to make the case to the world, with the partial exception of their own countries.
The American people have been treated to a spectacle of jingoism, fear mongering, confusion of Iraq with Osama bin Laden's terrorists, and simple patriotism.
None of this swayed the rest of the world, which views the war with disdain and alarm.
This would change if evidence on the four points is mustered.
When the 13 British colonies in North America launched their own War of Independence, Thomas Jefferson understood that "the decent respect to the opinions of mankind" required an explanation for that war, which he set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
Such an explanation, backed by rigorous evidence, is no less necessary today.
If the arguments for war are not proved, the consequences will be profound.
Propaganda, streets lined with cheering Iraqis, amazement over the prowess of US smart bombs, would not distract us from an awful truth-that Bush and Blair shattered world peace, engaged in massive premeditated killing, and did so against overwhelming global opinion.
Healing today's divided world could start only with fresh political leadership in both the US and UK, and a strong assertion of UN authority.
Given the terrible costs, I hope that this war will prove justified, though I have my doubts based on the current evidence.
If compelling evidence proves that weapons of mass destruction were at hand; that they were poised for use on a threatening scale; that the UN inspectors had poor prospects of uncovering and dismantling those weapons, then we must acknowledge the arguments made by Bush and Blair.
Even in those circumstances, war might well have been unwise compared to a policy of containment.
Still, the war would then at least make some sense.
The horrors of a senseless war are almost too frightening to contemplate.
Remembering and Forgetting Zhao Ziyang
So, at last former Chinese Premier and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang has died.
But the political agenda that he espoused while in office passed away long ago, on May 19, 1989, when he appeared in Tiananmen Square just before dawn to beg tearfully for the forgiveness of protesters.
"I am very sorry," he said to startled onlookers.
"I have come too late."
After that, he existed more as an historical chimera than as a real person.
When his bizarre and unscheduled appearance in the square was broadcast on Central Chinese Television the next morning -- during one of the last days of uncensored media coverage -- people across China were stunned by this fleeting moment of all-too-human, official anguish.
After all, Party leaders rarely evince their personal feelings in public, much less transgress the Party line as brazenly as Zhao did.
Such individualism fit neither Leninist nor traditional Chinese proscriptions for behavior by a high official.
As the crackdown following those heady weeks of free expression and assembly came to its apocalyptic end on the night of June 3-4, Zhao vanished, sucked down the Party's memory hole into which so many other leaders have vanished since China's "socialist liberation."
To the discredit of the democratic world, hardly any head of state remonstrated on Zhao's behalf, minimally demanding that some accounting be made for his illegal and immoral incarceration.
Instead, Zhao was allowed to remain in suspended animation, under house arrest, conveniently forgotten like some cryogenically frozen celebrity with no hope of resurrection.
Zhao was not killed, but allowed to live in an old Beijing courtyard house with his family.
He was let out from time to time, but under guard like a zoo animal, to go to some spa or to play solitary holes of golf, one of the many manifestations of "bourgeois liberalization" that his reform efforts allowed to leak through China's once hermetic seal.
Chinese have long since used the deaths of defrocked leaders as occasions to let out sentiments that can find no expression through the normal political process.
During the winter of 1976, when Premier Zhou Enlai (viewed as a relative liberal in the Maoist hierarchy) died, tens of thousands of people spontaneously flooded Tiananmen Square, giving the Party a tremendous fright.
It was, of course, the death of former Party chief Hu Yaobang, a liberal like Zhao, which set off the protests in 1989.
Whether Zhao's supporters will express themselves in a similar fashion is uncertain.
The events of 1989 remain so sensitive, and Tiananmen Square so securely guarded, that it is hard to imagine a protest happening there soon.
At the same time, China seems so drugged on business nowadays that it is hard to imagine many people marching for a cause that would do nothing for their bottom line.
It's almost as if the Communist Party had turned Marx on his head, replacing religion with profit as the new "opium of the masses."
Few outside of the lumpen classes of unemployed workers and dispossessed peasants seem to have any gusto for political protest.
By contrast, Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history when to be a reformer meant to take on not only the economy, but every aspect of life.
Before becoming Premier and Party chief, he experimented with everything from the de-collectivization of agriculture and separation of the Party from business to laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness toward the outside world for ordinary people.
He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than a Mao habit when traveling abroad, as well as the first to hold an open press conference.
Although Zhao was no visionary, no Vaclav Havel or Lech Walesa, and not even anti-communist, his agenda in the mid-1980's embraced the economy, politics, culture, media, and society, and it led to one of the most open and intellectually rich periods of Chinese history.
It was a tragic paradox that the political movement that so peacefully swept China in 1989 ended up arresting the process of broad-based, evolutionary reform to which Zhao consecrated his life.
So chastened by the trauma of June 4 was the Party leadership that, for several years afterwards, it was unclear if any reform would survive.
Then, in 1992, Deng Xiaoping set in motion one of the most rapid and total marketizations of a society in history, catalyzing China's spectacular rise as an economic superpower.
Zhao Ziyang's death reminds us not only of how unjustly he was treated, but of how lopsided China's reforms have been.
For China's "miracle" to truly become miraculous, Party leaders could do worse than study the record of a man whose legacy they now seem eager to push into oblivion.
The Real Risks of Deficits
Deficits are back--with a vengeance.
America's government budget deficit now stands at $455 billion, 4.1% of GDP.
Two years ago, the US predicted budget surpluses as far as the eye could see.
Although marginally less bloated than the US deficit, other rich countries are drowning in red ink.
The European Commission predicts that the French government deficit will reach 3.7% of GDP this year, with Germany's widening to 3.4%--both figures well beyond the deficit cap (3% of GDP) set by the Euro-zone's Stability and Growth Pact.
By running a deficit, a country increases its national debt and imposes burdens on future generations.
Politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is shifted between generations.
Their priority is paying for immediate problems, and for today's promised benefits.
The accountants who compute government deficits try to keep politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding something of the future cost.
But what these accountants do not provide is a way to judge when deficits are justifiable and when they are not.
Deficits raise not only immediate political issues, but also issues of distributive justice between generations, and of intergenerational risk sharing.
No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation.
Whether or not deficits treat future generations properly depends on how a government's systems for taxation and expenditure are designed.
Those who advocate running deficits often portray them as necessary to fix an economy in which confidence is draining away.
Following Keynes, they argue that running deficits will restore confidence before a recession or depression can take hold.
It is like putting a patient on Prozac before he becomes suicidal.
But such arguments, although valid at times, have their limits.
Japan's public deficits spawned a national debt of 140% of annual GDP, without producing any economic resurgence.
Indeed, today's budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not what Keynesian theory envisions.
So discussions about deficits should be recast in terms of the really long-term intergenerational issues that matter.
The issues are subtle, because they hinge on what future governments may do.
In the past, some governments, when faced with large national debts, effectively ``inflated them away.''
They thus shifted the debt burden away from the next generation and onto investors who did not bail out of the bond market at the first sign of rising prices, or who postponed buying a house when inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage debt.
Governments could decide to act this way again, especially if national debts grow bigger.
A resurgence of substantial inflation may seem unthinkable in today's environment, but remember that even a relatively modest 6% annual inflation rate cuts the real value of a nation's debt in half in just 11 years.
Continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed.
Some future politicians may succeed again in planting the idea that inflation, being stimulative, is good for the economy.
But in addition to today's officially measured government deficits, there are also other looming obligations caused by a demographic change (declining birth rates) and the prospect of huge social-welfare payments in the future.
The scale of these obligations is monumental.
In their 2003 report, the Trustees of the US Social Security Administration Trust Funds estimate that maintaining the Social Security System's solvency for the next 75 years will require an amount whose present value is $3.5 trillion, nearly equal to today's total US government debt ($3.9 trillion).
The Trustees of the US Medicare Trust Funds (providing medical services to the retired) estimate that their unfunded obligations have a present value of $5.9 trillion--50% larger than America's official publicly-held national debt.
The potential for budgetary shortfall with social security and health care is even worse in Europe and Japan, due to their more troublesome demographics.
Moreover, unlike official national debt, social-welfare obligations are not fixed in currency.
Instead, they are promises of a certain standard of living (including the value of medical services), corrected for inflation.
No government can thus ``inflate them away.''
But this does not mean that pensions and other welfare obligations are entirely fixed.
What it does mean is that the problem is political.
Pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy, and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental an issue.
Still, we need to face squarely the intergenerational issues at the core of today's economic dilemmas.
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a ``generational accounting'' that assures that economic risk is spread systematically across generations.
What this means is that pension and tax institutions must be designed to take better account of the changing circumstances facing different generations, rather than make fixed promises--which most likely cannot be kept, anyway--of a certain payout in the future.
For example, when demographic trends or persistent economic hardships impose undue social-welfare burdens on working people, benefits to pensioners should be automatically modified by raising the retirement age and/or adjusting benefits.
Such adjustments will probably happen anyway in the coming decades, but only after a long lag and with many inequities in the process.
What we need is the right system from the beginning, so that we can rationally manage risks that span several generations.
Can these issues be addressed now, when the economic slowdown in most advanced countries makes most politicians focus on short-term fixes?
Hard times, like the Great Depression, have been occasions for fundamental changes.
With proper leadership (which unfortunately seems in short supply), today's milder hardships could provide an opportunity for public discussion of better ways of intergenerational risk sharing.
Just Say No to Bush
For three years, America's president has pursued a unilateralist agenda, ignoring all evidence that contradicts his positions, and putting aside basic and longstanding American principles.
Take global warming.
Here Bush is conspicuously absent without leave (AWOL in military jargon).
Time and again, he questions the scientific evidence.
(Of course, Bush's academic credentials were never very impressive.)
Bush's position is more than wrong; it is an embarrassment.
Indeed, when asked by Bush to look into the matter, America's National Academy of Sciences came to a resounding verdict (the only one they could honestly reach) that greenhouse gases are a menace.
But America's automakers love their gas-guzzlers, and Bush's oil industry pals want no interference with their destruction of the planet's atmosphere.
So no change in policy.
In Iraq, Bush again pursued a unilateralist agenda, saying that there was incontrovertible evidence of a link with Al Queda, and that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.
Even before the invasion, there was overwhelming evidence that Bush was lying.
Detection technology made it clear that Iraq did not have nuclear weapons, as chief UN inspector Hans Blix pointed out.
It's possible that Bush read those reports, but that they were beyond his comprehension.
It is also possible that he did not believe what he read.
Whatever the case, American policy was not based on evidence.
Since the Cold War's end, America is the world's sole superpower.
Yet it has failed to exercise the kind of leadership needed to create a new world order based on principles like fairness.
Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this; but they don't vote in American elections.
Even so, the rest of the world is not powerless.

America has not won the hearts and minds of those in Iraq; indeed, it has lost them, just as it has lost the hearts and minds of much of the world.
The US wants to retain control of the occupation, but it wants others to receive the bullets now mowing down American soldiers.
UN soldiers should not bear the consequence of America's failure to manage the occupation, so US cries for financial help should fall on deaf ears.
What sympathy does the US agenda deserve, when President Bush has ladled out tax cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest people in the world.
It was not long ago that a Republican Congress held up $1 billion of UN dues, and threatened that it would only pay what it owed if the UN satisfied a raft of conditions.
America's unwillingness to provide small sums to wage peace contrasts sharply with the huge amounts Congress quickly granted to wage war.
Advocates of a softer approach say that if the UN stays on the sidelines, it will become irrelevant; by participating in Iraq, it will build trust with America, so that the next time a dispute such as this arises, America will turn earlier to the UN.
Nonsense.
Those in the White House today believe in
I normally write about economics, not politics.
But in the new world of globalization, there is greater economic interdependence, which requires more collective action, rules and institutions, and an international rule of law.
Economic globalization has, however, outpaced political globalization; the processes for decision making are far from democratic, or even transparent.
In no small measure, the failures of globalization can be traced to the same mindset that led to the failures in Iraq: multilateral institutions must serve not just one country's interest, but all countries'.
At the recent World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Cancun, the developing countries put America--and Europe--on notice that this system can no longer continue.
In that case, Europe was as much the culprit as America.
Europe has no trouble seeing the dangers of unilateralism in America's actions, in everything from abandoning Kyoto to its refusal to join the International Criminal Court.
But Europe should also reflect on its own practices, including trade policy, where the EU works systematically to unbalance the global trade regime against developing countries, despite promising that those imbalances would be corrected in the current round of trade negotiations.
Here, Europe acts like America, which has long talked the rhetoric of free trade, while its actions have long ignored the principles.
Forget about America's rhetoric of upholding fairness and justice; in trade negotiations, the US ignores the pleas of the poorest countries of the world to eliminate the cotton subsidies that have had so devastating an effect on them.
If we are to make the world politically more secure and economically more stable and prosperous, political globalization will have to catch up with economic globalization.
Principles of democracy, social justice, social solidarity, and the rule of law need to be extended beyond national boundaries.
Europe and the rest of the world will have to do their part--abiding by these principles themselves, and giving each other, and America, a shove in the right direction.
Right now, this entails `Just Saying No' to President Bush.
The True Costs of the Iraq War
The most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless.
But that doesn't mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), like defense, should not be subjected to cool, hard economic analysis.
Shortly before the current Iraq war, when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $100 and $200 billion, other officials quickly demurred.
For example, Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels put the number at $60 billion.
It now appears that Lindsey's numbers were a gross underestimate.
Concerned that the Bush administration might be misleading everyone about the Iraq war's costs, just as it had about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connection with Al Qaida, I teamed up with Linda Bilmes, a budget expert at Harvard, to examine the issue.
Even we, as opponents of the war, were staggered by what we found, with conservative to moderate estimates ranging from slightly less than a trillion dollars to more than $2 trillion.
Our analysis starts with the $500 billion that the Congressional Budget Office openly talks about, which is still ten times higher than what the administration said the war would cost.
Its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government.
And the budgetary costs are but a fraction of the costs to the economy as a whole.
For example, the Bush administration has been doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely wounded -- 16,000 so far, including roughly 20% with serious brain and head injuries.
So it is no surprise that its figure of $500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come.
Nor does the administration want to face up to the military's recruiting and retention problems.
The result is large re-enlistment bonuses, improved benefits, and higher recruiting costs -- up 20% just from 2003 to 2005.
Moreover, the war is extremely wearing on equipment, some of which will have to be replaced.
These budgetary costs (exclusive of interest) amount to $652 billion in our conservative estimate and $799 billion in our moderate estimate.
Arguably, since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes, the expenditures have been debt financed, and the interest costs on this debt add another $98 billion (conservative) to $385 billion (moderate) to the budgetary costs.
Of course, the brunt of the costs of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families.
But the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings.
Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million).
But the costs don't stop there.
The Bush administration once claimed that the Iraq war would be good for the economy, with one spokesperson even suggesting that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices.
As in so many other ways, things have turned out differently: the oil companies are the big winners, while the American and global economies are losers.
Being extremely conservative, we estimate the overall effect on the economy if only $5 or $10 of the increase is attributed to the war.
At the same time, money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere.
We estimate that if a proportion of that money had been allocated to domestic investment in roads, schools, and research, the American economy would have been stimulated more in the short run, and its growth would have been enhanced in the long run.
There are a number of other costs, some potentially quite large, although quantifying them is problematic.
For instance, Americans pay some $300 billion annually for the "option value" of military preparedness -- being able to fight wherever needed.
That Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs.
But there is little doubt that the option value has been greatly impaired and will likely remain so for several years.
In short, even our "moderate" estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America's involvement in Iraq.
And our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself.
We do not attempt to explain whether the American people were deliberately misled regarding the war's costs, or whether the Bush administration's gross underestimate should be attributed to incompetence, as it vehemently argues is true in the case of weapons of mass destruction.
Nor do we attempt to assess whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging the war.
Recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs.
Certainly, when a war's timing is a matter of choice, as in this case, inadequate preparation is even less justifiable.
But such considerations appear to be beyond the Bush administration's reckoning.
Elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and elsewhere in government for almost a half-century.
The Iraq war was an immense "project," yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was greatly flawed and that of its costs virtually absent.
One cannot help but wonder: were there alternative ways of spending a fraction of the war's $1-$2 trillion in costs that would have better strengthened security, boosted prosperity, and promoted democracy?
Is Freedom Enough?
Do democracies need values?
The question seems absurd in the light of photographs of American soldiers torturing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners.
But the fact is that the advance of democracy historically entailed the erosion of shared values and the rise of individual autonomy.
It presupposed moral agnosticism and a plurality of meanings, none of which are sacred or compulsory to all.
Democracy does nurture some common values, but they are overwhelmingly liberal values - in other words, individual rights trump collective obligations.
For contemporary democrats, the fullest possible respect for the autonomous individual is, as Thomas Jefferson put it, "self-evident."
But are civil, political, and human rights enough to ensure the strength and survival of democracies?
Are today's democracies virtuous enough to rally the energies - including self-sacrifice - needed to defeat their enemies?
Such questions were never so urgent in the past, partly because fundamental democratic values were less abstract than they seem nowadays.
Such values animated the fight against Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism, fascism, and military dictatorship; in their name, decolonization was achieved, and minorities gained equality and dignity.
Democracy's values may be one-sided on behalf of individual rights, but this has also made them universal, legitimizing the struggle against oppression, wherever it is played out.
But in the world's most advanced countries, the promise of material prosperity that freedom made possible has long since replaced attention to and defense of fundamental democratic values as the cement of society.
Western citizens do not rush to emulate the freedom fighters who built their world, despite celebrations, memorials, and the persistence of oppression.
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States allegedly changed everything - not only international relations, but the balance between rights and obligations that we long took for granted.
In fact, the attacks, while surprising in their method, symbolic character, and scope, changed nothing.
By themselves, they merely revealed the urgency of a fundamental reappraisal that has long been necessary.
What is the Western model of democratic development really worth?
Some non-democratic systems seem to evoke deeper support, because they are based on religious or national communal solidarity, and because closed societies minimize doubt, drift, and criticism.
Beyond fundamental freedoms and economic prosperity, do we have a specific civilization to defend?
Ours is a civilization that accepts selfishness towards one's own family and group; that tolerates, with few exceptions, autonomy in moral matters; and that considers blasphemy, criticism of authority, and even civil disobedience fundamental freedoms.
Our civilization, despite its drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, incivility, and vandalism, will always be better than rule by Mullahs or soldiers, because its social problems can be allayed, if never entirely eliminated, without changing the foundations of the regime.
This is not true of totalitarian or fundamentalist regimes, because, to foster free societies, they must be deposed.
But if our civilization is worth defending, why is it that fundamentalists, of whatever stripe, have the most committed fighters on their side?
Can we oppose them with anything but individual rights?
Two opposite temptations must be resisted.
The first temptation, characteristic of frightened societies, is a rush to embrace so-called "traditional" values, with their implications of withdrawal, closure, intolerance, and even hatred.
The second temptation is a purely military policy that fixates on physical strength without considering how to project greater credibility and fairness.
Of course, when enemies are already attacking, one cannot afford to ask too many questions.
But when enemies are merely threatening, it is better first to assert legitimacy, and thus acquire some credibility at home and abroad.
To do so, there cannot be too wide a gap between our stated principles and our actual behavior.
Nor can we claim, as we used to, that our values spring from God, nature, reason, or historical laws.
Our values reflect the democratic debate itself, nothing more, and our defense of them must address three related fields.
First, we must update our social contract.
France's ongoing public debate about secularism and legislation is an important effort in this direction, even if the debate could be better organized to demonstrate the link between principles, social and anthropological facts, and public policy.
Such a debate should also involve education - its rules, objectives, and contents.
In many countries, however, political parties find it difficult even to contemplate such debates.
The second axis of values concerns social justice and the environment.
Issues linked to inequality, the distribution of wealth, and our exploitation of the natural world will become increasingly salient.
This debate has not happened in the US, despite vague attempts at the beginning of the first Clinton administration; it has barely begun with Tony Blair's "Third Way" in the UK, or with Gerhard Schröder's variant in Germany.
In France, the debate has stalled altogether due to bitter distributive conflicts, deep division within the Left, and the Right's absence of an economic and social vision.
What remains are the values linked to the global order, defense of which requires leading by example, not by narrow, legalistic initiatives aimed at crisis management or conflict resolution.
This approach too often sacrifices long-term essential objectives to short-term concerns.
The fight for democracy cannot be selective.
A desirable vision for the future of humanity must appeal to universally shared conceptions of justice and equity.
We must all become freedom fighters.
Elections Are Venezuela's Last Chance
Venezuela is mired in a dangerous stalemate.
President Hugo Chávez clings to power despite the obvious failings of his government: severe economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization.
The opposition, tainted by their botched coup of April 2002, now seeks to force Chávez from office through a costly general strike.
Both sides justify their intransigence with one-sided interpretations.
His sympathizers glorify Chávez as a defender of the poor besieged by a selfish, coup-plotting elite.
His fiercest opponents demonize Chávez as an autocrat pursuing a Cuban-style revolution and destroying democracy.
Both interpretations are flawed.
The Chávez government has not helped Venezuela's poor in any significant way.
On the contrary, his belligerent rhetoric and inept governance scared off investors, inciting economic decline and boosting unemployment and poverty.
Now Chávez lacks majority backing even among the poor.
The opposition comprises most of Venezuela's organized civil society, not only business, but also trade unions, professional associations, and NGOs.
So Venezuela's polarization does not pit "the poor" against "the oligarchy," but a populist against civil society.
The opposition's view--shared by rightists in the Bush administration--is equally unconvincing.
Rather than initiating a revolution, Chávez merely spouts fiery rhetoric.
While his democratic credentials are dubious, he has not
But Chávez's insistence on the inviolability of the current constitution is hypocritical.
Four years ago, Chávez deviated from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to engineer a new one, tailor-made for him.
Now he invokes that charter to block calls for a plebiscite on his continuation in office.
The paradox here is that Chávez's earlier example may provide the solution to today's standoff.
As Chávez used para-constitutional means to advance a desire for change in 1999, so the international community should not be confined by the present constitution in pressing to resolve a crisis that is ruining the country.
In fact, the Latin American members of the "group of friendly nations" trying to mediate this conflict can draw on interesting experiences to design such a solution.
After all, confrontations like this are not unusual in Latin America's rigid presidential systems.
When chief executives with fixed terms of office lose political support, they cannot be removed through a no-confidence vote, as in parliamentary systems.
Presidential systems therefore risk lengthy stand-offs that threaten democracy--as in Venezuela today.
But over the last decade, Latin American politicians have made presidential systems more flexible by finding innovative ways to remove unpopular presidents.
One of Chávez's discredited predecessors was impeached on flimsy charges of malfeasance; Ecuador's Congress declared a disastrous chief executive "mentally incompetent"; in Peru, an autocratic president, after months of domestic and international pressure, was forced into exile.
While politicians interpreted the law with a good deal of creativity in these instances, they usually did so to ensure the survival of fragile democracies facing a crisis.
As long as these maneuvers do not proliferate and turn into easy ammunition for the opposition of the moment, they may provide a safety valve for presidential systems.
International monitoring can also safeguard against frivolous use of such mechanisms.
It is to be hoped that the group of friendly nations can help design an innovative solution to Venezuela's standoff.
To be acceptable to both sides, such a solution must deviate from the favorite proposals of each.
The opposition prefers an "up-or-down" vote on Chávez's continuation in office, which it would most likely win--and which Chávez will never accept.
Chávez insists on the recall referendum mechanism included in his constitution, which the opposition cannot tolerate: removing the president in this way would require a larger absolute number of votes than Chávez garnered in the last election.
But rising abstention makes this virtually impossible.
Both proposals are thus politically unfeasible.
Only a democratic mechanism for conflict resolution that has an uncertain outcome has any chance of being adopted.
That mechanism is an election, to be held as soon as possible (realistically, by this summer).
Both sides will have to work hard if they want to win.
The fractious opposition will need to go beyond rejection of Chávez, elaborate a program for the country's reconstruction, and unite behind an attractive candidate.
President Chávez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his "Bolivarian Revolution."
Since Chávez is a skilled campaigner and the opposition so far lacks unity, he will have a realistic chance of winning--which should make a new contest acceptable to him.
Pressure from the group of friendly nations may induce both sides to accept this last chance to avoid a political and economic meltdown.
Elections can be made legitimate through a constitutional amendment shortening the presidential term, as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent mediation effort.
Since this is designed to defuse an exceptional crisis, it would not become a precedent that encourages frivolous attacks on Latin America's democratically elected governments.
An election now in Venezuela will save, not undermine, democracy.
Syria's Dangerous Liaisons
All eyes turned to Syria following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Opposition groups in Lebanon, as well as Hariri supporters, openly accused Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime of being responsible for the killing.
The Bush administration, while not formally blaming Syria, virtually did so and recalled its ambassador to Damascus.
The US is said to be extremely angry at Syria's refusal to withdraw its forces from Lebanon in line with a United Nations resolution.
Growing opposition to Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is but one of four related problems Syria faces, all of which it has addressed inadequately.
The other three are Syria's behavior in Iraq, its relations with the US, and the need for domestic reform.
While corrosive immobility is a trademark of the Syrian regime, these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria internationally even more so than today.
In Lebanon, the Syrians have repeatedly misread the Bush administration's intentions.
Last September, the US, together with France, sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding a Syrian pullout and the disarming of militias -- mainly Hezbollah.
This came after Assad last September imposed an unconstitutional extension of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud's mandate, despite French and American warnings.
Yet to this day, Syrian officials privately say that they don't think the US is serious about a withdrawal.
Syria's leaders also continue to dismiss demands from within Lebanon for an end to Syria's 28-year military presence.
Such demands escalated dramatically after Hariri's death, as tens of thousands of the former prime minister's partisans, who previously sat on the fence when it came to Syria, shouted "Syria out."
Indeed, a broad multi-communal opposition front has formed in Beirut to demand Syria's departure.
Yet rather than address the front's demands and shape a healthy bilateral relationship between equal countries, Syria has sought to divide the opposition and reassert control.
Hariri's assassination makes that far more difficult, and Syria must prepare for a strong backlash from the US and France.
In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003, Damascus has shown undue nostalgia for the old system.
Though the Syrian and Iraqi Baath parties were bitter foes, there was consolation in that both were members of a confederacy of despotisms.
For the Syrians, a democratic Iraq friendly to the US was always far worse than Saddam Hussein, the enemy they knew -- and later profitably traded with -- during the years of international sanctions against Iraq.
Syria's suspected support for Iraqi Baathist exiles threatens to damage relations with the new Iraq.
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the Assad regime of allowing Iraqi funds to be channeled to insurgents, and recently notified the Syrians that the photograph of a senior Syrian intelligence official taken with an Islamist combatant was found on the latter's body in Falluja.
As a legitimate Iraqi authority emerges following the elections, the Syrians will have to show foresight in jettisoning their pro-Saddam acquaintances.
The Bush administration's growing impatience with Syrian involvement in the Iraqi insurgency is a major reason for Syria's deteriorating relationship with the US.
Indeed, there is palpable disdain for Syria in Washington.
That is why Syria's denials that it is playing a spoiler role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously, and why Assad has not gained American support for renewed negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights.
There are signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues as well.
For example, Assad apparently still does not realize how much the Bush administration associates his regime with terrorism.
Syrian officials believe that because the Baath Party is secular, the US will invariably support it against an Islamist resurgence.
They fail to see that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq, and Lebanon.
At home, Assad's regime also finds itself in a bind.
Political and economic reform, when it advances, does so at a glacial pace.
A major item of discussion in Syria is the revival of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system offering few incentives except to regime grandees.
France's opposition to Syria's presence in Lebanon was at least partly a reflection of disenchantment with Assad's reformist ambitions, and the European Union has expressed similar reservations.
Assad is now in a consolidation phase, leaving little room for reform.
Indeed, his new interior minister, Ghazi Kanaan, an old-school hardliner, spearheaded a crackdown on reformers and Kurds in the past year or so.
The reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad's preferences.
In the coming month, several rounds of retirements should allow the president to place more of his people in positions of power.
Consolidation, however, is not reform.
Assad must show that his enhanced authority can lead to genuine transformation.
Until now, the president has toed a hard line on Iraq, on Lebanon, and in domestic affairs.
If he's a reformer, few are convinced.
Syria may pay a heavy price for that ambiguity.
