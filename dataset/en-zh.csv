"With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. ",所有對於愛滋病同禽流感嘅擔心 都係好合理嘅 而我哋稍後亦會從 Brilliant 醫生 聽到有關嘅嘢 不過，而家我想講嘅係另一啲流行病 就係心血管疾病、糖尿病同高血壓 而且對於 95% 以上嘅患者嚟講 只要改變飲食習慣同生活作息 呢啲病完全係可以預防嘅 
"And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us. And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. ",但現正發生嘅事就係慢性病開始全球化 其他國家嘅人嘅飲食同生活方式 甚至死亡方式 都開始同我哋相似 例如短短一代人嘅時間 亞洲已經由其中一個心臟病、肥胖 同糖尿病發病率極低嘅地區 變成發病率極高嘅地區 喺非洲，患心血管疾病嘅人數 等同於喺大多數國家 死於愛滋病嘅人數 
"So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people, and practice preventive medicine on a global scale. ",所以呢個係一個關鍵時刻 我哋必須做一個重要嘅改變 去影響幾百萬人嘅生命 同埋喺全球實施預防性醫學 
"Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country, but also worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. ",心血管疾病導致嘅死亡人數 比其他疾病加起嚟仲要高 呢樣嘢唔單止喺我哋嘅國家 全世界亦一樣 不過對絕大多數人嚟講 
"It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans. ",心血管疾病係完全可以避免嘅 甚至可以醫好 喺過去接近二十九年 我哋以一啲高科技、昂貴 先進嘅方法證明咗 透過改變飲食同生活作息 呢啲非常簡單、原始、低成本嘅 治療方法有幾大嘅威力 例如對比一年前同一年後嘅 定量動脈造影術 同埋心臟正子掃描 
"We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group. ",幾個月前，我們發表第一份研究 指出只需透過改變飲食同生活習慣 你就能夠停止或者逆轉前列腺癌擴散 令到 70% 嘅癌細胞縮小 或者停止生長 相對之下，對照組只有 9% 
"And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year. ",喺呢啲磁力共振造影同埋光譜分析裏邊 紅色係前列腺癌細胞活動 可以見到佢喺一年後減少咗 
"Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years, and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's preventable. ",現時癡肥非常流行 影響到三份之二嘅成人同 15% 嘅兒童 特別令我擔心嘅係 過往十年糖尿病人數已經上升咗 70% 我哋可能係第一個代人 見到細路短命過我哋 咁係好可悲 而且呢個情況其實係可以避免 
"Now these are not election returns, these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're kind of devolving. (Laughter) Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. ",呢啲並唔係選舉結果 而係各州肥胖人口統計 由 85、86、87 年起計 呢啲資料取自美國疾病管制 暨預防中心網站—— 88、89、90、91 年 一個新嘅分類 —— 92、93、94、95、96 年 97、98、99、2000、2001 ——越嚟越差 我哋一直喺度退化（笑聲） 而家我哋可以為到呢樣做啲乜呢？ 我哋發現亞洲嘅飲食習慣 可以預防心臟病同癌症 
"But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are, which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. ",但亞洲人都開始食得好似我哋咁 因此佢哋都開始病到好似我哋咁 
"So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods, like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's, and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good business. ",我一直有同好多大型飲食公司合作 佢哋可以令食用健康食品變得 樂趣、吸引、流行、有口感又方便 例如，我擔任麥當勞、百事可樂 康尼格拉食品、Safeway 嘅 諮詢董事會嘅主席 嚟緊仲會做埋台爾蒙食品 諮詢董事會主席 佢哋發現健康食品市場充滿商機 
"The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. ",你喺麥當勞見到嘅沙律 就係我哋嘅成果 佢哋將會有亞洲款式嘅沙律 喺百事可樂公司 三分二嘅營業增長 嚟自佢哋改良咗嘅食品 
"And so if we can do that, then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you. ",所以如果我哋可以咁做 我哋就可以慳返好多資源 去買我哋真正需要嘅藥物 去治療愛滋病、瘧疾，或者禽流感 多謝各位！

"On a warm August morning in Harare, Farai, a 24-year-old mother of two, walks towards a park bench. ",喺八月嘅一個上晝 喺津巴布韋首都哈拉雷 有個叫法拉嘅女人 佢廿四歲，有兩個仔女 行去公園嘅一張長櫈度 
She looks miserable and dejected. ,佢望落去好鬱悶、好沮喪 
"Now, on the park bench sits an 82-year-old woman, better known to the community as Grandmother Jack. ",嗰張公園長凳已經 有個八十二歲嘅婆婆坐喺度 人人都叫佢做 Jack 婆婆 
Farai hands Grandmother Jack an envelope from the clinic nurse. ,法拉遞畀 Jack 婆婆 一封診所護士畀佢嘅介紹信 
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down as she opens the envelope and reads. ,Jack 婆婆請佢坐低 然後打開個信封讀 
There's silence for three minutes or so as she reads. ,婆婆睇信嘅三分鐘裡邊，冇人講嘢 
"And after a long pause, Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath, looks at Farai and says, ""I'm here for you. ",隔咗一陣，Jack婆婆深呼吸 佢望住法拉講： 「我係來幫你嘅， 
"Would you like to share your story with me?"" ",你可唔可以講下你嘅事啊？」 
"Farai begins, her eyes swelling with tears. ",法拉眼濕濕 
"She says, ""Grandmother Jack, I'm HIV-positive. ",佢話:「 Jack 婆婆啊， 我有愛滋病已經四年。 
My husband left me a year ago. ,老公一年前走咗佬。 
I have two kids under the age of five. ,我有兩個仔女， 佢哋都未到五歲。 
I'm unemployed. ,我失業， 
"I can hardly take care of my children."" ",我根本照顧唔嚟我啲仔女。 」 
Tears are now flowing down her face. ,佢淚流滿面 
"And in response, Grandmother Jack moves closer, puts her hand on Farai, and says, ""Farai, it's OK to cry. ",見到咁，Jack 婆婆坐埋過去 輕輕攬住法拉 話：「法拉，你可以喊㗎。 
You've been through a lot. ,你經歷咗好多事， 
"Would you like to share more with me?"" ",可唔可以再講多啲畀我聽？」 
And Farai continues. ,法拉繼續講： 
"In the last three weeks, I have had recurrent thoughts of killing myself, taking my two children with me. 
I can't take it anymore. 
The clinic nurse sent me to see you. ",「喺過去嘅三個禮拜， 我成日喺度諗自殺， 仲想帶埋啲仔女走。 
"There's an exchange between the two, which lasts about 30 minutes. ",我頂唔順喇， 
"And finally, Grandmother Jack says, ""Farai, it seems to me that you have all the symptoms of kufungisisa."" ",所以護士叫我嚟揾你 。」 
"The word ""kufungisisa"" opens up a floodgate of tears. ",佢哋兩個傾咗大概半個鐘 
"So, kufungisisa is the local equivalent of depression in my country. ",最尾，Jack 婆婆話： 「法拉， 睇嚟『Kufungisisa』 嘅病徵你都有曬。」 
"It literally means ""thinking too much."" ",聽到呢個字，法拉又即刻喊番 
"The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people globally, today, suffer from depression, or what in my country we call kufungisisa. ",「Kufungisisa」 係當地話「抑鬱症」嘅意思 
"And the World Health Organization also tells us that every 40 seconds, someone somewhere in the world commits suicide because they are unhappy, largely due to depression or kufungisisa. ",直譯就係「諗太多」 
And most of these deaths are occurring in low- and middle-income countries. ,世界衛生組織統計 依家全世界有多過三億人有抑鬱症 即係我個國家叫嘅 「Kufungisisa」 
"In fact, the World Health Organization goes as far as to say that when you look at the age group between 15 to 29, a leading cause of death now is actually suicide. ",世界衛生組織又話 全世界每四十秒 就有一個人因為 抑鬱症，或者「Kufungisisa」 而自殺 
"But there are wider events that lead to depression and in some cases, suicide, such as abuse, conflict, violence, isolation, loneliness -- the list is endless. ",呢啲自殺個案 多數出現喺中、低收入國家 
But one thing that we do know is that depression can be treated and suicides averted. ,事實上 世界衛生組織仲話 十五到二十九歲嘅年齡層 佢哋主要嘅死因係自殺 
But the problem is we just don't have enough psychiatrists or psychologists in the world to do the job. ,但係，導致抑鬱症 甚至自殺嘅原因有好多 例如虐待 衝突、暴力 隔離、孤獨等等 
"In most low- and middle-income countries, for instance, the ratio of psychiatrists to the population is something like one for every one and a half million people, which literally means that 90 percent of the people needing mental health services will not get it. ",不過，我哋知道 抑鬱症有得醫，自殺可以避免 
"In my country, there are 12 psychiatrists, and I'm one of them, for a population of approximately 14 million. ",問題係 全世界冇咁多 精神科醫生或者心理學家 來睇所有嘅病人 
"Now, let me just put that into context. ",譬如，喺中、低收入國家 精神科醫生對人口嘅比例 大概係一對一百五十萬 即係話，九成需要心理服務嘅人 都得唔到幫助 
"One evening while I was at home, I get a call from the ER, or the emergency room, from a city which is some 200 kilometers away from where I live. ",我哋成個國家 只有十二個精神科醫生 而我係其中嘅一個 我哋國家人口有一千四百萬 
"And the ER doctor says, ""One of your patients, someone you treated four months ago, has just taken an overdose, and they are in the ER department. ",我再畀多啲實際故事 
"Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK, but they will need neuropsychiatric evaluation."" ",有一晚，我喺屋企 收到 ER 打嚟嘅電話 ER 即係急症室 間急症室喺離我 兩百公里嘅一個城市度 
"Now, I obviously can't get into my car in the middle of the night and drive 200 kilometers. ",個主診醫生話： 「你有個病人， 你四個月前醫過佢。 佢啱啱用藥過量， 依家入咗急症室。 
"So as best as we could, over the phone with the ER doctor, we come up with an assessment. ",佢嘅血液動力正常， 不過需要神經心理科嘅檢查。 」 
We ensure that suicidal observations are in place. ,當然，我無可能半夜揸車 揸兩百公里去嗰度 
"We ensure that we start reviewing the antidepressants that this patient has been taking, and we finally conclude that as soon as Erica -- that was her name, 26-year-old -- as soon as Erica is ready to be released from the ER, she should come directly to me with her mother, and I will evaluate and establish what can be done. ",所以，我哋唯有 喺電話度 諗出對應嘅辦法 
And we assumed that that would take about a week. ,我要確保有人觀察著病人嘅自殺傾向 
A week passes. ,要確保我哋審視返病人 服用抗抑鬱藥嘅劑量 最後得出嘅結論係 Erica —— 呢個係病人嘅名，佢廿六歲 喺 Erica 可以出院時 佢同佢媽媽就應該有直接來揾我 然後我就會對佢做檢查同評估 同決定下一步要點做 
Three weeks pass. ,我哋估計 Erica 大概一個禮拜之後就會來 
No Erica. ,過咗一個禮拜 
"And one day I get a call from Erica's mother, and she says, ""Erica committed suicide three days ago. ",過咗三個禮拜 
"She hanged herself from the mango tree in the family garden."" ",我都冇見到 Erica 
"Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction, I couldn't help but ask, ""But why didn't you come to Harare, where I live? ",有一日，Erica 媽媽打電話畀我 佢話： 「Erica 三日前自殺咗。 
"We had agreed that as soon as you're released from the ER, you will come to me."" ",佢喺屋企花園 一樖芒果樹度吊頸。」 
Her response was brief. ,我本能反應噉忍唔住問： 「噉點解你哋冇嚟哈拉雷揾我？ 
We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare to come to Harare. ,我哋講好咗，Erica 一出院， 你哋就會嚟揾我 。」 
"Now, suicide is not an unusual event in the world of mental health. ",佢解釋得好簡單： 
But there was something about Erica's death that struck me at the core of my very being. ,「去哈拉雷嘅車費要十五蚊， 我哋籌唔到錢。 」 
"That statement from Erica's mother: ""We didn't have 15 dollars bus fare to come to you,"" made me realize that it just wasn't going to work, me expecting people to come to me. ",喺精神科裏面 自殺唔算罕見 
"And I got into this state of soul-searching, trying to really discover my role as a psychiatrist in Africa. ",但 Erica 嘅死 好震憾我 
"And after considerable consultation and soul-searching, talking to colleagues, friends and family, it suddenly dawned on me that actually, one the most reliable resources we have in Africa are grandmothers. ",佢媽媽嗰句 「我哋籌錢唔到 十五蚊嘅車費嚟揾你。」 令我醒覺 等病人嚟揾我 呢個方法行唔通 
"Yes, grandmothers. ",我開始自我反省 重新諗 我喺非洲做精神科醫生嘅職責 
"And I thought, grandmothers are in every community. ",經過一番請教同思考 又同同事、家人、朋友傾過 我突然醒覺 其實非洲最多嘅資源 就喺啲婆婆 
There are hundreds of them. ,無錯，係婆婆 
And -- (Laughter) And they don't leave their communities in search of greener pastures. ,我喺度諗 每個社區都有好多婆婆 
"(Laughter) See, the only time they leave is when they go to a greener pasture called heaven. ",有成幾百個 
"(Laughter) So I thought, how about training grandmothers in evidence-based talk therapy, which they can deliver on a bench? ",仲有 （笑聲） 佢哋唔會離職， 唔會換工走人 
"Empower them with the skills to listen, to show empathy, all of that rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy; empower them with the skills to provide behavior activation, activity scheduling; and support them using digital technology. ",（笑聲） 佢哋唯一走佬會去嘅地方 就係天堂 
"You know, mobile phone technology. ",（笑聲） 所以我諗，不如訓練呢啲婆婆 教佢哋循證談話療法 等佢哋可以坐喺公園長櫈度幫人 
Pretty much everyone in Africa has a mobile phone today. ,根據認知行為療法 教佢哋聆聽嘅技巧 教佢哋表達同情心 教佢哋技巧來引導病人做正確行為 安排病人嘅活動 同埋教佢哋學識用數碼科技 
"So in 2006, I started my first group of grandmothers. ",譬如︰手機 
(Applause) Thank you. ,"依家, 喺非洲人人都有手機 "
"(Applause) Today, there are hundreds of grandmothers who are working in more than 70 communities. ",喺 2006 年 我組織到 第一班婆婆 
"And in the last year alone, more than 30,000 people received treatment on the Friendship Bench from a grandmother in a community in Zimbabwe. ",（掌聲） 多謝 
"(Applause) And recently, we published this work that is done by these grandmothers in the Journal of the American Medical Association. ",（掌聲） 今日，我哋有幾百個婆婆 分散喺七十幾個社區度做嘢 
"And -- (Applause) And our results show that six months after receiving treatment from a grandmother, people were still symptom-free: no depression, suicidal ideation completely reduced. ",單單係舊年 已經有三萬以上嘅津巴布韋人 喺社區嘅「友誼長櫈」計劃度 接受咗一個婆婆嘅治療 
"In fact, our results -- this was a clinical trial -- in fact, this clinical trial showed that grandmothers were more effective at treating depression than doctors and -- (Laughter) (Applause) And so, we're now working towards expanding this program. ",（掌聲） 最近，我哋喺 美國醫學研究協會嘅雜誌 發表文章講述呢啲計劃同婆婆嘅工作 
There are more than 600 million people currently aged above 65 in the world. ,仲有 （掌聲） 我哋嘅研究結果顯示 接受過婆婆治療嘅病人 喺六個月後 依然無復發嘅徵像 無抑鬱 少咗好多自殺嘅傾向 
"And by the year 2050, there will be 1.5 billion people aged 65 and above. ",我哋嘅研究顯示 —— 呢個係臨床試驗 臨床試驗結果顯示 婆婆醫抑鬱症仲有效過醫生 （笑聲） （掌聲） 所以 我哋依家努力擴展呢個計劃 
"Imagine if we could create a global network of grandmothers in every major city in the world, who are trained in evidence-based talk therapy, supported through digital platforms, networked. ",依家，全球有六億 六十五歲以上嘅人口 
And they will make a difference in communities. ,到 2050 年 會有十五億 六十五歲以上嘅人口 
"They will reduce the treatment gap for mental, neurological and substance-use disorders. ","想像一下, 如果我哋能夠 喺全世界所有主要城市 建立一個國際婆婆網絡 而啲婆婆又受過 循證談話療法嘅訓練 有電子平台支援佢哋 又有網絡將佢哋聯繫起來 "
"Finally, this is a file photograph of Grandmother Jack. ",佢哋會為社區做出好多貢獻 
"So, Farai had six sessions on the bench with Grandmother Jack. ",佢哋會縮窄當地 心理、神經同濫用藥物問題上嘅 醫療供求差距 
"Today, Farai is employed. ",最後 呢張係 Jack 婆婆嘅相 
She has her two children at school. ,法拉喺「友誼長櫈」 同婆婆有六次療程 
"And as for Grandmother Jack, one morning in February, we expected her to see her 257th client on the bench. ",依家，法拉揾到工做 
She didn't show up. ,佢兩個仔女讀緊書 
She had gone to a greener pasture called heaven. ,至於 Jack 婆婆 喺二月嘅一個上晝 佢本來會嚟見佢第 257 位病人 
"But I believe that Grandmother Jack, from up there, she's cheering on all the other grandmothers -- the increasing number of grandmothers who are making a difference in the lives of thousands of people. ",但係佢無出現 
"And I'm sure she's in awe when she realizes that something that she helped to pioneer is now spreading to other countries, like Malawi, the island of Zanzibar and coming closer to home here in the Unites States in the city of New York. ",佢去咗天堂 
May her soul rest in peace. ,但我相信，Jack 婆婆 喺天堂同緊其他婆婆打氣 而且越來越多婆婆加入呢個計劃 改變千萬人嘅人生 
Thank you. ,我仲諗 Jack 婆婆一定會好驚嘆 佢帶頭開始嘅計劃 已經發展到其他國家 例如馬拉維 桑給巴爾群島 同埋呢度 美國嘅紐約市 
(Applause) (Cheering) (Applause) ,願 Jack 婆婆安息 
,多謝 
"My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us. ",（掌聲） （歡呼） （掌聲） 
And my little idea that will do that is sleep. ,
(Laughter) (Applause) This is a room of type A women. ,我嘅大諗頭 喺一個非常，非常細嘅意見 可以釋放 數十億 目前喺我哋體內處於休眠狀態嘅大想法. 
This is a room of sleep-deprived women. ,我嘅意見就喺 瞓覺。 
And I learned the hard way the value of sleep. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 依度有成屋嘅A型女性。 
"Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion. ",依間屋有一班 唔夠瞓嘅女人。 
I hit my head on my desk. ,而且我從教訓中學習到， 睡眠嘅價值。 
"I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye. ",兩年半之前， 我攰到暈底咗。 
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. ,我個頭撞咗落檯面，然後撞爆咗我嘅臉頰骨， 
"And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep. ",我嘅右眼聯咗五針。 
"(Applause) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue. ",所以我開始重新 尋找睡眠嘅價值。 
"We are literally going to sleep our way to the top -- literally -- (Laughter) (Applause) because unfortunately, for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol. ",喺依個過程裡面， 我研究， 我見咗醫生，科學家， 而我喺依度話比你聽 如果你想有更加高嘅效率， 更加多靈感，生活得更快活 你就要有足夠嘅睡眠。 
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before. ,(掌聲） 而我哋女人要帶領 一個新嘅革命，依種新嘅女權主義。 
"And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn't say -- I felt like saying, ""You know what? if you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting."" ",我哋簡直要用最好嘅方式瞓覺，確實咁做。 (笑聲) (掌聲) 因為不幸嘅喺， 對男人嚟講 唔夠瞓已經成為有男子氣概嘅象徵。 
(Laughter) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship. ,最近我同一個男人食晚飯， 佢吹噓佢每晚只得到 四個鐘頭嘅睡眠。 
"Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date, and you say, ""How about eight o'clock?"" ",而且我覺得自己想同佢講 -- 但我冇講到-- 我覺得好似話：“你知道嗎？ 如果你瞓左五個鐘頭， 今次晚餐會變得有趣好多。“ 
"they're likely to tell you, ""Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's OK, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."" ",(笑聲) 有一種唔夠瞓嘅情況 更勝人一籌。 
"And they think that means they are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is, they're not, because we, at the moment, have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions. ",特別喺華盛頓，如果你試圖搞一個早餐會， 然後你話，“八點可以嗎？“ 
"So a high IQ does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic. ",佢哋好可能話比你聽，“八點鐘已經喺太遲啦， 不過唔緊要，我可以打場網球 之後再講幾個電話會議，然後八點鐘再見你。“ 
(Laughter) And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics. ,佢地以為咁樣喺代表 佢哋喺難以置信嘅繁忙同有效率， 但事實上佢哋唔喺咁， 因為我哋依家， 有輝煌嘅領袖 喺商業、金融、政治， 做緊可怕嘅決定。 
"In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be around. ",因此，一個人有高智商 並唔代表佢喺一個好嘅領導人， 因為領導嘅本質 喺能夠喺鐵達尼號擊中冰山 之前已經見到冰山。 
"(Laughter) (Applause) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep, and have been able to see the big picture. ",而且我哋已經有太多嘅冰山 擊中鐵達尼號。 
"So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers, is also what is best for the world. ",事實上，我有一種感覺 如果雷曼兄弟 喺雷曼兄弟姐妹， 咁佢哋可能仍然存在。 
"So I urge you to shut your eyes, and discover the great ideas that lie inside us; to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep. ",(掌聲) 當所有兄弟都忙緊 被24 / 7超連接嘅時候， 也許一個姊妹會注意到冰山， 因為佢瞓左七個半或八個鐘頭，瞓醒 已經能夠睇到 全幅圖畫。 
Thank you. ,所以喺我哋世界嘅依刻， 當我哋面對 所有多重嘅危機， 咩喺個人層面上對我哋嚟講喺好嘅， 仲有啲乜嘢可以為我哋嘅生活 帶黎更多嘅快樂、感恩同成效， 可以最好甘幫到我哋嘅事業， 仲可以最幫到成個世界。 
(Applause) ,所以我希望你 閉上你嘅眼睛 去發掘喺我哋裡面 嘅新思維， 關閉你嘅引擎，發掘睡眠嘅力量。 
,多謝。 
"I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs, but not the cyborgs that you think. ",（掌聲） 
"You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. ",
So what's a good definition for cyborg? ,我想同你哋講， 其實你哋都係半機械人， 不過唔係你哋念嘅果種半機械人。 
"Well, traditional definition is ""an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments."" ",你哋唔係鐵甲威龍，亦都唔係終結者， 但係每次你望住個屏幕 或者用手機果陣，你就係一個半機械人。 
"That came from a 1960 paper on space travel, because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward. ",甘點先為止正宗嘅半機械人呢？ 
People aren't supposed to be there. ,嗱，傳統嚟講就係 “一個有機體為咗適應新環衛 而被添加外部組件。” 
"But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next. ",呢種講法係源於1960年一篇記錄太空漫遊嘅文章。 因為你認真唸下，太空其實好可怕； 
So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. ,人類本嚟就唔應該係果度。 
"Somebody goes to another country, says, ""How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are, how curious their culture is."" ",不過人類都係好有奇心嘅，佢哋鐘意係自己身上加啲嘢， 所以總有一日佢地可以爬上阿爾卑斯山， 跟住另外一日又變成海底嘅一條魚。 
"And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it, and we think it's very exotic. ",等我哋嚟睇下傳統概唸上嘅人類學係觀點。 
"Well, what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. ",有條友去咗另一個國家， 佢話：“呢度啲人真係神奇，佢哋嘅架撐真係得意， 距哋嘅文化好盞鬼。” 
"I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said, ""Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens, and look at these fascinating cultures, and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. ",跟住佢地係張紙度寫咗啲也，或者咁啱有幾個人類學家睇度， 我哋就會覺得呢單也靈舍有異國情調。 
"They're clicking on things and staring at screens."" ",而同時發生嘅係我哋突然發現咗 一個新品種。 
"Now there's a reason why I study this, versus traditional anthropology. ",我，作為一個研究半機械人嘅人類學家，實會話： “哇，依家我哋突然間成為咗新新人類啦。 過嚟睇下呢啲引人入勝嘅文化， 再睇下呢啲令人好奇嘅儀式， 個個都圍繞呢項技術做嘢。 
"And the reason is that tool use, in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years, everything has been a physical modification of self. ",佢哋一路點擊，一路望著個屏幕。” 
"It has helped us to extend our physical selves, go faster, hit things harder, and there's been a limit on that. ",我之所以去研究呢樣也， 而唔係傳統人類學係有原因嘅。 
"But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self, but an extension of the mental self, and because of that, we're able to travel faster, communicate differently. ",因為工具嘅使用， 係一開始，經過咗千萬年， 所有也都係人類挪嚟改造自身。 
And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology. ,工具幫助我哋擴展自身嘅技能， 令我哋跑得更快，錘嘢錘得更有力， 雖然一切都有個限度。 
"We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out. ",但係依家我哋睇度嘅唔係人類自身技能嘅擴展， 而係心智嘅延伸。 由於咁，我哋可以走得更快， 更多元化咁交流。 
What does the inside of your computer actually look like? ,第二件發生哽嘅嘢就係 我哋都隨身攜帶住Mary Poppins嘅技術。 
"Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. ",我地可以將任何野擺在我地想放噶任何地方，唔重咖， 然之後又可以從入面挪距出來。 
"And if you actually lose that information, it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind, that you suddenly feel like something's missing, except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion. ",你台電腦入面究竟有啲咩呢？ 
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. ,嗱，如果你將佢打印出嚟，就好似你要運輸 成千磅重嘅信息材料。 
"Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online, and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. ",而且，如果你真係唔見咗果啲信息， 你個心就會覺得突然之間冇咗一啲嘢， 就好似突然之間感覺失去咗一啲嘢， 除非你無辦法見度呢啲嘢，距就好似D好奇怪噶感覺。 
"And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open, which is basically your Facebook wall, so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night -- because it's very much the equivalent. ",另外一件發生咗嘅嘢就係你擁有第二個自己。 
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self. ,無論你鐘唔鍾意，你都開始係線上出現， 當你唔係果度， 人哋就開始同第二個你交流， 
You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. ,咁你就要小心， 唔好輕易開放你嘅第一道防線， 基本上嚟講就係你嘅Facebook， 唔好比人哋係深夜係上面寫嘢， 因為呢個效果同現實生活係好大程度上係等價嘅。 
"So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed, you have to learn to do that for your digital self. ",所以突然之間，我哋開始維護第二個自己， 
"And the problem is that a lot of people now, especially adolescents, have to go through two adolescences. ",你不得不以一種你係現實中呈現嘅方式 相似咁係數碼生活中呈現。 
"They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward, and then they go through their second self's adolescence, and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online. ",就好似你起身，冲個涼，著衫， 你一樣要學識係數碼生活中去做同樣嘅也。 
"And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now, and so it's very awkward, and it's very difficult for them to do those things. ",不過問題在於家陣好多人， 尤其係青少年， 需要經歷兩個青春期。 
"So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say, ""I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."" ",佢哋要經歷第一個青春期已經好唔容易， 依家仲要經歷自己第二個青春期。 咁就更加之難。 因為係呢個真實嘅網絡歷史入面 佢哋經歷都會被記錄。 
"And I said, ""Great."" ",依家每個啱開始接觸新科技嘅人， 都係網上嘅青少年。 所以，要佢地去做果啲嘢 係好奇怪同埋困難嘅。 
"And he said one day, ""What's the shortest distance between two points?"" ",係我好細個果陣，夜晚我老窦會叫我坐低跟住同我講： “我要教你一樣關於未來時間同空間嘅嘢。” 
"And I said, ""Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."" ",我話：“好啊！” 
I thought I was very clever. ,有一日佢問我：“兩點之間最短嘅距離係咩？” 
"He said, ""No, no, no. Here's a better way."" ",我話：“哦，直線啰。你琴日係咁同我講嘅。” 
"He took a piece of paper, drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched. ",我唸住我好醒目， 
"And he said, ""That is the shortest distance between two points."" ",點知佢話：“唔啱，唔啱，呢個先係更短嘅路徑。” 
"And I said, ""Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"" ",佢挪咗一張紙， 係一面寫咗個A，另外一面寫咗個B， 跟住折埋兩邊令到A掂到B。 
"He said, ""Well, you just bend time and space, it takes an awful lot of energy, and that's just how you do it."" ",佢話：”呢個先系兩點之間最短嘅距離。“ 
"And I said, ""I want to do that."" ",我跟住問：”老窦，老窦，老窦，你點做度嘎？“ 
"And he said, ""Well, okay."" ",佢話：“嗱，呢個先係兩點之間最短嘅距離， 要用好多能量， 跟住就可以做到喇。” 
"And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, ""I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster. ",我話：“我都想做到啊！” 
"And I want to make a time machine."" ",佢話：“好啊！” 
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders. ,跟住，係接落嚟呢10幾20年，每當我夜晚訓覺時 我就會唸， “我一定會係第一個創造出“蟲洞”嘅人， 令事物加速。 
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. ,我仲要製造一台時光機。” 
It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. ,我經常用錄音機嚟發信息 比未來嘅自己。 
So I started studying anthropology. ,但係當我讀大學果陣，我意識到， 技術唔會因為佢有用 而被人類接受， 
"And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones, I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets. ",而係人類用過之後先會被接受。 因為佢係為滿足人類所需而創造嘅。 
They weren't physically transporting themselves; they were mentally transporting themselves. ,所以，我開始研究人類學。 
"They would click on a button, and they would be connected as A to B immediately. ",當我係度寫哽關於手機嘅論文時， 我意識到每個人嘅口袋入面都隨身帶著個”蟲洞“。 
"And I thought, ""Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."" ",呢個“蟲洞”唔係通過身體接觸嚟傳遞信息， 而係從心智上傳遞。 
"So over time, time and space have compressed because of this. ",人類點擊一下按鈕， 跟住以A身份同B取得聯繫。 
"You can stand on one side of the world, whisper something and be heard on the other. ",跟住我唸：“噢，哇，我穩到啦！真係太好啦！” 
One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use. ,所以，隨住時間推移，時間同空間 都因為咁而被壓縮埋一齊。 
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. ,你可以企係地球嘅一邊， 細細聲講嘢，而且可以比另外一邊嘅人聽到。 
"And because of that, you start to dig around for your external memories -- where did you leave them? ",仲有就係， 你用嘅唔同設備可以比你擁有唔同類型嘅時間。 
So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. ,每一個瀏覽標籤都比你一個唔同嘅時間軸。 
"And that incites a sort of panic architecture -- ""Oh no, where's this thing?"" ",而且因為咁，你開始到處發掘延伸嘅記憶， 將佢哋收埋咗係邊呢？ 
"We're all ""I Love Lucy"" on a great assembly line of information, and we can't keep up. ",所以話依家我哋都係古生物學家， 不停咁發掘我哋失去嘅嘢， 我哋將外部大腦隨身帶係口袋入面。 
"And so what happens is, when we bring all that into the social space, we end up checking our phones all the time. ",咁樣會促發一種恐慌。 弊，啲嘢究竟存咗係邊度？ 
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. ,係信息狂潮嚟臨前，我哋都好似”我愛Lucy“電視入面演嘅咁狼狽， 而且我哋冇辦法追得上信息嘅腳步。 
"It's not that we're always connected to everybody, but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. ",由於咁， 我哋將所有嘢帶入到社交空間， 結果就係我哋會不停咁查看電話。 
"And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone, the room would be very crowded. ",呢個就係稱之為親密環境。 
"These are the people that you have access to right now, in general -- all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to. ",咁樣唔係話我哋經常同每個人聯繫， 而係話我哋可以隨時聯繫上我哋想聯繫嘅人。 
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. ,如果你可以將電話簿入面嘅人全部打印出嚟， 果間房就會變得非常壁， 
"One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore, and that they aren't slowing down and stopping, being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces, paleontology and panic architecture. ",一般嚟講呢哋就係你可以聯繫到嘅人 同埋同你保持聯繫嘅朋友，家人。 
They're not just sitting there. ,隨之而嚟嘅係我哋會有一種心理效應。 
"And really, when you have no external input, that is a time when there is a creation of self, when you can do long-term planning, when you can try and figure out who you really are. ",一種我好擔心嘅心理效應， 就係人類唔再花費時間嚟反省自己， 佢地唔再放慢節奏同埋停落嚟， 時刻同屋入面嘅人係埋一齊， 嘗試係同一時間內 獲得所有人嘅注意力， 同時活係研究 古生物學同埋面對恐慌嘅架構中。 
"And then, once you do that, you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way, instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in -- and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this. ",佢地唔止係坐埋一齊咁簡單。 
And so this is very important. ,講真果句，當你唔再受黎自外部嘅影響果陣， 你就有一段可以創造自我嘅時間， 一段可以作長遠計劃嘅時間， 嘗試發覺究竟自己係點樣一個人。 
"I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it. ",而一旦你咁樣做，你就會搞清楚 應該點樣合理咁呈現第二個自己， 而唔係等所有嘢發生之後再臨時應對—— 哦，我要做呢個，我要做那個，我一定做呢個。 
"So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either. ",所以呢一點係非常重要嘅。 
"It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. ",我真係好擔心，尤其對依家嘅細路仔， 佢地冇靜低心嚟處理事情嘅時間， 因為佢地生活係一個不停點擊按鈕嘅文化中， 咩嘢都向佢地湧埋嚟， 佢地就會變得好興奮，甚至沉迷其中。 
"But when you actually visualize it, all the connections that we're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the Internet -- it doesn't look technological. ",你唸下，呢個世界都未試過停落嚟。 
It actually looks very organic. ,佢都有自己嘅外部修復設備， 而且呢啲設備都係度幫哽我哋 互相溝通同交流。 
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way. ,如果你可以見度呢啲 將我哋聯繫埋一齊嘅網路， 你會發覺呢個係一幅互聯網嘅地圖—— 佢睇起身無乜技術含量； 
And it's not that machines are taking over. ,不過事實上係有機化嘅。 
"It's that they're helping us to be more human, helping us to connect with each other. ",呢個係人類歷史上第一次 以咁樣嘅方式嚟連接每個人。 
The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. ,而且唔係部機器係度話事， 
"And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because we're co-creating each other all the time. ",而係佢幫我哽我哋變得更人性化， 更好咁同每個人溝通。 
"And so this is the important point that I like to study: that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection -- it's just done in a different way. ",最成功嘅技術係幫我哋排除障礙， 幫助我哋生活得更美好。 
"We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography. ",確切嚟講， 機器令到我哋最後變得更人性化而非技術化， 因為我哋一路都係度互相合作，共同創造。 
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology. ,呢個就係我想研究嘅一個重點： 事物係美好嘅，不過依然需要人與人之間嘅聯繫； 只不過係以一種唔同嘅方式。 
Thank you. ,我哋正係度增強自身嘅特性， 聯繫彼此嘅能力，不受地域嘅限制。 
(Applause) ,呢個就係點解我要研究半機械人類學。 
,多謝噻！ 
"I'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care, which is the patient, or, as I like to use the scientific term, people. ",（掌聲） 
"Because we are all patients, we are all people. ",
Even doctors are patients at some point. ,我將會同大家講吓 我哋點樣可以有效利用 一種絕對被忽視嘅醫療上嘅資源。 呢種資源就係病人本身， 或者﹐以科學術語嚟講 —— 人。 
"So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and, in fact, worldwide. ",因為我哋都係病人，我們亦都係人。 
"If you want to get at the big part -- I mean from a public health level, where my training is -- you're looking at behavioral issues. ",就連醫生﹐有時都可以係病人。 
"You're looking at things where people are actually given information, and they're not following through with it. ",所以我想討論呢種資源 可帶嚟嘅良機﹐ 一項我哋國家﹐甚至全世界 都冇足夠善用到嘅良機。 
"It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes, obesity, many forms of heart disease, even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking. ",如果你想由大局嚟睇 -- 由公共醫療嘅角度﹐即係我嘅職業範圍 -- 我哋就見到行為上嘅問題， 
Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. ,你會發現人得到訊息之後﹐ 並冇妥善跟進。 
"They know what they're supposed to be doing, but they're not doing it. ",呢個問題﹐於糖尿病﹑ 肥胖症以及多種嘅心臟病﹐ 甚至﹐如果考慮到吸煙問題﹐於癌症方面﹐都有存在。 
Now behavior change is something that is a long-standing problem in medicine. ,所有人都知道應該要點樣做先至正確﹐ 
It goes all the way back to Aristotle. ,雖然知道應該要點樣做﹐ 但佢哋冇去做到。 
"And doctors hate it, right? ",要將行為改變﹐ 一直都係醫學上長期存在嘅問題。 
"I mean, they complain about it all the time. ",遠至亞里士多德嘅時代都有存在。 
"We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance. ",而且醫生都討厭呢種行為，係嗎？ 
"When people don't take their pills, when people don't follow doctors' orders -- these are behavior problems. ",我意思係﹐醫生經常都抱怨呢個問題。 
"But for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change, there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem. ",我哋通常歸納為留心聽取﹐以及唔聽指示。 
"So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them, but actually leads them to make better decisions, better choices in their lives. ",當有人唔食藥﹑ 唔聽醫生吩咐﹐ 呢啲都係行為問題。 
"One part of medicine, though, has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well, and that's dentistry. ",但係無論臨床醫學專家點樣 為改變病人行為嘅問題而煩惱﹐ 要解決呢個問題﹐ 我哋能力根本有限。 
Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is -- many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. ,因此解決問題嘅關鍵 在於助人去作出正確嘅判斷 -- 即是於提供信息嘅時候﹐ 不單只教育病人﹐ 或者通知佢哋， 而係實際上引導佢哋去作更好嘅決定﹐ 於生活上作更好嘅選擇。 
"Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry. ",其實﹐喺醫學上有一個領域 已經比較成功解決到行為改變方面嘅問題﹐ 就係牙科。 
But they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it. ,好多人眼中﹐包括我自己﹐ 而且好多牙醫都承認， 牙科於某程度係醫學上一個沉悶嘅死角。 
It's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system. ,牙科嘅領域一般都冇任何新奇有趣嘅事發生。 
People brush and floss their teeth. ,但係佢哋確實有將改變行為嘅問題作出研究 而且解決咗呢個問題。 
"They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it. ",呢個係我哋嘅醫療保體系統中 一個非常成功嘅疾病預防嘅例子。 
So I'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in Connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago. ,每個人都刷牙﹐而且用牙線剔牙。 
"So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one, because it was very simple, so it's an easy story to tell. ",佢哋雖然做得唔夠多﹐但係都總算有做。 
"So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often, and they were going to use one variable: they wanted to scare them. ",所以我就想同大家分享一個實驗。 呢個係一個30年前﹐幾個喺美國康州嘅牙醫 諗出嚟嘅實驗。 
They wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth. ,呢個實驗雖然古老，但係的確唔錯 因為佢非常簡單， 所以亦好容易說明。 
They had a big patient population. ,話說﹐呢班康州嘅牙醫決定 想令到病人更頻密地刷牙﹐而且用牙線清理牙齒。 而佢哋利用咗一個變量﹕ 佢哋想要令人驚怕。 
They divided them up into two groups. ,佢哋想講給病人知道 如果唔刷牙﹑唔用牙線﹐後果將會點樣嚴重。 
"They had a low-fear population, where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation, all based in science, but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth, you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth, but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad. ",佢哋當時有好多病人。 
So that was the low-fear group. ,於是將呢些病人分成兩組。 
"The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick. ",一組是低恐慌組， 佢哋比呢組人睇一段13分鐘 有科學根據嘅講解， 但係亦講比佢哋知道，如果唔刷牙﹑唔用牙線， 可能就會得到牙周病，而如果得到牙周病，就會失去牙齒， 但係重可以戴假牙，情況就唔會太差。 
They showed bloody gums. ,呢個就是低恐慌組嘅部份。 
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. ,對於高恐慌組﹐佢哋就落足料。 
They told them that their teeth were going to fall out. ,佢哋比呢一組睇見血淋淋嘅牙肉﹑ 
"They said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies, and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth. ",牙縫之間流膿嘅口腔。 
"They would get dentures, and if you got dentures, you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob, you weren't going to be able to eat apples, you weren't going to be able to eat steak. ",佢哋對實驗者講牙齒會脫落﹑ 
You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. ,佢哋會受到細菌感染 而細菌會由嘴巴擴散到身體其他部份， 同埋最後﹐佢哋當然會失去牙齒。 
So go brush and floss your teeth. ,雖然都可以戴假牙，但是戴假牙 就再唔可以食原條粟米﹑ 唔可以食蘋果﹑ 唔可以食牛扒。 
That was the message. That was the experiment. ,下半世就只好食糊狀嘅食物。 
Now they measured one other variable. ,所以快去刷牙同埋用牙線啦。 
"They wanted to capture one other variable, which was the patients' sense of efficacy. ",呢個就係其中嘅信息，實驗就係咁樣進行。 
This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. ,跟住佢哋測試咗另一個變量。 
"So they asked them at the beginning, ""Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"" ",佢哋想要研究嘅變量就係 病人自認為嘅能動性。 
"And the people who said, ""Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"" they were characterized as high efficacy, and the people who said, ""Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,"" they were characterized as low efficacy. ",即係話﹐病人自己認為佢哋會唔會 真係去刷牙同埋用牙線。 
So the upshot was this. ,所以於實驗嘅開始﹐佢哋問病人﹐ 「你哋認為自己的確會依照呢個計劃進行嗎？」 
The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. ,回答「會﹑一定會﹐呢方面我好在行」嘅參加者﹐ 都被列入高能動性嘅一組。 而回答「噢﹐我從來都無法養成 刷牙﹑用牙線嘅習慣」嘅人﹐ 都被列入缺乏能動性嘅一組。 
The people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen -- it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior. ,終於得到嘅結論就係咁樣。 
So fear showed up as not really the driver. ,呢個實驗證實 恐懼其實完全唔係帶動行為的 主要因素。 
It was the sense of efficacy. ,照指示刷牙﹑用牙線嘅人 並唔一定係 對可能帶來嘅後果感到恐懼嘅人﹐ 而係只需要係認為自己有能力 去改變自己行為嘅人。 
"So I want to isolate this, because it was a great observation -- 30 years ago, right, 30 years ago -- and it's one that's laid fallow in research. ",因此顯示到﹐能夠改變行為嘅原動力並唔係恐懼， 
"It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work, who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment. ",而係病人自認為嘅能動性。 
The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. ,所以我想特別談及呢個例子， 因為呢個確實係非常唔錯嘅觀察結果， 30年前﹐冇錯﹐係30年前嘅結論﹐ 而一直冇被發揮﹑利用嘅﹐就係呢個結論。 
"In health care terms, you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health, that they can actually see their way towards getting better health, and that's a very important notion. ",呢個想法其實起源於 Albert Bandura 嘅研究之中﹐ 佢曾研究 人是否可取得賦能感。 
It's an amazing notion. ,能動性嘅理念最後可以總結為﹕ 一個人是否相信﹐自己有能力去改變自己嘅行為。 
"We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well. ",以醫療角度，我哋可以將呢個概括爲 人是否能夠意識到 佢哋改善健康狀況嘅途徑， 以至佢哋能夠確實為自己健康作出改善。 而呢個係非常重要嘅一個觀點。 
"Except, maybe we do. ",係一個奇妙嘅觀點。 
"So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work. ",只不過我哋未懂得點樣去有效利用佢。 
And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. ,又或者﹐我哋已經懂得。 
This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association. ,恐懼起唔到作用。係﹐恐懼起唔到作用。 
This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. ,而呢個係個非常好嘅例子， 證明我哋完全唔會接受教訓。 
"I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night, and he's like, ""Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"" ",以下係美國糖尿病協會嘅一個宣傳活動。 
"And I had to explain, ""They're trying to scare people."" ",亦都係目前醫療健康方面仍然採用來傳達信息嘅方法。 
And I don't know if it works. ,我想講嘅係，我昨晚比我三歲嘅孩子睇咗呢張幻燈片， 然後佢話：「爸爸，點解呢啲人屋企裡面會有救護車呢？」 
Now here's what does work: personalized information works. ,我只能解釋：「呢個只係用來嚇人。」 
"Again, Bandura recognized this years ago, decades ago. ",我都唔知道呢個做法有效與否。 
"When you give people specific information about their health, where they stand, and where they want to get to, where they might get to, that path, that notion of a path -- that tends to work for behavior change. ",而以下才是有效嘅方法。 就係個人化嘅信息。 
So let me just spool it out a little bit. ,又是 Bandura﹐喺幾十年前 認出了呢一點。 
"So you start with personalized data, personalized information that comes from an individual, and then you need to connect it to their lives. ",當您向他人提供具體嘅﹑ 關乎佢哋健康嘅﹑佢哋目前病情嘅信息﹐ 以及佢哋可以達到嘅狀況﹑可能會出現嘅情況嘅信息﹐ 就是呢條路途﹑呢條路途嘅理念﹐ 令到人嘅行為作出改變。 
"You need to connect it to their lives, hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand. ",請等我詳盡少少去解釋。 
"Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. ",您可以由一個人身上得到嘅 個人化嘅數據﹑個人化嘅資料開始﹐ 然後將呢啲跟每個人的生活聯繫起來。 
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with. ,您要將資訊跟佢哋嘅生活聯繫起來。 最好係以一種唔會令人感到恐懼嘅方式﹐而係一種佢哋可以理解嘅方式。 
But it actually hits home. ,好喇﹐我已知道自己嘅立場。我已知道自己嘅位置。 
It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts. ,而用抽象嘅數目子作根基的話﹐對我毫無意義﹐ 呢啲過多嘅有關健康嘅資訊 實在氾濫得令我哋應付不來﹐ 
There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. ,但係佢哋其實係解決問題嘅根源。 
"That information then needs to be connected to choices, needs to be connected to a range of options, directions that we might go to -- trade-offs, benefits. ",佢哋不單止影響我哋嘅思想﹐亦都帶動我哋嘅情緒。 
"Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action. ",我哋對呢啲信息有不解嘅情結， 因為呢啲信息起源自我哋本身。 
"We need to connect the information always with the action, and then that action feeds back into different information, and it creates, of course, a feedback loop. ",然後﹐呢啲資料需要與選擇串連起來， 需要與各種各樣嘅選摘連貫起來， 包括有可能嘅發生嘅情況 -- 各種利弊。 
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion for behavior change. ,最後，我哋需要被清楚地告知﹐要採取點樣嘅行動。 
"But the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there -- personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by. ",我哋需要每次都將信息 跟行動串連起來﹐ 然後果個行動再反饋成 另一份信息 而當然，咁樣因此形成一個反饋循環。 
"It's a difficult and expensive commodity, until now. ",其實呢一套理念﹐已經係一套相當有根據﹑廣泛被公認嘅﹑ 用作行為改變嘅理念。 
"So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works. ",但問題係，圖中右上角嘅 個人數據﹐因為通常都係難以取得嘅。 
"So we've all seen these. These are the ""your speed limit"" signs. ",個人數據係一種難以得到嘅奢侈品﹐ 直到目前為止。 
"You've seen them all around, especially these days as radars are cheaper. ",我再來向大家講解一個例子，一個非常簡單嘅例子﹐去說明呢個原理。 
And here's how they work in the feedback loop. ,我哋每個人都見過呢啲標示牌。呢啲係顯示「你的時速」嘅標示牌。 
"So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25, and, of course, you're going faster than that. ",大家喺任何地方都一定見過， 尤其是而家雷達儀器比較便宜嘅時代。 
We always are. We're always going above the speed limit. ,而以下就係佢哋點樣牽涉反饋循環嘅現象。 
The choice in this case is pretty simple. ,一開始﹐您所得嘅個人化數據﹐就係 您當時於路面嘅時速限制﹐ 25﹐ 而當然﹐您當時正超速。 
"We either keep going fast, or we slow down. ",我哋﹐永遠都會超速。 
"We should probably slow down, and that point of action is probably now. ",呢個例子中嘅選擇係非常簡單。 
"We should take our foot off the pedal right now, and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down. ",我哋一係就繼續超速，一係就將速度減慢。 
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent. ,其實我哋應該要將速度減慢。 而且大概要立刻行動。 
"They last for about five miles, in which case we put our foot back on the pedal. ",我們應該立刻將腳從油門鬆開。 而通常我哋都會咁樣做。呢類設備﹐通常都有效令到 司機將行車速度減慢。 
"But it works, and it even has some health repercussions. ",佢哋有效將車速減慢百分之五到百分之十。 
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit. ,而且有效持續五英哩左右。 之後我哋又再將腳踩落油門。 
"Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits. ",但至少起作用﹐甚至帶嚟一啲健康嘅效應。 
"But by and large, this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. ",您嘅血壓可能會降低些少。 
"Because in health care, most health care, the data is very removed from the action. ",亦可能會減少意外發生，因此對大眾健康帶來益處。 
It's very difficult to line things up so neatly. ,但具體嚟講﹐呢類一流嘅反饋環 係少之又少嘅。 
But we have an opportunity. ,因為喺醫療系統中，又或者大部份醫療系統中， 數據已經被行動所分離。 
"So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country, how we actually get information. ",因此好難將事件每部份清晰串連起嚟。 
This is a pharmaceutical ad. ,但係我哋有呢個機會。 
"Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad. ",因此我而家想轉話題去討論 我哋國家係點樣去將有關醫療信息傳達﹑ 我哋點樣取得呢啲信息。 
Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet. ,呢個係一個西藥嘅廣告。 
But it looks completely right. ,其實呢個係一個諷刺廣告，而唔係真嘅藥品廣告。 
"So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect. ",到目前為止﹐未有人聰明到用 「Havidol」為藥品命名。 
"And then we turn the page of the magazine, and we see this -- now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads, or to follow their ads, and to me, this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine. ",但係佢看似完全冇問題。 
Because we know. ,我哋就係以呢種方法 取得有關健康同藥品嘅資訊﹐ 而且看似非常完美。 
Who among us would actually say that people read this? ,跟住我哋翻到雜誌嘅下一頁， 係喇﹐我們可以見到呢個情況。 呢一頁就係食物及藥物管制局﹐要求製藥公司 放入廣告內或附加到廣告後面嘅說明。 而對我而言，呢個動作﹐係醫學界其中一種多餘嘅動作。 
And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it? ,因為我哋知道 
This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information. ,在座中﹐我哋邊個真係會去睇呢些啲說明呢？ 
There is no good faith in this. ,又或者在座中﹐我哋邊個真係認為 會有人試圖去睇呢啲說明﹐ 而又真係從中獲益呢? 
So this is a different approach. ,呢個係一個完全殘缺嘅﹑ 去企圖將醫療信息轉達嘅方法。 
"This is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin. ",呢種做法欠缺誠意。 
"And they created this thing called the ""drug facts box."" ",以下就係另外一種方法。 
"They took inspiration from, of all things, Cap'n Crunch. ",係達特茅斯醫學院嘅兩位研究員 想出嚟嘅辦法。 佢哋係 Lisa Schwartz 同埋 Steven Woloshin。 
"They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food, actually helps people understand what's in their food. ",佢哋將呢個發明稱之為藥物成分說明表。 
God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies. ,有趣嘅係﹐佢哋主要係從 Cap'n Crunch 取得靈感。 
So let me just walk through this quickly. ,佢哋見到﹐穀類早餐上嘅營養標籤 就如其他食物標籤一樣﹐實際上真可以有效幫助人 去瞭解自己嘅食物存有甚麼成份。 
"It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for, so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you. ",我哋點解未想過﹐ 將 Cap'n Crunch 嘅製造標準﹐ 帶到製藥公司﹖ 
You can understand exactly what the benefits are. ,請等我簡短地講解。 
"It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what, but you get the statistics for how effective it is. ",佢會清楚說明藥物嘅用途﹐尤其是係使用對象。 咁樣您就可以根據自己情況﹐ 去理解究竟呢段資訊﹑ 又或者呢項藥物﹐是否與您相關。 
"And finally, you understand what those choices are. ",於是您就能清楚知道﹐藥物對您有乜嘢幫助。 
You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects. ,唔再係以往一般﹑含糊地向您保證﹐藥物無論如何都一定有效﹐ 而係透過統計數據令您知道佢點樣有效。 
"Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect. ",最後，您就會明白應該作甚麼選擇。 
"So it spells those out in very clean terms, and that works. ",您可以根據副作用的情況 去收窄要選擇嘅範圍。 
So I love this. I love that drug facts box. ,每次無論食乜嘢藥，都可能會產生副作用。 
"And so I was thinking about, what's an opportunity that I could have to help people understand information? ",呢個模式﹐可以清晰令您瞭解佢哋。 而真係有效。 
What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use? ,所以我非常鐘意呢個辦法。呢個藥物成分說明表。 
And so I came up with this: lab test results. ,跟住我開始思考， 我可以利用乜嘢良機 去幫其他人理解呢些信息呢？ 
Blood test results are this great source of information. ,有乜嘢其他潛在嘅信息 係我哋未有善用呢﹖ 
They're packed with information. ,於是我想到呢個：化驗結果。 
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. ,血液化驗報告就是這類相當有用嘅信息﹐ 
They go right to doctors. ,佢哋充滿一大堆嘅資料。 
"And God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them, they don't really understand all this stuff either. ",只不過呢種報告唔係比我哋嘅，唔係比普通人嘅，亦唔係比病人嘅。 
This is the worst presented information. ,只有醫生才睇得明白。 
"You ask Tufte, and he would say, ""Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."" ",而天知曉﹐我覺得如果你真係問到，恐怕多數醫生 都未必一定明白呢堆資料。 
"What we did at Wired was we went, and I got our graphic design department to re-imagine these lab reports. ",呢類嘅信息表達實在係最差嘅。 
So that's what I want to walk you through. ,您去問 Tufte﹐佢亦會話﹕ 「係呀﹐呢種信息表達﹐實在差到極點。」 
"So this is the general blood work before, and this is the after, this is what we came up with. ",喺《連線》雜誌社， 我利用我哋嘅圖表設計部 去重新設計呢啲化驗報告。 
The after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. ,呢啲亦都係我想比在座各位見到嘅。 
"It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know. ",呢份係之前見到嘅血液化驗報告， 而呢張係經過我哋重新設計之後嘅報告。 
This is our one-page summary. ,後者將原來嘅四頁紙 -- 其實上一張幻燈片 只有顯示四頁資料嘅第一頁， 而呢份只不過係巡例嘅血液化驗部告。 
We use the notion of color. ,呢啲數值﹑您唔明白嘅數字﹐無窮無盡地繼續。 
It's an amazing notion that color could be used. ,而呢份就是我哋嘅一頁摘要。 
"So on the top-level you have your overall results, the things that might jump out at you from the fine print. ",我哋用顔色加以區分。 
"Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context, and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. ",其實用顔色作區分﹐係非常奇妙嘅概念。 
"In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level. ",於最上面一欄﹐係您報告結果嘅概況， 呢啲通常係字裡行間最顯眼嘅要點。 
"Likewise, you can go over your lipids and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. ",然後你可以更詳細看下去， 而實質瞭解﹐我哋點樣將資訊帶到您嘅水平。 我哋通過顔色來清晰表明 您嘅數值處於邊一個位置。 
"But again, always using color and personalized proximity to that information. ",呢個例子裡面﹐據葡萄糖含量可見到 呢個病人存有輕微患糖尿病嘅風險。 
"All those other values, all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing, we summarize. ",同樣，您可以見到您嘅血脂含量， 然後瞭解您總體嘅膽固醇含量， 再有興趣的話﹐進一步得知高密度膽固醇及低密度膽固醇嘅程度。 
"We tell you that you're okay, you're normal. ",但無論如何，都係以顔色 以及個人化關聯 去表達信息。 
But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk. ,所有其他嘅數值， 所有果啲無止境嘅一大堆數值，根本毫無意義﹐ 而我哋將佢哋簡化。 
And then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop: we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate. ,我哋會比您知道你情況唔錯﹑一切正常。 
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do. ,而您無須喺數字堆之中尋覓﹑無須理會雜亂﹑無意義嘅信息。 
"We give them some insight into what choices they can make, what actions they can take. ",根住我哋還會做兩件非常重要嘅事， 去填補呢個反饋循環存在嘅空隙。 我哋令人明白一點更多嘅細節， 也即是呢啲數值代表甚麼﹑可能表明甚麼。 
So that's our general blood work test. ,然後我哋更進一步﹕話比病人知道佢哋可以做甚麼。 
Then we went to CRP test. ,我哋會幫佢哋洞悉 從而更有效作出選擇﹑採取行動。 
"In this case, it's a sin of omission. ",呢份就係我哋嘅基本血液報告。 
"They have this huge amount of space, and they don't use it for anything, so we do. ",跟住我哋再來睇一份C反應蛋白測試。 
"Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test, or in conjunction with a cholesterol test. ",今次就係一個嚴重缺失嘅例子。 
"So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page, which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. ",呢度上面有一大片空白， 既然佢哋冇善用，我哋就嚟將空白加以利用。 
So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. ,目前﹐C反應蛋白測試通常 都用作跟進膽固醇測試， 或者與膽固醇測試一齊進行。 
"It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed, which might be a risk for heart disease. ",因此我們大膽地 將膽固醇測試結果放於在同一頁上面， 因為醫生亦都係咁樣用資料作診斷。 
What you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language. ,所以我哋都覺得﹐病人亦都或者想知道有關來龍去脈。 
Then we use the information that's already in the lab report. ,呢個係當您血管有炎症嘅時候， 一種會被驗出來嘅蛋白質， 亦可能係存有患心臟病風險嘅反映。 
We use the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks. ,我哋用易明瞭嘅語言 去顯示報告上嘅信息。 
So we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is. ,然後我哋用上 化驗報告裡頭已存有嘅資訊。 
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test. ,我哋以病人嘅年齡﹑性別 去將佢哋嘅風險作出個人化嘅評估。 
"Here's the before, and here's the after. ",我哋用手上掌握嘅数據 進行一個非常簡單嘅計算， 網上已經有各式各樣類似嘅計算器﹐ 從而對實際風險作出預測。 
"Now a lot of our effort on this one -- as many of you probably know, a PSA test is a very controversial test. ",最後我展示嘅﹐係前列腺特異性抗原測試。 
"It's used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. ",呢份係修改之前嘅﹑呢份係修改之後嘅。 
And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that. ,我哋喺呢一份化驗報告上﹐下咗好大功夫 -- 大概好多人都知道 前列腺特異性抗原測試﹐係一項具有極度爭議嘅測試。 
We again personalized the risks. ,佢係用來檢測病人是否患有前列腺癌﹐ 但實際上有各種原因 會導致前列腺腫脹。 
"So this patient is in their 50s, so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is. ",因此我哋花咗好多時間 去指出呢一點。 
"In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that. ",同樣我哋會根據個人情況﹐去評估風險。 
"And then again, the follow-up actions. ",例如呢位病人50幾歲﹐ 我哋就能夠精確估計到 佢患前列腺癌嘅風險。 
"So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right. ",根據計算，呢個病例嘅風險大概係百分之二十五。 
That's what Wired magazine spent on this. ,然後又係要採取嘅對策。 
Why is Wired magazine doing this? ,我哋做這項工作嘅成本少於一萬美元。 
"(Laughter) Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, the two largest lab testing companies -- last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively. ",呢個數目就係《連線》雜誌於呢方面所花嘅成本。 
Now this is not a problem of resources; this is a problem of incentives. ,點解《連線》雜誌要做呢項工作呢？ 
"We need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company. ",（笑聲） Quest Diagnostics 以及 LabCorp﹐ 兩間最大規模嘅化驗公司 去年，佢哋分別賺得超過7億 以及5億美元。 
It should be the patient. ,咁樣睇嚟﹐呢個根本唔係資源嘅問題， 而係動機嘅問題。 
"It's the person who actually, in the end, is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors. ",我哋要認清楚﹐呢啲信息嘅目標 並唔應該係醫生，亦唔應該係保險公司， 
This is information that is incredibly powerful. ,而應該係病人。 
It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change. ,最後始終都係病人本身﹐ 要去為自己嘅人生作出改變﹐ 而開始去養成新嘅行為習慣。 
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. ,呢啲係具有無窮力量嘅信息。 
It's being lost. ,係能促使人類改變嘅強力催化劑。 
"So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask, because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. ",佢近在咫尺，但係我哋一直冇去將佢善用。 
But you can create your own feedback loop. ,佢不斷流失。 
Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions: Can I have my results? ,所以我只想提出四個問題 每個病人都應該要問呢啲問題 因為我冇指望有人真的會 實質地去製造呢類化驗報告。 
And the only acceptable answer is -- (Audience: Yes.) -- yes. ,但係您可以創造屬於自己嘅反饋環。 
What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is. ,任何人都可以透過問以下幾個簡單嘅問題﹐來創造自己嘅反饋環： 我可以取回我嘅測試結果嗎？ 
What are my options? What choices are now on the table? ,而呢個問題只能有一個可接受嘅答案，就係 —— （觀眾：可以）—— 可以。 
"And then, what's next? ",呢份報告說明乜嘢﹖請幫我理解呢啲數據代表乜嘢。 
How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life? ,我有邊啲選擇？邊啲做法係可行？ 
So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. ,然後又點樣﹖ 
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people. ,於未來嘅日子﹐我點樣可以將呢啲資料 運用於生活當中﹖ 
You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. ,結束之前﹐我想令大家知道， 每個人都有能力去理解呢啲信息。 
"Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information, if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. ",呢個並非超出普通人可理解嘅範圍。 
"And engagement is essential here, because it's not just giving them information; it's giving them an opportunity to act. ",無須擁有像在座各位嘅教育程度， 
That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. ,普通人已經可以理解呢啲信息， 只要我哋願意為信息嘅表達方面努力， 做到可以容許病人參與嘅模式。 
It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today. ,喺呢度﹐參與係關鍵因素， 因為不單止關乎向病人提供信息﹐ 更重要嘅係比佢哋行動嘅機會。 
And this information is out there. ,呢個就係參與嘅意義﹔與服從唔同。 
"I've been talking today about latent information, all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use. ",呢個同我哋所討論有關現今醫學界嘅行為﹐ 完全唔同。 
"But there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online, and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people, to help people and to change the course of their lives. ",而呢啲信息就在眼前。 
Thank you very much. ,我今日一直講及潛在嘅信息， 呢啲信息存在於呢個體系之中， 而我們卻未有加以利用。 
(Applause) ,但仍有大量各種其他信息 正逐漸可於網上取得。 我哋需要認清楚呢啲信息嘅力量， 去吸引人去參與﹑去幫助人， 而且去改變佢哋嘅生命路程。 
,多謝大家。 
"Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris, and the phone rang and I heard, ""Hey, JR, you won the TED Prize 2011. ",（掌聲） 
"You have to make a wish to save the world."" ",
I was lost. ,"兩個星期之前，我響巴黎工作室 聽到電話響，話 ""喂 JR... ...你贏左TED2011大獎... "
"I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can. ","...要許個願拯救地球喔。"" "
The world is fucked up. ,我即時呆左 
"Come on, you have dictators ruling the world, population is growing by millions, there's no more fish in the sea, the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said, we're all becoming fat. ",我唔識拯救世界呀，呢件事無人做得到 
(Laughter) Except maybe French people. ,宜家個世界真系亂到阿媽都唔認得。 
Whatever. ,你睇，呢個跟本就系獨裁者嘅天下 人口成百萬咁遞增 海裏面嘅魚無曬 北極啲冰都融埋 先頭嘅TED獲獎得主仲話 我地會越來越肥添。 
"So I called back and I told her, ""Look, Amy, tell the TED guys I just won't show up. ",（笑） 法國人會唔會例外呢。 
"I can't do anything to save the world."" ",是但啦。 
"She said, ""Hey, JR, your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."" ",跟住我打返電話俾佢 同佢講 “嗱，Amy， 你話俾TED班人知，我唔出現啦 
"Oh, all right. ",我救唔到地球呀。“ 
"(Laughter) ""That's cool."" ","佢就話，”JR呀， 你嘅願望又唔系拯救世界，系改變佢姐。"" "
"I mean, technology, politics, business do change the world -- not always in a good way, but they do. ",哦，咁啊 
What about art? ,（笑） ”甘好啦。“ 
Could art change the world? ,其實我發現科技、政治、商業 都響度改變世界-- 結果唔一定理想，但系一定有改變。 
I started when I was 15 years old. ,咁藝術呢？ 
"And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world. ",藝術系咪都可以改變世界？ 
"I was doing graffiti -- writing my name everywhere, using the city as a canvas. ",我從15歲開始搞創作 
"I was going in the tunnels of Paris, on the rooftops with my friends. ",當時無唸住要改變世界 
"Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure. ",就系玩開graffiti街頭噴畫-- 到處留名 將城市當成畫布 
"It was like leaving our mark on society, to say, ""I was here,"" on the top of a building. ",我會鑽入巴黎的隧道 又同朋友爬上樓頂 
"So when I found a cheap camera on the subway, I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies -- really small photos just that size. ",每次出去都好盡興 好刺激 
"That's how, at 17 years old, I started pasting them. ",感覺終於響呢個社會留底屬於我地自己嘅印記 響樓頂記低“本人到此一遊” 
"And I did my first ""expo de rue,"" which means sidewalk gallery. ",有一次我響地鐵執到部簡易相機 之後就開始拍低我同朋友嘅歷險記 然後將相片畀返佢地 啲相好細張，得咁大 
And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising. ,然之後，17歲嘅我就咁 開始左我嘅貼相生涯 
"I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine. ","搞左自己的第一個expo de rue 無非系一個""街頭影展” "
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people. ,我響每一張相片周圍涂左彩色框 路人就唔會以為系廣告 
I would control it directly with the public in the streets. ,我發現城市真系一個最佳畫廊 
So that's Paris. ,無必要出書 更加無必要搵畫廊 請專家鑒定 作品系咪夠好 夠吸引 
I would change -- depending on the places I would go -- the title of the exhibition. ,響大街度 可以更加直接 
That's on the Champs-Elysees. ,呢張系巴黎 
I was quite proud of that one. ,我會視乎 展出地點 調整主題。 
Because I was just 18 and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees. ,呢張系香榭麗舍大街 
"Then when the photo left, the frame was still there. ",呢張系我嘅得意之作 
(Laughter) November 2005: the streets are burning. ,因為嗰年我先18歲 就已經佔領香榭麗舍嘅頂峰。 
A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris. ,後來張相唔見左 相框仲留響度 
"Everyone was glued to the TV, watching disturbing, frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood. ",（笑） 2005年11月： 火燒街頭 
"I mean, these kids, without control, throwing Molotov cocktails, attacking the cops and the firemen, looting everything they could in the shops. ",大規模暴亂 響巴黎最舊的住宅區爆發 
"These were criminals, thugs, dangerous, destroying their own environment. ",人人睇電視追蹤 見到從住宅區周邊傳返來嘅影像 畫面令人擔憂又驚恐 
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? -- my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car -- a pasting I'd done a year earlier -- an illegal one -- still there. ,呢啲細路無人管教 起勢掟汽油炸彈 攻擊警察同消防隊 掃蕩商舖 
"I mean, these were the faces of my friends. ",呢班罪犯、歹徒同危險分子 用盡手段同環境抗爭 
I know those guys. ,忽然間我見到一樣嘢--有無可能啊？-- 畫面嘅牆上有一幅我貼嘅相 就響嗰部燒著嘅汽車後面-- 我一年前貼嘅-- 呢張非法張貼--仲響度 
"All of them are not angels, but they're not monsters either. ",相片裏面系我朋友嘅面孔 
So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television. ,我瞭解呢啲人 
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens. ,佢哋都唔系天使 但亦唔系惡魔 
It was the only one I had at that time. ,響電視度睇見啲眼望住自己 感覺有些少怪 
"But with that lens, you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person. ",於是我返返去 帶埋部28mm焦距相機 
So you can do it only with their trust. ,亦系我當時唯一一部相機 
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet. ,用佢影相 要靠埋個人物 離得25公分 
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves. ,所以攝影師一定要俾人信得過至影到相 
"And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name, age, even building number of these guys. ",我影左四張相，主角都系Le Bosquet波士基人 
"A year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris. ",佢地扮怪面嚇人 用搞笑誇張嘅方式表現自我 
"And we go from thug images, who've been stolen and distorted by the media, who's now proudly taking over his own image. ",跟住我將啲相整成巨幅海報 貼勻巴黎嘅bourgeois購物區 上面寫埋人物嘅姓名，年齡 連屋企嘅門牌號都有埋 
That's where I realized the power of paper and glue. ,一年之後 呢輯相片響巴黎市政廳前展出 
So could art change the world? ,對比起以前我地睇到嗰啲 經過媒體偷拍、扭曲嘅相 嗰日展出嘅一張張自豪嘅面龐 
"A year later, I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict. ",響一刻令我意識到 紙張同漿糊嘅力量 
"I mean, at that time, trust me, they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. ",藝術系咪都可以改變世界呢？ 
"So with my friend Marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis. ",時隔一年 我聽講中東地區衝突連連 傳黎各種聲音 
Are they so different? ,當時，我可以負責任咁講 所有話題都指向以色列同巴勒斯坦 
"When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media. ",所以我同朋友Marco 決定去現場 見識一下真正的巴勒斯坦人同真正的以色列人 
"So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks. ",佢地之間差別真系咁大咩？ 
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment. ,落腳之後我地出街 周圍同人傾計 發現事實同媒體嘅聲音 有些少差別 
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel. ,於是我地又決定影頭像 主角系從事同樣職業嘅 巴勒斯坦人同以色列人 -- 有的士司機、律師、同埋有廚師 -- 
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other. ,為表誠意 我地請佢地扮鬼 
I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall. ,唔系笑-- 因為笑面無辦法傳達人嘅心理狀態同感受 
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever. ,佢地都接受 將自己嘅相同對方嘅貼埋一齊 
We called the project Face 2 Face. ,我決定去8個以色列 同巴勒斯坦城市貼相 貼系牆嘅兩邊 
"The experts said, ""No way. ",我哋籌辦左有史以來最大型的非法藝術展 
The people will not accept. ,個名稱系：面對面 
"The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."" ",專家話 ”無可能[做到]... 
"We said, ""Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."" ","民眾唔會接受..."" "
"I love the way that people will ask me, ""How big will my photo be?"" ","...軍隊會開槍打你，同埋哈馬斯會綁架你哋。“ 
我哋就話 ”咁 我地試下可以行幾遠啦“ 
我最鍾意人哋問我 “到時我張相有幾大架？” 
”會同你間屋一樣咁大呀“ 
貼相上牆嘅時候，我地響巴勒斯坦 
帶埋條梯到現場， 先發現條梯唔夠高。 
於是幾個巴勒斯坦人話， “唔好心急，等陣。我幫你搞掂佢” 
佢跑到一個基督教堂 扛左一條舊梯返黎 條梯真系舊到不得了，我估可能系耶穌時期傳落黎嘅 
（笑） 系6個朋友嘅幫助之下，我哋完成左”面對面“ 兩條梯，兩把刷 一架租返黎嘅車，一部相機 仲有20000平方英寸嘅纸 
我哋得到各行各業嘅人 各式各樣嘅幫助。 
就好似呢張巴勒斯坦相甘， 
我哋當時系拉馬拉 
貼緊相 -- 兩張相都貼系熱鬧嘅市場 
啲人圍住我哋，問我哋 ”你哋系到做緊咩呀？“ 
“哦，我哋搞緊藝術呀 我哋宜家將做同一個工作嘅以色列人同巴勒斯坦人嘅相貼埋一齊。 
呢兩個就系的士司機喇。” 
呢個時候啲人就會驚左。 
“你嘅意思系你系度 -- 貼緊以色列人嘅相？ "
It will be as big as your house. ,“哦，系呀，系呀，系呢個藝術嘅一部分黎架。” 
"When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side. ",呢個時候，我會俾佢地睇一陣， 然後問佢地， “你可唔可以話我聽邊個打邊個呀？” 
So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough. ,而佢地大部分都講唔出。 
"And so Palestinians guys say, ""Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."" ",（鼓掌） 我哋甚至系以色列嘅軍事防禦塔到貼左相， 咩都無發生。 
So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born. ,當你貼一張相嘅時候，佢只不過系紙同漿糊。 
"(Laughter) We did Face 2 Face with only six friends, two ladders, two brushes, a rented car, a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper. ",啲人可以搣左佢，貼野系上面，甚至可以系上面尿尿 不過有啲太高啦，我諗應該尿唔到 -- 但系街上面嘅人， 佢哋就系策展人。 
We had all sorts of help from all walks of life. ,遇到落雨打風，啲相遲早會唔見 
"Okay, for example, that's Palestine. ",我本來就無打算要佢哋留系到。 
We're in Ramallah right now. ,不過正正4年之後， 果啲相大多數仲系到。 
We're pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market. ,”面對面“證實左 有啲我哋覺得唔可能嘅事系可能發生嘅 -- 而且，你知唔知呀？好易架咋。 
"People come around us and start asking, ""What are you doing here?"" ",我哋無挑戰界限， 我哋只不過系證明我哋做到嘅野比啲人諗嘅遠。 
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job. 
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers. ",系中東，我系[好多]博物館 展出我嘅作品。 
And then there was always a silence. ,系街展覽呢個方向 有啲搞笑。 
You mean you're pasting an Israeli face -- doing a face -- right here? ,於是我決定繼續向呢個方向發展 去啲無博物館嘅地方。 
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project. ",當你行入呢啲發展中嘅社會， 你會發現女人系佢地社區嘅支柱， 不過男人仲系條街嘅話事人。 
"And I would always leave that moment, and we would ask them, ""So can you tell me who is who?"" ",於是我哋啟發左要創作一個項目 等啲男人通過啲相 向女人致敬。 
And most of them couldn't say. ,我叫呢個項目做《婦女系英雄》 
"(Applause) We even pasted on Israeli military towers, and nothing happened. ",當我聽到果啲故事嘅時候 系任何我去過嘅地方， 我唔系次次都明 衝突嘅複雜情況， 
"When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue. ",我淨系觀察。 
"People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that, I agree -- but the people in the street, they are the curator. ",有時候系無文字， 無句子，只有眼淚。 
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway. ,我影左佢地嘅相 貼左出黎。 
They are not meant to stay. ,《婦女系英雄》帶我走遍世界。 
"But exactly four years after, the photos, most of them are still there. ",我去左好多地方。 我決定去果度 系因為我系媒體上面聽過。 
"Face 2 Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible -- and, you know what, even easy. ",好似2008年6月 我系巴黎睇電視， 聽到系 里約熱內盧發生嘅慘案。 巴西嘅第一個貧民窟叫做Providencia 
We didn't push the limit; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought. ,三個細路，系三個學生黎嘅， 被軍隊扣押 因為佢地無帶身份證明 
"In the Middle East, I experienced my work in places without [many] museums. ",軍隊抓住佢地 無將佢地送去警局， 反而將佢地送左去一個同佢地有仇嘅貧民窟 於是佢地俾人斬到一碌碌。 
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting. ,我好震驚。 
So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums. ,所有巴西人都好震驚。 
"When you go in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community, but the men are still the ones holding the streets. ",我聽講呢個系最暴力嘅貧民窟之一 因為最大嘅販毒集團掌控呢個區域。 
So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos. ,所以我決定去果度。 
I called that project Women Are Heroes. ,當我抵達嘅時候 -- 我嘅意思系，我無同任何NGO取得聯繫。 
"When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents, I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict. ",果度咩都無 -- 無旅行社，無NGO，咩都無 -- 連證人都無。 
I just observed. ,我哋周圍行， 然後遇到一個女人， 我俾我本書佢睇。 
"Sometimes there was no words, no sentence, just tears. ",然後佢同我講，”你知唔知呀？ 
I just took their pictures and pasted them. ,我哋好文化飢渴呀。 
Women Are Heroes took me around the world. ,我哋呢度需要文化。” 
"Most of the places I went to, I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media. ",我從幫小朋友影相開始。 
"So for example, in June 2008, I was watching TV in Paris, and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro -- the first favela of Brazil named Providencia. ",我淨系拍左幾張小朋友嘅相， 第二日我攞住張海報過黎，貼上去。 
Three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers. ,第三日已經俾人搣左喇。 
"And the army took them, and instead of bringing them to the police station, they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces. ",不過，唔緊要啦。 
I was shocked. ,我就系想俾佢地覺得啲藝術系佢地嘅。 
All Brazil was shocked. ,第四日，我系主要嘅廣場開左個會 有哋婦女黎左。 
"I heard it was one of the most violent favelas, because the largest drug cartel controls it. ",佢地都系同果三個比人殺死嘅細路有關。 
So I decided to go there. ,有細路嘅阿媽，阿婆，好朋友。 佢地全部都想大叫甘講個故事出黎。 
"When I arrived -- I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO. ",果日之後， 每個貧民窟嘅人都對我開左綠燈。 
"There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing -- no eyewitnesses. ",我影左更多相，終於開始左個計劃。 
"So we just walked around, and we met a woman, and I showed her my book. ",啲毒販對於我哋系到影相 有啲擔心。 我同佢哋講，“你哋知唔知呀？ 
"And she said, ""You know what? ",我對暴力同武器無興趣。 
We're hungry for culture. ,你系媒體度都見到啦。 
"We need culture out there."" ",我要展示呢到嘅美好生活。 
So I went out and I started with the kids. ,"而過去幾日我真系見到。"" "
"I just took a few photos of the kids, and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them. ",呢張好有代表性， 因為呢個系第一張你系城市見唔到嘅相。 
"The day after, I came back and they were already scratched. ",三個細路就系o系呢到俾人抓左， 張相入面就系其中一個人嘅阿婆。 
But that's okay. ,而呢條樓梯， 就系啲毒販成日黎嘅地方。 呢度成日都交火。 
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them. ,個個都明白個計劃系咩意思。 
"Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square and some women came. ",然後我哋將啲相貼滿左成個山。 
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed. ,（掌聲） 有趣嘅系媒體過唔到黎。 
"There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend -- they all wanted to shout the story. ",我嘅意思系，你可以理解。 
"After that day, everyone in the favela gave me the green light. ",佢地系從好遠嘅距離嘅直升機上面影我哋， 要用果種好長嘅鏡頭， 然後我哋可以系電視機見到自己貼緊相。 
"I took more photos, and we started the project. ","而且佢地仲寫左個電話，話：“如果你知道 果度發生左咩事，請打呢個電話。"" "
"The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, ""You know what? ",我哋做完個計劃就走左 所以媒體唔知道發生咩事。 
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons. ,甘點樣可以了解呢個計劃呢？ 
You see that enough in the media. ,所以佢地去左搵啲女人 從佢地果到得到解釋。 
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy. ,甘樣，你就創造左一個媒體 同埋無名氏婦女之間嘅橋樑。 
"I've been seeing it around me the last few days."" ",我哋繼續旅行。 
"So that's a really symbolic pasting, because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city. ",一路去左非洲、蘇丹、塞拉热昂、 利比里亞、肯尼亞。 
"And that's where the three kids got arrested, and that's the grandmother of one of them. ",系好似蒙羅維亞啲戰火紛飛嘅地方， 啲人會直接走到你面前。 
"And on that stairs, that's where the traffickers always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire. ",姐系，佢哋想知道你黎呢到做咩。 
Everyone there understood the project. ,佢地不停問我，”你黎呢到有咩目的？ 
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill. ,"你系咪NGO嘅人呀？你系咪媒體呀？"" "
(Applause) What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in. ,藝術，搞藝術咋。 
"I mean, you should see that. ","有啲人問，""點解系黑白架？ "
"They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens, and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting. ",法國無顏色咩？” 
"And they would put a number: ""Please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia."" ","（笑） 有時佢地會問，""呢啲人系咪死左呀？"" "
We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn't know. ,有哋人睇得明，就會同其他人解釋。 
So how can we know about the project? ,我聽到有個人同個唔明嘅人解釋， “嗱，你企系到幾個鐘 冥思苦想，同你嘅同伴討論。 
So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them. ,系呢段時間，你從來都無諗過 聽日食啲咩。 
So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women. ,"甘就系藝術啦。"" "
We kept traveling. ,我覺得系啲人嘅好奇心 激發佢地 去參與呢個計劃。 
"We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya. ",所以個計劃先會越來越多。 
"In war-torn places like Monrovia, people come straight to you. ",變成一種慾望，一種需要，一種[聽唔清楚]。 
"I mean, they want to know what you're up to. ",系蒙羅維亞嘅橋上面， 一個曾經系叛軍嘅軍人幫我哋貼一張相 呢張相系一個系戰爭中被軍隊強姦嘅婦女。 
"They kept asking me, ""What is the purpose of your project? ",系衝突之中 婦女總系最早嘅受害者。 
"Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"" ",呢到系这是肯尼亞的基貝拉， 非洲最大嘅貧民窟之一。 
Art. Just doing art. ,你或者見過2008選舉後發生 嘅一啲畫面。 
"Some people question, ""Why is it in black and white? ",今次我哋從房頂落手， 不過我哋無用紙， 因為紙一落雨就無左 唔可以幫啲屋擋雨 -- 乙烯基塑料就得喇。 
"Don't you have color in France?"" ",呢個時候藝術有實際用途。 
"(Laughter) Or they tell you, ""Are these people all dead?"" ",啲人保留左佢地。 
Some who understood the project would explain it to others. ,我最鍾意嘅系當你睇到最大果隻眼嘅時候， 你可以看到眼睛果到有好多屋。 
"And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say, ""You know, you've been here for a few hours trying to understand, discussing with your fellows. ",幾個月前我去左果度 -- 啲相仲系到 -- 不過眼睛入面有一塊唔見左。 
"During that time, you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow. ",我問啲人發生咩事。 
"This is art."" ",“哦，果個人搬左屋呀。” 
I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects. ,（笑） 當我哋將啲乙烯基塑料鋪系屋頂嘅時候，有個女人同我哋講笑， ”宜家上帝可以見到我啦。“ 
And then it becomes more. ,你宜家再睇基貝拉， 佢地都會睇返你 
"It becomes a desire, a need, an armor. ",好啦，印度。 
"On this bridge that's in Monrovia, ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war. ",我開始講之前，你要知道， 我們每一次去一個地方，都無旅遊顧問， 所以我哋搞到好似突擊隊甘 -- 我哋一班人去到果個地方， 到左就想辦法講啲相貼到牆上面。 
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict. ,不過有啲地方你唔可以就甘貼野系牆。 
"This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa. ",系印度想貼野系無可能嘅。 
You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008. ,我聽講系文化同埋法律嘅原因， 如果我們系牆貼左野，就會即刻俾人拉。 
"This time we covered the roofs of the houses, but we didn't use paper, because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house -- vinyl does. ",於是我哋決定貼白色， 系牆上貼白紙。 
Then art becomes useful. ,你想像下一班人系牆到貼白紙。 
So the people kept it. ,有人過黎問我哋， “喂，你哋搞緊咩呀？” 
"You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there, there are so [many] houses inside. ",“哦，無野，搞緊藝術。” “藝術？” 
And I went there a few months ago -- photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye. ,當然，佢地好唔知點甘嘅樣。 
So I asked the people what happened. ,不過你知啦，印度條街好多塵架嘛， 越多塵 系空氣到飄下飄下， 系白紙到都見到甘制， 不過有啲位系有粘性嘅 就好似你反轉張貼紙甘。 
"Oh, that guy just moved. ",所以越多塵，就越可以見到張相。 
"(Laughter) When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke, ""Now God can see me."" ",之後幾日我哋系條街到行 就見到啲相自己顯現左出黎。 
"When you look at Kibera now, they look back. ",（掌聲） 多謝。 
"Okay, India. ",所以我哋今次無俾人抓住。 
"Before I start that, just so you know, each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization, so we set up like commandos -- we're a group of friends who arrive there, and we try to paste on the walls. ",呢個計劃，系《婦女系英雄》 一條片。 
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall. ,（音樂） （好） 
In India it was just impossible to paste. ,我哋將每一個計劃 都整左一條片。 
"I heard culturally and because of the law, they would just arrest us at the first pasting. ",呢個系《婦女系英雄》嘅預告片 -- 有形象、相片， 一張一張排起。 
"So we decided to paste white, white on the walls. ",就是我哋唔系到，啲相都會繼續旅行。 
So imagine white guys pasting white papers. ,（笑） （掌聲） 希望你哋有機會睇到呢條片， 然後你就會明白呢個計劃嘅範圍 同埋啲人見到啲相有咩感覺。 
"So people would come to us and ask us, ""Hey, what are you up to?"" ",呢個系計劃更重要嘅一部分。每一張相都有層次。 
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art. ""Art?"" ",每張相都有故事。 
"Of course, they were confused. ",《婦女系英雄》呢個計劃為社區 增加左新嘅活力， 呢啲婦女系我哋走左之後仲繼續保持呢種活力。 
"But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker. ",例如，我哋整左啲書 -- 非賣品 -- 全個社區都可以得到。 
"So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo. ",不過想要就要攞本書俾其中一個女人簽名。 
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves. ,好多地方我哋都甘做。 
(Applause) Thank you. ,我哋定時定候就會返去。 
So we didn't get caught this time. ,包括果個貧民窟， 我哋系果到有一個固定嘅中心。 
Each project -- that's a film from Women Are Heroes. ,系基貝拉，每年我哋都會整多啲相系房頂。 
(Music) Okay. ,因為，每一次我哋走果陣，有啲人嘅房頂就系我哋個計劃旁邊， 佢地話：“喂，我個屋頂呢？” 
For each project we do a film. ,於是我哋決定第二年再去過 繼續做呢個計劃。 
"And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from ""Women Are Heroes"" -- its images, photography, taken one after the other. ",對我黎講，好重要嘅一點系 我無用任何品牌或者公司嘅贊助。 
And the photos kept traveling even without us. ,所以我對其他人無責任 除左對自己 仲有呢個主題。 
"(Laughter) (Applause) Hopefully, you'll see the film, and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos. ",（掌聲） 對我黎講 亦系我工作中最重要嘅事 
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo. ,我覺得，宜家， 事情嘅結果同你做事嘅方式一樣重要。 
Behind each image is a story. ,而呢個總系工作嘅一部分。 
"Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities, and the women kept that dynamic after we left. ",有趣嘅系我會將圖像同廣告 明確甘分開。 
"For example, we did books -- not for sale -- that all the community would get. ",上個禮拜，我哋系洛杉磯 貼左啲相，開始左一個新計劃。 
"But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women. ",佢地甚至邀請我將啲相貼到加州現代藝術博物館。 
We did that in most of the places. ,不過尋日，市政府嘅人打電話俾我 ，話 “睇黎，我哋要將佢地搣左佢。 
We go back regularly. ,因為啲人會覺得我哋做緊廣告， 法律唔俾呀， 以一定要攞落黎。“ 
"And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela, we have a cultural center running there. ",不過唔該話我知，我哋做緊咩廣告？ 
"In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs. ",俾我影相嘅人 好自豪甘黎參加呢個計劃 好自豪可以系社區展示佢地嘅相。 
"Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project said, ""Hey, what about my roof?"" ",佢地只有一個好基本嘅要求。 
So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project. ,"佢地話，”求下你啦，俾我哋嘅故事同你一齊旅行。"" "
A really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors. ,所以我做左。呢到系巴黎。 
So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects. ,呢到系里約。 
(Applause) And that is for me one of the more important things in the work. ,每一個地方，我哋都用一個故事做展覽，然後呢個故事開始傳播。 
"I think, today, as important as the result is the way you do things. ",你會理解成個計劃嘅範圍。 
And that has always been a central part of the work. ,呢到系倫敦， 
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising. ,紐約。 
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks. ,今日，佢地系長島，同你一齊。 
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum. ,好啦，最近我開始左另外一項公共藝術項目 今次我唔用自己嘅作品喇。 
"But yesterday the city called them and said, ""Look, you're going to have to tear it down. ","我用Man Ray, Helen Levitt Gracomelli，其他人嘅作品。 "
"Because this can be taken for advertising, and because of the law, it has to be taken down."" ",系唔系你嘅相唔緊要。 
"But tell me, advertising for what? ",重要嘅系你用啲相 黎做咩， 佢貼嘅地方有咩用意。 
The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community. ,舉例，我貼左一張尖塔嘅相 系瑞士， 因為佢地系幾個禮拜之前投票通過禁止國內起尖塔嘅法律。 
But they asked me for a promise basically. ,（掌聲） 呢張有三個帶住防毒面具男人嘅相， 系o系Chernobyl影嘅， 我將佢貼系意大利南部， 果度啲黑手黨成日將啲垃圾埋系地下。 
"They asked me, ""Please, make our story travel with you."" ",從某啲方面黎講，藝術系可以改變世界嘅。 
So I did. That's Paris. ,藝術本身唔系為左改變世界， 唔系為左去改變具體的事， 而系去改變觀點。 
That's Rio. ,藝術可以改變 我哋睇世界嘅方式。 
"In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled. ",藝術可以創造一種類比。 
You understand the full scope of the project. ,事實上藝術改變唔到事態 藝術處於中立地帶 為交流同討論提供環境， 令到改變世界變得可能。 
That's London. ,系我創作嘅時候， 一般會遇到兩種反應。 
New York. ,有人會話：”噢，你不如去伊拉克或者阿富汗啦... 
"And today, they are with you in Long Beach. ",響嗰邊一定好有用。“ 
"All right, recently I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore. ",又有人問 ”我哋可以點幫你？“ 
"I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt, Giacomelli, other people's artwork. ",我諗你哋似乎系屬於第二類， 其實系好事 因為呢個計劃， 我要請大家影相 然後貼出黎。 
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not. ,所以我宜家嘅心願系： (敲鼓動作) （笑） 我希望各位積極參與 通過呢個全球性的藝術項目 表現你最關切的人物事件， 我哋一齊顛覆世界。 
"The importance is what you do with the images, the statement it makes where it's pasted. ",而家就開始 
"So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country. ",從在座的每一位開始 就系你 
"(Applause) This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally, and I pasted it in Southern Italy, where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground. ",仲有屏幕另一邊嘅每一位觀眾 
"In some ways, art can change the world. ",我希望呢個願望 可以從呢一分鐘開始實行。 
"Art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions. ",揀一個你心動嘅主題 搵一位有精彩故事嘅人物 或者你自己張相 -- 話我知 你嘅觀點。 
Art can change the way we see the world. ,影啲相，影啲人像， 放上網--我會講明細節-- 跟住等我寄返張海報俾你。一班人一齊 將現實展示俾全世界。 
Art can create an analogy. ,所以嘅資料都系呢個網站： insideoutproject.net 網站今日會上線。 
"Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables you to change the world. ",我哋見到嘅野會改變我哋。 
"When I do my work, I have two kinds of reactions. ",當我哋一齊行動， 團體嘅效應遠遠超出個人嘅總和 
"People say, ""Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan. ",所以我希望，我哋可以一齊創造 一啲世界會記得嘅事。 
"They would be really useful."" ",宜家開始啦，靠曬你。 
"Or, ""How can we help?"" ",多謝。 
"I presume that you belong to the second category, and that's good, because for that project, I'm going to ask you to take the photos and paste them. ",(掌聲) 多謝大家 
"So now my wish is: (mock drum roll) (Laughter) I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project, and together we'll turn the world inside out. ",（掌聲） 
And this starts right now. ,
"Yes, everyone in the room. ",我知道你哋諗咩 
Everyone watching. ,你哋覺得我走錯咗上台 然後有人會好快帶我返落去 
I wanted that wish to actually start now. ,（掌聲） 我喺杜拜成日會遇上呢啲問題︰ 
"So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for. ",「嚟呢度度假吖？」 
"Take the photos, the portraits, upload it -- I'll give you all the details -- and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups and reveal things to the world. ",（笑聲） 「嚟探小朋友吖？你會留幾耐？」 
The full data is on the website -- insideoutproject.net -- that is launching today. ,其實我想留耐啲 
What we see changes who we are. ,我喺波斯灣生活同教書已經超過 30 年啦 
"When we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts. ",（掌聲） 呢 30 年裏面，我睇到好多變化 
"So I hope that, together, we'll create something that the world will remember. ",宜家呢份數據幾嚇人 
And this starts right now and depends on you. ,而我今日要講嘅係 語言消失同埋英語全球化 
Thank you. ,我想講一講我朋友 喺阿布扎比教大人英文 
(Applause) Thank you. ,喺一個晴天嘅日子，佢帶學生去花園 喺嗰度教學生一啲大自然嘅詞彙 
(Applause) ,但最後卻變成我朋友 學曬所有當地植物嘅阿拉伯名 同埋植物用途 例如用喺藥物、化妝品 烹飪用途、草藥 
,呢啲學生點樣得到呢啲知識嘅呢？ 
I know what you're thinking. ,當然係由佢哋嘅祖父母 甚至曾祖父母獲得架啦 
"You think I've lost my way, and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat. ",所以跨世代溝通我唔需多講有幾重要 
(Applause) I get that all the time in Dubai. ,但遺憾嘅 今日好多語言正以前所未有嘅速度消失 
"Here on holiday are you, dear? ",每 14 日就有一種語言消失 
"(Laughter) ""Come to visit the children? ",與此同時 英文卻無庸置疑成為國際語言 
"Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet. ",當中有關聯嗎？ 我唔知 
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years. ,但我知我見證好多轉變 
"(Applause) And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes. ",當我第一次嚟到波斯灣，我去咗科威特 當時英文老師仍然唔係一份好工 
Now that statistic is quite shocking. ,其實，我嚟呢度做嘢唔係好耐之前 
And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English. ,但做老師唔太好係講緊更加早之前 
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi. ,總之，英國文化協會 請咗我同其他 25 位老師 
"And one fine day, she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary. ",我哋係第一批喺科威特嘅國立學校 任教嘅非穆斯林老師 
"But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants, as well as their uses -- medicinal uses, cosmetics, cooking, herbal. ",我哋被派到嗰度教英文 係因為當地政府希望國家可以現代化 同埋提升公民嘅教育水平 
How did those students get all that knowledge? ,當然，英國從中獲得石油財富 
"Of course, from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents. ",言歸正傳 
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations. ,"我見過最大嘅改變, 就係英語教學 由原本大家互惠互利嘅經濟手段 演變成今日全世界大規模嘅生意 "
"But sadly, today, languages are dying at an unprecedented rate. ",英語唔再係學校課程裡面嘅外語科目 亦唔再只係英國嘅專利 英語教學嘅商機已經成為 所有英語國家想分一杯匙嘅嘢 
A language dies every 14 days. ,點解唔係呢？ 
"Now, at the same time, English is the undisputed global language. ",畢竟，根據最新嘅世界大學排名 最好嘅教育嚟自英國同美國嘅大學 
Well I don't know. ,所以自然每個人都想接受英語教育 
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes. ,但如果你嘅母語唔係英文 你就要考英文試 
"When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post. ",但單憑英語能力決定收唔收學生 咁樣做啱嗎？ 
"Actually, not that long ago. ",譬如有一位電腦科學家，佢係天才嚟嘅 
That is a little bit too early. ,但他需唔需要有律師一樣嘅語言能力？ 
"But nevertheless, I was recruited by the British Council, along with about 25 other teachers. ",我唔覺得要 
And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait. ,但身為英語老師嘅我哋 卻總係拒絕收呢啲人 
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education. ,我哋喺佢個人發展嘅路上處處設限 將學生擋喺路上 
"And of course, the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth. ",令佢哋無法追求自己嘅夢想 直至佢哋通過咗英文考試 我哋至畀佢過 
Okay. ,容我換個方式講 如果我遇到一位只會講荷蘭文嘅人 而呢個人能夠醫好癌症 我會阻止佢入英國大學嗎？我諗唔會 
Now this is the major change that I've seen -- how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today. ,但事實上，我哋的確咁樣做 
"No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum, and no longer the sole domain of mother England, it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth. ",我哋英語老師嘅工作就係把關 
And why not? ,學生必須先令我哋覺得佢哋嘅英文夠好 我哋至會畀佢哋上 
"After all, the best education -- according to the latest World University Rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S. ",但咁樣可以係危險嘅 因為社會將太多權力交畀一小撮人 
"So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally. ",或者呢種升學障礙全世界都有 
"But if you're not a native speaker, you have to pass a test. ",我聽到你哋話 「咁研究呢？佢哋全部都用英文。」 
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone? ,書藉用英文寫 期刊都係用英文寫 但呢個只係自我滿足嘅情況 
Perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius. ,有英語需求自然就有英語供給 
"Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example? ",所以英語出版長做長有 
"Well, I don't think so. ",我想問大家，翻譯發生咗啲咩呢？ 
We English teachers reject them all the time. ,如果你哋諗返伊斯蘭嘅黃金時代 當時翻譯盛行 
"We put a stop sign, and we stop them in their tracks. ",啲人將拉丁文同希臘文 翻譯成阿拉伯文或波斯文 然後再由阿拉伯文同波斯文翻譯成 歐洲日耳曼系以及羅曼系嘅語言 
"They can't pursue their dream any longer, 'til they get English. ",可以話文明照亮咗歐洲嘅黑暗時代 
"Now let me put it this way: if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer, would I stop him from entering my British University? ",但唔好會咗意，我唔係反對英語教學 尤其在座咁多位英語老師喺度 
"But indeed, that is exactly what we do. ",我好高興我哋有一個國際語言 
We English teachers are the gatekeepers. ,國際語言今時今日更加需要 
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough. ,但我反對用英語阻止他人升學發展 
Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society. ,唔通我哋真希望世界剩返 600 種語言 其中以英文或者中文做主流？ 
Maybe the barrier would be too universal. ,世界需要更多語言 
"But, I hear you say, ""what about the research? ",咁幾多語言先至夠多呢？ 呢個制度將成績同英語水平畫上等號 咁係相當武斷嘅 
"So the books are in English, the journals are done in English, but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. ",（掌聲） 我想提醒各位 站在巨人肩膀嘅當代知識分子 唔需要識英文或者通過英語考試 
It feeds the English requirement. ,愛因斯坦就係其中一個例子 
And so it goes on. ,順便講下，愛因斯坦曾被學校認為 係需要補救嘅學生 因為佢有讀寫障礙 
"I ask you, what happened to translation? ",但佢當時嘅世界好好彩 佢唔需要通過英語考試 
"If you think about the Islamic Golden Age, there was lots of translation then. ",因為美國英語測驗托福 1964 年先至開始 
"They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic, into Persian, and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages. ",宜家英語測試氾濫 
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe. ,有太多英語測試 
"Now don't get me wrong; I am not against teaching English, all you English teachers out there. ",甚至每年過百萬嘅學生都參加呢啲考試 
I love it that we have a global language. ,宜家你會認為呢啲考試費用唔貴 價錢合理咁 但對於幾百萬窮人嚟講 呢啲考試太過奢侈 
We need one today more than ever. ,所以考試令到好多人卻步 
But I am against using it as a barrier. ,（掌聲） 呢樣令我諗起最近睇到嘅 一個新聞標題： 「教育：分開人嘅工具」 
"Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese? ",我終於明白點解 大家都想焦點擺喺英語度 
We need more than that. Where do we draw the line? ,因為佢哋想孩子得到最好嘅機會 
"This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English, which is quite arbitrary. ",為咗達成，佢哋需要畀孩子西方教育 
"(Applause) And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English, they didn't have to pass an English test. ",畢竟，唔可否認 最好嘅工都係留返畀 西方大學畢業出嚟嘅人 就好似我之前所講咁 
"Case in point, Einstein. ",呢個係一種循環 
"He, by the way, was considered remedial at school because he was, in fact, dyslexic. ",等我講兩位科學家嘅故事 
"But fortunately for the world, he did not have to pass an English test. ",有兩位英國科學家做一項 用到動物前後肢嘅遺傳學實驗 
"Because they didn't start until 1964 with TOEFL, the American test of English. ",但佢哋得唔到佢哋想要嘅結果 
Now it's exploded. ,佢哋唔知點算 直到嚟咗一位德國科學家 佢發現前肢同後肢喺英文裡面 係兩隻唔同嘅字 但遺傳學同德文都唔會分 
There are lots and lots of tests of English. ,所以，得咗！ 問題解決咗 
And millions and millions of students take these tests every year. ,如果你諗唔到嘢，你會卡喺度 
"Now you might think, you and me, ""Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,"" but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people. ",但如果用另一種語言可以諗到嗰樣嘢 講唔同語言嘅我哋就可以透過合作 達到目的，學到更多 
"So immediately, we're rejecting them. ",我個囡由科威特嚟到英格蘭 
"(Applause) It brings to mind a headline I saw recently: ""Education: The Great Divide."" ",因為佢喺阿拉伯讀中學 
"Now I get it, I understand why people would want to focus on English. ",佢用阿拉伯文讀科學同數學 
They want to give their children the best chance in life. ,喺英國文法學校裡面 佢要翻譯所有嘢做英文 
"And to do that, they need a Western education. ",而佢呢兩科擺全班第一 
"Because, of course, the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities, that I put on earlier. ",呢樣話畀我哋聽，當外國學生嚟搵我哋 我哋未必有按到佢哋所知道嘅嘢畀足分 因為佢哋用佢哋自己嘅語言 去講佢哋知道嘅嘢 
It's a circular thing. ,當一個語言消失 我哋唔肯定有咩係同個語言一齊消失 
"Let me tell you a story about two scientists, two English scientists. ",呢個…我唔知大家最近有冇睇 CNN 佢哋頒咗一個英雄獎 畀一位年輕嘅肯亞牧童 同村裡面其他小朋友一樣 佢無辦法夜晚讀書 因為火水燈產生嘅煙霧會整傷佢隻眼 
They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals. ,再者，佢冇足夠火水 畢竟每日只有一蚊美金嘅收入 你可以買到啲咩？ 
But they couldn't get the results they wanted. ,所以他發明咗唔使成本嘅太陽能燈 
"They really didn't know what to do, until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb, whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German. ",宜家佢條村嘅細路仔嘅成績 同屋企有電嘅細路仔成績都一樣 
"So bingo, problem solved. ",（掌聲） 當佢攞到個獎時 他講咗呢番可愛嘅說話： 「呢啲孩子可以帶領非洲 由宜家呢刻一塊黑暗大陸 走冋明日光明一片嘅大陸。」 
"If you can't think a thought, you are stuck. ",一個簡單嘅諗法卻有著咁深遠嘅影響 
"But if another language can think that thought, then, by cooperating, we can achieve and learn so much more. ",無論屋止冇光定係英文唔好 都通過唔到我哋嘅測試 而且我哋永遠無辦法知道佢哋知嘅嘢 
My daughter came to England from Kuwait. ,唔好畀佢哋同我哋自己處身於黑暗裡邊 
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic. ,等我哋一齊為語言多元化歡呼 
It's an Arabic-medium school. ,好好保護你母語 
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school. ,用佢嚟傳播偉大嘅諗法 
And she was the best in the class at those subjects. ,（掌聲） 多謝 
"Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad, we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know, and they know it in their own language. ",（掌聲） 
"When a language dies, we don't know what we lose with that language. ",
"This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently -- they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn't study at night in his village, like all the village children, because the kerosene lamp, it had smoke and it damaged his eyes. ",細個果陣 我就鐘意汽車 
"And anyway, there was never enough kerosene, because what does a dollar a day buy for you? ",18歲果陣 我最好噶一位朋友係車禍中喪生。 
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp. ,好似咁， 
And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home. ,於是決定投身 拯救每年 一百萬人噶生命 
"(Applause) When he received his award, he said these lovely words: ""The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent."" ",目前還未成功，所以哩個只係一個進度報告， 今日我想同你地介紹噶係無人駕駛汽車。 
"A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences. ",我第一次聽講哩個概念果陣係 美國政府係DARPA大挑戰中 懸賞建造一輛 可以在沙漠入邊導航噶無人駕駛汽車。 
"People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know. ",即使當時有100家團隊， 果D汽車都未完成過。 
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark. ,因此我決定係斯坦福大學建造一輛無人駕駛汽車。 
Let us celebrate diversity. ,我地搭建軟硬件。 
Mind your language. ,令距向我地學習 同時自由係沙漠中奔馳。 
Use it to spread great ideas. ,意想唔到噶事發生左： 距成爲左第一輛 可以完成DARPA大挑戰噶汽車—— 爲斯坦福大學贏到20萬美金。 
(Applause) Thank you very much. ,不過我仲係未能拯救到一條生命。 
(Applause) ,果次之後， 我地噶任務轉向左 可以在任何地方自動駕駛噶汽車—— 係加州任意一條街道上。 
,我地已經行駛左14萬英里。 
"As a boy, I loved cars. ",車上噶傳感器會 魔幻般檢視 周圍一切 同時會做出 駕駛方向決策。 
"When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident. ",距噶駕駛技術太剄了。 
Like this. ,我地駛過 好似三藩市感噶城市， 
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. ,我地係1好高速公路上從三藩市開到洛杉磯。 
"Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. ",我地遇到過慢跑者、 繁忙噶高速公路、收費站， 成個過程都戲無人操縱噶； 汽車自己駕駛。 
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert. ,事實上，甚至無人注意到 我地駛過14萬英里 
"And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere. ",無論係山路、 白天黑夜， 還係三藩市崎嶇噶 Lombard街道。 
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car. ,（笑聲） 有時我地噶汽車會好瘋狂， 有D雜技表演噶味道。 
We built the hardware and the software. ,（視頻）A：噢，上帝！ 
"We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert. ",乜啊？ 
"And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars. ",B:距自動駕駛緊 
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. ,ST：今日我無辦法令我噶朋友Harold重生， 但係我可以爲果D死去噶人做些野。 
"Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California. ",你知唔知交通意外係 年輕人死亡噶頭號殺手嗎？ 
"We've driven 140,000 miles. ",你有無意識到 幾乎所有噶事故都係由於人爲錯誤 而唔係機器及其鼓掌導致嗎？ 你有無意識到我地可以通過機器來阻止感樣噶後果？ 
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. ,你知唔知 假如我地唔再依賴人類 選擇車道噶精確度 可以將高速公路噶容納量 提高兩到三倍—— 優化車輛噶位置 令距地可以係較窄噶車道上 行駛， 以及減少高速公路上噶交通擠塞。 
It's the perfect driving mechanism. ,你有無意識到 你地平均每日 耗費52分鐘 係交通上， 浪費緊你每日噶 通勤時間？ 
"We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here. ",你可以贏翻哩滴時間。 
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1. ,哩度有40億個鐘 同埋24億加倫汽油 
"We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself. ",浪費係哩個村莊裏。 
"In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice. ",現在覺得有一個夢想，一種新技術， 我好期待未來某一日 當下一代人回首過去睇翻我地果陣 距地會覺得人類駕駛汽車哩件事係幾咁荒謬。 
"Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco. ",多謝大傢 
"(Laughter) Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts. ",（掌聲） 
"(Video) Man: Oh, my God. ",
What? ,嗨，我的名字是Marcin 是個農夫，也是技術專家 
Second Man: It's driving itself. ,我在波蘭出生，現在則在美國 
"Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died. ",我創立了一個名為Open Source Ecology的團隊 
Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people? ,"我們已經鑒別出維持現代生活運轉 所需五十種最重要既機器 例如拖拉機 多士爐, 電路製造機 "
"And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines? ","然後我們創設了資源共享, DIY, 自己動手做的版本 也就是任何人都能建造 並以少數花費來維護的機器 "
"Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways? ",我們稱這為全球村建構集 
"Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time on your daily commute? ",讓我來說個故事 
You could regain this time. ,在我二十歲時 我獲得了融合能源的博士學位 我了解到我根本一無是處 
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone. ,我沒有任何的實質技能 
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. ,世界給了我不同的選擇 我也接受了 
"Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. ",我想你們可以說那是消費者的生活方式 
Thank you. ,所以我開始在密蘇里當起了農夫 並且學習經營農場的經濟學 
(Applause) ,"我買了台拖拉機, 然後它壞了 "
,我花了錢將它修復好 然後它又壞了 
"Hi, my name is Marcin -- farmer, technologist. ",沒多久 我也跟著沒錢了 
"I was born in Poland, now in the U.S. ","我瞭解到 我需要真正合適, 低成本的工具 來打造出一個還不存在的 永續農場和住所 "
I started a group called Open Source Ecology. ,"我需要堅固的, 模組化的 高效率並最佳化 低成本, 以當地可回收材料做成的工具 而不只是設計用來作為過渡用 "
"We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers. ",我瞭解到我必須自己建造它們 
"Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. ",而我也就這麼做了 
We call this the Global Village Construction Set. ,並且測試它們 
So let me tell you a story. ,我瞭解到工業化的生產效率 是可以小量的達成 
"So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless. ","所以我在維基創立3D設計, 解析圖, 操作指南影片 和預算 "
I had no practical skills. ,而之後世界各地的贊助者開始出現 並在造訪我們的計畫中 創造多種新的原創機器 
"The world presented me with options, and I took them. ","到目前為止, 我們的五十種機器中有八項是原創設計 "
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. ,而現在這個計畫 正開始自我茁壯 
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming. ,我們知道資源共享是藉由軟體的使用 來駕馭知識與創意而成功 
I bought a tractor -- then it broke. ,而相同的事正開始發生在硬體上 
I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again. ,我們著眼在硬體 因為正是硬體設施這樣實質形體的事物 能改變人的生活 
"Then pretty soon, I was broke too. ","如果我們能降低耕作, 建築, 製造的成本 我們就能釋放出人類大量的潛能 "
"I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. ",这不仅仅针对发展中国家。 
"I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low-cost, made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for obsolescence. ","美國的農夫, 建築業者, 企業家, 生產者 也建構出我們的機器 "
I found that I would have to build them myself. ,我們看見了這些人 因能開創一個建構事業 或者是製造業 有機 CSA 或僅僅販售這些機器而感到開心興奮 
So I did just that. ,"我們的目標是一份已知設計的知識寶典 如此的簡單, 如此的完整 只要一片DVD 就收錄著文明開創的成套設備 "
And I tested them. ,我曾在一天中種了一百顆樹 
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. ,我曾在一天中將我腳下的土 壓製成五千塊磚頭 並在六天內建造出一台拖拉機 
"So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki. ","在我眼裡, 這些都只是個開始 "
"Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. ",如果這點子真的管用 那它的影響一定十分重大 
"So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines. ","製造的意義將能有更好的分佈, 聽起來更環保的供應鏈, 和一個全新價值的DIY製造者文化 期望能優於 過往過度工業化的製程 "
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. ,我們正探索著 藉由硬體科技資源共享 使世界更好的極限 
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. ,謝謝 
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. ,（鼓掌） 
We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. ,
"If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. ",在過去嘅一年半時間， 我哋在Push Pop Press (一間數碼出版平台)團隊 連同查理·梅爾切以及梅爾切媒體公司 共同合作創造 第一本長篇互動電子書。 
That's not only in the developing world. ,書名為“我們的選擇” 作者係艾爾·高爾(前美國副總統） 
"Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker. ","此書為""難以忽略的真相""之續作 並探討各種可能 解決氣候危機嘅方案。 "
"We've seen lots of excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. ",黎本書開頭係咁。黎個係封面。 
"Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear, so complete, that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit. ",跟住個地球會轉， 我哋可以睇到所處嘅位置。 跟住，我哋打開本書 掃過各篇章節 來瀏覽此書 
I've planted a hundred trees in a day. ,"或者,我哋可以滑動書面底部進行翻頁。 "
"I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days. ",假如我哋想要縮放頁面， 可以直接咁樣打開。 
"From what I've seen, this is only the beginning. ",你係黎本書睇得到嘅野， 都可以用兩隻手指抓取 之後將其抽離頁面， 再打開。 
"If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant. ",如果你想返回 再讀一次， 只要將本書折埋再放翻頁面。 
"A greater distribution of the means of production, environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity. ",用同一樣嘅方式；將圖片抽離，之後打開， 
We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. ,(音效)艾爾·高爾: 我將我自己 歸類於大部分人一樣 睇到風車都會感到 他們為已有噶景觀錦上添花。 
Thank you. ,麥克·馬塔斯：總攬全書， 艾爾·高爾會為你導航解釋相片細節。 
(Applause) ,黎張相片，你甚至可睇到一張交互地圖。 
,放大黎張地圖就可以睇到係邊度拍攝的。 
"So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book. ",在本書中， 有超過一個鐘頭嘅紀錄片 同埋交互動畫。 
"It's called ""Our Choice"" and the author is Al Gore. ",譬如，你可以打開黎個。 
"It's the sequel to ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. ",(音效) AG: 大部分現代風力渦輪機都具備大型... 
The book starts like this. This is the cover. ,MM: 影片即刻播放。 
"As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. ",播放果陣，我哋可以抽起影片之後又放翻頁面， 影片會繼續播放。 
"Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom. ",或者，我哋可以縮細翻目錄， 影片仍然繼續播放。 
"And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up. ",黎本書最型嘅其中一點 就係互動資料圖表。 
"And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. ",黎張圖表顯示出 美國各地嘅風力潛能。 
"And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. ",唔淨至睇到黎D資訊， 我哋可以用手指去感觸探索， 觀看每一個州， 到底有幾多風力潛能。 
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open. ,我哋可以用同樣方式去檢測地熱 和太陽能。 
(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. ,黎張係我至愛之一。 
"Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. ",你可以睇到... 
"This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map. ",(笑聲) (掌聲) 當起風時， 所有來自風車發電剩餘的能量 會被轉儲到電池中。 
Zoom into it and see where it was taken. ,隨著風漸漸平息， 所有多餘的能量將會轉移到住家 -- (幹樣) 永遠唔會無電照明。 
"And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. ",黎本書，唔但只可以在iPad運行。 
So you can open this one. ,iPhone都可以用。 
(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... ,你可以安享家中客廳用iPad開始閱讀 之後再用iPhone繼續閱讀未剩餘部分。 
MM: It starts playing immediately. ,係iPhone都係用同樣嘅操作模式。 
"And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing. ",你可以揀選起任何一頁。 
"Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing. ",打開黎頁。 
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. ,所以黎個就係Push Pop Press出版嘅第一本書， 高爾嘅“我們的選擇”。 
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States. ,多謝。 
"But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is. ",(掌聲) 克里斯·安德森:剛才實在太驚人了。 
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. ,你係想成為一個出版商， 或係技術授權商？ 
This is one of my favorites. ,黎個係點樣嘅經營模式? 
So this shows ... ,其他人都可以做同樣嘅產品嗎? 
"(Laughter) (Applause) When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. ",MM:係嘅，我哋正在建立一個工具 可讓出版社非常簡易地建立書中內容。 
"And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out. ",可以咁講，梅爾切媒體嘅團度，距地位於(美國)東岸-- 連同我哋係西岸嘅團隊，正在建立這套軟件-- 利用我哋嘅工具 每日將圖片及文字編載入書中。 
"And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad. ",CA:所以， 你哋想將黎套軟件授權比出版社 來製造咁精美嘅圖書? (MM:係。) 好。麥克，多謝曬。 
It also runs on the iPhone. ,MM:多謝(CA:祝你好運。） (掌聲） 
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. ,
And it works the exact same way. ,我地今日系哩度 系因为 我地有一份好多人都觉得 不平凡噶友谊。 
You can pinch into any page. ,而且距的确系咁。 
Open it up. ,现在，我地已经觉得好自然了。 
"So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's ""Our Choice."" ",当初知道 我噶仔系2001年9月11日噶早上 入左世贸大楼。 
Thank you. ,直到36个钟后 我地先知道 距已经离开左。 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: That's spectacular. ,果阵， 我知道同政治有关。 
"Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser? ",我地担心国家会以我地个仔噶名义 去做果D事 我先生，奥兰多同埋我，我地一家人。 
What is the business here? ,系我睇到果阵 不过，经历左哩种震惊， 可怕噶震惊， 实质上生命中可怕噶震惊后， 我地并唔想报复。 
Is this something that other people can do? ,几个星期后 迦利亚·穆萨维受到指控 成为六名策划制造袭击噶恐怖分子之一， 美国政府将对距进行判决死刑， 如果定罪， 我同我先生 都会用完全唔同噶视角，群众噶角度探讨过哩D野。 
"MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. ",通过哩D 同埋人权组织， 我地聚合埋一齐 仲有D其他受害者家属。 
"So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text. ",当我系媒体上见艾莎噶时候， 距噶仔受到左指控， 我想：“几咁勇敢噶女人啊。 
"CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.) All right. Mike, thanks so much. ",系我更加强大噶时候，我想见下哩个女人。“ 
MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.) (Applause) ,我仲沉浸于悲伤之中， 我知我唔够坚强。 
,我知终有一日我会稳到距， 或者我地会互相稳到对方。 
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship. ,因为，系人地听讲我噶仔受害后， 我即刻受到同情。 
And it is. ,但系当听到 距噶仔被指控果阵， 距唔受到同情。 
"And yet, it feels natural to us now. ",不过距同我一样甘痛苦。 
"I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th, 2001. ",跟住我地系2002年11月见面了。 跟住落艾莎会话比你地听 成件事系点噶。 
We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later. ,（译者）艾莎·瓦非：女士们先生们，下午好。 
"At the time, we knew that it was political. ",我系撒迦利亚·穆萨维噶妈咪。 
"We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband, Orlando, and I and our family. ",我请求 人权组织 比我同果D受害者家属联系。 
"And when I saw it -- and yet, through the shock, the terrible shock, and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful. ",于是距地就将我介绍比 5个家庭。 
"And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism, and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him, if convicted, my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that, publicly. ",当我见到菲莉斯果阵，我注意到距。 
"Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families. ",距系哩个团体中唯一噶妈妈。 
"When I saw Aicha in the media, coming over when her son was indicted, and I thought, ""What a brave woman. ",其他都系兄弟姐妹。 
"Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."" ",我从距噶眼神睇出 距系一位妈咪，同我一样。 
I was still in deep grief; I knew I didn't have the strength. ,作为一个妈咪我都受到好多惨痛经历。 
"I knew I would find her someday, or we would find each other. ",我14岁结婚。 
"Because, when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy. ",15岁无左第一个细路 16岁无左第二个。 
"But when people learned what her son was accused of, she didn't get that sympathy. ",所以撒迦利亚噶事对我来讲意味住好多野。 
But her suffering is equal to mine. ,我仲沉浸于悲痛当中， 因为我噶仔 就好似被活埋左咁。 
"So we met in November 2002, and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. ",我知道距的确为距噶仔悲痛欲绝。 
"(Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. ",但系距至少知道距系边。 
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui. ,但我甚至唔知道我噶仔到底系边。 
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. ,唔知距是否生还，唔知有无被人虐待。 
So they introduced me to five families. ,唔知距身上发生左咩。 
"And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her. ",哩个亦系我决定讲述我噶故事噶原因， 令我噶痛苦可以帮到其他女性。 
She was the only mother in the group. ,为左所有噶女性，所有赋予生命噶妈咪， 可以恢复， 可以改变 
"The others were brothers, sisters. ",哩个决定于我地女性， 因为我地系女人， 我地爱我地噶仔女。 
"And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother, just like me. ",我地一定要联合起来 做一D野。 
I suffered a lot as a mother. ,哩件事唔系要反对女性， 系为左我地，我地女性， 为左我地噶仔女。 
I was married when I was 14. ,我反对暴力，反对恐怖主义。 
"I lost a child when I was 15, a second child when I was 16. ",我去学校 同果D年轻噶穆斯林女仔交流 叫距地少年时期唔好接受违背意志噶婚姻。 
So the story with Zacarias was too much really. ,如果我可以拯救一个女孩， 令到避免距地太早结婚好似我咁受苦受难， 至少就系一件好事。 
"And I still suffer, because my son is like he's buried alive. ",所以我要企系你地面前。 
I know she really cried for her son. ,菲莉斯·罗德里格斯：我想讲噶系 我从艾沙身上学到好多野， 回忆起我地第一次见面果阵 仲有其他家庭 哩个系一个受高度保护噶私下聚会， 因为果阵系2002年11月， 讲实话，我地好担心国内D爱国主义者 果D家庭成员。 
But she knows where he is. ,但系我地都好紧张。 
"My son, I don't know where he is. ",”点解距想见我地？“ 
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured. ,距都好紧张。 
I don't know what happened to him. ,”点解我地想见距？“ 
"So that's why I decided to tell my story, so that my suffering is something positive for other women. ",我地互相之间可以得到咩呢？ 
"For all the women, all the mothers that give life, you can give back, you can change. ",系我地相互了解姓名同其他野之前， 我地已经缆埋一齐喊晒。 
"It's up to us women, because we are women, because we love our children. ",跟住我地坐成一圈 系相互和解噶气氛下同经历过哩件事噶人 相互支持，相互帮助。 
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together. ,艾沙头先话 ”我唔知道 我噶仔 有罪定系无辜， 但系我想话比你地噶系我对于发生系 你地屋企噶事感到非常非常抱歉。 
"It's not against women, it's for us, for us women, for our children. ",我明白咁样好痛苦， 而且我认为，如果有人犯罪， 距应该受到公平对待和惩罚。” 
"I talk against violence, against terrorism. ",距就系感样同我地接触。 我想讲，哩个系一次破冰之旅。 
"I go to schools to talk to young, Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young. ",我地所讲噶故事就系所发生噶一切， 我地因人类而相互连接住 
"So if I can save one of the young girls, and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well this is something good. ",下午结束果阵 大概系午饭后3个钟 我地觉得好似彼此之间永远了解咁。 
This is why I'm here in front of you. ,我从距身上学到噶系 作为一个女人，可以变得如此宽容 唔单单系当时噶情况下 当时发生噶事情， 和距噶仔经历过噶惨痛遭遇， 仲有距经历过噶人生。 
"PR: I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha, starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security, because it was November 2002, and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members. ",系我经历果咁多唔同噶文化环境入边， 我从来未见过 命运如此坎坷噶人。 
But we were all so nervous. ,我觉得 我地之间有种 特别噶联系， 一种我好珍惜噶联系。 
Why does she want to meet us? ,我觉得哩个都系因为 我地互相之间噶关心， 但系当时做到哩步 会觉得：“啊，唔系咁难姐。” 
And then she was nervous. ,我仲可以见到D我唔了解噶人， 亦或者系同我地唔同噶人。 
Why did we want to meet her? ,艾沙 你仲有无野 需要总结吗？ 
What did we want from each other? ,我地时间快到了 
"Before we knew each others' names, or anything, we had embraced and wept. ",（笑声） （译者）艾莎·瓦非：我想讲 我地要尝试了解其他人、其他事情 
"Then we sat in a circle with support, with help, from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. ",你要更加大方， 同埋你噶内心都要更加宽容， 你噶想法要更大宽容。 
"And Aicha started, and she said, ""I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families. ",你要学识宽恕。 
"I know what it is to suffer, and I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished."" ",我地不得不同暴力抗争 
"But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker. ",我希望有一日我地会生活埋一齐 和平地在尊重人地 
"And what happened then is we all told our stories, and we all connected as human beings. ",哩个就系我想讲噶。 
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. ,（掌声） 
"Now what I learned from her, is a woman, not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then, and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had. ",
"I never had met someone with such a hard life, from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. ",好荣幸来到TED. 
"And I feel that we have a special connection, which I value very much. ",我想到一些令我 印象深刻噶演示， 不过最精彩噶 系我脚下噶故事。 
"And I think it's all about being afraid of the other, but making that step and then realizing, ""Hey, this wasn't so hard. ",果D生命中微小噶野 我地有时会晤记得， 譬如大家都知道噶授粉。 
"Who else can I meet that I don't know, or that I'm so different from?"" ",你讲唔出有关授粉者噶故事 蜜蜂、蝙蝠、蜂鸟、蝴蝶... 而排除关于花噶诞生 以及距地点样在哩50亿年里面 共同进化。 
"So, Aicha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion? ",我拍摄左花随时间推移而变化噶视频 每日24个钟，每周7日， 超过35年。 
Because our time is up. ,为了睇到距地噶变化 系孜孜不倦噶舞蹈 
"(Laughter) (Translator) AW: I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other. ",距令我惊叹，距打开左我噶心扉。 
"You have to be generous, and your hearts must be generous, your mind must be generous. ",我相信美丽和诱惑 系大自然噶生存工具， 因为我地会保护果D我地所爱噶野。 
You must be tolerant. ,距地噶关系 系滋润地球噶爱情故事。 
You have to fight against violence. ,距令我想起我地系大自然噶一部分， 并无脱离自然。 
And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other. ,当我听到蜜蜂消失，蜂群衰落果阵， 我想即刻行动。 
This is what I wanted to say. ,我地都要依赖授粉者 我地所食噶蔬菜和水果超过1/3需要距地。 
(Applause) ,唔少科学家认为 哩个系人类所面临噶最严重噶问题 
,就好似煤矿中噶金丝雀， 
It's great being here at TED. ,如果距地灭绝，人类都会消亡。 
"You know, I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head, but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. ",距令我想起我地系大自然噶一部分， 我地要保护好距 
"The little things in life, sometimes that we forget about, like pollination, that we take for granted. ",令我要去拍摄距地行为噶动机来自于 我向我噶科学顾问请教左D野： 系乜嘢激发左授粉者噶积极性？ 
"And you can't tell the story about pollinators -- bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years. ",好，答案同 危险与报答有关。 
"I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years. ",我就好似一个天真噶细路咁问问题：“点解噶？” 
To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of. ,距地话：“额，因为距地想生存落去。” 
"It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart. ",我继续问：“点解噶？” 
"Beauty and seduction, I believe, is nature's tool for survival, because we will protect what we fall in love with. ",“额，为左繁殖。” 
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. ,“额..点解啊？” 
"It reminds us that we are a part of nature, and we're not separate from it. ",我觉得距地好可能会讲：“额..同性有关。” 
"When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, it motivated me to take action. ",王蝶专家Chip Taylor话 “任何野都唔会无限持续落去， 
We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat. ,所有野最终都会在宇宙中消逝。“ 
And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind. ,哩句话令我震撼。 
It's like the canary in the coalmine. ,因为我意识到 大自然创造左繁殖 来作为传承生命噶机制， 作为穿越我地噶生命力量， 距令我地成为生命进化噶纽带。 
"If they disappear, so do we. ",好难用肉眼去捕捉 哩个在动物世界和植物世界 之间噶十字路口 真系一个魔幻般噶瞬间。 
It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. ,生命噶自我繁殖 系一个神秘的瞬间， 生生不息。 
"What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers: ""What motivates the pollinators?"" ",跟住落来噶系哩部影片噶精华 
"Well, their answer was, ""It's all about risk and reward."" ",我希望你地好好欣赏 跟住在花园里 播下种子。 
"Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, ""Why is that?"" ",花时间闻下D花， 距会令你充满美丽， 以及重现惊叹噶感觉。 
"And they'd say, ""Well, because they want to survive."" ",现在我地睇下哩部影片。 
"I go, ""Why?"" ",（音乐） （鼓掌） 多谢 
"Well, in order to reproduce. ",多谢晒 
"Well, why? ",（鼓掌） 多谢 
"And I thought that they'd probably say, ""Well, it's all about sex."" ",（鼓掌） 
"And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert, he replied, ""Nothing lasts forever. ",
"Everything in the universe wears out."" ",細個嗰陣，我時時都想做超級英雄 
And that blew my mind. ,拯救全世界，等個個都快樂 
"Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward, as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life. ",但我亦知道要有超能力 至可以夢想成真 
"Rarely seen by the naked eye, this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment. ",所以我開始咗幻想旅程 尋找從氪子行星而來嘅跨銀河物體 雖然好好玩 但無乜效用 
"It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself, over and over again. ",大個之後，我明白 科幻小說唔係超能力嘅來源 所以我轉為開展真正科學之旅 探求更有用的事實 
So here is some nectar from my film. ,我嘅科學之旅響加州嘅柏克萊大學開始 響嗰度我參予一個長30年嘅研究 嘗試響舊畢業年冊 入面嘅學生照片度 量度佢哋一生人 成就同快樂程度 
"I hope you'll drink, tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden. ",只要量度學生嘅笑容 研究員就可以預測到 被研究嘅人嘅婚姻 有幾美滿同長久 響統一嘅快樂測驗入面 研究對象會得到幾多分 又有幾啟發人 
"And always take time to smell the flowers, and let it fill you with beauty, and rediscover that sense of wonder. ",有次響紀念冊見到奧巴馬嘅相 
Here are some images from the film. ,第一眼見到佢張相 我以為佢嘅超能力來自佢個超級衫領 
(Music) (Applause) Thank you. ,但我依家知道佢嘅超能力響笑容入面 
Thank you very much. ,另一個新發現係 來自2010年響偉恩州立大學嘅研究計劃 研究1950年代前 大聯盟球員協會嘅棒球員卡 
(Applause) Thank you. ,研究員發現 球員笑容嘅大細 其實預示咗佢嘅壽命 
(Applause) ,嗰啲響張相度無笑容嘅球員 平均只有72.9年命 而露笑容嘅 平均有成差唔多80歲命 
,（笑） 好消息係我哋天生會笑 
"When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero. ",用三維超聲波技術 就可以見到響子宮入面 成長緊嘅胎兒面露微笑 佢哋出咗世 
I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy. ,多數會瞓覺時 繼續識得笑 
But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true. ,就算係失明嘅細路 都識得跟住人嘅聲線去笑 
"So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton, which was a lot of fun, but didn't yield much result. ",笑係全人類最基本 生理學上大家共有嘅表情 
"When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers, I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science, to find a more useful truth. ",世界知名嘅面部表情研究學者 保羅艾克曼 在巴布亞新幾內亞嘅研究入面 發現好似高山族族人咁 同西方文化完全無接觸 而且有食人習俗嘅部族 聽到一啲令人發笑嘅情景 亦會顯露笑容 
"I started my journey in California, with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook, and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life. ",所以無論係響巴布亞新幾內亞 荷李活 甚至響北京嘅現代藝術入面 我哋都會笑 而我哋會因為表達 喜悅、滿足而笑 
"By measuring the students' smiles, researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage would be, (Laughter) how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being, and how inspiring she would be to others. ",響呢度有幾多人會 一日笑超過20次？ 
"In another yearbook, I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture. ",會嘅就舉手，嘩 
"When I first saw his picture, I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar. ",響會場外 
(Laughter) But now I know it was all in his smile. ,有超過三分一人口每日笑多過20次 而少過百分之十四嘅人 每日笑少過5次 
Another aha! moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of Major League players. ,事實上，擁有強大超級大量嘅 係小朋友 佢哋每日可以笑成400次咁多 
The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life. ,有無諗過點解同呢啲 時時笑嘅小朋友一齊 會令你笑得多啲？ 
"Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years, where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost 80 years. ",瑞典烏普薩柆大學最近有項研究 發現見到人笑時 好難皺眉頭 
(Laughter) The good news is that we're actually born smiling. ,點解？ 
"Using 3D ultrasound technology, we can now see that developing babies appear to smile, even in the womb. ",因為笑容響演化過程上有傳染性 而且會抑制 我哋平時對面部肌肉嘅控制能力 
"When they're born, babies continue to smile -- initially, mostly in their sleep. ",而透過模仿 親身體驗笑容 幫助我哋了解個笑容係真心還是偽裝 從而明白笑嘅人 嘅情緒狀熊 
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice. ,響法國嘅克萊蒙費朗大學 最近有個模仿研究 會要求參加者分辨 個笑容係真定假 同時佢哋要用個口擔住支鉛筆 去壓抑笑容肌 
"Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans. ",當無咗支鉛筆，參加者都判別得到真假笑容 但有支鉛筆響個口度嗰陣 佢哋唔能夠模仿見到嘅笑容 而佢哋嘅判斷就有誤差 
"In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea, Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions, found that even members of the Fore tribe, who were completely disconnected from Western culture, and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals, (Laughter) attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would. ",(笑) 達爾文除咗響《物種起源》呢本書入面 為演化立論 佢亦提及面部回饋反應理論 
"So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing, we smile often, and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction. ",佢嘅理論係話 笑容呢個動作本身 實際上會令我哋覺得更開心 而唔係 純粹感覺良好嘅結果 
How many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day? ,佢研究入面 亦確實有提到法國神經學家杜鄉 杜鄉利用電擊 刺激面部，得到笑容 
Raise your hand if you do. ,唔該，千祈唔好響屋企模仿 
"Oh, wow. ",(笑) 一個響德國做嘅相關研究 研究員響注射肉毒捍菌 壓制笑容肌肉前後 用磁力共振造影 量度腦部活動 
"Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five. ",研究結困支持達爾文嘅理論 結果顯示面部回饋 改變腦部內神經 處理情緒嘅內容 所以我哋笑嗰陣會令我哋感到愉快 
"In fact, those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children, who smile as many as 400 times per day. ",笑容刺激我哋腦入面嘅獎賞系統 就算人所共知 可以引起歡愉心情嘅誘導劑 朱古力都望塵莫及 
"Have you ever wondered why being around children, who smile so frequently, makes you smile very often? ",英國研究員發現 一個微笑對腦部產生嘅刺激 有2000排朱古力咁強烈 
A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles. ,(笑) 仲有，同一個研究亦都發現 微笑可以引起 好似收到16000英鎊咁多嘅現金嘅刺激 
You ask why? ,咁即係一個微笑值成25000蚊美金 
"Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious, and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles. ",都唔錯喎 
"Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real, so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler. ",試諗下 25000乘以400 都唔少小朋友 日日都好似馬克．札克伯格咁有錢 
"In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France, subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles. ",而且相比食大量嘅朱古力 笑得多仲可以令你更健康 
"Without the pencil, subjects were excellent judges, but with the pencil in their mouth -- when they could not mimic the smile they saw -- their judgment was impaired. ",笑有助於減低 加重壓力嘅荷爾蒙水平 例如皮質醇、腎上腺素同多巴胺 令好心情嘅荷爾蒙水平提高 好似腦內啡咁 亦會令整體血壓下降 
"(Laughter) In addition to theorizing on evolution in ""The Origin of Species,"" Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory. ",唔止咁 笑容令其他人覺得 你親切可人 
"His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better, rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good. ",響賓尼州立大學嘅研究發現 當你笑嗰陣 你睇上嚟唔單止可親有禮 仲會令你睇嚟好能幹添 
"In his study, Darwin actually cited a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne, who sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles. ",所以無論你想睇上嚟靚啲、能幹啲 減低壓力 改善婚姻關係 或者想覺得好似啱啱食咗大排朱古力 又無付出卡路里嘅代價 又或者想好似響舊外套入面 搵到25000蚊美金響袋 甚至想得到超能力 令你同身邊嘅人 生活得長命啲、健康啲、開心啲 笑啦 (掌聲) 
"Please, don't try this at home. ",
"(Laughter) In a related German study, researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles. ",我係一名小兒科醫師亦係麻醉師， 我靠催眠D細路賺錢謀生。 
"The finding supported Darwin's theory, by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain, in a way that helps us feel better when we smile. ",（笑聲） 我仲係一名學者，我可以唔使錢催眠聽眾。 
Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-regarded pleasure inducer -- cannot match. ,（笑聲） 但事實上我最做得最多嘅 係喺帕洛阿爾托市斯坦福帕卡德兒童醫院 進行痛楚管理。 
"British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate. ",喺果度嘅 有20至25年經驗 今日我想話比你地聽， 痛楚係一種疾病。 
"(Laughter) Wait -- The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000 pounds sterling in cash. ",大多数情况， 你將痛楚睇成疾病嘅一種症狀。 好多時候都係啱嘅。 
(Laughter) That's like 25 grand a smile. ,佢可以係腫瘤或某種感染 或者係某種炎症亦或者係手術嘅症狀。 
It's not bad. ,但係有大概10%嘅情况， 患者從以上所講嘅情況恢復之後， 痛楚仍然持續。 
"And think about it this way: 25,000 times 400 -- quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day. ","而且持續好幾個月, 好多時仲係幾年。 哩種情況發生果陣， 佢就係疾病。 "
"(Laughter) And unlike lots of chocolate, lots of smiling can actually make you healthier. ",喺我講比你地聽佢點樣產生之前 以及我地可以點做之前， 我想同你地講下我D病人嘅感受。 
"Smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine, increase the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphins, and reduce overall blood pressure. ",如果可以，請你地想像一吓， 我用哩條羽毛掃你你嘅手臂， 就好似兒家我就掃緊自己。 
"And if that's not enough, smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others. ",請你地兒家開​​始想像吓 我用佢掃過哩度。 
"A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you actually appear to be more competent. ",大家坐好D啊 
"So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress or improve your marriage, or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost, or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages, or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile. ",（笑聲） 好唔同嘅感覺。 
,咁樣同慢性痛楚有咩關係呢？ 
"I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist, so I put children to sleep for a living. ",想像吓，如果你將哩兩個想法混埋一齊。 
"(Laughter) And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free. ",想像你嘅生活會系點 如果我用羽毛掃過呢度， 但係你嘅大腦會話比你聽 哩個就係你嘅感覺 哩個就係我哥個慢性痛楚病人嘅經歷。 
(Laughter) But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto. ,事實上，試想像某些更壞嘅事情。 
"And it's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning, that pain is a disease. ",想像我用羽毛掃過你細路嘅手臂， 佢地嘅大腦會話比佢地聽 佢地感覺到哩把高溫火焰。 
"Now most of the time, you think of pain as a symptom of a disease, and that's true most of the time. ",哩個就係我個病人Chandler嘅經歷， 哩張係佢幅相。 
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation. ,你地見到佢係一個靚女。 
"But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists. ",我識佢果陣佢先至16歲， 佢渴望成為一位職業舞蹈員。 
"It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease. ",喺佢一次舞蹈排練嘅過程中， 佢跌親壓住咗伸出嘅手臂，跟住扭親埋手腕 
"And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it, I want to show you how it feels for my patients. ",兒家你地大概可以想象就好似佢感， 扭傷手腕喺人生中 只不過係件小事。 
"So imagine, if you will, that I'm stroking your arm with this feather, as I'm stroking my arm right now. ","只需用ACE繃帶包紮吓， 只食一到兩個星期嘅布洛芬止痛藥, 就無乜事喇。 "
"Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this. ",不過喺Chandler嘅病例中，服藥只係故事嘅開始。 
Please keep your seat. ,哩個係佢手臂嘅樣 佢扭傷咗大概3個星期後先來穩我。 
(Laughter) A very different feeling. ,你地可以睇到佢嘅手臂， 已經褪色同埋發紫。 
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain? ,摸上去好似屍體咁凍。 
"Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together. ",肌肉僵硬、麻痹、 張力障礙。 
"Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather, but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain. ",痛楚從腕部擴展到手， 再到手指，痛楚從手腕擴展到肘部， 甚至幾乎到左肩部。 
"In fact, imagine something even worse. ",最惨嘅係， 並唔係自發嘅整日痛楚。 
"Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather, and their brain [was] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch. ",最慘嘅系佢掂下野就會痛， 醫學上叫觸痛 同剛才羽毛、高溫火焰一樣。 
"That was the experience of my patient, Chandler, whom you see in the photograph. ",輕輕觸摸佢嘅手臂、 手， 甚至係衣袖 都會引發劇烈的、燒灼般嘅痛苦。 
"As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman. ",神經系統系點解會錯成咁樣？ 
"She was 16 years old last year when I met her, and she aspired to be a professional dancer. ",點解神經系統 誤解咗一個無辜嘅知覺 就好似摸佢隻手 會變成惡毒嘅知覺 火焰燒灼般嘅觸覺。 
"And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist. ",你大概可以想像機體中嘅神經系統 就好似你屋企裡面嘅導​​線。 
"Now you would probably imagine, as she did, that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life. ",在屋企裡面，導線佈滿牆壁， 從開關制到天花板嘅連接盒 從連接盒到燈泡。 
"Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story. ",當你開開關制，燈就著。 
"But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story. ",當你關閉開關制，燈就熄。 
This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain. ,就用咁嘅方式想像神經系統。 
"You can see that the arm is discolored, purplish in color. ",如果一個錘打傷你嘅手指， 你手臂嘅導線，當然，我地稱為神經 將信息傳入脊髓裡面嘅連接盒 脊髓入面嘅新嘅線路、新嘅神經， 將信息上傳到大腦 你意識到你嘅手指受咗傷。 
It was cadaverically cold to the touch. ,不過在哩種情況下，當然，在人體內 要比哩個複雜好多。 
"The muscles were frozen, paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that. ",並唔係甘純粹 連接盒在脊髓入邊 神經之間嘅聯繫非常簡單 通過釋放哩D棕色包裹 內涵化學信息，我地叫佢做神經遞質 線性一一傳導信息， 事實上， 神經遞質嘅釋放在三維空間裡進行 脊髓入面：橫向，縱向，垂直 佢地開始與相連嘅細胞 相互作用 
"The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands, to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow, almost all the way to her shoulder. ",哩D細胞叫做膠質細胞， 之前被認為係 脊髓中最唔重要嘅結構元素 除咗幫助所有重要嘅好似神經細胞甘嘅物質 聚合在一齊之外，無其他用途。 
"But the worst part was, not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day. ",不過其實 膠質細胞扮演著一個重要角色 在調製，放大 同埋痛楚、扭曲 嘅感覺體驗入邊， 
"The worst part was that she had allodynia, the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch. ",哩D膠質細胞被激活 
"The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand, the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on -- caused excruciating, burning pain. ",佢地嘅DNA開始合成 新蛋白跟住釋放出来。 同相連嘅神經相互作用， 佢地開始釋放神經遞質 果D神經遞質釋放出去 激活相連嘅膠質細胞，一直持續向前， 直到找到 一個確定嘅反饋迴路。 
How can the nervous system get this so wrong? ,就好似有人来到你屋企 重新在牆上拉線， 跟住下一次你開燈哥陣， 馬桶開始自動沖洗， 或者係你嘅洗碗機開咗， 或者係你嘅電腦屏幕開咗。 
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame? ,太瘋狂了， 但實際上就係咁 —— 慢性痛楚嘅情况。 
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. ,也就係由痛楚變成疾病嘅原因。 
"In your house, wires run in the wall, from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb. ",神經系統有可塑性， 
"And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on. ",佢會改變，會變換 作為刺激嘅回應。 
"And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off. ",好，咁我地打算點做呢？ 
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that. ,Chandler嘅病例我地可以點做？ 
"If you hit your thumb with a hammer, these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires, new nerves, take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt. ",目前我地對於哩D患者嘅治療方法 仲停留在非常粗糙嘅階段。 
"But the situation, of course, in the human body is far more complicated than that. ",我地用可以改變症狀嘅藥物來治療佢地 止痛药 講真，對於哩類痛楚來講 唔係特別有效。 
"Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion, in fact, what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells. ",對於本來安靜但係現在 亢奮過度嘅神經， 我地用局部麻醉方式令到佢地休眠。 
"These cells, called glial cells, were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together, like the nerves. ",最重要嘅係，我地所做嘅 係用一個嚴格嘅進程，通常並唔咁係舒服嘅 物理治療同職業療法 喺神經系統入面重新訓練神經 使到能正常應答 尤其係果D日常生活嘅所有 正常活動同感覺體驗。 
"But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences. ",我地全力支持 用密集嘅心裡療法計劃 打擊嚴重慢性痛楚所引起嘅 失望、绝望、 憂慮症狀。 
These glial cells become activated. ,Chandler嘅病例係成功嘅， 你地睇到嘅視頻来自Chandler， 兩個月後嘅现在， 正在進行後翻身跳轉。 
"Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins, which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves, and they start releasing their neurotransmitters, and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth, until what we have is a positive feedback loop. ",我我昨天同佢一齊吃午餐， 因為佢喺在長灘市嘅大學學習舞蹈。 佢表演得太好了。 
"It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch, the toilet flushed three doors down, or your dishwasher went on, or your computer monitor turned off. ",未來會更加精彩。 
"That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain. ",未來將承諾 新藥將會發展 成唔係症狀控制嘅藥物 我地現在哩D藥物， 太輕易地掩飾痛楚。 但係改變症狀嘅藥物 將會真正瞄準問題嘅本源 攻擊果D會擴張神經膠質細胞 產生有害蛋白 有害嘅蛋白， 佢地嘅釋放會終結可塑嘅 樞神經系統， 咁樣就可以扭曲同放大 感覺體驗嘅能力 我地稱之為痛楚。 
And that's why pain becomes its own disease. ,所以我希望 在未来， George Carlin嘅预言可以被咁樣理解， 佢話：我嘅哲學： “唔痛，唔痛” 
The nervous system has plasticity. ,多谢大家 
"It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli. ",（鼓掌） 
"Well, what do we do about that? ",
What can we do in a case like Chandler's? ,我一直覺得TED有一羣好勁噶聽衆， 令人印象深刻，有智慧， 聰明、機智、 經歷豐富、有創新。 
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time. ,我真係咁覺嘎。 
"We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are, frankly, not very effective for this kind of pain. ",不過，我有理由相信 你地之中噶好多人 用緊錯誤噶方式綁鞋帶。 
"We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet, and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics. ",（笑聲） 我知聽起來几荒謬。 
"And most importantly, what we do is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life. ",我知聽起來几荒謬。 
"And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency, despair and depression that always accompanies severe, chronic pain. ",但係相信我，我曾經過住同樣悽慘噶生活。 直到大概3年前先結束。 
"It's successful, as you can see from this video of Chandler, who, two months after we first met her, is now doings a back flip. ",果陣我 我买左一對好贵噶鞋。 
"And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here, and she's doing absolutely fantastic. ",綁住尼龙鞋带， 但我唔识点绑。 
But the future is actually even brighter. ,跟住我翻翻到商店同个老板讲， “我钟意哩对鞋，但我好憎个鞋带。“ 
"The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem, as we have now, but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells, or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate, that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up, or plasticity, that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain. ",距睇左下讲：“噢，你绑錯左啦。” 
"So I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized, who said, ""My philosophy: No pain, no pain."" ",直到果阵， 我原先覺得到左50歲 一定會識噶生存技能 系綁鞋帶。 
Thank you very much. ,其實唔係——我現在來展示下 
(Applause) ,哩個係 我地大多數人學習綁鞋帶噶方式 
,現在搞點——多謝。 
"I'm used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective, intelligent, intellectual, savvy, worldly and innovative people in the world. ",等陣，仲有更多。 
And I think that's true. ,結果 哩個結有牢固同脆弱兩種模式。 我地學習噶係脆弱模式。 你可以咁判斷。 
"However, I also have reason to believe that many, if not most, of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly. ",如果拉個結下邊個鞋帶， 你會見到個結轉動， 向下同個鞋個牙長軸對齊。 
(Laughter) Now I know that seems ludicrous. ,哩個就係脆弱模式。 
I know that seems ludicrous. ,不過無所謂。 
"And believe me, I lived the same sad life until about three years ago. ",如果我地從新來過 用第二種好簡單噶方式 來繞過距 就可以得到牢固噶結 
"And what happened to me was I bought, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes. ",如果拉結下邊個鞋帶， 你會見到個結轉動 同鞋噶橫軸對齊。 
"But those shoes came with round nylon laces, and I couldn't keep them tied. ",哩個就係牢固噶結，距無咁容易粒。 
"So I went back to the store and said to the owner, ""I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."" ",同樣都唔會令你失望。 
"He took a look and said, ""Oh, you're tying them wrong."" ",唔但只係感樣，距更加好睇 
"Now up until that moment, I would have thought that, by age 50, one of the life skills that I had really nailed was tying my shoes. ",我地再來一次。 
(Laughter) But not so -- let me demonstrate. ,（掌聲） 從尋常野開始 用另一種方式繞圈。 
This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes. ,對於小朋友來講有少少難度， 不過我覺得你地可以掌握距。 
Now as it turns out -- thank you. ,拉個結。 
"(Applause) Wait, there's more. ",哩度：牢固噶結。 
"As it turns out -- (Laughter) there's a strong form and a weak form of this knot, and we were taught the weak form. ",爲左相應今日噶主題， 我想指出噶係——有D野你地係知道噶—— 生活中噶某些地方噶 小優勢 都可以係其他地方產生好強大噶結果 
"If you pull the strands at the base of the knot, you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe. ",多福多壽。 
That's the weak form of the knot. ,（掌聲） 
But not to worry. ,
"If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow, we get this, the strong form of the knot. ",從所有表面來看， John事事都很順利。 
"And if you pull the cords under the knot, you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe. ",他剛剛以六位數的利潤 簽售了他在紐約的公寓， 而他擁有呢套公寓 只不過五年時間。 
This is a stronger knot. ,他碩士畢業的學校 剛剛向他提供一份教書的職位， 呢個職位唔單只代表工資， 更意味著多年以來第一次的福利。 
It will come untied less often. ,然而，儘管對於John來說事事順利， 他依然處於掙扎之中， 他在于毒癮和無法擺脫的抑鬱爭鬥。 
"It will let you down less, and not only that, it looks better. ",2003年6月11日的夜晚， 他爬上了曼哈頓大橋 圍欄的邊緣， 縱身跳入橋下莫測的河水中。 
We're going to do this one more time. ,不可思議地 – 唔係，奇跡般地 – 他生還了。 
(Applause) Start as usual -- (Applause) go the other way around the loop. ,墜落導致他的右臂粉碎， 他的每條肋骨都斷了， 他的肺被刺穿， 他順著河流漂到東河時， 時而清醒時而昏迷， 他漂到了布魯克林大橋下， 到了史帝登島渡輪的入口， 在那里渡輪上的乘客 聽到他痛苦的叫聲， 報告了船長， 船長報告了海岸警衛隊， 海岸警衛隊把他從東河打撈上來 并把他送到瞭貝爾維醫院。 
"This is a little hard for children, but I think you can handle it. ",事實上這才是故事的開始。 
Pull the knot. ,因為一旦John承諾 重新振作 – 首先生理上，然後情緒上， 再到精神上 – 他發現只有很少可用資源 來幫助那些像他一樣曾經嘗試 以同樣的方式結束生命的人。 
There it is: the strong form of the shoe knot. ,研究發現 20個試圖自殺的人中 有19人 會失敗。 
"Now, in keeping with today's theme, I'd like to point out -- something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else. ",但是這些失敗的人 第二次自殺的成功機率 是37倍。 
(Laughter) Live long and prosper. ,這確實是 一群高危人群， 然而卻只有很少的資源去支持他們。 
(Applause) ,對于那些 試著回到原來的生活的人又是怎樣的情況？ 因為我們對自殺的避忌， 我們不確定要說些什麼， 而很多時候我們什麼都沒有說。 
,因此這樣就更加 令像John那樣的人覺得自己處於被孤立的狀態。 
"From all outward appearances, John had everything going for him. ",我非常了解John的故事 因為我就是John。 
"He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six-figure profit, and he'd only owned it for five years. ",今天在這里， 是我每一次在公共場合 講述 我的經歷。 
"The school where he graduated from with his master's had just offered him a teaching appointment, which meant not only a salary, but benefits for the first time in ages. ",然而在2006年失去一位敬愛的教師 以及上一年因自殺而失去的好友之後， 在參加了上一年的TEDActive之後， 我意識到自己需要站出來不再沈默， 克服我的避忌 來講述一個值得傳播的思想 – 即是那些 作出艱難抉擇 決定重新開始的人來說， 他們需要更多的資源以及我們的幫助。 
"And yet, despite everything going really well for John, he was struggling, fighting addiction and a gripping depression. ",正如Trevor項目提倡的，一切都會好起來的。 
"On the night of June 11th, 2003, he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below. ",會變得更好的。 
"Remarkably -- no, miraculously -- he lived. ",今天我選擇站出來 述說一個完全不同的人生， 來鼓勵大家，力勸大家， 如果你或者 你身邊認識的人 考慮過或嘗試過自殺， 請與人傾訴，尋求援助。 
"The fall shattered his right arm, broke every rib that he had, punctured his lung, and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River, under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry, where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain, contacted the boat's captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital. ",這是一個值得討論的話題， 一個值得傳播的想法。 
And that's actually where our story begins. ,多谢。 
"Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together -- first physically, then emotionally, and then spiritually -- he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did. ",(掌声) 
Research shows that 19 out of 20 people who attempt suicide will fail. ,
But the people who fail are 37 times more likely to succeed the second time. ,今日我喺度， 掀起一場革命。 
This truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them. ,喺你攞起武器， 開始高唱戰歌， 或者揀最中意嘅顔色之前， 我想明確一下我對革命嘅定義， 
"And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life, because of our taboos around suicide, we're not sure what to say, and so quite often we say nothing. ",所謂革命， 即係喺我哋嘅思維同行為方式上， 喺我哋嘅思維同行為方式上， 我哋嘅思維同行為方式上，明白嗎? 
And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in. ,點解係史帝夫，點解我哋要一場革命 
I know John's story very well because I'm John. ,我哋需要一場革命 因為有啲嘢唔啱，完全唔啱。 
"And this is, today, the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on. ",佢哋令我好頽喪， 因為我為佢哋嘅唔啱而覺得。 
"But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide, and sitting last year at TEDActive, I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help. ",我痛心于大家沒生活喺以我們嘅潛力可以過嘅生活。 
"As the Trevor Project says, it gets better. ",我痛心于我哋包尾。 
It gets way better. ,我哋喺好多地方都係包尾—— 比如社會方面， 
"And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you, to urge you, that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide, or you know somebody who has, talk about it; get help. ",喺創新上，我哋喺成個歐洲都係包尾嘅 
It's a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. ,我哋喺呢度，我哋喺最尾， 被視為唔重視創新嘅民族。 
Thank you. ,我哋喺醫療保健上包尾， 而呢樣嘢對幸福感喺好重要嘅 
(Applause) ,我哋唔止喺歐盟包尾， 我哋仲喺歐洲包尾，墊底。 
,最弊嘅喺， 三個星期前先發布嘅，你哋好多人都應該睇過，經濟學人。 
I'm here today to start a revolution. ,我哋係世界上最悲傷嘅地方， 關聯到人均GDP—— 世界上最悲傷嘅地方。 
"Now before you get up in arms, or you break into song, or you pick a favorite color, I want to define what I mean by revolution. ",呢個只喺社會方邊，再睇下教育。 
"By revolution, I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave. ",我哋喺三個星期之前， 一份经合組織（OECD）嘅報告指出 
"Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution? ",閱讀，數學同科學都係包尾嘅，包尾。 
We need a revolution because things aren't working; they're just not working. ,商業上： 我哋係歐盟入面，對于 
And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working. ,【企業家提供福利畀社會】呢個概唸嘅認同度最低。 
"You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential. ",結果？ 
I'm sick and tired of us being last. ,最少人做生意。 
"And we are last place in so many things -- for example, social factors. ",即使每個人都知道 小型企業喺經濟發展嘅引擎 呢個事實。 
We're last place in Europe in innovation. ,我哋小型企業提供最多嘅職位，我哋貢獻最多嘅稅收。 
"There we are right at the end, right at the bottom, last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation. ",所以，如果我哋嘅引擎壞咗，會點？ 
"We're last place in health care, and that's important for a sense of well-being. ",喺歐洲人均GDP上我哋亦係包尾。 
"And there we are, not just last in the E.U., we're last in Europe, at the very bottom. ",包尾。 
"And worst of all, it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist. ",所以，一啲都唔奇怪， 一啲都唔奇怪。 
"We're the saddest place on Earth, relative to GDP per capita -- the saddest place on Earth. ",我哋唔開心，我哋教育唔好， 我哋仲有最差嘅生意。 
That's social. Let's look at education. ,而呢啲都喺事實啊，各位。 
Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD? ,唔係古仔，唔係作出來嘅。 
"Last in reading, math and science. Last. ",唔係！ 
Business: The lowest perception in the E.U. ,唔係我用來針對保加利亞嘅隂謀，呢個喺事實。 
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society. ,所以，好明顯， 我哋嘅繫統short咗。 
"Why as a result, what happens? ",我哋霖嘢嘅方式，我哋嘅行為， 我哋嘅操作繫統short咗。 
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses. ,我哋需要一個長遠而徹底嘅改變， 來令保加利亞變得更好， 爲咗我哋自己，爲咗我哋嘅朋友 爲咗我哋屋企人，同埋我哋嘅未來。 
And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies. ,點做啊？ 
We hire the most people; we create the most taxes. ,樂觀啲，我哋積極啲。點先可以改變？ 
"So if our engine's broken, guess what? ",我認為，我哋包尾係因為—— 呢個可能會震撼到一啲人—— 因為我哋固步自封。 
Last in Europe GDP per capita. ,我哋扯著自己返轉頭 因為我哋唔重視玩。 
Last. ,我話【玩】！ 
"So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future. ",可能有啲人已經唔記得乜嘢係玩了，玩係咁樣嘅。 
"We're unhappy, we have bad education, and we have the worst businesses. ",bb仔玩，細路仔玩， 大人玩。 
"And these are facts, guys. ",我哋唔重視玩。 
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe. ,事實上，我哋輕視玩。 
It's not. ,我哋喺呢三個方面輕視玩。 
It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts. ,睇返我哋啱先講嘅三個方面。 
"So I think it should be really, really clear that our system is broken. ",社會方面：45年嘅乜？ 
"The way we think, the way we behave, our operating system of behaving is broken. ",共産主義 社會同國家高于個人利益 無意之中碾壓咗創造力， 自我表達，同創新意識。 
"We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better, for ourselves, for our friends, for our family and for our future. ",相反，我哋重視乜嘢？ 
How did this happen? ,好明顯， 我哋做嘢，生産，同知識運用 係畀我哋嘅社會同製度環境所影響， 共産主義要我哋點做？ 
Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen? ,严肃。 
I think we're last because -- and this is going to be drastic to some of you -- because we are handicapping ourselves. ,要严肃。 
We're holding ourselves back because we don't value play. ,非常非常严肃。 
"I said ""play,"" all right. ",（掌聲） 講真咖。 
"In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like. ",我已經記唔清畀人喺公園鬧過幾多次， 因為我畀我嘅細路喺地下玩。 
"Babies play, kids play, adults play. ",絕對唔畀佢哋喺泥（кал，保加利亚语）度玩， 更咪話玩水，咁會害死佢哋。 
We don't value play. ,爺爺嫲嫲同我講， 我哋唔可以畀細路玩咁多， 因為人生喺嚴肅認真嘅， 我哋要訓練佢哋面對人生嘅嚴肅認真。 
"In fact, we devalue play. ",我哋文化之中有一個嚴肅嘅基因。 
And we devalue it in three areas. ,係我哋體內嘅社會基因。 
Let's go back to the same three areas. ,一個嚴肅嘅基因。 
Social: 45 years of what? ,45年來 佢創造咗我叫做“嫲嫲因素”嘅嘢。 
"Of communism -- of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing, inadvertently, creativity, individual self-expression and innovation. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 過程係咁嘅， 
"And instead, what do we value? ",第一步：“女人話，我想有個得意嘅BB。” 
"Because it's shown the way we apply, generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context, which told us what in communism? ",第二部：我哋生咗個BB出來啦～ 
To be serious. ,但第三步又點咧？ 
"To be really, really serious. ",我要返工， 因為我想發展自己嘅事業，或者想飲杯咖啡。 
It did. ,我要將BB畀嫲嫲睇著。 
(Applause) Be serious. ,但記得嘛？ 嫲嫲已經畀嚴肅基因影響咗45年啦。 
I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground. ,所以發生乜事？ 
"Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal, or even worse, lokvi, water -- that will kill them. ",佢將呢個病毒傳畀BB， 而咁要花好長好長時間——好似紅杉樹一樣， 將呢個嚴肅基因 從我哋思想入邊消除。 
I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life. ,跟著咧？ 
We have a serious meme running through. ,我哋嘅教育體製抱殘守缺 100年先變得嗰啲咁多 重視死記硬揹， 生搬硬套，墨守陳規， 輕視自我表達，自我探索， 疑問，創造，同玩耍。 
It's a social gene running through us. ,呢個繫統坏咗。 
It's a serious gene. ,真實故事：我幫我嘅仔揾學校。 
"It's 45 years of it that's created what I call the ""baba factor."" ",去到呢間出名嘅細學校， 佢哋話學校一個星期上10堂數學 8堂科學 5堂閱讀，等等等等。 
(Laughter) (Applause) And here's how it works. ,跟著我哋問：“咁啲學生玩幾耐啊？” 
"Step one: woman says, ""I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."" ",佢哋話：“課程表入邊根本就沒呢樣嘢。” 
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo! ,（笑聲） 跟著我哋話“佢先5歲咋。” 
But then what happens in step three? ,犯罪！犯罪！ 
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees. ,咁係犯罪 我哋嘅教育體繫太嚴肅了， 我哋剩係識創造沒腦嘅機械工人 去同螺母上螺絲。 
I'm going to give bebko to baba. ,但可惜嘅喺，而家嘅問題， 唔喺工業革命嗰時嘅問題。 
But we need to remember that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years. ,我哋需要適應能力， 去學習創造同創新。 
So what happens? ,我哋唔需要機械人咁嘅工作者。 
"She passes that virus on to baby, and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system. ",現實喺，我哋嘅文化輕視玩。 
What happens then? ,我哋創造機械人咁嘅工人，仲當喺工具咁， 用完就丟。 
"It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years, that values rote learning, memorization and standardization, and devalues self-expression, self-exploration, questioning, creativity and play. ",保加利亞人工作嘅特點係乜？ 
It's a crap system. ,獨斷專橫—— 照我講嘅做，因為我係老闆。 
True story: I went looking for a school for my kid. ,我叻過你。 
We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff. ,唔信任——你擺明係個罪犯，所以我要裝攝像槍。 
"And we said, ""Well what about play and recess?"" ",（笑聲） 指手画脚—— 你擺明係個死蠢，所以我要整幾百萬個步驟畀你跟著 咁你就唔會做錯啦。 
"And they said, ""Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."" ",佢哋仲好嚴格——唔畀用打電話， 唔畀用手提電腦，唔畀上網， 唔畀用聊天工具。 
"(Laughter) And we said, ""He's five."" ",太唔專業了， 
What a crime. What a crime. ,做足一日，沒啲成就感， 因為你畀人睇著，你畀人限製著，你沒價值 仲要無聊到死。 
"And it's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we're creating mindless, robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes. ",喺社會，教育，工作上， 我哋唔重視玩。 
"But I'm sorry, the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution. ",呢個就係我哋包尾嘅原因， 因為我哋唔重視玩。 
"We need adaptability, the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative. ",你可能會話，“史帝夫喺度亂噏。咁沒譜嘅霖法都有嘎。 
We don't need mechanized workers. ,點可能喺因為玩咧。 
"But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play. ",因為玩好蠢。”喺咪？ 
"We create robotic workers that we treat like assets, to lever and just throw away. ",因為我哋有嚴肅基因。 
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work? ,我要話，唔係！ 
Autocratic -- do what I say because I'm the chef. ,我跟著落來就會證明畀你睇—— 玩係催化剂，係變革， 係用來令保加利亞變得更好嘅載體。 
I'm the boss and I know better than you. ,玩： 我哋嘅大腦， 係专为玩耍而设计嘅。 
"Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras. ",生物進化選擇咗佢， 超過千萬年， 仍然保留喺人類同動物身上。 
"(Laughter) Controlling -- you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box. ",知道嘛？ 
"So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone, don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet, don't be on I.M. ",進化非常有用， 佢淘汰棄對我哋有害嘅身體特徴。 選擇利于生物競爭嘅特性。 
That's somehow unprofessional and bad. ,自然好醒目，而佢選擇咗玩來幫助進化。 
"And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued and you're not having any fun. ",以動物界為例， 螞蟻玩， 
"In social, in education and in our business, don't value play. ",不過你可能唔知， 
"And that's why we're last, because we don't value play. ",佢哋玩嘅時候， 學會咗社會秩序同事物規律。 
"And you can say, ""That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea. ",家鼠玩，不過你可能唔知， 家鼠玩得越多 佢哋嘅腦就越大 佢哋學嘢就會越快， 佢哋學技能更容易。 
It can't be because of play. ,貓仔玩，我哋都知道貓仔玩。 
"Just play, that's a stupid thing."" ",不過你可能唔知， 貓仔唔玩， 就沒辦法同其他貓交際。 
We have the serious meme in us. ,佢哋仲係可以抓老鼠，但會孤僻。 
Well I'm going to say no. ,熊亦玩。 
"And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech -- that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution, that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better. ",不過你可能唔知， 熊玩得越多，生存得越耐。 
Play: our brains are hardwired for play. ,唔係嗰只抓魚叻嘅， 
"Evolution has selected, over millions and billions of years, for play in animals and in humans. ",而係玩得多嗰只。 
And you know what? ,最后仲有一項有趣嘅研究， 表明玩同腦容積 嘅關繫 
"Evolution does a really, really good job of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage. ",你玩得越多，大腦就會越發達。 
"Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play. ",海豚，有好大嘅腦，玩得好多。 
"Throughout the animal kingdom, for example: ants. Ants play. ",你認為邊個有最大嘅腦？ 邊個最玩得嘅？ 
Maybe you didn't know that. ,梗喺你啦，人類！ 
"But when they're playing, they're learning the social order and dynamics of things. ",細路玩，我哋玩—— 每個國家，每個種族， 每种膚色，每個宗教。 
"Rats play, but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better, skills. ",呢樣嘢喺普世共有嘅——我哋玩。 
Kittens play. We all know kittens play. ,唔單止喺細路玩，大人亦玩。 
But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially. ,有型嘅講法：幼态延续—— 少年好玩嘅天性喺成年人内心嘅延续 
"They can still hunt, but they can't be social. ",邊個最童心未泯？ 
Bears play. ,人類。我哋玩運動。 
But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer. ,爲咗娛樂，參賽，或者當成職業。 
It's not the bears that learn how to fish better. ,我哋玩樂器。 
It's the ones that play more. ,我哋跳舞，我哋親吻，我哋唱歌， 我哋追逐打闹。 
"And a final really interesting study -- it's been shown, a correlation between play and brain size. ",我哋天生就識玩 由細到大。 
"The more you play, the bigger the brains there are. ",我哋被設計成一直咁做—— 玩，搏命玩 永遠唔停止玩。 
"Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot. ",玩有巨大嘅好處。 
But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players? ,就好似對動物嘅好處一樣， 佢亦有對人類嘅好處。 
Yours truly: humans. ,比如，刺激喺杏仁体嘅 神經生長， 呢度喺情緒控製中心。 
"Kids play, we play -- of every nationality, of every race, of every color, of every religion. ",仲會促進脑前额叶外皮生長 呢度喺意識形成嘅區域。 
It's a universal thing -- we play. ,玩得多嘅結果係乜？ 
"And it's not just kids, it's adults too. ",我哋情感更加成熟， 
Really cool term: neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults. ,我哋嘅決策能力更強。 如果我哋玩得多嘅話。 
And who are the biggest neotenists? ,呢啲係事實。 
Humans. We play sports. ,唔喺古仔，唔喺亂噏，可能沒人信。 但呢啲係硬科學。 
"We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals. ",玩有太多嘅好處了。 
We play musical instruments. ,呢個係我哋天生嘅權利， 像好似講話，行路一樣。 
"We dance, we kiss, we sing, we just goof around. ",而如果我們限製自己玩， 我們固步自封，裹足不前 如果唔行使我哋天生嘅權利。 
We're designed by nature to play from birth to old age. ,我哋就會扯著自己返轉頭。 
We're designed to do that continuously -- to play and play a lot and not stop playing. ,做個小練習。 合埋雙眼。 試下想象一個沒得玩嘅世界， 
It is a huge benefit. ,想象下一個世界沒戲劇，沒藝術嘅， 沒歌曲，沒舞蹈， 沒足球，沒橄欖球， 沒笑聲。 
"Just like there's benefits to animals, there's benefits to humans. ",呢個世界睇落點啊？ 
"For example, it's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala, in the area where it controls emotions. ",慘白。 
It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening. ,灰暗。 
"As a result, what happens? ",而家想象一下你工作嘅地方。 
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more. ,有趣嘛？好玩嘛？ 
We develop better decision-making ability if we play more. ,或者你朋友嘅工作環境——做個换位思考 
These guys are facts. ,有趣嘛？好玩嘛？ 
"It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe; it's cold, hard science. ",定係沒癮，機械化，高壓， 诸多阻滯，唔信任，沒成就感？ 
These are the benefits to play. ,我哋有個觀唸 玩嘅反義詞就喺做嘢 
"It is a genetic birthright that we have, like walking or speaking or seeing. ",我哋甚至會因為喺工作中玩而覺得慚愧。 
"And if we handicap ourselves with play, we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have. ",“弊啦，我同事見到我喺度笑。我一定係做得唔夠落力，” 或者“我要收埋因為老細可能見到我。 
We hold ourselves back. ,佢會覺得我唔夠努力工作。” 
Little exercise just for a second: close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play. ,但我有個消息要話畀你啲知：我哋霖反咗。 
"Imagine a world without theater, without the arts, without song, without dancing, without soccer, without football, without laughter. ",玩嘅反義詞 唔喺工作。 
What does this world look like? ,玩嘅反義詞 喺壓抑，壓抑。 
It's pretty bleak. ,事實上， 玩提昇我哋嘅工作水平。 
It's pretty glum. ,就好似嗰啲對人類同動物嘅好處一樣， 呢啲係玩對工作嘅好處。 
Now imagine your workplace. ,比如，佢刺激創造力。 
Is it fun? Is it playful? ,佢提昇我哋接受改變嘅開明度。 
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking. ,佢提昇我哋學習嘅能力。 
Is it fun? Is it playful? ,佢提供一種目標同掌控感—— 通過玩 提高生産效率 有2個關鍵因素 
"Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling, restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling? ","唔好急著認為玩唔認真299 00:11:50,000 --&gt; 00:11:52,000 玩唔代表輕浮。 玩唔代表輕浮。 "
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work. ,職業運動員中意滑雪， 佢對滑雪好認真，但佢亦一樣愛呢樣運動。 
We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work. ,佢覺得開心，覺得愉快，覺得甘暢淋灕。 
"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work, or, ""Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me. ",醫生可能會嚴肅， 但笑聲依然係偉大嘅傷藥。 
"He's going to think I'm not working hard."" ",我哋霖反咗。 
But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards. ,我哋唔應該覺得丑。 
The opposite of play is not work. ,我哋應該慶祝玩樂。 
The opposite of play is depression. It's depression. ,一個企業嘅簡單例子 
"In fact, play improves our work. ",聯邦快遞，簡單口號：人，服務，利潤。 
"Just like there's benefits for humans and animals, there's benefits for play at work. ",如果你人性化咁對員工，你對佢哋好， 佢哋更加開心，佢哋會覺得滿足，佢哋會有目標同掌控感。 
"For example, it stimulates creativity. ",跟著會點？佢哋會提供更好嘅服務—— 唔係更差，而係更好。 
It increases our openness to change. ,当客人需要服务时， 佢哋係同開心有主見有成就感嘅人打交道， 客人會覺得點啊？佢哋會好滿足。 
It improves our ability to learn. ,滿足嘅客人會點做？ 
"It provides a sense of purpose and mastery -- two key motivational things that increase productivity, through play. ",佢哋買你更多嘅服務同話畀更多嘅朋友知， 咁就帶來更多嘅利潤。 
"So before you start thinking of play as just not serious, play doesn't mean frivolous. ",人，服務，利潤。 
"You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing, he's serious about it, but he loves it. ",玩耍提高生産力，唔係降低 
"He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow. ",跟著你會話， “唓，聯邦快遞呢套喺美國就行得通咯， 保加利亞就唔掂啦。 
"A doctor might be serious, but laughter's still a great medicine. ",唔得。我哋係唔同嘅。” 
Our thinking is backwards. ,各位，佢對保加利亞一樣有用，2個原因。 
We shouldn't be feeling guilty. ,一，玩係世界通用嘅。 
We should be celebrating play. ,要踢开严肃基因， 我哋保加利亚人玩无可厚非。 
Quick example from the corporate world. ,二，我已經喺Sciant試過了。 
"FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit. ",當我去嗰度嘅時候，我哋一個開心嘅客人都沒。 
"If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great, they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose. ",沒人願意揾我哋。 
"What happens? They give better service -- not worse, but better. ",我問勻曬每一個人. 
"And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled, how do the customers feel? They feel great. ",我哋占有市場最少嘅利潤——曾經 
"And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers? ","我哋占有市場最少嘅利潤, 我哋有唔開心嘅股東。 "
"They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends, which leads to more profit. ",通過一啲基本嘅改變， 比如提昇透明度， 比如促進自我引導 合作，鼓勵合作， 而唔係機械化， 由結果引導努力。 
"People, service, profit. ",我介意你幾時返工，我介意你幾時放工。 
"Play increases productivity, not decreases. ",我介意嘅喺你嘅客人同同事開心 你係令佢哋開心嘅人。 
"And you're going to say, ""Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States, but it can't work in Bulgaria. ",點解我唔介意你係咪9點鐘返工？ 
"No way. We're different."" ",因為樂趣。 
"It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons. ",通過提昇樂趣同好嘅工作環境 我哋已經將Sciant變好 而呢個改變只係用咗短短3年—— 聽起身好耐，不過改變唔多—— 每個客人，從一個客都沒到個個客人都選擇我哋， 我哋有咗呢行入邊超過50％嘅利潤 同埋開心嘅股東。 
"One, play is universal. ",跟著你會問，“你點知佢哋開心嘎？” 
"There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play, besides the serious meme that we have to kick out. ",我哋做到咗，每一年我哋都獲得 小型企業最佳老闆獎 
"Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant. ",呢個喺員工匿名投票嘅 獨立研究。 
"When I got there, we had zero happy customers. ","玩, 對保加利亞係有用兼且行得通嘅. "
Not one customer would refer us. ,"沒嘢扯緊我哋返轉頭, 除咗我哋對玩嘅成見. "
I asked them all. ,"最尾, 呢幾步可以 通過玩促成革命. "
We had marginal profit -- I did. ,"首先, 你要信我. "
"We had marginal profits, and we had unhappy stakeholders. ","如果你唔信我, 咁就返屋企霖下先. "
"Through some basic change, change like improving transparency, change like promoting self-direction and collaboration, encouraging collaboration, not autocracy, the things like having a results-focus. ",其次，如果你沒玩嘅興緻， 你要揾返佢返來來. 
I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave. ,"無論佢係你以前覺得好玩嘅, 可能就玩得個半年, 不過今日你因為昇職而唔玩得，373 00:14:39,000 --&gt; 00:14:41,000 因為你覺得要嚴肅啦， 因為你覺得要嚴肅啦, 揾返佢。375 00:14:43,000 --&gt; 00:14:45,000 我唔理係佢踩單車爬山，定睇書，定打機，376 00:14:45,000 --&gt; 00:14:47,000 揾返佢. "
I care that your customer and your team is happy and you're organized with that. ,"我唔理喺踩單車爬山, 定讀書, 定打機, "
Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock? ,"揾返佢. 因為你係領袖, 維新領袖, 思想領袖。379 00:14:51,000 --&gt; 00:14:53,000 你係嗰個要返去辦公室 "
Basically promoting fun. ,你喺嗰個要返去辦公室 話畀你同事同朋友知嘅人 然后燃起玩嘅革命之火. 
"Through promoting fun and a great environment, we were able to transform Sciant and, in just three short years -- sounds like a long time, but change is slow -- every customer, from zero to every customer referring us, above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders. ","你一定要做, 否則 你嘅同事, 你嘅手足係唔會信嘅. "
"And you can say, ""Well how do you know they're happy?"" ","你要返去同佢哋講:""喂, 我信你。"" "
"Well we did win, every year that we entered, one of the rankings for best employer for small business. ","呢個霖法一啲都唔奇怪. 我請你梗係要信你嘎啦。386 00:15:09,000 --&gt; 00:15:12,000 我準備畀支咪你. "
Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys. ,"我要授權畀你. 我準備畀支咪你. 我要授權畀你. 我畀你抓主意, 將權利下放, 而唔係集權。 "
"It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria. ","我要鼓勵建設性嘅批判。389 00:15:18,000 --&gt; 00:15:20,000 我要畀妳挑戰權威。 "
"There's nothing holding us back, except our own mentality about play. ",我要畀妳挑戰權威. 
So some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play. ,因為咁係爲咗挑戰我哋過往嘅做事方式 爲咗打破過往嘅陳規陋習 為今日嘅問題 帶來新嘅解決方法. 
"First of all, you have to believe me. ","作為領袖, 我哋唔係永遠都啱. "
"If you don't believe me, well just go home and think about it some more or something. ",我哋要根除恐懼. 
"Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play. ",恐懼喺玩耍嘅敵人. 
"Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it. ",我哋準備做嘅事有 消除約束. 
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game. ,畀佢哋用手機 來打私人電話——唔好禁止。 
"Rediscover that because you're the leaders, the innovation leaders, the thought leaders. ",畀佢哋上網。 
You're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution. ,畀佢哋用即時聊天軟件。 
"You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it, your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it. ",畀佢哋食耐啲晏。 
"You've got to go back and say, ""Hey, I'm going to trust you."" ",午飯好似工作時嘅休息。 
Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you. ,畀妳離開工作 同大腦充電，見下朋友， 飲盃酒，食啲嘢，傾下計， 你可能會有 一啲以前從來未有過嘅創意。 
"I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you, and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top. ",畀佢哋咁做，畀啲自由佢哋。 講到白，就係畀佢哋玩。畀佢哋喺工作中享受樂趣。 
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism. ,我哋要花大部分嘅光隂喺工作上， 所以呢度唔應該成為冇癮嘅地方， 否則20年之后，有一日你起床然后問：“我成世就係咁啦？ 
I'm going to let you challenge authority. ,咁就係我過去做嘅一切？” 
Because it's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today. ,我接受唔到！ 
We're not always right as leaders. ,（笑聲） 所以， 我哋需要一個喺我哋嘅思維同行為方式上 ， 但我哋唔需要 工人起義。 
We're going to eradicate fear. ,我哋唔需要工人起義。 
Fear is the enemy of play. ,我哋要嘅係 玩家嘅覺醒。 
And we're going to do things like eliminate restrictions. ,我哋要嘅係玩家嘅覺醒。 
"You know what, let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid. ",我哋要嘅係玩家嘅覺醒。 
Let them be on the Internet. ,認真嘅，我哋要一齊努力。 
Let them be on instant messengers. ,今日就係覺醒嘅開始。 
Let them take long lunches. ,而你哋要做嘅就係 點燃革命之火。 
Lunch is like the recess for work. ,你要行動，講出你嘅睇法同 關于玩帶來成功嘅故事 關于重塑我哋嘅生活，我哋嘅學校， 點樣將玩同工作結合。 關于玩點樣促進 目的性同成就感， 關于玩點樣促進創新同生産效率； 最重要嘅，係玩點樣令一切變得有意義。 
"It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends, you have a beer, you have some food, you talk, you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn't have had before. ",因為我哋沒辦法孤身奮戰。我哋要一齊努力。 而如果我哋一齊努力傳播關于玩嘅思想， 我哋就可以令保加利亞變得更好。 
"Let them do it. Give them some freedom, and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace. ",多謝。 
"We spend so much of our lives at the workplace, and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind, so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, ""Is this it? ",(掌聲） 
"Is that all there was?"" ",
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv. ,"幾年前, 我突然覺得生活枯燥無味, 於是我決定步 偉大嘅美國思想家 Morgan Spurlock 嘅後麈, 嘗試持續30日做一啲新嘅事情。 "
"(Laughter) So in summary, we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave, but we don't need a workers' revolution. ",呢個主意其實好簡單。 
We don't need a workers' revolution. ,諗吓有啲你好想添加喺你人生裡面嘅嘢 然後喺嚟緊果30日試吓佢。 
What we need is a players' uprising. ,"原來, 30日嘅時間啱啱好 夠養成或者戒除一個生活上嘅習慣 - 譬如話 睇新聞報導嘅習慣。 "
What we need is a players' uprising. ,"喺呢啲30日挑戰裡面,我學識咗一啲嘢。 "
What we need is a players' uprising. ,"首先係, 歲月唔再飛逝、被遺忘, 而變得十分值得懷念。 "
"Seriously, we need to band together. ",有一個挑戰嘅部份係我喺一個月內每曰影低一張想。 
Today is the start of the uprising. ,結果我完全記得番我每日喺邉度 同埋做過啲乜嘢。 
But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution. ,"我又留意到 當我開始做更多更難嘅30日挑戰後, 我嘅自信心亦增強。 "
"You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives, our schools, and our work with play; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment; of how play promotes innovation and productivity, and, ultimately, how play creates meaning. ",我由一個唔願離開座位嘅電腦呆子 變成貪好玩 
"Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together, and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play, we can transform Bulgaria for the better. ",而踩單車返工果類人。 
Thank you. ,"舊年,我甚至爬上咗非洲最高嘅山, Kilimanjaro 山。 "
(Applause) ,喺我開始30日挑戰前 我絕對唔係咁富冒險精神嘅人 
,"我又發覺 如果你真係好想做一樣嘢, 你可以持續做果樣嘢30日。 "
"A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days. ","你有冇諗過寫本小說吖? 每年11月, "
The idea is actually pretty simple. ,數以萬計嘅人 嘗試喺30日內由零開始 完成佢地5萬字嘅小說。 
Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. ,"原來,你只要 喺一個月內 每日寫1,667個字。 "
It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life. ,我試過。 
There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges. ,我嘅秘密係未寫完果日嘅字數 我唔上床瞓覺。 
"The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable. ","你可能會嚴重睡眠不足, 但係你可以寫成你嘅小說。 "
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. ,我本書會唔會成為下一部美國小說巨著? 
And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. ,梗係唔會喇!我只用咗一個月時間嚟寫。 
"I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew. ",其實本書慘不忍睹。 
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. ,"不過,喺我餘生, 當我喺TED聚會遇到 John Hodgman 時, 我唔使話, 我係電腦科學家。 "
For fun! ,"我鍾意嘅話,可以介紹我係小說家。 "
"(Laughter) Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. ","(笑聲) 最後我想講嘅係, "
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges. ,"我學識當我作出細小而持續嘅改變, 我能夠一直做落去嘅事情, 佢地更容易成為習慣。 "
"I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days. ",偉大、瘋狂嘅挑戰並非壞事。 
Have you ever wanted to write a novel? ,"事實上,佢地會帶來無窮樂趣。 "
"Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days. ",但係佢地較難持續下去。 
"It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. ","當我放棄糖果30日後, 第31日會變成咁樣。 "
So I did. ,(笑聲) 等我問吓你: 你仲等乜嘢呢? 
"By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. ",我保證 無論你鍾唔鍾意 嚟緊嘅30日都會成為過去。 點解唔諗吓 一啲你成日都想試嘅嘢 喺嚟緊果30日 
"You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel. ",試吓佢。 
Now is my book the next great American novel? ,多謝。 
No. I wrote it in a month. ,(拍手) 
It's awful. ,
"(Laughter) But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say, ""I'm a computer scientist."" ",包容他人。 
"No, no, if I want to, I can say, ""I'm a novelist."" ",當我第一次聽到嚟個主題， 我唸，包容他人 就系擁抱自己。 
(Laughter) So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. ,之所以會有嚟種想法 系因為深刻體會和接受。 我覺得非常有趣， 同埋給予我一種對自我的 洞察見解 今天，我想將嚟個見解同在座的各位分享 
"I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick. ",我地每個人都有一個自我， 但我唔認為嚟種自我系與生俱來的。 
"There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. ",你知道，新生兒 相信距地系萬物中的一體； 他們沒有分離。 
"In fact, they're a ton of fun. ",嚟種萬物歸一嘅概念 被我地好快就遺忘了。 
But they're less likely to stick. ,就好似人生最初階段好快就結束咗-- 統一性：雛形， 未成型，原始的。 
"When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this. ",嚟種萬物歸一嘅概念對於我地來講已經失真，失效。 
(Laughter) So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for? ,取而代之嘅系獨立性。 就系初生嬰兒時期， 自我的概念 開始成型。 
"I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot! ",從起名開始，自我的小部分開始萌芽， 開始得知各種關於自己的事情。 嚟D細節， 觀點同見解 成為事實， 逐漸構造我地自我， 同我地身份。 
For the next 30 days. ,與此同時自我便成為我地 系嚟個社會行動嘅方向。 
Thanks. ,但系嚟個自我只是一個投影 一個建立於他人對你睇法嘅投影。 
(Applause) ,距可以真實反映我們嗎？ 
,或者真實的反映我們想成為點樣， 又或者應該系點樣？ 
Embracing otherness. ,所有嚟D自我同身份 相互交流 伴隨我成長嘅過程中一個大難題。 
"When I first heard this theme, I thought, well, embracing otherness is embracing myself. ",我試圖呈現俾世界嘅真我 受到一次又一次嘅打擊。 
"And the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me, and it's given me an insight into the whole notion of self, which I think is worth sharing with you today. ",而我恐慌 沒有一個適合自己的自我， 以及因拒絕繼而 產生嘅困惑 又帶來焦慮，羞愧 同埋無助感， 系好長一段時間內，嚟D感受一直牽引住我的生命。 
"We each have a self, but I don't think that we're born with one. ",但反過來唸下， 我嘅自我被摧毀的系如此頻繁， 幫我睇到一個規律的存在。 
You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything; they're not separate? ,我嘅自我開始改變， 被外界影響，被摧毀打碎， 另一個我又逐漸開始產生---- 有時好勇敢， 有時充滿憤恨， 有時根本唔想存在。 
Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly. ,黎個自我系唔穩定。 
"It's like that initial stage is over -- oneness: infancy, unformed, primitive. ",又有多少次 我嘅自我要死去 先至領悟 黎個自我從始至終根本唔存在？ 
It's no longer valid or real. ,我成長於英國沿海地帶 70年代 
"What is real is separateness, and at some point in early babyhood, the idea of self starts to form. ",我爸爸系白人來自康沃尔郡， 而我媽媽系黑人來自津巴布韦。 
"Our little portion of oneness is given a name, is told all kinds of things about itself, and these details, opinions and ideas become facts, which go towards building ourselves, our identity. ",即使作為一個咁樣嘅家庭， 對於好多人來講都未必接受。 
And that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world. ,但系自然就有距獨特嘅方式， 一個棕色嬰兒就此誕生。 
But the self is a projection based on other people's projections. ,但大概從五歲開始， 我就意識到，我與黎個世界格格不入。 
Is it who we really are? ,我系一個無神論嘅黑人小孩 就讀一間由修女掌管嘅全白人天主教學校。 
"Or who we really want to be, or should be? ",我就係一個異常。 而我四處為自我去尋找定義， 並試圖找到切入點去融入。 
So this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up. ,因為自我希望融入， 睇到自己被複製， 搵到歸屬。 
The self that I attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again. ,因為肯定自我的存在 以及其重要性。 
"And my panic at not having a self that fit, and the confusion that came from my self being rejected, created anxiety, shame and hopelessness, which kind of defined me for a long time. ",確實，咁樣好重要。 
"But in retrospect, the destruction of my self was so repetitive that I started to see a pattern. ",具有极其重要的的功能。 
"The self changed, got affected, broken, destroyed, but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger, sometimes hateful, sometimes not wanting to be there at all. ",無咗距，我地根本無法與人交往。 
The self was not constant. ,我地無辦法孵化計劃 不斷向上爬，變得更受歡迎， 更為成功。 
And how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place? ,不過我嘅膚色唔o岩。 
I grew up on the coast of England in the '70s. ,我嘅頭髮唔o岩。 
"My dad is white from Cornwall, and my mom is black from Zimbabwe. ",我個人嘅歷史唔o岩。 
Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people. ,我嘅自我被相異性， 所定義， 咁就意味著，系黎個社會， 我唔存在。 
"But nature had its wicked way, and brown babies were born. ",而我首先系個異類，黎個身份 甚至比作為一個女仔更先考慮。 
"But from about the age of five, I was aware that I didn't fit. ",我系一個引人注目無名小卒。 
I was the black atheist kid in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns. ,與此同時，另一個世界 向我招手： 演出與舞蹈。 
"I was an anomaly, and my self was rooting around for definition and trying to plug in. ",那個無時無刻都存在對自我身份嘅擔憂 當我跳舞時都不再存在。 
"Because the self likes to fit, to see itself replicated, to belong. ",我真系拋棄了自我。 
That confirms its existence and its importance. ,我系一個非常優秀嘅舞者。 
And it is important. ,我會把 我全部的感情 投入在舞蹈中。 
It has an extremely important function. ,我可以舞出在 現實生活中無法 做到嘅自我。 
"Without it, we literally can't interface with others. ",在我16歲的時候， 我遇到另一個機會， 我得到咗第一次出演電影嘅機會。 
"We can't hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity, of success. ",我難以用言語 來形容當時我所感受到嘅平和 當我演出時。 
But my skin color wasn't right. ,我無法運轉嘅自我 卻可以融入到 不屬於我自己的自我。 黎種感受實在太好啦。 
My hair wasn't right. ,黎個系我第一次感受到自己嘅存在 一個完全正常的自我裡。 一個自我可以控制， 我可以掌托， 我給予其生命。 
My history wasn't right. ,但系當拍攝完結時， 我重回到 果個粗燥，蠢鈍嘅我。 
"My self became defined by otherness, which meant that, in that social world, I didn't really exist. ",19歲的時候， 我已成為一個完羽翼豐滿的電影演員， 但系我仲系到找尋自我的定義。 
"And I was ""other"" before being anything else -- even before being a girl. ",我申請攻讀人類學 系大學。 
I was a noticeable nobody. ,菲利斯·李博士面試我， 她問我，“你系點樣定義種族？” 
Another world was opening up around this time: performance and dancing. ,我以為知道黎題嘅答案。 我講， ”膚色“。 
That nagging dread of self-hood didn't exist when I was dancing. ,“咁你即系話， 生物，基因咯？” 距講。 
I'd literally lose myself. ,”不過， 桑迪，黎個答案唔準確喔。 
And I was a really good dancer. ,因為系基因上 一個黑皮膚嘅肯尼亞人 同一個黑皮膚嘅烏干達人 的差別好多。 一個黑皮膚嘅肯尼亞人。 比如同， 一個白膚色挪威人之間亦有區別。 
I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing. ,因為我地都來自非洲。 
"I could be in the movement in a way that I wasn't able to be in my real life, in myself. ",所以系非洲， 有更長嘅時間 來形成基因多樣化。 “ 
"And at 16, I stumbled across another opportunity, and I earned my first acting role in a film. ",換言之， 種族的劃分 系無生物同科學的依據。 
I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting. ,一方面系結果。 
"My dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self, not my own, and it felt so good. ",o岩唔o岩？ 
"It was the first time that I existed inside a fully-functioning self -- one that I controlled, that I steered, that I gave life to. ",系另一方面， 我對自我嘅定義 就咁樣失去一大部分可信性。 
"But the shooting day would end, and I'd return to my gnarly, awkward self. ",可信嘅系， 生物學與科學事實， 就係我地都係來自非洲-- 事實上， 我地都源自一個女人-『粒線體夏娃』 她生後在16萬年前。 
"By 19, I was a fully-fledged movie actor, but still searching for definition. ",所以，種族系一個不合理的概念 系我地自我所塑造的 基於恐慌與無知。 
I applied to read anthropology at university. ,奇怪嘅系，了解到黎一切 並沒有治愈好我卑微的自尊， 仲系有果種異類感。 
"Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview, and she asked me, ""How would you define race?"" ",我想要就此消失的祈望 還是非常強烈。 
"Well, I thought I had the answer to that one, and I said, ""Skin color."" ",我有一個劍橋學位； 我嘅蒸蒸日上； 但我自己就似一場車禍， 結果我患上厭食症 並開始接受心理治療。 
"So biology, genetics? she said. ",我當然會變成咁。 
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate. 
Because there's actually more genetic difference between a black Kenyan and a black Ugandan than there is between a black Kenyan and, say, a white Norwegian. 
Because we all stem from Africa. 
So in Africa, there's been more time to create genetic diversity. ",當時我仍然相信 我的自我便是我的全部。 
"In other words, race has no basis in biological or scientific fact. ",我依然非常自重 勝於其他所有的價值。 我仲可以點唸？ 
"On the one hand, result. ",我地所創造出嘅整個價值系統 客觀存在緊 都系為著支撐黎個自我的價值觀。 
Right? ,睇下周邊為個人形象所建立的產業 仲有相關聯工作， 創造出的價值。 
"On the other hand, my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility. ",我地仲好去認為 黎個自我系個真實存在的東西。 
"But what was credible, what is biological and scientific fact, is that we all stem from Africa -- in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived 160,000 years ago. ",不過答案系否定的；黎只系一個投影， 一個我們聰明大腦所塑造出的投影 用來欺騙我地自己 好讓我地無需面對死亡黎個現實。 
And race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance. ,但系有樣嘢 距可以給予自我 終極，無限的聯繫-- 黎個就係合一性， 我們的本質。 
"Strangely, these revelations didn't cure my low self-esteem, that feeling of otherness. ",自我的鬥爭 為尋找真實性和定義 系永無休止 除非自我與其創造者一齊-- 同你， 同我。 
My desire to disappear was still very powerful. ,只要真正意識到黎點-- 意識到合一性的真實存在 與自我其實僅僅系一個投影。 
"I had a degree from Cambridge; I had a thriving career, but my self was a car crash, and I wound up with bulimia and on a therapist's couch. ",o岩開始的時，我地可以咁唸 當我地可以忘我的時。 
And of course I did. ,對我而言，但我跳舞時就會忘掉自己， 當我系表演時。 
I still believed my self was all I was. ,我接近我的本質， 把自我暫停。 
"I still valued self-worth above all other worth, and what was there to suggest otherwise? ",系黎段時間內， 我與萬物相連-- 大地，空氣， 聲音，觀眾中的能量。 
We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self. ,我所有感官都醒覺充滿活力 就好似一個初生嬰兒一樣--- 感覺到合一性。 
"Look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates, the revenue it turns over. ",當我表演一個角色的時候， 我居住在另一個自我裡， 我在一個段時間裡給予其生命。 因為，當我的自我被暫停後 分離與 評判的態度都被暫停。 
We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing. ,我中意表演各種角色 從奴隸時代復仇心重嘅鬼魂 到生活在2004年的國務卿。 
But it's not. It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death. ,無論別人的自我如何， 與我有多麼相異， 我都可以理解他們。 
"But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness, our essence. ",而我真的相信 成為一位成功演員的關鍵 還有我做為一個人進步的原因 就係我缺乏自我 即使黎種缺乏在過去令我感到 無比焦慮， 缺乏安全感。 
The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator -- to you and to me. ,我時時唸 點解我可以如此深刻感受到他人的痛楚， 點解我可以睇到 無名小卒裡的不平凡靈魂。 
And that can happen with awareness -- awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self-hood. ,因為我沒有一個自我來檔路。 
"For a start, we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves. ",我本以為我缺乏實在的存在， 還有我能夠感受他人 系因為我沒有一個自我的感受。 
"It happens when I dance, when I'm acting. ",在過去缺乏自我令我感到羞愧 反而依家成為我感悟的源泉。 
"I'm earthed in my essence, and my self is suspended. ",當我意識到， 並清楚知道後 我的自我只是一個投影，黎個自我有自己的功用， 一件有得意嘅事發生。 
"In those moments, I'm connected to everything -- the ground, the air, the sounds, the energy from the audience. ",我不在給我的自我很多權力。 
All my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel -- that feeling of oneness. ,我開始對它進行磨練。 
"And when I'm acting a role, I inhabit another self, and I give it life for awhile, because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment. ",我帶我的自我做心理治療。 
And I've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to Secretary of State in 2004. ,我已經對自我 不良的行為好熟悉。 
"And no matter how other these selves might be, they're all related in me. ",但我不再對自己感到羞愧。 
And I honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure. ,事實上， 我開始尊重自己 自我運轉的功能。 
"I always wondered why I could feel others' pain so deeply, why I could recognize the somebody in the nobody. ",通過長時間鍛煉， 我不斷嘗試從我的 本源生活。 
It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way. ,如果你可以做到黎一點， 奇妙的事情就會發生。 
"I thought I lacked substance, and the fact that I could feel others' meant that I had nothing of myself to feel. ","二月份當我系剛果，果陣時， 與自我遭到被無法想像的 真實毀滅女性 一起跳舞慶祝 系字面上無法形容-- 與其他被摧殘了的扭曲心靈的自我的人們 一起同在黎片美麗的土地 來推動我地自省的意識，抵觸自我上癮 對於iPods, iPads同埋其他外表光鮮的事物 黎D另我地上癮，令我地中斷接近自己 黎D癮另我地更加無法感到他人的痛苦， 他人的磨難， 他人的存亡/ "
The thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of enlightenment. ,因為， 如果我地各自活在自我的生活裡， 還以為咁就係人生， 那麼我地正在貶低人生的價值 對一切都不在敏感。 
"And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened. ",系咁樣一個隔離狀態， 無錯，我地可以建造一個唔需要窗嘅工廠， 摧毀海洋生命 用強暴作為戰爭的武器。 
I stopped giving it so much authority. ,所以， 我有一個對於自我的建議： 在我地塑造的鋼筋水泥世界 已經呈現裂痕， 大海將會不斷的 沿著裂縫上湧， 仲有石油和血， 將匯流成河。 
I give it its due. ,關鍵就係，我地仲沒搵到 怎樣與地球 以及其他生物合一共存。 
I take it to therapy. ,我地瘋狂地試圖尋找 與其他人共存的方式- 幾十億人類。 
I've become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior. ,不過並唔係我地系一起生活， 而我地系瘋狂的自我生活在一起 不斷的蔓延，讓我們無法交匯 產生溝通疫病。 
But I'm not ashamed of my self. ,讓我們真正的生活在一起 一步一步來， 
"In fact, I respect my self and its function. ",如果我地可以潛伏在自我之下， 點燃自省的火炬， 去尋找我們的根源， 咁我地就可以無限 並與萬物產生聯繫的紐帶。 
"And over time and with practice, I've tried to live more and more from my essence. ",我們從出生之日便知黎個紐帶。 
"And if you can do that, incredible things happen. ",我們不需要因為 大把的空虛而感到慌張。 
"I was in Congo in February, dancing and celebrating with women who've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways -- destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves' addiction to iPods, Pads, and bling, which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain, their suffering, their death. ",我們生存的狀態就是一個事實 僅僅系我們自己創造的。 
"Because, hey, if we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life, then we're devaluing and desensitizing life. ",想像下，我們的生存方式會系點樣 如果我地能夠直面自我不可避免的死亡， 珍惜我們可以生存的權利 對即將發生的事情保持驚喜之心。 
"And in that disconnected state, yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows, destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war. ",黎D簡單的意識，就是回歸根本的開始。 
"So here's a note to self: The cracks have started to show in our constructed world, and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks, and oil and blood, rivers of it. ",感謝你地來聽我的演講。 
"Crucially, we haven't been figuring out how to live in oneness with the Earth and every other living thing. ",（掌聲） 
We've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other -- billions of each other. ,
Only we're not living with each other; our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection. ,今日嘅問題唔係︰ 點解我哋派兵阿富汗？ 
Let's live with each other and take it a breath at a time. ,問題係︰ 點解十年後嘅今日 我哋仲喺阿富汗？ 
"If we can get under that heavy self, light a torch of awareness, and find our essence, our connection to the infinite and every other living thing. ",點解我哋仲要用 1350億美金？ 
We knew it from the day we were born. ,點解仲有13萬地面軍隊？ 
Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness. ,點解呢場衝突 上個月犧牲嘅人數 比起以前嘅月份都多？ 
It's more a reality than the ones our selves have created. ,點解會咁？ 
"Imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self, appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next. ",過去20年 係干預嘅年代 阿富汗只係五幕悲劇中嘅 其中一幕 
Simple awareness is where it begins. ,我哋喺絕望中 由冷戰結束行出嚟 
Thank you for listening. ,我哋面對盧旺達 我哋面對波斯尼亞 然後我哋搵番自信 
(Applause) ,喺第三幕，我哋進入波斯尼亞同科索沃 而且我哋睇起嚟成功咗 
,喺第四幕 傲慢助長咗過度自信 我哋入侵咗伊拉克同阿富汗 而喺第五章 我哋趺入咗令人羞愧嘅混亂 
The question today is not: Why did we invade Afghanistan? ,所以個問題係︰我哋喺度做緊咩？ 
The question is: why are we still in Afghanistan one decade later? ,點解我哋仲留喺阿富汗？ 
Why are we spending $135 billion? ,答案，當然 正如人哋一直同我哋咁講︰ 我哋派兵阿富汗 係因為911 而軍隊仲留喺當地 係因為塔利班對全球嘅安全 
"Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground? ","存在威脅 用總統奧巴馬嘅說話︰ ""如果塔利班再次掌控 佢哋會請阿爾蓋達組織番嚟 殺盡我哋嘅人"" "
Why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict? ,"人哋話俾我哋聽 一開始只係一個""輕足印"" – 即係話，當時嘅情況係 無足夠嘅軍隊 無足夠嘅資源 令阿富汗人失望 佢哋覺得經濟發展同保安 嘅進展都都唔夠 所以塔利班番咗嚟 – 於是我哋喺2005同2006年 以軍隊部署嚟回應 但係我哋嘅地面部隊都係唔夠 "
How has this happened? ,"直至2009年 總統奧巴馬簽署咗增加兵嘅方案 終於，我哋有啦 用美國國務卿希拉里嘅說話 ""戰略、領導同資源"" "
"The last 20 years has been the age of intervention, and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy. ",所以總統依架同我哋保證 我哋向緊目標進發 
We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair. ,所有都係錯架 
"We faced Rwanda; we faced Bosnia, and then we rediscovered our confidence. ",每一句都係錯架 
"In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo and we seemed to succeed. ",阿富汗無對全球全球嘅安全 造成威脅 
"In the fourth act, with our hubris, our overconfidence developing, we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, and in the fifth act, we plunged into a humiliating mess. ",而塔利班 係其乎無可能奪得國家嘅控制權 – 佢哋無咩可能奪取喀布爾 
So the question is: What are we doing? ,佢哋根本無常規軍隊 
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan? ,就算佢哋可以咁做，就算我錯 喺塔利班嘅角度嚟睇 塔利班都無咩可能 
"And the answer, of course, that we keep being given is as follows: we're told that we went into Afghanistan because of 9/11, and that we remain there because the Taliban poses an existential threat to global security. ",請阿爾蓋達組織番嚟 呢個正係佢哋上次犯嘅最大錯誤 
"In the words of President Obama, ""If the Taliban take over again, they will invite back Al-Qaeda, who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can."" ",如果佢哋無請阿爾蓋達組織番嚟 佢哋今日仲掌緊權 
"The story that we're told is that there was a ""light footprint"" initially -- in other words, that we ended up in a situation where we didn't have enough troops, we didn't have enough resources, that Afghans were frustrated -- they felt there wasn't enough progress and economic development and security, and therefore the Taliban came back -- that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments, but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground. ",如果呢兩點我都係錯 就算佢哋可以攞番個國家 就算佢哋請阿爾蓋達組織番嚟 阿爾蓋達組織都唔太可能 大幅增加實力 去危害美國 或者去危害歐洲 
"And that it wasn't until 2009, when President Obama signed off on a surge, that we finally had, in the words of Secretary Clinton, ""the strategy, the leadership and the resources."" ",因為依架已經唔再係90年代 
"So, as the president now reassures us, we are on track to achieve our goals. ",如果阿爾蓋達組織嘅基地 係喺加茲尼附近 我哋就可以大力打擊佢哋 而塔利班就好難，好難 保護佢哋 
All of this is wrong. ,再講，人哋話 喺阿富汗發生過嘅係輕足印 係錯架 
Every one of those statements is wrong. ,喺我嘅經驗嚟睇，事實上 輕足印係非常有幫助 
Afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security. ,我哋呢啲軍隊 – 將碧咸張靚相 放咗喺佢哋嘅衝鋒槍上 – 令到情況差咗，而唔係好咗 
It is extremely unlikely the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul. ,喺2001到2002年嘅冬天 我徒步橫越阿富汗 我睇到嘅係咁樣嘅景象 
They simply don't have a conventional military option. ,如果你好彩嘅話會見到 一個女仔喺陰暗嘅房間角落 – 好好彩咁可以睇可蘭經 
"And even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong, it's extremely unlikely the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda. ",但係之前 當我哋嘅軍隊同資源都唔夠嘅時候 我哋喺阿富汗嘅進展好好 
"From the Taliban's point of view, that was their number one mistake last time. ",喺幾個月之內 多咗25萬個女仔入學 
"If they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda, they would still be in power today. ",2002年我喺Sangin嘅時候病咗 最近嘅診所 要行三日先到 
"And even if I'm wrong about those two things, even if they were able to take back the country, even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda, it's extremely unlikely that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the United States or harm Europe. ",今日，單單喺嗰個地區 就有14間診所 
Because this isn't the 1990s anymore. ,進展得好驚人 
"If the Al-Qaeda base was to be established near Ghazni, we would hit them very hard, and it would be very, very difficult for the Taliban to protect them. ",阿富汗人由塔利班 幾乎無人有手提電話嘅時代 到差唔多一夜間 30萬阿富汗人都有手提電話 
"Furthermore, it's simply not true that what went wrong in Afghanistan is the light footprint. ",我哋喺媒體自由方面都有進展 
"In my experience, in fact, the light footprint was extremely helpful. ",選舉方面都有進展 – 呢啲就係所謂嘅輕足印 
"And these troops that we brought in -- it's a great picture of David Beckham there on the sub-machine gun -- made the situation worse, not better. ",但係當我哋開始投放更多資金 當我哋投入更多資源 事情變壞，而無好到，點解？ 
"When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002, what I saw was scenes like this. ",首先，如果你每年將1250億美金 投放喺阿富汗呢種國家 全國整體收入 每年只有10億美金 你就會掩蓋曬所有嘢 
"A girl, if you're lucky, in the corner of a dark room -- lucky to be able to look at the Koran. ",你唔只造成貪污 同浪費 你根本上取代咗阿富汗政府嘅主要任務 選出嚟嘅阿富汗政府 傾向微觀管理 去短途旅行嘅外國人 
"But in those early days when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources, we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan. ",軍隊方面都係一樣道理 
"Within a few months, there were two and a half million more girls in school. ",我行過阿富汗嘅時候 我同呢啲人一齊 
"In Sangin where I was sick in 2002, the nearest health clinic was within three days walk. ",佢係喺 Kamenj 嘅 指揮官 Haji Malem Mohsin Khan 
"Today, there are 14 health clinics in that area alone. ",佢係一個好好嘅主人 
There was amazing improvements. ,佢好慷慨 同好多我相處過嘅阿富汗人一樣 
"We went from almost no Afghans having mobile telephones during the Taliban to a situation where, almost overnight, three million Afghans had mobile telephones. ",但係佢比我哋認為嘅 相對地更保守 相對更排斥外國 相對更相信伊斯蘭教 
And we had progress in the free media. ,例如呢個人 Mullah Mustafa 試過射殺我 
We had progress in elections -- all of this with the so-called light footprint. ,我喺呢張相入面望落有嘅困惑嘅原因 係我有啲嚇親 當時我好驚，唔敢問佢 佢用咗成個鐘跑過嗰沙漠 匿喺呢間屋 問佢點解會出現要我同佢合照 
"But when we began to bring more money, when we began to invest more resources, things got worse, not better. How? ",但18個月之後，我問佢 點解要射殺我 
"Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year, you drown everything. ",Mullah Mustafa 解釋 因為佢係拎住紙同筆嘅人 而喺呢張相我嘅左手邊 Nadir Shah同佢輸賭佢傷唔到我 
"It's not simply corruption and waste that you create; you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government, the elected Afghan government, with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours with their own priorities. ",我嘅意思唔係話 阿富汗人都同 Mullah Mustafa 一樣 
And the same is true for the troops. ,唔係咁嘅 嗰個地方好美好 充滿活力同智慧 
"When I walked across Afghanistan, I stayed with people like this. ",但係呢個地方 被投放咗軍隊 增加咗，而無減少到暴力 
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj. ,2005年 一位農業工程師 Anthony Fitzherbert 可以橫越赫爾曼德省 可以留喺 Nad Ali， Sangin 同 Ghoresh 呢啲哋方依架已經成為咗戰地 
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host. ,今日，佢唔再可以咁樣做 
"He was very generous, like many of the Afghans I stayed with. ",所以我哋話以部處軍隊 嚟回應塔利班嘅叛亂 係錯架 
"But he was also considerably more conservative, considerably more anti-foreign, considerably more Islamist than we'd like to acknowledge. ",部署軍隊唔係喺塔利班叛亂之後發生 而係隨之而嚟 依我睇 部署軍隊係塔利班回歸嘅原因 
"This man, for example, Mullah Mustafa, tried to shoot me. ",呢個係一個新嘅講法？ 
"And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is I was somewhat frightened, and I was too afraid on this occasion to ask him, having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house, why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me. ",唔係，喺過去嘅七年 已經有好多人談論呢個觀點 
"But 18 months later, I asked him why he had tried to shoot me. ",喺 2008 至 2010 年我喺哈佛 管理過一個中心 嗰度嘅人，好似 Michael Semple 可以講流利嘅阿富汗語言 佢幾乎遊歷過阿富汗所有地區 
"And Mullah Mustafa -- he's the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph, Nadir Shah had bet him that he couldn't hit me. ",例如 Andrew Wilder 喺巴基斯坦同伊朗邊境出世 佢一生 都為巴基斯坦同阿富汗工作 
Now this is not to say Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa. ,Paul Fishstein 喺 1978 年開始 喺阿富汗工作 – 喺救助兒童會做 負責當地嘅研究同評估小組 
It's not; it's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence. ,呢啲人 佢哋由始至終都係話 增加發展援助 令阿富汗無咁安全 而唔係更安全 – 而反叛亂策略 係行唔通，亦唔會行得通 
But it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it. ,但係，無人聽佢哋講 
"2005, Anthony Fitzherbert, an agricultural engineer, could travel through Helmand, could stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh, which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place. ",反而 係一連串令人驚訝嘅樂觀主義 
"Today, he could never do that. ","喺 2004 年開始 每一位上任嘅將軍都話 ""我接手咗一個慘淡嘅局面 但最終當我有 適合嘅資源同啱嘅策略 會創造出"" 用 Barno 將軍喺 2004 年嘅原話 “決定性嘅一年” "
So the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the Taliban insurgency is mistaken. ,你估下點？事實唔係咁 
"Rather than preceding the insurgency, the Taliban followed the troop deployment, and as far as I'm concerned, the troop deployment caused their return. ","但係咁並唔足以 阻止 Abuzaid 將軍話 佢有戰略同資源 喺 2005 年創造 ""決定性嘅一年"" "
Now is this a new idea? ,"或者 David Richards 將軍 喺 2006 年上任嘅時候 話佢有戰略同資源 創造""關鍵嘅一年"" "
"No, there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years. ","或者喺 2007 年 挪威副外交大臣 Espen Eide 話會創造""決定性嘅一年"" "
"I ran a center at Harvard from 2008 to 2010, and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently, who've traveled to almost every district in the country. ","或者喺2008年 Champoux 少將上任 話佢會創造""決定性嘅一年"" "
"Andrew Wilder, for example, born on the Pakistan-Iranian border, served his whole life in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ","或者喺2009年，我嘅好朋友 Stanley McChrystal 將軍 話佢""非常關注決定性嘅一年"" "
"Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 -- worked for Save the Children, ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit. ","或者喺2010年 英國外相文禮彬話 最後我哋會創造""決定性嘅一年"" "
"These are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure -- that the counter-insurgency strategy was not working and would not work. ","2011年嘅今日 你會好開心咁聽到 德國外交部長 Guido Westerwelle 同我哋保證 我哋處於""決定性嘅一年"" "
"And yet, nobody listened to them. ",(掌聲) 我哋點會俾 呢啲嘢發生？ 
"Instead, there was a litany of astonishing optimism. ",個答案當然係 如果你一年喺一個國家 用1250或者1300億美金 你幾乎要說服所有人支持你 
"Beginning in 2004, every general came in saying, ""I've inherited a dismal situation, but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy, which will deliver,"" in General Barno's word in 2004, the ""decisive year."" ",甚係援助機構 佢哋喺美國同歐洲政府度 收到巨額資助 用嚟起學校同診所 都會唔願意 去挑戰呢個諗法 話阿富汗係全球安全 
Well guess what? It didn't. ,存在威脅 換句話嚟講，佢哋擔心 如果有任何人相信根本無威脅 – 樂施會、救助兒童 就唔會拎到錢 去起醫院同學校 
"But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying that he had the strategy and the resources to deliver, in 2005, the ""decisive year."" ",我哋都好難同一個 心口掛滿勛章嘅將軍對抗 
"Or General David Richards to come in 2006 and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the ""crunch year."" ",對政客嚟講都好難 因為你驚好多人會白白浪費咗生命 
"Or in 2007, the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide, to say that that would deliver the ""decisive year."" ",你深深感受到愧疚 
"Or in 2008, Major General Champoux to come in and say he would deliver the ""decisive year."" ",你誇大你嘅恐懼 俾擊敗嘅屈辱嚇怕 
"Or in 2009, my great friend, General Stanley McChrystal, who said that he was ""knee-deep in the decisive year."" ",有咩解決嘅方法呢？ 
"Or in 2010, the U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband, who said that at last we would deliver the ""decisive year."" ",解決嘅方法係 我哋要搵到 好似 Michael Semple 或者其他會講真話嘅人 了解佢哋國家嘅情況 喺當地生活咗30年 – 更重要嘅係 缺乏嘅呢部份嘅正係 – 阿富汗人自己 佢哋明白發生緊咩事 
"And you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today, that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, assures us that we are in the ""decisive year."" ",我哋要將佢哋嘅信息 話俾制定政策嘅人知 
(Applause) How do we allow any of this to happen? ,呢點好難做到 因為我哋嘅體制 
"Well the answer, of course, is, if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion dollars a year in a country, you co-opt almost everybody. ",我哋首先要改變嘅係 我哋政府嘅架構 
"Even the aid agencies, who begin to receive an enormous amount of money from the U.S. and the European governments to build schools and clinics, are somewhat disinclined to challenge the idea that Afghanistan is an existential threat to global security. ",非常悲哀嘅係 我哋嘅大使館、聯合國 喺呢啲國家嘅軍隊 都唔了解當地嘅情況 
"They're worried, in other words, that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat -- Oxfam, Save the Children wouldn't get the money to build their hospitals and schools. ",平均每個英國軍人駐紮6個月 意大利軍人駐紮4個月 美國軍隊駐紮12個月 
It's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest. ,外交官又唔俾離開大使館 
"It's very difficult for a politician, because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain. ",離開嘅時候 都喺坐呢啲唔尋常有武器嘅車 又會有啲嚇人嘅保鑣團隊 呢啲保鑣仲會早24小時準備好 佢哋只會俾你喺出面逗留1個鐘 
"You feel deep, deep guilt. ",喺駐阿富汗嘅英國使館 喺2008年 成個使館入面350個工作人員 只有3個人識得講似樣嘅 阿富汗嘅主要語言達利語 
"You exaggerate your fears, and you're terrified about the humiliation of defeat. ",同埋無一個識講普什圖語 
What is the solution to this? ,喺倫敦嘅阿富汗組 負責決定喺阿富汗嘅政策 舊年有人話俾我知 喺外交部嘅嗰個組別入面 無任何一個職員 曾經喺阿富汗任職 
"Well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like Michael Semple, or those other people, who are telling the truth, who know the country, who've spent 30 years on the ground -- and most importantly of all, the missing component of this -- Afghans themselves, who understand what is going on. ",所以我哋需要改變呢種體制文化 
We need to somehow get their message to the policymakers. ,我都可以話俾大家知 美國同聯合國都有相同嘅問題 
And this is very difficult to do because of our structures. ,第二，我哋要小心對待將士嘅樂觀 
The first thing we need to change is the structures of our government. ,我哋需要抱持住一啲懷疑 明白樂觀 係植根咗喺軍隊嘅DNA入面 我哋唔會好快咁 用沉默回應 
"Very, very sadly, our foreign services, the United Nations, the military in these countries have very little idea of what's going on. ",第三，我哋要有謙遜 
"The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months; Italian soldiers, on tours of four months; the American military, on tours of 12 months. ",我哋要喺 我哋嘅知識，我哋嘅權力 我哋嘅合法性 都係有限嘅情況下開始 
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds. ,咁唔係話 世界上所有嘅干預都係一個災難 
"When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready 24 hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour. ",唔係架 波斯尼亞同科索沃 都係成功嘅例子 係極大嘅成功 
"In the British embassy in Afghanistan in 2008, an embassy of 350 people, there were only three people who could speak Dari, the main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level. ",當你今日去波斯尼亞 你幾乎唔會相信 90年早期喺嗰度發生嘅事 
And there was not a single Pashto speaker. ,由1994年開始，嗰度嘅進展 幾乎無辦法相信 
"In the Afghan section in London responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground, I was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a posting in Afghanistan. ",難民番屋企 但係聯合國難民署 就認為係好唔可能發生嘅 喺嗰度大規模發生咗 
So we need to change that institutional culture. ,退還咗100萬份財產 
And I could make the same points about the United States and the United Nations. ,波斯尼亞人同 波斯尼亞塞族人之間嘅邊界分爭停止咗 
"Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals. ",國家嘅軍隊縮減咗 
"We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious, that we understand that optimism is in the DNA of the military, that we don't respond to it with quite as much alacrity. ",今日波斯尼亞嘅犯罪率 比瑞典仲低 
"And thirdly, we need to have some humility. ",呢個成就 係源於國際社會嘅 不可思議，有原則嘅努力 當然，最主要嘅係 波斯尼亞人自己嘅努力 
"We need to begin from the position that our knowledge, our power, our legitimacy is limited. ",另外，你仲要睇下件事嘅背景 
This doesn't mean that intervention around the world is a disaster. ,呢樣就係我哋對阿富汗 
"Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes, great successes. ",同伊拉克中缺少嘅 你要明白，喺嗰啲地方 最重要嘅係 首先，圖季曼同米洛舍維奇 喺達成協議過程中嘅角色 同埋佢哋經歷過嘅事 好似係地區嘅情況改善 歐盟可以為波斯尼亞 提供特別嘅機會︰ 加入一個 新嘅俱樂部嘅機會 加入一個更大組織嘅機會 
Today when you go to Bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early 1990s happened. ,最後，我哋要明白 喺波斯尼亞同科索沃入面 有好多我哋做過嘅秘密 有好多我哋成功嘅秘密 都係我哋嘅謙遜 – 係我哋暫時性嘅干預 
It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made since 1994. ,我哋喺波斯尼亞批評咗好多人 佢哋對戰犯嘅行動緩慢 
"Refugee return, which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees thought would be extremely unlikely, has largely happened. ",我哋批評佢哋 對難民歸國嘅行動緩慢 
A million properties have been returned. ,克林頓總統一開始話 美軍只會留守一年 但正正係呢種緩慢，呢種謹慎 依架睇嚟係優勢 而且幫我哋搞清咗楚重點 
Borders between the Bosniak territory and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down. ,喺我哋對阿富汗嘅干預之中 最悲哀嘅莫過於 所有人嘅重點唔一致 
The national army has shrunk. ,我哋嘅資源同重點配對唔到 
The crime rates in Bosnia today are lower than they are in Sweden. ,如果我哋想反恐 咁巴基斯坦比阿富汗更加重要 
"This has been done by an incredible, principled effort by the international community, and, of course, above all, by Bosnians themselves. ",如果我哋想穩定地區局勢 咁埃及更加重要 
But you need to look at context. ,如果我哋擔心貧困同發展 咁撒哈拉以南嘅非洲更加重要 
And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq. ,咁唔係話阿富汗唔重要 但係呢個只係世界上40個 我哋需要照顧嘅國家之一 
"You need to understand that in those places what really mattered was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic in coming to the agreement, and then the fact those men went, that the regional situation improved, that the European Union could offer Bosnia something extraordinary: the chance to be part of a new thing, a new club, a chance to join something bigger. ",咁如果我要比喻國際干預 我哋可以將佢 想像成山地救援 
"And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo, a lot of the secret of what we did, a lot of the secret of our success, was our humility -- was the tentative nature of our engagement. ",點解係山地救援？ 
We criticized people a lot in Bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals. ,因為當人講起國際干預 佢哋會想像出一啲科學理論 – 蘭德公司 搜集咗43個叛亂嘅先例 建立出一條數學公式 話俾你知，每20個居民 就要有一個受過訓練嘅 反叛亂部隊成員 
We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees. ,呢個睇法係錯架 
"But that slowness, that caution, the fact that President Clinton initially said that American troops would only be deployed for a year, turned out to be a strength, and it helped us to put our priorities right. ",你應該將山地救援睇法 
One of the saddest things about our involvement in Afghanistan is that we've got our priorities out of sync. ,擺落呢件事度 喺山地救援入面 你唔需要一個博士學位 你需要嘅係搵一個熟悉地形嘅人 
We're not matching our resources to our priorities. ,係睇情況而定 
"Because if what we're interested in is terrorism, Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan. ",你可以提早準備 但係可以準備嘅嘢 係有限嘅 – 你可以帶啲水，帶張地圖 孭個背囊 
"If what we're interested in is regional stability, Egypt is far more important. ",但真正重要嘅 係兩種困難 – 喺山度出現嘅問題 係唔可以預測嘅 例如山坡上面結咗冰 但你都可以避開 另外就係你預計唔到 而且無避唔開嘅問題 好似係突發嘅暴風雪或者雪崩 或者係天氣嘅變化 
"If what we're worried about is poverty and development, sub-Saharan Africa is far more important. ",呢度嘅關鍵 就係搵一個喺唔同嘅溫度下 喺每一個時段 去過呢坐山嘅嚮導 – 最重要嘅係呢個嚮導 知道幾時折返 喺條件轉差嘅情況下 佢唔會不停咁前進 
"This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter, but that it's one of 40 countries in the world with which we need to engage. ",我哋揀 消防員、登山者、警察嘅時候 同我哋揀人去參與國際干預嘅時候 都係搵聰明嘅冒險者 – 唔係會跳落懸崖嘅人 唔係會跳入火場嘅人 係會衡量風險嘅人 會權衡責任嘅人 
"So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention, what we need to think of is something like mountain rescue. ",因為我哋喺阿富汗做過最差嘅嘢 係呢個諗法 唔準失敗 
Why mountain rescue? ,咁樣令失敗變成透明 難以置信同埋唔可以避免 
"Because when people talk about intervention, they imagine that some scientific theory -- the Rand Corporation goes around counting 43 previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter-insurgent for every 20 members of the population. ",如果我哋可以抵抗 呢個瘋狂嘅口號 我哋就會發現 – 喺埃及、敍利亞、利比亞 仲有我哋干預過嘅國家 – 如果我哋可以做得比假裝嘅少啲 我哋反而可以做得比起驚慌更多 
This is the wrong way of looking at it. ,多謝大家 
You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue. ,(掌聲) 多謝，非常多謝 
"When you're doing mountain rescue, you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue, you look for somebody who knows the terrain. ",多謝，非常多謝 
It's about context. ,多謝，多謝，多謝 
"You understand that you can prepare, but the amount of preparation you can do is limited -- you can take some water, you can have a map, you can have a pack. ",(掌聲) 多謝 
"But what really matters is two kinds of problems -- problems that occur on the mountain which you couldn't anticipate, such as, for example, ice on a slope, but which you can get around, and problems which you couldn't anticipate and which you can't get around, like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather. ",多謝，多謝 
"And the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain, in every temperature, at every period -- a guide who, above all, knows when to turn back, who doesn't press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them. ",多謝 
"What we look for in firemen, in climbers, in policemen, and what we should look for in intervention, is intelligent risk takers -- not people who plunge blind off a cliff, not people who jump into a burning room, but who weigh their risks, weigh their responsibilities. ",(掌聲) Bruno Giussani︰Rory 
Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option. ,你最後提到利比亞 簡單啲問，你對嗰度近期嘅事件 同干預有咩睇法？ 
"It makes failure invisible, inconceivable and inevitable. ",Rory︰我覺得利比亞 展示咗一個經典問題 
"And if we can resist this crazy slogan, we shall discover -- in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya, and anywhere else we go in the world -- that if we can often do much less than we pretend, we can do much more than we fear. ",喺利比亞嘅問題 係我哋成日要分黑白 
Thank you very much. ,想像一下我哋淨係得兩個選擇 一係完全干預同部署軍隊 一係完全孤立 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. ,我哋成日都忍唔住陷入去 
Thank you. Thank you very much. ,我哋輕微咁接觸就完全陷入 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ,我哋喺利比亞應該 嚴格遵守聯合國決議 
(Applause) Thank you. ,我哋應該好嚴咁限制自己 去保護班加西嘅人民 
Thank you. Thank you. ,我哋本來可以咁做 我哋喺48個鐘內制定禁飛區 因為卡達菲喺48個鐘入面 無飛機 
Thank you. ,調反轉頭，如果我哋忍受唔到 政權更變嘅誘惑 
"(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Rory, you mentioned Libya at the end. ",咁我哋就會破壞咗 安全理事會嘅誠信 亦即係話更難 為敍利亞提供議案 我哋又再為自己埋下失敗嘅種子 
"Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there and the intervention? ",再一次，謙遜嘅態度 自我限定、誠實 實際嘅期望 可以成就一啲我哋引以自豪嘅事 
"Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem. ",Bruno︰Rory，好多謝你 
The problem in Libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white. ,Rory︰多謝你 (Bruno︰多謝你) 
We imagine there are only two choices: either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation. ,
And we are always being tempted up to our neck. ,長久以來， 我，與我的身體，似乎毫不相關。 
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck. ,“我”滿腦都系故事， 都系願望和追求 同埋對未來嘅憧憬。 
What we should have done in Libya is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution. ,“我”一直系度努力， 唔好成為我那不堪回首的過去所造成的惡果， 但其實， “我”與“我嘅身體”的分離， 就系一個非常惡劣的後果。 
"We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi. ",“我”過去經常渴望成為大人物。 
We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours because Gaddafi had no planes within 48 hours. ,那個“我”，不斷地嘗試。 
"Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change. ",“我嘅身體”卻總阻住“我”。 
"In doing so, we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council, which means it's very difficult to get a resolution on Syria, and we're setting ourselves up again for failure. ",“我”系一個漂浮的靈魂。 
"Once more, humility, limits, honesty, realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of. ",甘多年來，我其實只戴帽。 
"BG: Rory, thank you very much. ",甘可以讓我感覺到，我嘅頭仲系度。 
RS: Thank you. (BG: Thank you.) ,系一種“穩返自我”嘅方法。 
,我時常擔心，如果我脫佐頂帽， 我就不復存在了。 
"For a long time, there was me, and my body. ",以前有一個醫生同我講， “伊娃，你已經來呢度兩年了，” “講句實話，我從來不認為你有個身體。” 
"Me was composed of stories, of cravings, of strivings, of desires of the future. ",我過去一直住系城裡， 因為，講句實話， 我好驚啲樹。 
"Me was trying not to be an outcome of my violent past, but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome. ",我一直無生BB， 因為凈得個頭，系生唔到BB嘅。 
"Me was always trying to become something, somebody. ",BB唔會從把口入邊出來。 
Me only existed in the trying. ,因為我對自己嘅身體無發言權， 我開始問其他嘅女人，關於佢地嘅身體—— 特別系，佢地嘅陰道。 因為，我認為陰道系一個很重要的部位。 
My body was often in the way. ,呢個亦系我點解會開始寫“陰道的獨白”的原因， 也令我執著不斷地，持續地， 到處談論陰道。 
Me was a floating head. ,我系陌生人面前都會講。 
"For years, I actually only wore hats. ",有一晚，系臺上， 我進入佐我的陰道。 
It was a way of keeping my head attached. ,呢次經歷令我狂喜。 
It was a way of locating myself. ,令我恐慌，令我充滿活力。 我從此之後，變得好似被操縱， 我的陰道亦都似被操縱。 
I worried that [if] I took my hat off I wouldn't be here anymore. ,我開始將我嘅身體當成一件物品， 佢可以很快地移動， 可以完成其他的事情， 可以同時完成很多事情。 
"I actually had a therapist who once said to me, ""Eve, you've been coming here for two years, and, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body."" ",我開始將我的身體看作一部iPad或者汽車。 
"All this time I lived in the city because, to be honest, I was afraid of trees. ",我可以渣住佢，驅使佢，從佢身上得到很多。 
I never had babies because heads cannot give birth. ,佢無極限，佢不可戰勝。 
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth. ,就像地球一樣，佢能被征服，被掌控。 
"As I had no reference point for my body, I began to ask other women about their bodies -- in particular, their vaginas, because I thought vaginas were kind of important. ",我根本唔關心佢； 我吩咐佢，命令佢。 
"This led to me writing ""The Vagina Monologues,"" which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere I could. ",我對佢無耐心； 我將佢硬生折成我要的形狀。 
I did this in front of many strangers. ,我太貪心了。 
"One night on stage, I actually entered my vagina. ",我要的比佢能俾的多得多。 
It was an ecstatic experience. ,如果我累佐，我就飲咖啡。 
"It scared me, it energized me, and then I became a driven person, a driven vagina. ",如果我怕佐，我就去更多危險嘅地方。 
"I began to see my body like a thing, a thing that could move fast, like a thing that could accomplish other things, many things, all at once. ",不過肯定啦，我都有欣賞佢嘅時候。 就好似，暴虐嘅父母， 都有時會慈悲。 
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car. ,好比，系我16歲生日果日， 我爹地就真系對我很好。 
I would drive it and demand things from it. ,我時常聽到人人竊竊私語， 講，我應該愛惜自己嘅身體。 所以，我一直努力學點去愛惜身體。 
It had no limits. It was invincible. ,我過去系素食主義者，唔飲酒，唔食煙。 
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself. ,不過，這只不過系一種，去操縱身體 更複雜嘅方式—— 系與身體嘅分離， 就好似系公路上種蔬菜。 
"I didn't heed it; no, I organized it and I directed it. ",因為我成日講我嘅陰道， 好多女人都開始話卑我知，佢地嘅陰道—— 佢地嘅故事，關於佢地嘅身體。 
I didn't have patience for my body; I snapped it into shape. ,呢地故事，令我想去世界各地行下。 我去佐60幾個國家。 
I was greedy. ,我聽到成千上萬個故事。 我想話卑你知，總有一個時刻， 那些女人話卑我知， 佢地與佢地嘅身體分離嘅那一個時刻—— 離開家嘅那一刻。 
I took more than my body had to offer. ,我聽講，女人們系自己嘅床上被性騷擾， 系自己嘅布卡入邊被鞭打， 系停車場里奄奄一息， 系自己嘅廚房里被潑上酸性腐蝕液體。 
"If I was tired, I drank more espressos. ",有些女人沉默了，有些銷聲匿跡了。 
"If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places. ",仲有一些，變得瘋癲，變得似我，似部被人操縱嘅機器。 
"Oh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body, the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness. ",在我嘅旅途中， 我40歲了，我開始憎恨我嘅身體， 不過其實系進步佐， 起碼我嘅身體已經有資格被恨了。 
"My father was really kind to me on my 16th birthday, for example. ",我嘅肚——我好憎我嘅肚。 
"I heard people murmur from time to time that I should love my body, so I learned how to do this. ",佢話卑我知，我唔合格， 我又老，又無魅力，又唔完美 不能與原定嘅，大家心目中嘅形象相匹配。 
"I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke. ",我嘅肚，證明佐我嘅失敗， 佢令我失望，佢形如廢物。 
"But all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body -- a further disassociation, like planting a vegetable field on a freeway. ",我嘅生活開始圍繞點除佐佢，我心神不寧，一心要除佐佢。 
"As a result of me talking so much about my vagina, many women started to tell me about theirs -- their stories about their bodies. ",事實上，佢變得甘極端， 我甚至寫佐關於佢嘅一部劇。 
"Actually, these stories compelled me around the world, and I've been to over 60 countries. ",不過，我講起佢，講得愈多， 我嘅身體，就顯得越加似個冷冰冰、破碎嘅物體。 
"I heard thousands of stories, and I have to tell you, there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body -- when she left home. ",變得似娛樂，似新商品， 我到處推銷嘅一件物品。 
"I heard about women being molested in their beds, flogged in their burqas, left for dead in parking lots, acid burned in their kitchens. ",然後，我去佐另一個地方。 
Some women became quiet and disappeared. ,我行出去， 去佐一個我自以為我熟識嘅地方。 
"Other women became mad, driven machines like me. ",我去佐剛果共和國。 
"In the middle of my traveling, I turned 40 and I began to hate my body, which was actually progress, because at least my body existed enough to hate it. ",我聽聞佐一些故事， 呢地故事令其他嘅故事黯然無光。 
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated. ,呢地故事 貫穿佐我嘅身體。 
"It was proof that I had not measured up, that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape. ",一個小女孩， 小便失禁， 因為有好多成年士兵， 殘忍地強暴佐她。 
"My stomach was proof that I had failed, that it had failed me, that it was broken. ",一個80歲嘅老婆婆， 被折斷佐腿，脫佐臼， 被扭到頭頂， 那些士兵就系甘強暴佐佢。 
My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it. ,有成千上萬個咁樣嘅故事。 許多女人身體里永遠的留低佐創口—— 一個個洞，一個個流膿嘅傷口—— 呢地都系戰爭留低嘅傷口—— 靈魂嘅創口。 
"In fact, it became so extreme I wrote a play about it. ",呢地故事塞滿佐我嘅每個細胞同神經。 講句實話， 我三年都無好好地甘訓一覺了。 
"But the more I talked about it, the more objectified and fragmented my body became. ",呢地故事流梗血。 
"It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity, something I was selling. ",對地球嘅施暴， 對礦物嘅掠奪， 對陰道嘅摧毀—— 再唔系毫不相關嘅 全部同彼此，同我連埋一齊。 
Then I went somewhere else. ,軍隊士兵強暴六個月大嘅嬰兒， 為佐遠在天邊嘅祖國， 能得到黃金和鈳膽鐵礦， 來生產iPhone同電腦。 
I went outside what I thought I knew. ,我嘅身體不單單只成為佐被驅使的機器， 更為滿足自己呢部機器嘅速度同效率 瘋狂甘要求其他被驅使的機器來滿足自己 果地機器又去摧毀其他女人嘅身體， 我要為呢件事負全責。 
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo. ,於是，我得了癌癥—— 或者，系我發現佐，我得佐癌癥。 
And I heard stories that shattered all the other stories. ,就好似一隻快速飛來嘅雀仔， 撞到一扇玻璃窗。 
I heard stories that got inside my body. ,突然間，我“有”佐身體， 佢千瘡百孔， 到處都系傷口， 被切得鮮血淋漓， 佢失去佐原本嘅器官， 又移植佐新嘅器官，一切都被打亂重新安排， 佢上上下下被機器掃描， 被插滿佐各種輸液管， 佢經歷佐化學藥品嘅侵蝕和折磨。 
I heard about a little girl who couldn't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her. ,癌癥， 打通佐我封閉好耐嘅“心牆”。 
I heard an 80-year-old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that. ,我突然間意識到，在我身體入邊嘅危機， 也存在於整個世界， 呢個危機，並非遙遙無期， 佢就系眼前了。 
"There are thousands of these stories, and many of the women had holes in their bodies -- holes, fistula -- that were the violation of war -- holes in the fabric of their souls. ",突然間，我嘅病癥似乎蔓延到成個世界， 殘忍嘅癌癥，貪婪嘅癌癥， 住系化工廠附近嘅人，通常系窮人， 佢地身體里嘅癌癥， 煤礦工人嘅肺癌， 因欲求不滿嘅壓力嘅癌癥， 過去嘅傷痛嘅癌癥， 籠子裏面圈養嘅雞，同生活系污水裏面嘅魚，佢地嘅癌癥， 被強姦嘅女人嘅子宮癌， 仲有因為我地嘅冷漠，我地身邊無處不在嘅癌癥。 
"These stories saturated my cells and nerves, and to be honest, I stopped sleeping for three years. ",系菲利普·謝佛德新創作嘅小說 《新的自我，新的世界》入邊， 佢話， “如果你同你嘅身體分離了， 你亦都同呢個世界分離佐， 呢個世界似乎與你無關， 你遊離了， 不再屬於， 一個完整嘅生命統一體。 
All the stories began to bleed together. ,系得癌之前， 世界好唔同。 
"The raping of the Earth, the pillaging of minerals, the destruction of vaginas -- none of these were separate anymore from each other or me. ",以前，我好似住系一個腐臭嘅死水池入邊， 而癌癥炸開佐池塘邊嘅巨石， 果地阻住我流向大海嘅巨石。 
Militias were raping six-month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers. ,我依家可以自由嘅暢遊系大海入邊了。 
"My body had not only become a driven machine, but it was responsible now for destroying other women's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine. ",依家，我訓低系草地上， 青草摩擦著我嘅身體， 我好中意黏系腿、腳上面嘅泥土。 
Then I got cancer -- or I found out I had cancer. ,我日日都冥修， 就系塞納河畔旁嘅一塊柳蔭下， 我系如此嘅想念布卡武（扎伊尔东部城市）嘅灌木叢， 果片綠色。 
It arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane. ,當落大雨時， 我就大聲叫，兜圈跑。 
"Suddenly, I had a body, a body that was pricked and poked and punctured, a body that was cut wide open, a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed, a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it, a body that was burning from chemicals. ",我明白，世間萬事都有聯繫， 我身體上嘅果條疤， 就好似果次地震留低嘅記錄。 
Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection. ,好似我同三百萬人一齊系太子港（海地首都）嘅街度。 
"I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world, and it wasn't happening later, it was happening now. ",我做化療嘅第3日到第6日時， 我感覺到嘅果種如被火燒嘅痛苦， 就好似，世界上嘅森林， 被火燒梗。 
"Suddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere, the cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed, the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they're usually poor -- the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs, the cancer of stress for not achieving enough, the cancer of buried trauma, the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish, the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped, the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness. ",手術後傷口里， 長出嘅膿包， 16盎司嘅膿液， 就好似被污染佐嘅墨西哥灣， 我身體里亦有仲有果地被油污弄髒嘅鹈鹕， 同果地漂浮系水面上嘅死魚。 
"In his new and visionary book, ""New Self, New World,"" the writer Philip Shepherd says, ""If you are divided from your body, you are also divided from the body of the world, which then appears to be other than you or separate from you, rather than the living continuum to which you belong."" ",無經過合理嘅藥物處理嘅導尿管，就甘插入我嘅身體， 我都忍唔住失聲大叫， 就好似地球忍受鑽探時發出嘅哀嚎。 
"Before cancer, the world was something other. ",系我第二次化療時， 我媽咪病得好嚴重， 我去見佢。 
It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea. ,以世間萬物嘅聯繫嘅名義， 佢系死前想做嘅唯一一件事就系， 返屋企， 返去佢深愛嘅墨西哥灣。 
Now I am swimming in it. ,所以我地帶佢返屋企， 我祈禱，系佢去世之前， 油污唔會玷污佐佢嘅沙灘， 
"Now I lay down in the grass and I rub my body in it, and I love the mud on my legs and feet. ",幸運地是，我嘅憂慮無發生。 
"Now I make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine, and I hunger for the green fields in the bush outside Bukavu. ",我媽咪，系佢最中意嘅地方，安靜嘅離去。 
"And when it rains hard rain, I scream and I run in circles. ",幾個星期后，我系新奧爾良， 有一位美麗，善良嘅朋友， 話卑我知，佢想為我祈福。 
"I know that everything is connected, and the scar that runs the length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake. ",我受寵若驚。 
And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince. ,於是，我去佐佢屋企，系一個早晨， 新奧爾良嘅陽光穿過窗簾灑入來。 
And the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world. ,我嘅朋友準備梗一個大碗， 我問，“呢個系咩啊？” 
"I know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation, the 16 ounces of puss, is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico, and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish. ",佢話，“系為佐你。 
And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling. ,呢地花會令佢靚， 呢地蜂蜜會令佢甜。” 
"In my second chemo, my mother got very sick and I went to see her. ",我問，“甘水代表什麽呢？” 
"And in the name of connectedness, the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico. ",以世間萬物嘅聯繫為名， 佢話，“啊，系墨西哥灣。” 
"So we brought her home, and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died. ",我話，“當然。” 
"And gratefully, it didn't. ",其他女人都到佐，佢地坐成一個圓， 米歇爾開始用聖水沖洗我嘅頭。 
And she died quietly in her favorite place. ,佢唱道——我系話，佢用佢成付身心系度唱。 
"And a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans, and this beautiful, spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me. ",其他女人亦都一起唱， 為我同我媽咪祈禱。 
And I was honored. ,當墨西哥灣溫暖嘅水淋過我嘅光頭， 我意識到，佢代表佐， 我地最好，同埋最差嘅一面。 
"And I went to her house, and it was morning, and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains. ",系貪婪，肆無忌憚， 導致佐鑽探爆炸事件。 
"And my friend was preparing this big bowl, and I said, ""What is it?"" ",又系果地前前後後嘅 謊言。 
"And she said, ""It's for you. ",系水入邊嘅蜂蜜令佢變得甜， 系果地油污令佢生病。 
"The flowers make it beautiful, and the honey makes it sweet."" ",我的確有一個光頭， 依家無需要帽，我都感覺舒服。 
"And I said, ""But what's the water part?"" ",我，整個我， 都融入佐米歇爾嘅溫柔拍打。 
"And in the name of connectedness, she said, ""Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico."" ",我面上滴落嘅眼淚， 與墨西哥灣嘅水融為一體。 
"And I said, ""Of course it is."" ",“我嘅身體”終於返來了。 
"And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle, and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water. ",呢種感覺系痛苦， 折磨佐我好長時間。 
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang. ,系我一直找尋著嘅， 與聯繫相關嘅， 果份巨大嘅責任。 
And the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother. ,系剛果持續不聽嘅戰爭， 同成個世界嘅冷漠。 
"And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head, I realized that it held the best and the worst of us. ",系依家勇敢企起身嘅 剛果女人。 
It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion. ,系我媽咪嘅離開， 就系果一刻， 我“出世”。 
It was all the lies that got told before and after. ,系當我離死亡甘近果時， 我嘅覺醒—— 地球母親， 亦感覺難以支撐， 就好似這星球上嘅75%， 都勉強支撐著， 同樣， 亦都有如何存活嘅秘笈。 
"It was the honey in the water that made it sweet, it was the oil that made it sick. ",我學到佐， 呢件事與我地嘅關注同資源有關， 系我地每個人應該做嘅。 
It was my head that was bald -- and comfortable now without a hat. ,系有關於表示支持嘅朋友， 同埋果個被寵壞嘅妹妹。 
It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap. ,有關於精明嘅醫生，同埋先進嘅藥物， 同果地心知肚明自己嘅職責所在嘅外科醫生。 
It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf that were falling down my cheek. ,有關於果地拿低報酬卻保持和藹嘅護士， 
It was finally being in my body. ,有關於高明嘅醫術，同芳香膏。 
It was the sorrow that's taken so long. ,有關於果地帶著符咒同宗教儀式而來嘅人。 
It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection. ,有關於憧憬未來， 有關於為之奮鬥， 我明白，我唔系一個人系度戰鬥。 
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world. ,仲有數以百萬計嘅祈禱者。 
It was the Congolese women who are now rising up. ,仲有一千首讚歌， 百萬份榮耀。 
"It was my mother leaving, just at the moment that I was being born. ",系好多好多怒火， 瘋狂嘅幽默， 好多好多關注，憤慨。 
"It was the realization that I had come very close to dying -- in the same way that the Earth, our mother, is barely holding on, in the same way that 75 percent of the planet are hardly scraping by, in the same way that there is a recipe for survival. ",系能量，愛，同愉快。 
What I learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves. ,系所有嘅一切。 
It was advocating friends and a doting sister. ,系所有嘅一切。 
It was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands. ,系所有嘅一切， 系水裡，系世界里，系我嘅身體里。 
It was underpaid and really loving nurses. ,（掌声） 
It was magic healers and aromatic oils. ,
It was people who came with spells and rituals. ,我係一個魔術師，我鍾情與嘅魔術 係利用高科技嘅魔術 去創造錯覺 
"It was having a vision of the future and something to fight for, because I know this struggle isn't my own. ",所以，我宜家將要展現比你地睇我一直從事緊嘅魔術 
It was a million prayers. ,哩個係一個iPods應用 一個我覺得對藝術家好有幫助嘅應用 特別係多媒體藝術家 
It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms. ,佢可以將幾個視頻同步起身 跨越多部手機屏幕

,（掌聲） （音樂） 馬高：當人地問到佢關於欺騙 佢話： 主持人：魔術係唯一誠實嘅職業 
"So the type of magic I like, and I'm a magician, is magic that uses technology to create illusions. ",一個魔術師承諾話要呃你 佢就係做到佐 
So I would like to show you something I've been working on. ,馬高：我好樂意認為自己係一個誠實嘅魔術師 
It's an application that I think will be useful for artists -- multimedia artists in particular. ,我會用好多嘅把戲 即係話 有時我必須要呃你 
It synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices. ,宜家我個心唔係幾舒服，因為要呃你 
I borrowed these three iPods from people here in the audience to show you what I mean. ,但係每個人每日都係度講大話 
And I'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject: deception. ,（電話鈴）等等 
(Music) One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain. ,女：嘿，你宜家係邊度？ 
He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes. ,馬高：塞緊車，我好快會到嘎啦

A magician promises to deceive you -- and he does. ,女：你睇起身唔錯喔 
MT: I like to think of myself as an honest magician. ,馬高：欺騙 係生活嘅基本組成部分 
"I use a lot of tricks, which means that sometimes I have to lie to you. ",宜家有調查測試顯示 男人講大話嘅數量 係女人嘅兩倍 假設被調查嘅女人都係講真話嘅 
Now I feel bad about that. ,（觀眾笑） 我地通過欺騙去獲得好處 同埋掩飾我地嘅弱點 
But people lie every day. ,中國嘅將軍，孫子 佢話所有嘅戰爭 都要基於欺騙 
(Ringing) Hold on. ,奧斯卡·王爾德 佢都話愛情係基於欺騙嘅

MT: This one? ,唔好嘅經歷好快會唔記得 
Sorry. You lose. ,唔好嘅經歷 好快係記憶中消失 
"Well, I didn't deceive you. ",哩個就係點解係哩個又大又寂寥嘅宇宙入面 我地啲人咁樂觀嘅原因 
You deceived yourself. ,我地嘅自我欺騙 成為一個積極嘅錯覺 點解電影 可以同我地講述一個非凡嘅冒險故事？ 點解我地會相信羅密歐話 佢愛朱麗葉？ 仲有點解單個音符 當我地將佢地一齊演奏 可以成為一首奏鳴曲同埋表達一種意境 
Self-deception. ,哩首係“月光” 
That's when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth. ,德彪西作曲 佢話藝術 係所有嘅欺騙術中最好嘅一種

Bad experiences quickly disappear. ,我系一名藝術家，亦系一位爹地。第二次當爹地了。 
"Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos, we are so wonderfully optimistic. ",多謝。 
"Our self-deception becomes a positive illusion -- why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures; why we believe Romeo when he says he loves Juliet; and why single notes of music, when played together, become a sonata and conjure up meaning. ",我想同大家分享我最新嘅藝術項目。 
"That's ""Clair De lune."" ",系為iPad設計嘅一款小兒書。 
"Its composer, called Debussy, said that art was the greatest deception of all. ",有少少搞怪，有少少傻。 
Art is a deception that creates real emotions -- a lie that creates a truth. ,佢叫做“泡泡書” 系關於細路仔同佢地嘅父母一齊做嘅嘢。 
"And when you give yourself over to that deception, it becomes magic. ",（音樂） 所以，呢個就系關於上廁所嘅“訓練”啦—— 我希望，大家都知啦。 
[MAGIC] (Music fades slowly) (Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. ,你可以玩小地毯。 
(Applause) ,你可以幫BB仔便便。 
,你可以做所有呢地有趣嘅事。 
Hi everyone. ,你可以嘟爆滴泡泡。 
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around. ,你可以畫畫，大家都可以。 
Thank you. ,不過，你知啦，我對小兒書有個想法： 我覺得入邊太多宣傳啦。 
And I want to share with you my latest art project. ,最起碼，一個印度人去買上流社會嘅美國書籍，算了吧。 
It's a children's book for the iPad. ,呢種唔系我長大嘅方式。 
It's a little quirky and silly. ,所以，我就講：“我要用我自己嘅宣傳去對抗。” 
"It's called ""Pop-It,"" And it's about the things little kids do with their parents. ",如果你細心嘅睇下， 呢果系一對男同性夫妻同一個細路仔。 
"(Music) So this is about potty training -- as most of you, I hope, know. ",你唔中意？ 
You can tickle the rug. ,搖下，依家變成佐女同性夫妻啦。 
You can make the baby poop. ,（笑……） 搖下，依家又變成異性夫妻啦。 
You can do all those fun things. ,你知嘅，我唔相信有么嘢系叫做理想家庭嘅。 
You can burst bubbles. ,我想話卑你知，我嘅童年。 
"You can draw, as everyone should. ",我去佐一個很好嘅基督教學校。 老師系修女，神父，兄弟，姐妹。 
"But you know, I have a problem with children's books: I think they're full of propaganda. ",基本上，佢地希望我成為一個很善良的人。 事實上都系咁。 
"At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it. ",每日晚上，我去到一個傳統的印度教會。 系一個伊斯蘭教興盛的街區里， 果間或者就系唯一一間印度度教會。 
It's not the way I was brought up. ,基本上，我會慶祝所有嘅宗教慶典。 
"So I said, ""I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."" ",事實上，如果隔壁有人結婚， 我都所有人都會為果個婚禮粉刷我地間屋。 
"If you notice carefully, it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child. ",當夏日同我地一齊玩嘅果地羊仔， 變成佐蓋澆飯， 我記得我地都哭地好慘。 
You don't like it? ,（笑……） 齋月果陣時，我地都要食齋。 
"Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple. ",果段時間很美好。 
"(Laughter) Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple. ",但系，我要講， 我唔會旺季，我13歲果時，發生嘅事。 
"You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family. ",巴布里清真寺—— 印度最靚嘅一間清真寺之一， 我想，系16世紀由巴布爾國王建造嘅， 佢被印度教活躍分子摧毀佐。 
I have to tell you about my childhood. ,呢件事系我嘅城市裡造成佐好大嘅動亂。 
"I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters. ",第一次， 我被呢種族群暴亂， 所影響。 
"Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan, and I am. ","我隔壁嘅細路仔，5歲， 沖佐入來， 佢同我講，“Rags, Rags” "
"And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house, which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood. ",”你知唔知印度教滴人系度傻梗我地穆斯林啊，小心滴！“ 
"Basically, I celebrated every religious function. ",我就好似，“呃，我系印度教嘅。” 
"In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood, all of us would paint our houses for the wedding. ",（笑……） 佢就好似，“啊！” 
I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani. ,你知，我就系受呢地事情所激發， 做出呢個項目。 
(Laughter) We all had to fast during Ramadan. ,系我嘅畫廊展示入邊， 我都努力重新演繹歷史時間， 就好似巴布里清真寺， 提煉出佢嘅情感沉澱， 再想像出我自己嘅生活。 
It was a very beautiful time. ,想下，如果歷史唔系甘教嘅。 
"But I must say, I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened. ",記得我本小兒書嘛？ 當你搖下，父母嘅性別會轉變？ 
"Babri Masjid -- one of the most beautiful mosques in India, built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century -- was demolished by Hindu activists. ",我仲有個想法。 
This caused major riots in my city. ,呢個系一本小兒書，關於印度獨立—— 好愛國嘅。 
"And for the first time, I was affected by this communal unrest. ",當你搖下，你會有巴基斯坦人嘅角度。 
"My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, ""Rags, Rags. ",再搖下，你又有英國人嘅角度。 
"You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."" ",（掌聲） 系啦，你要將事實同偏見分開。 
"I'm like, ""Dude, I'm Hindu."" ",我嘅小兒書， 有好得意，毛茸茸嘅動物。 
"(Laughter) He's like, ""Huh!"" ",不過，佢地玩梗地緣政治。 
"You know, my work is inspired by events such as this. ",佢地扮演佐以色列-巴勒斯坦。 印度-巴基斯坦。 
"Even in my gallery shows, I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid, distill only its emotional residue and image my own life. ",你知道嗎，我做梗一個很重要嘅宣言。 
Imagine history being taught differently. ,就系， 教導如何創新嘅唯一方式， 系最初嘅階段， 就系教卑佢地不同嘅角度。 
Remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change? ,畢竟，小兒書就系大人教導細路仔嘅手冊， 所以你最好卑佢地果地可以教佢地由不同方式睇問題嘅小兒書。 
I have another idea. ,相反， 只有你教佢地不同角度， 細路仔先會有能力去想像， 去切身體會， 同佢地唔一樣嘅人系點想問題嘅。 
It's a children's book about Indian independence -- very patriotic. ,我要宣稱，藝術同創新， 系培養同情，同感，同理入邊好重要嘅部份。 
"But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective. ",你明白，我唔可以保證我嘅子女， 可以完全無偏見—— 我地所有人都有偏見—— 但系，我可以保證，我嘅子女可以從多重角度睇問題。 
"Shake it again, and you get the British perspective. ",非常感谢。 
"(Applause) You have to separate fact from bias, right. ",（掌声） 
"Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy animals. ",
But they're playing geopolitics. ,我係一個改革營銷者 依家從事國際發展 
"They're playing out Israel-Palestine, India-Pakistan. ",今年十月，我去咗剛果民主共和國 非洲（第二）最大嘅國家 
"You know, I'm making a very important argument. ",事實上佢同西歐差唔多大 但築路長度只有 300 英里 
And my argument [is] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage. ,剛果係一個危險嘅地方 
"After all, children's books are manuals on parenting, so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives. ",過去十年 已有五百萬人喪生喺東部嘅戰亂之中 
"And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. ",但導致人民生活困難嘅，並非只有戰爭 
I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy. ,仲有好多健康問題 
"You know, I can't promise my child a life without bias -- we're all biased -- but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. ",事實上，喺成年人中 HIV 感染率係 1.3% 
Thank you very much. ,"聽上去唔算多 但喺一個有 7,600 萬人口嘅國家 呢個數字就表示有 93 萬人受到感染 "
(Applause) ,由於公共設施落後 只有 25% 嘅患者獲得賴以生存嘅藥物 
,呢個亦係捐贈機構 以低價或免費提供安全套嘅部分原因 
"I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development. ",所以喺剛果期間 我花咗大量時間同居民談論安全套 包括狄米恩 
"In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the [second] largest country in Africa. ",狄米恩喺金沙薩周邊經營酒店 
"In fact, it's as large as Western Europe, but it only has 300 miles of paved roads. ",佢間酒店淨係開到午夜 所以唔係用嚟過夜嘅 
The DRC is a dangerous place. ,性工作者同佢哋嘅客人係呢度嘅常客 
"In the past 10 years, five million people have died due to a war in the east. ",狄米恩好了解安全套 但係佢唔賣 
But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC. ,佢話根本冇人買 
There are many health issues as well. ,咁唔出奇 因為喺剛果 只有 3% 嘅人使用安全套 
"In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults. ",約瑟同克莉絲汀 佢哋開嘅藥鋪有賣安全套 佢哋話雖然捐贈機構提供咗 廉價甚至免費嘅安全套 仲做咗相應嘅宣傳 但客人都唔買呢啲有牌子嘅 
"This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million people, it means there are 930,000 that are infected. ",反而鐘意冇牌子個啲 
"And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need. ",作為營銷者，我覺得好奇怪 
"Which is why, in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost. ",於是我開始研究佢哋嘅營銷策略 
"And so while I was in the DRC, I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including Damien. ",結果發現 捐贈機構嘅安全套廣告 主要包含三種信息︰ 恐懼、經濟同忠誠 
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa. ,安全套嘅名包括「生活」 同「信任」 
"It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay. ",佢哋用印有紅絲帶包裝 見到就會諗起 HIV 又會放喺箱入面提醒你邊個係供應者 又印有妻子或丈夫嘅照片 提醒你要保護配偶或謹慎行動 
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come. ,呢啲都唔係一個人購買安全套之前 所諗嘅嘢 
"Now Damien knows all about condoms, but he doesn't sell them. ",（笑聲） 你喺買安全套之前會諗啲乜嘢？ 
He said there's just not in demand. ,性！ 
"It's not surprising, because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms. ",喺呢度銷售安全套嘅私人公司 了解到呢一點 
"Joseph and Christine, who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost, and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them, their customers don't buy the branded versions. ",以至佢哋嘅宣傳策略有所不同 
They like the generics. ,名稱可能差唔多 但包裝就差好遠 
"And as a marketer, I found that curious. ",有啲牌子雄心勃勃 包裝極具誘惑 
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like. ,於是我諗到 可能捐贈機構冇捉住 市場營銷呢一個重點 就係要認清客戶群 
"And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms: fear, financing and fidelity. ",對於捐贈機構嚟講，好不幸 佢哋嘅客戶並唔係 佢哋所幫助嘅國家嘅人 
"They name the condoms things like Vive, ""to live"" or Trust. ",而係佢哋本身國家嘅人 支持佢哋工作嘅人 類似呢度顯示嘅各方 
"They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently. ",但係如果我哋真正要做嘅 係阻止 HIV 傳播 我哋就要考慮到客戶 即係個啲行為上需要改變嘅人 包括夫妻 年輕女子、年輕男子 呢點關係到佢哋嘅生命安全 
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom. ,我哋學到嘅教訓就係 你賣乜嘢唔緊要 但你要思考邊個係你嘅客戶 你要傳遞乜嘢信息 嚟令到佢哋改變行為模式 
(Laughter) What is it that you think about just before you get a condom? ,咁樣可能會救佢哋一命 
Sex! ,多謝 
"And the private companies that sell condoms in these places, they understand this. ",（掌聲） 
Their marketing is slightly different. ,
"The name might not be much different, but the imagery sure is. ",喺我去蘇格蘭嘅前一晚， 我被邀請去上海主持 “中國達人秀“決賽 體育館內有八萬現場觀眾。 
"Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. ",估下邊個系特別嘉賓？ 
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing: understanding who's the audience. ,蘇珊·波爾 （蘇珊大媽）。 
"And for donor agencies, unfortunately, the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working [in]. ",我同距講，”我聽日就去蘇格蘭啦。“ 
"It's people back home, people that support their work, people like these. ",她唱得非常動聽， 仲學講幾句中文： 送你蔥 嚟句話唔系“你好” 或者“多謝”， 之類的話。 
"But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples, the young women, the young men -- whose lives depend on it. ",意思系：“免費送你蔥”。 
"And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior. ",點解距講黎句話？ 
It might just save their lives. ,因為黎句話 來自於中國版蘇珊大媽- 一位五十有多嘅中年大媽， 一位上海街市擺攤的阿姨， 距熱愛唱西方歌劇， 不過距唔明 任何英文，法語， 或者意大利文， 所以距獨創一種方式來記歌詞 將全部歌詞用中文蔬菜名來代替。 
Thank you. ,（笑聲） 意大利歌劇《公主徹夜未眠》嘅最後一句話 當時距系體育館內演出 就以“送你蔥”來代替。 
(Applause) ,所以蘇珊大媽會咁唱， 連同八萬名現場觀眾一起跟唱。 
,當時嘅場面十分有趣。 
"The night before I was heading for Scotland, I was invited to host the final of ""China's Got Talent"" show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium. ",我惗蘇珊大媽 同嚟位上海嘅菜販阿姨 都有距地嘅獨特之處。 
Guess who was the performing guest? ,距地系常人最少期待 會喺娛樂圈內闖蕩成名的一類人， 但係距地嘅勇氣同才能讓她們受到大家的肯定。 
Susan Boyle. ,一場演出同一個平台 給予她們一個 實現夢想的舞台。 
"And I told her, ""I'm going to Scotland the next day."" ",其實，要與眾不同並唔難。 
"She sang beautifully, and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese: ??? So it's not like ""hello"" or ""thank you,"" that ordinary stuff. ",我地都唔同 從唔同嘅角度。 
"It means ""green onion for free."" ",我覺得與眾不同其實很好， 因為你有唔同嘅惗法。 
Why did she say that? ,你可能會系某方面作出影響。 
"Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle -- a 50-some year-old woman, a vegetable vendor in Shanghai, who loves singing Western opera, but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian, so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese. ",我地黎代人好幸運 我地見證並參與 中國歷史性的變化 有太多巨變發生 在過去的二，三十年。 
"(Laughter) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was ""green onion for free."" ",我記得系1990果陣時， 我啱啱大學畢業， 當時我去應聘一份 系北京五星級酒店返工的銷售工作。 長城喜來登酒店，至今都喺到。 
"So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that, 80,000 live audience sang together. ","被一位日本經理詢問咗 一個半種後， 當面試將要結束時，距講， ""楊小姐， 你有咩問題要問我嗎？"" "
That was hilarious. ,我鼓足勇氣鎮定甘問距， “系， 你可不可以話我知， 你地賣D咩？” 
So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness. ,因為我當時完全唔知一間 五星級酒店內的銷售部要做D乜。 
"They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment, yet their courage and talent brought them through. ",黎個系我第一次進入 五星級酒店。 
And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams. ,與此同時， 我參加咗由中國國家電視台 有史以來舉辦嘅 第一次公開面試 現場參賽上千名女大學生。 
"Well, being different is not that difficult. ",製作人通告 距地要搵甜美，單純 同漂亮的新面孔。 
We are all different from different perspectives. ,當輪到我果陣，我起身問， “點解系電視上的女性個性 都要系靚，甜美，單純 仲要有配合度？ 
"But I think being different is good, because you present a different point of view. ",點解距地唔可以有自己的想法 同埋自己的聲音？” 
You may have the chance to make a difference. ,我以為我黎番話有點冒犯評委。 
"My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20, 30 years. ",不過正系黎番話令距地留下印象。 
"I remember that in the year of 1990, when I was graduating from college, I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing, Great Wall Sheraton -- it's still there. ",所以我進入了第二回合比賽， 繼而第三，第四。 
"So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour, he finally said, ""So, Miss Yang, do you have any questions to ask me?"" ",當完成第七回合比賽后， 我成為一位勝出者。 
"I summoned my courage and poise and said, ""Yes, but could you let me know, what actually do you sell?"" ",因此我加入了國家電視台黃金檔一個節目。 
I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel. ,你可能唔相信 黎個節目系中國第一個 允許主持人 自由發揮表達自己的意見 而唔需要背經批准後D稿。 
That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel. ,（鼓掌） 當時每週的觀眾人數 高達200-300萬。 
"Around the same time, I was going through an audition -- the first ever open audition by national television in China -- with another thousand college girls. ",幾年以後， 我確定要去美國哥倫比亞大學 繼續讀研， 同時創辦自己的媒體公司， 一個當我啱啱入行時 從來都無惗過嘅想法。 
"The producer told us they were looking for some sweet, innocent and beautiful fresh face. ",公司項目分好多類， 
"So when it was my turn, I stood up and said, ""Why [do] women's personalities on television always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent and, you know, supportive? ",我訪問過的人數過千。 
"Why can't they have their own ideas and their own voice?"" ",有時，有些年輕人他會同我講 “楊瀾， 你改變了我的人生，” 我會為黎D話感到自豪。 
I thought I kind of offended them. ,同時我地十分幸運地 見證整個國家的興起。 
"But actually, they were impressed by my words. ",見證著北京奧運競標賽。 
"And so I was in the second round of competition, and then the third and the fourth. ",代言上海世博會。 
"After seven rounds of competition, I was the last one to survive it. ",我睇到中國正在擁抱全世界 也見到全世界在擁抱中國。 
So I was on a national television prime-time show. ,不過我亦系度惗， 當下的年輕人到底要做什麼？ 
"And believe it or not, that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script. ","距地有什麼不同之處， 他們會創造怎樣的不同 又會點樣改變中國未來, 甚至整個世界？ "
(Applause) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people. ,所以我今天的話題系關於年輕一代 通過社交網絡平台。 
"Well after a few years, I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies, and then started my own media company, which was unthought of during the years that I started my career. ",首先， 他們是誰？他們做緊咩？ 
So we do a lot of things. ,照片中黎位叫郭美美女仔 20歲，年輕貌美。 
I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past. ,在距嘅微博上盡顯 距擁有的名牌袋， 衫同鞋， 微博即系中國版的Twitter。 
"And sometimes I have young people approaching me say, ""Lan, you changed my life,"" and I feel proud of that. ",距仲自稱系紅十字 商會經理。 
But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country. ,距無惗到 自己的舉動引起民眾公憤 惹起全國大眾的質疑。 差D成為針對 紅十字會的騷亂。 
I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games. ,黎場爭論十分激烈 以至於紅十字會開記者招待會 來澄清“郭美美事件”， 此事件因此亦被不斷調查。 
I was representing the Shanghai Expo. ,現金為之， 公眾已知道郭美美系冒充紅十字商會經理職位 可能因為距覺得與慈善相關的為她帶了自豪感。 
I saw China embracing the world and vice versa. ,距果D奢侈品 同禮物 都系距男朋友送。 距的男朋友系紅十字商會 旗下部門的前任董事會成員。 
"But then sometimes I'm thinking, what are today's young generation up to? ",黎個解釋起來有點困難。 
"How are they different, and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China, or at large, the world? ",儘管如此，公眾憤怒仍未平息。 
So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media. ,熱論還在進行。 
"First of all, who are they? [What] do they look like? ",黎件事件講明民眾 對政府或有政府背景的機構唔信任， 因為黎D機構過去的不透明 
"Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei -- 20 years old, beautiful. ",黎件事件亦講明 社交網站上的力量同影響 例如微博。 
"She showed off her expensive bags, clothes and car on her microblog, which is the Chinese version of Twitter. ",微博在2010年興起， 訪客人數翻倍 瀏覽時間更系三倍增加。 
And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce. ,單系新浪網， 一個主要的新聞網站， 就有超過1.4億微博用戶。 
"She didn't realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning, almost a turmoil, against the credibility of Red Cross. ",騰訊網，2億。 
"The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it, and the investigation is going on. ",最多人關注的用戶 唔系我-- 系一位電影女演員， 距有超過九百五十萬粉絲。 
"So far, as of today, we know that she herself made up that title -- probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity. ",大約有八成微博用戶都系年輕人， 年齡在30歲以下。 
"All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend, who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce. ",正如大家所知， 傳統媒體依然由政府所控， 社交網絡提供一個開放平台 讓大家可以發表自己的意見。 
It's very complicated to explain. ,因為開放平台為數不多， 來自社交網站上的激憤 有時可以變得非常強烈，非常活躍 甚至帶有暴力。 
"But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it. ",通過微博， 我地可以進一步了解中國年輕的一代。 
It is still boiling. ,我地有幾唔同？ 
"It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions, which lacked transparency in the past. ",首先，大部分青年都生於 80， 90年代， 出生於獨生子女政策下。 
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog. ,因為有了選擇性流產 很多家長重男輕女， 造成我地現今 男性數量比女性超出3千萬人口。 
"Microblog boomed in the year of 2010, with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled. ",黎個可能會對 社會存在潛在危機， 但無人能確定； 我地生活系個全球化嘅世界， 男性可以到其他國家結識女朋友。 
"Sina.com, a major news portal, alone has more than 140 million microbloggers. ",年輕人裡大多數都受過不錯的教育。 
"On Tencent, 200 million. ",喺黎一代，中國文盲人數 已少於百分之一。 
"The most popular blogger -- it's not me -- it's a movie star, and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans. ",在城市， 有80%的學生上大學。 
"About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people, under 30 years old. ",不過他們正面對一個老年化的中國 今年，年齡超過65歲人口 已達到百分之7點幾， 到2030年 人口老年化將達到15%。 
"And because, as you know, the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government, social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit. ",大家也許知道我們的傳統 年輕人一代有義務供養長輩， 在生病時照顧他們。 
"But because you don't have many other openings, the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong, active and even violent. ",這意味著已成家的年輕人 要供養四位長輩 其預期壽命將會是73歲。 
"So through microblogging, we are able to understand Chinese youth even better. ",所以許多年輕一代的 日子不輕鬆過得並不輕鬆。 
So how are they different? ,面對大學畢業生供過於求。 
"First of all, most of them were born in the 80s and 90s, under the one-child policy. ",喺城市， 大學畢業生起薪點 大致系400美金一個月， 平均租金 都超過500美金。 
"And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls, now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women. ",他們點樣生活呢？ 他們只能合租 逼系一個窄小嘅空間 甘來悭钱-- 黎群人自稱“蟻族”。 
"That could pose a potential danger to the society, but who knows; we're in a globalized world, so they can look for girlfriends from other countries. ",至於果D打算結婚 同賣屋嘅人 距地明白要打工 30，40年 先可以買得起第一間公寓。 
Most of them have fairly good education. ,美國的比例系 一對夫妻5年嘅人工就可買一間屋， 不過要係中國需要30 - 40 年先至做到 因為房價高漲。 
The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent. ,做兩億離鄉打工族中， 60%系年輕人。 
"In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college. ",他們覺得自己系夾心族 夾隔在城市同鄉村之間。 
"But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year, and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030. ",距地大多數都唔想返鄉下， 不過他們又無城市歸屬感。 
"And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially, and taking care of them when they're sick. ",他們長時間工作 收入相對較少，社會福利也不多。 
So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old. ,很多因素會影響他們 例如失業， 通貨膨脹， 銀行貸款政策緊縮， 人民幣升值， 又或者歐美國家對 中國產品的需求 減少。 
So making a living is not that easy for young people. ,上年，一場令人震驚 的悲劇 喺中國南方嘅設備加工廠發生咗 13名年輕工人 年齡大致20歲左右 相繼自殺， 就似一場傳染病甘 
College graduates are not in short supply. ,距地自殺的原因各不同。 
"In urban areas, college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month, while the average rent is above $500. ",整個事件 引起社會的關注 大家開始關心 黎D工人嘅 身體同心理上的孤單。 
"So what do they do? They have to share space -- squeezed in very limited space to save money -- and they call themselves ""tribe of ants."" ",果D選擇返鄉下嘅人， 當地人十分歡迎他們回鄉， 因為他們在城市獲得了知識，技能同人脈 距地系城市學識， 通過互聯網的幫助， 距地可以創作更多工作， 升級當地農業技術同埋製造商機 喺相對落後的市場。 
"And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment, they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment. ",在過去數年，沿海地帶， 出現勞工短缺的現象。 
"That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn, but in China it's 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price. ",黎D圖表顯示 一個更廣泛的社會背景。 
"Among the 200 million migrant workers, 60 percent of them are young people. ",第一個系恩格爾系數， 解釋了每天生活必須的花費 百分點有所減少 在過去十年內 對比人均家庭收入 下降了37%。 
They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas. ,"不過就係過去兩年間， 黎個比例又上漲39%, 甘樣來講生活花費正在上升。 "
"Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside, but they don't have the sense of belonging. ",吉尼系數顯示 已經超過0.4的警戒線。 
"They work for longer hours with less income, less social welfare. ",宜家系0.5 -- 仲差過美國-- 說明了收入不平等。 
"And they're more vulnerable to job losses, subject to inflation, tightening loans from banks, appreciation of the renminbi, or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce. ",你可以睇到整個社會 逐漸感到沮喪 因為他們失去一部分流動性。 
"Last year, though, an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China: 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide, just one by one like causing a contagious disease. ",同時，仇富和仇權情緒 逐以升高 並開始蔓延。 
But they died because of all different personal reasons. ,所以各種對腐敗 或者官商勾結的指控 都會造成社會譴責 甚至動亂。 
"But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation, both physical and mental, of these migrant workers. ",通過觀察微博上一些最熱門的話題， 我地可以更了解年輕的一代。 
"For those who do return back to the countryside, they find themselves very welcome locally, because with the knowledge, skills and networks they have learned in the cities, with the assistance of the Internet, they're able to create more jobs, upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market. ",社會公正與政府責任 系他們最關心的問題。 
"So for the past few years, the coastal areas, they found themselves in a shortage of labor. ",在過去十年裡， 大量嘅城市化發展 令我地睇到好多關於 強拆民宅 的報到。 
These diagrams show a more general social background. ,黎D新聞都引起了 年輕人不滿和失望。 
"The first one is the Engels coefficient, which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade, in terms of family income, to about 37-some percent. ",過程中有時有身亡， 亦有人用自焚嘅形式來抗議。 
"But then in the last two years, it goes up again to 39 percent, indicating a rising living cost. ",當黎類報導 越來越常見於互聯網上 人們強烈要求政府出面阻止。 
The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4. ,今年早輪有好消息， 國務院在房屋申請同拆建方面 頒發咗新政策 同時允許法庭 傳喚果D強拆的地方政府 上法院。 
Now it's 0.5 -- even worse than that in America -- showing us the income inequality. ,仲有好多其他令民眾擔憂嘅問題 系互聯網上熱議。 
And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility. ,大家都聽過空氣污染， 水源污染，有毒食品。 
"And also, the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread. ",但應該不知道我地還發明了假牛肉。 
So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest. ,黎種牛肉精包含多種成分 如果你把距塗喺雞魚肉 睇落就似牛肉。 
"So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging, we can see what young people care most about. ",最近， 民眾又開始擔心食用油， 原因上千人發現 來自餐館嘅 食用油系加工過的地溝油。 
Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand. ,黎類現象 在互聯網引起公眾強烈不滿。 
"For the past decade or so, a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property. ",幸運地是， 我地睇到政府 更及時同更頻繁地 對應民眾的擔憂。 
And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation. ,雖然年輕一代睇落相信 他們的參與影響到 政策制定， 不過，在生活上的追求 他們卻有點迷失。 
"Sometimes people get killed, and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest. ",中國很快就會超越美國 
"So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet, people cry for the government to take actions to stop this. ",成為第一大 奢侈消費品市場。 黎果唔包括中國人 喺歐洲或其他地方消費。 
"So the good news is that earlier this year, the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court. ",但或許你唔知，其中一半的消費者 系收入不到2000美金。 
"Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet. ",距地並不富裕。 
"We heard about polluted air, polluted water, poisoned food. ",不過距地買名牌手袋同衣服 來作為距地身份的象徵。 
"And guess what, we have faked beef. ",黎個女仔上一個相親節目 公開表明 距情願坐系寶馬車度喊， 都唔要坐系單車上笑。 
"They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish, and it turns it to look like beef. ",當然，我地還有年輕人 只要開心 坐寶馬或騎單車都無所謂。 
"And then lately, people are very concerned about cooking oil, because thousands of people have been found [refining] cooking oil from restaurant slop. ",黎張圖片裡，你見到宜家好風行的一個現象 叫做“裸婚”。 
So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet. ,距地唔系話喺婚禮上么都唔著， 不過黎D年輕人決定 就算無屋，無車，無鑽戒 同無婚禮都願意 為真愛結婚。 
"And fortunately, we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns. ",通過社交媒體，人們做咗好多有意義的事。 
"While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making, but sometimes they're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life. ",黎張圖片展示 500只被困卡車將要被加工食物的 流浪或綁架狗。 在高速公路上被發現， 截停 整個國家都在微博上 見證事件發展。 
China is soon to pass the U.S. ,有人捐錢，捐狗糧 仲有志願者去截停部貨車。 
as the number one market for luxury brands -- that's not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere. ,幾小時協商後， 500只狗獲救。 
"But you know what, half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars. ",同時亦有人幫助搵走失兒童。 
They're not rich at all. ,黎位爸爸將個仔張相放上網。 
They're taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status. ,在上千萬次轉發後， 小朋友被搵到。 我地通過微博 見證了家庭團聚。 
And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle. ,幸福 - 系近兩年 最常聽到上嘅熱門詞。 
"But of course, we do have young people who would still prefer to smile, whether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle. ",幸福不靜只 同個人經歷和價值觀相關， 我們生活的環境同樣息息相關。 
"So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon called ""naked"" wedding, or ""naked"" marriage. ",人們會思考以下問題： 我地到底應唔應該犧牲我地嘅環境 來製作更高GDP增長? 
"It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding, but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet, to show their commitment to true love. ",我們應該如何實現社會及政治改體 先至跟得上經濟上的增長， 同時又可持續穩定發展？ 
"And also, people are doing good through social media. ",仲有，如何實現系統 自行糾正 在各種紛爭的亂世下 如何保持自我更新？ 
And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging. ,我估人們會為黎D問題追尋答案。 
"People were donating money, dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck. ",我們年輕的一代 將會改變他們的國家 與此同時，他們正系度改變自己。 
"And after hours of negotiation, 500 dogs were rescued. ",十分感謝。 
And here also people are helping to find missing children. ,（掌聲） 
A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet. ,
"After thousands of resends in relay, the child was found, and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging. ",個箱裏面有乜？ 
So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years. ,無論係乜，肯定好重要 因為我去邊到都帶著佢 包括我每次去公寓 
"Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values, but also, it's about the environment. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 聽落好熟？ 
People are thinking about the following questions: Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP? ,你知道我哋美國人 比起 50 年前用多咗 三倍幾嘅空間？ 
"How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth, to keep sustainability and stability? ",係三倍啊！ 
"And also, how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time? ",所以你會諗，多咗咁多空間 我哋就有更多地方擺我哋嘅物品 
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer. ,唔係 
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves. ,我哋有個新嘅產業 一個價值 220 億、佔地 22 億平方呎 專門提供個人存儲空間嘅產業 
Thank you very much. ,雖然我們有多三倍空間 但係我哋比以前更加鍾意購物 使到我哋需要更多嘅地方 
(Applause) ,繼續落去會點？ 
,一堆卡債、超乎想像嘅環境足跡 或者唔係偶然 我們嘅幸福水平過去 50 年都無變過 
What's in the box? ,所以我想提議一個更好嘅生活態度︰ 就係屋企愈少物品愈好 
"Whatever it is must be pretty important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment. ",我估大部分人喺某個階段都體會到 淋糝嘢唔多先至好 譬如話你讀大學住宿舍嗰陣 旅行嘅時候 露營嘅時候 甚至乎喺船上面 
(Laughter) (Applause) Sound familiar? ,無論係咩嘅經歷 我都相信你都會體會到 愈少嘢，人嘅束摶都會愈少 仲會多咗時間出嚟 
Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago? ,我想指出 少啲物品同空間 就等如少啲嘅環境足跡 
Three times. ,而且仲可以幫你慳錢 
"So you'd think, with all this extra space, we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff. ",令你嘅生活有多一份嘅悠閒 
Nope. ,所以我喺 lifeedited.org 發起咗 一個叫「簡約生活」嘅計畫 更深入咁探討我哋呢個話題 同埋揾出好嘅解決方案 
"There's a new industry in town, a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry: that of personal storage. ",我首先同 Mutopo 同 Jovoto.com 兩間公司合作 眾籌我買入曼哈頓一間 420 呎嘅公寓 
"So we've got triple the space, but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space. ",我心頭大，乜都想要︰ 家庭辦公室、十個人嘅飯廳、客房 同埋想間屋可以容納 我全部嘅風箏衝浪裝備 
So where does this lead? ,喺全球 300 幾個樓盤介紹當中 我買到屬於自己嘅公寓 
"Lots of credit card debt, huge environmental footprints, and perhaps not coincidentally, our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years. ",與其買一個 600 呎嘅地方 
"Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way, that less might actually equal more. ",我買 420 呎嘅話 我就可以慳返 20 萬 
"I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less: college -- in your dorm, traveling -- in a hotel room, camping -- rig up basically nothing, maybe a boat. ",更細嘅空間用嘅水電煤就更少 即係慳到更多嘅錢 同造成更少嘅環境足跡 
"Whatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things, this gave you a little more freedom, a little more time. ",因為個地方有齊我最鍾意嘅嘢 而且係專為我而設嘅 所以我好開心入去住 
So I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint. ,咁你點樣先可以過簡約嘅生活？ 
It's actually a great way to save you some money. ,三個重點 
And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. ,首先，你一定要決心去改 
So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area. ,我哋一定要徹底改變 
First up: crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com. ,至於我嗰件我好多年都無著過嘅衫？ 
"I wanted it all -- home office, sit down dinner for 10, room for guests, and all my kite surfing gear. ",係時候揼咗佢 
"With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box. ",我哋一定要除去生活中多餘嘅物件 同埋學識逆向思維 
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft. ,我哋要考慮係咪需要至去買 
"instead of 600, immediately I'm saving 200 grand. ",問下自己︰ 「買嘅嘢會唔會令我更開心？真係？」 
"Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities -- save some more money there, but also a smaller footprint. ",當然，我哋應該買同擁有好嘅嘢 
"And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff -- and really designed for me, I'm really excited to be there. ",但係我哋真正需要嘅 係我哋會愛不惜手嘅嘢 而唔係是是但但話想要嘅嘢 
So how can you live little? ,第二，我哋新嘅口頭禪：愈細愈吸引 
Three main approaches. ,我哋用空間都要講求效率 
"First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly. ",我哋想啲嘢按長期使用習慣去設計 而唔係為到偶然需要而去設計 
We've got to clear the arteries of our lives. ,你平時只會用到三個火爐 咁點解要六個？ 
And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years? ,所以我哋將物品擺到唔嘥位 我哋想物品可以疊高，同埋數碼化 
It's time for me to let it go. ,你可以將文件、書籍、電影收埋 就好似魔術咁 
"We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives, and we've got to learn to stem the inflow. ",最後，我哋要多功能空間同多功能傢俬 具備洗手盆同馬桶功能嘅嘢 同一個空間，飯臺可以變成張床 一個摺枱扯出十人飯枱 
We need to think before we buy. ,喺呢個獲獎嘅簡約生活計畫中 我哋利用可以變形嘅傢俬 同埋可移動嘅牆騰出好多空間 
"Ask ourselves, ""Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?"" ",睇下張咖啡枱 佢可以拉高拉闊 可以坐十個人 
"By all means, we should buy and own some great stuff. ",我嘅工作空間可以收起，容易收埋 
"But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff. ",我用兩隻手指我張床就可以拉出嚟 
"Secondly, our new mantra: small is sexy. ",客人點？ 推開個活動牆可以疊出幾張床 
We want space efficiency. ,當然，仲有我嘅私人影院 
"We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time, not that rare event. ",我唔係話每個人都需要 生活喺 420 平方呎嘅空間裏面 
Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three? ,但係值得大家考慮下簡約生活嘅好處 
"So we want things that nest, we want things that stack, and we want it digitized. ","以前住 3,000 呎 宜家住 2,000 平方呎 以前住 1,500 呎 宜家住 1,000 平方呎 "
"You can take paperwork, books, movies, and you can make it disappear -- it's magic. ",我哋大部分人，或者所有人 無論空間幾大 只需要幾個睡袋、一個細少嘅空間 我哋就可以好快樂 
"Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet, a dining table becomes a bed -- same space, a little side table stretches out to seat 10. ",當你返去屋企、入門口嗰時 不妨問下自己 「我可唔可以過得簡約啲？ 
"In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space. ",咁樣會唔會畀到我更多自由？ 
Look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10. ,或者更多時間？」 
"My office folds away, easily hidden. ",個箱度有咩？ 
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers. ,其實有乜都唔重要 
"Guests? Move the moving wall, have some fold-down guest beds. ",我知道我用唔著 
"And of course, my own movie theater. ",你個箱又有啲咩？ 
So I'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq. ft. ,或者，少啲就係等於多啲 
But consider the benefits of an edited life. ,等我哋一齊騰出更多嘅空間 營造美好嘅生活 
"Go from 3,000 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 1,000. ",多謝 
"Most of us, maybe all of us, are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags, maybe a small space, a hotel room. ",（掌聲） 
"So when you go home and you walk through your front door, take a second and ask yourselves, ""Could I do with a little life editing? ",
Would that give me a little more freedom? ,我想帶你哋去另一個世界 
"Maybe a little more time?"" ",我想同你哋分享 一個同窮人長達 45 年嘅故事 呢班窮人每日連一蚊美金都賺唔到 
What's in the box? ,我曾經喺印度接受 精英、貴族、高昂嘅教育 但咁嘅教育幾乎摧毀我嘅人生 
It doesn't really matter. ,我被選做外交官、老師、醫生 呢啲工全部都等住我 
I know I don't need it. ,但我冇做呢啲工 因為我三年嚟都係參加緊 印度國家壁球比賽 
What's in yours? ,（笑聲） 成個世界就好似為我準備好曬 
"Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more. ",一切都喺我掌握之中 
So let's make room for the good stuff. ,差錯絕對冇可能發生 
Thank you. ,但係之後我出於好奇 我想去鄉下工作、生活下 感受一下係點嘅感覺 
(Applause) ,所以喺 1965 年 我去到印度比哈爾邦 經歷嗰度史上最大嘅飢荒 我第一見到飢荒同死亡 
,我嘅生命亦從此改變 
I'd like to take you to another world. ,我返到屋企 同我母親講： 「我想去鄉下做嘢，喺嗰度生活。」 
"And I'd like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor, living on less than one dollar a day. ",佢震驚到暈咗 
"I went to a very elitist, snobbish, expensive education in India, and that almost destroyed me. ",（笑聲） 「你係咩意思？ 
"I was all set to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor -- all laid out. ",成個世界都為你而鋪排好曬， 最好嘅工等住你做， 你宜家同我講想去鄉下工作？ 
"Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years. ",你係唔係有問題？」 
(Laughter) The whole world was laid out for me. ,我話：「我受過最好嘅教育， 
Everything was at my feet. ,令我學識咗思考。 我決定要用我所學，回饋社會。」 
I could do nothing wrong. ,「你想去鄉下做咩？ 
And then I thought out of curiosity I'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like. ,你無工作，無錢，無保障，無前景。」 
"So in 1965, I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India, and I saw starvation, death, people dying of hunger, for the first time. ",我話：「我想喺嗰度生活， 挖五年井。」 
It changed my life. ,「挖五年井？ 
"I came back home, told my mother, ""I'd like to live and work in a village."" ",你讀過全印度最貴嘅學校， 宜家你話想用五年時間去挖井？」 
Mother went into a coma. ,自此之後，佢好耐無同我講嘢 因為佢覺得我令屋企人丟架 
"(Laughter) ""What is this? ",不過，喺村裡邊、喺窮人身上 我見識咗最非凡嘅知識同技能 但呢啲知識同技能從來都唔入流 從來無被外邊嘅人 注意過、尊重過，同廣泛應用過 
"The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you, and you want to go and work in a village? ",我於是諗創辦一間赤腳學院 一間只為窮人開辦嘅學院 
"I mean, is there something wrong with you?"" ",將窮人認為重要嘅想法體現喺學院裏邊 
"I said, ""No, I've got the best eduction. ",第一次去到個農村 
"And I wanted to give something back in my own way."" ",年紀老邁嘅長者過嚟問我： 
"What do you want to do in a village? 
No job, no money, no security, no prospect. ",「你係咪通緝犯？」 我話：「唔係。」 
"I said, ""I want to live and dig wells for five years."" ",（笑聲） 「考試肥佬？」 
"Dig wells for five years? 
You went to the most expensive school and college in India, and you want to dig wells for five years? ",我話唔係 
"She didn't speak to me for a very long time, because she thought I'd let my family down. ",「搵唔到政府工？」 我話唔係 
"But then, I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have, which are never brought into the mainstream -- which is never identified, respected, applied on a large scale. ",「咁你過嚟做咩？點解要嚟呢度？ 
And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College -- college only for the poor. ,印度嘅教育制度 只會令你嚮往巴黎、新德里 或者蘇黎世呢啲地方。 你嚟我哋鄉下到底做咩？ 
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college. ,你係唔係有嘢瞞住我哋未講？」 
I went to this village for the first time. ,我話：「冇， 我只想為窮人創辦一間學院。 
"Elders came to me and said, ""Are you running from the police?"" ",窮人認為重要嘅想法 可以喺學院裏邊體現出嚟。」 
"I said, ""No."" ",呢啲長者給咗我好多建設性嘅提議 
"(Laughter) ""You failed in your exam?"" ",佢哋話： 「唔好畀有學歷或者證書嘅人 入呢間學院。」 
"I said, ""No."" ",所以我哋係印度唯一一間 唔請博士同碩士嘅學院 
"You didn't get a government job? I said, ""No."" ",（笑聲） 你必須要係逃學者 考試唔合格，或者輟學 先至能夠入嚟我哋學院 
"What are you doing here? 
The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich; what are you doing in this village? 
Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us? ",你必須用勞力做嘢 
"I said, ""No, I want to actually start a college only for the poor. ",唔會因為勞動而羞恥 
"What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."" ",要向社區證明你有佢哋所需要嘅技能 同埋服務社區 
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice. ,所以我哋開始咗赤腳學院 我哋將「專業」重新定義 
"They said, ""Please, don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college."" ",咁點先算一名專家？ 專家指嘅係嗰啲 有能力、自信心同信念嘅人 
"So it's the only college in India where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's, you are disqualified to come. ",搵水源嘅人係專家 
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college. ,接生婆同樣係專家 
You have to work with your hands. ,鐵打師傅都係專家 
You have to have a dignity of labor. ,專家遍佈世界各地 
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community. ,你可以喺任何偏僻嘅村落 揾到佢哋嘅身影 
"So we started the Barefoot College, and we redefined professionalism. ",我哋認為我哋要畀呢啲人 喺我哋主流社會裏邊 證明佢哋擁有嘅知識同技能 係全世界都需要嘅 
"A professional is someone who has a combination of competence, confidence and belief. ",正因為呢啲知識同技能今日仲有用 佢哋應該推展到全世界同埋廣泛應用 
A water diviner is a professional. ,呢間學院奉行 聖雄甘地嘅生活同工作文化 
A traditional midwife is a professional. ,食飯、瞓覺同工作都喺地下 
A traditional bone setter is a professional. ,冇有合同，從來都唔需要簽合同 
These are professionals all over the world. ,你可以喺度做廿年，然後聽日就走 
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world. ,無人可以一個月賺取多過一百美金 
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal. ,如果你想賺錢，你就嚟錯咗地方嘞 
"It needs to be used, needs to be applied, needs to be shown to the world outside -- that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today. ",如果你愛工作而且愛挑戰 赤腳學院歡迎你 
So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi. ,呢度我哋想你測試瘋狂嘅想法 
"You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor. ",無論係點嘅想法，都可以大膽嘗試 
"There are no contracts, no written contracts. ",失敗無所謂 
"You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow. ",最多咪重頭嚟過 
And no one can get more than $100 a month. ,呢度係唯一一間 老師同學生身份互換嘅學院 
"You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College. ",同時亦係唯一一間唔頒證書嘅學院 
"You come for the work and the challenge, you'll come to the Barefoot College. ",你嘅學歷係由你服務嘅社區嚟鑑定 
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas. ,你唔需要喺牆上掛起一張證書 嚟證明你係工程師 
"Whatever idea you have, come and try it. ",當村民聽到我呢番話 佢哋話：「好啊，你用行動實踐呀。 
It doesn't matter if you fail. ,如果你做唔成， 你講嘅全部都係廢話。」 
"Battered, bruised, you start again. ",所以喺 1986 年 我哋成立第一間赤腳學院 
It's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher. ,係十二位連字都唔識嘅建築師 以每平方呎 $1.5 美金嘅成本 興建咗呢間學院 
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate. ,一百五十人喺嗰度住同做嘢 
You are certified by the community you serve. ,2002 年時佢哋獲頒阿迦汗建築獎 
You don't need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer. ,但評委懷疑有其他建築師參與 
"So when I said that, they said, ""Well show us what is possible. What are you doing? ",於是我話畀佢哋︰「的確有， 但佢哋只係畫藍圖， 而落手落腳起嘅 只有赤腳學院嘅建築師。」 
"This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."" ",因為佢哋唔信我哋赤腳學院嘅建築師 而且我哋認為佢哋喺度誹謗 所以我哋係唯一一個得獎者 將五萬蚊獎金還返畀主辦方 
So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986. ,我問一位林務員 一位權威、有學歷證書嘅專家 我問︰「你可以喺度起咩？」 
"It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can't read and write, built on $1.50 a sq. ft. ",他望一望泥土，話︰ 
"150 people lived there, worked there. ",「算數啦，冇可能。根本唔值得。 
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002. ,無水，周圍都係岩石地。」 
"But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it. ",我開始有啲擔憂 
"I said, ""Yes, they made the blueprints, but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."" ",我話：「咁好啦， 我去問下村嘅長老。」 我問呢度可以種咩 長老望住我講︰ 「你起呢個，放呢個，咁就得㗎嘞。」 
"We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000, because they didn't believe us, and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia. ",學院今日就係咁嘅樣 
"I asked a forester -- high-powered, paper-qualified expert -- I said, ""What can you build in this place?"" ",我記得當時我上去屋頂望 但所有嘅婦女都話︰ 「出去，男人唔上得嚟， 
"He had one look at the soil and said, ""Forget it. No way. ",因為我哋唔想同男人分享呢門技術， 
Not even worth it. ,事關宜家喺房頂整緊防水工程。」 
"No water, rocky soil."" ",（笑聲） 防水材料有棕櫚糖、蕁麻 仲有一啲我唔知嘅嘢 
I was in a bit of a spot. ,但佢的確防水 
"And I said, ""Okay, I'll go to the old man in village and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"" He looked quietly at me and said, ""You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."" ",1986 年到宜家都無漏過水 
This is what it looks like today. ,呢門技術，婦女唔會同男士分享㗎嘞 
"Went to the roof, and all the women said, ""Clear out. ",（笑聲） 呢間亦係唯一完全由太陽能供電嘅學院 
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men. ,所有電力嚟自太陽 
"This is waterproofing the roof."" ",四萬五千瓦嘅太陽能板裝喺屋頂 
"(Laughter) It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know. ",今後 25 年都係靠曬太陽 
But it actually doesn't leak. ,只要有陽光，我哋就唔怕冇電 
"Since 1986, it hasn't leaked. ",但呢樣嘢獨特在 佢係由一位受過只有八年小學教育 從來冇讀過中學或者讀大學嘅 印度教牧師裝嵌 
"This technology, the women will not share with the men. ",我敢講佢喺太陽能方面嘅知識 全世界無人能及 
(Laughter) It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified. ,如果你嚟到赤腳學院 所有食物都係靠太陽能煮熟 
All the power comes from the sun. ,而組裝太陽能烹調器具嘅人 全部都係唔識字嘅女性 佢哋組裝咗最尖端複雜 呈拋物線形狀嘅太陽能烹調用具 
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof. ,不幸嘅係，佢哋幾乎有一半德國血統 或者係咁，佢哋做嘢非常精確 
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years. ,（笑聲） 你無可能揾到做嘢咁精確嘅印度女性 
"So long as the sun shines, we'll have no problem with power. ",成個器具嘅製作過程就全靠佢哋 
"But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest, a Hindu priest, who's only done eight years of primary schooling -- never been to school, never been to college. ",我哋每日兩餐飯，一餐六十份 全靠太陽能煮好 
He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed. ,學院有一位牙醫 佢係一位唔識字、而且有孫嘅阿婆 
"Food, if you come to the Barefoot College, is solar cooked. ",但佢真係牙醫，仲幫七千名兒童睇牙 
"But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women, illiterate women, who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker. ",赤腳科技： 呢年係 1986 年 當時無工程師、無建築師諗到 但我哋諗到收集屋頂雨水 
"Unfortunately, they're almost half German, they're so precise. ",所以咁多年嚟我哋浪費咗好少水 
(Laughter) You'll never find Indian women so precise. ,所有屋頂嘅水槽都同地底 一個有四十萬升容量嘅水箱連接 所有水都唔會浪費 
"Absolutely to the last inch, they can make that cooker. ",即使發生四年乾旱 因為儲雨水嘅關係 我哋嘅學院都唔會缺水 
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking. ,另外，六成小朋友 因為幫屋企而無機會返學 呢啲小朋友要睇住動物︰山羊、綿羊 仲要理埋家頭細務 
"We have a dentist -- she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist. ",有見及此 我哋決定為呢啲孩子開辦夜校 
"She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children. ",因為呢啲夜校 令超過七萬五千個細路都有得返學 
"Barefoot technology: this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs. ",夜校嘅出現係因為孩子嘅需要 而唔係為咗方便老師 
Very little water is wasted. ,我哋學校教咩？ 
"All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank, and no water is wasted. ",民主、公民資格 點樣測量土地 俾人拉之後要做嘅嘢 生畜病咗點算 
"If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus, because we collect rainwater. ",呢啲都係我哋夜校教嘅知識 
"60 percent of children don't go to school, because they have to look after animals -- sheep, goats -- domestic chores. ",所有學校仲係完全靠太陽能供電 
So we thought of starting a school at night for the children. ,每到五年，我哋搞一次選舉 
"Because the night schools of Tilonia, over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools. ",六至十四歲嘅兒童 都會喺呢個民主選舉裏邊投票 選出一個總理 
Because it's for the convenience of the child; it's not for the convenience of the teacher. ,現任總理係一個十二歲嘅女仔 
And what do we teach in these schools? ,佢朝早看住二十隻羊 但夜晚就做返總理 
"Democracy, citizenship, how you should measure your land, what you should do if you're arrested, what you should do if your animal is sick. ",佢有自己內閣 有教育部長、能源部長、衛生部長 
This is what we teach in the night schools. ,"佢同內閣負責監督同管理 150 間學校 7,000 名學生 "
But all the schools are solar-lit. ,五年前呢位總理得到世界兒童獎 佢仲去咗瑞典攞獎添 
Every five years we have an election. ,佢第一次離開條村 
"Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process, and they elect a prime minister. ",佢從未去過瑞典 
The prime minister is 12 years old. ,但佢對當時嘅場面都一啲唔驚訝 
"She looks after 20 goats in the morning, but she's prime minister in the evening. ",瑞典皇后當時都喺度 佢問我：「你可唔可以 問下呢個小朋友， 
"She has a cabinet, a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health. ",佢嘅自信邊度嚟？ 佢先得十二歲，但完全唔驚嘅？」 
"And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children. ",企喺皇后左邊嘅呢個細路女 轉身對住我，望住皇后 然後同我講： 「話畀佢知，我係總理。」 
"She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago, and she went to Sweden. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 喺文盲率太高嘅地方，我哋用木偶溝通 
First time ever going out of her village. ,木偶就成為我哋溝通嘅方式 
Never seen Sweden. ,呢個三百歲嘅木偶，佢叫喬金查查 
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening. ,佢係我嘅心理分析師、我嘅導師 
"And the Queen of Sweden, who's there, turned to me and said, ""Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from? ",我嘅醫生、我嘅律師、我嘅捐贈者 
"She's only 12 years old, and she's not dazzled by anything."" ",佢幫我籌款，解決爭執 
"And the girl, who's on her left, turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said, ""Please tell her I'm the prime minister."" ",仲幫助村落解決問題 
"(Laughter) (Applause) Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high, we use puppetry. ",如果村落發生糾紛 如果返學嘅出席率少咗 如果老師同家長發生磨擦 木偶會叫老師同家長嚟到全村人面前 然後講「握手言和，出席率唔可以跌」 
Puppets is the way we communicate. ,呢啲木偶仲係用回收返嚟嘅 世界銀行報告書整成 
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 呢個用太陽能為條村供電嘅方法 唔單止容易做到 而且仲拓展到成個印度 從拉達克到不丹 所有太陽能供電嘅村 都係由受過培訓嘅人去做 
He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher. ,我去咗拉達克 問咗一位當地婦女 喺呢度，零下四十度 因為室內無地方匿，屋兩邊又俾雪覆蓋 你只能夠喺屋頂爬出嚟 我哋問佢： 「太陽能發電對你有咩好處？」 
He's my doctor. He's my lawyer. ,佢唸咗一陣，答： 「佢令我第一次喺冬天 見到我老公個樣。」 
"He actually raises money, solves my disputes. ",（笑聲） 嚟到阿富汗… 
He solves my problems in the village. ,我哋喺印度學識嘅一件事︰ 男人係教唔識嘅 
"If there's tension in the village, if attendance at the schools goes down and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent, the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says, ""Shake hands. ",（笑聲） 佢哋唔願意靜落嚟 但係又雄心勃勃、易衝動 而且都想要張沙紙 證明自己實力 
These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports. ,（笑聲） 你會發覺世界各地嘅男士 都想要一張證書 
"(Laughter) (Applause) So this decentralized, demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages, we've covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan -- all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained. ",點解？ 因為佢哋想離開村落，去城市揾工 
"And we went to Ladakh, and we asked this woman -- this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof, because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides -- and we asked this woman, ""What was the benefit you had from solar electricity?"" ",我哋諗到一個好辦法，就係訓練阿婆 
"And she thought for a minute and said, ""It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."" ",如今世上最好嘅溝通方式係咩？ 
(Laughter) Went to Afghanistan. ,電視？唔係 
One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable. ,電報？唔係 
"(Laughter) Men are restless, men are ambitious, men are compulsively mobile, and they all want a certificate. ",電話？唔係 
"(Laughter) All across the globe, you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate. ",向女性傾訴 （笑聲） （掌聲） 我哋第一次嚟到阿富汗時 揀咗三位女性 同當地人講︰ 「我哋想帶佢哋返印度。」 
"Why? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city, looking for a job. ",當地人話︰「冇可能。 佢哋連自己間房都出唔到去， 點會同你去印度！」 
So we came up with a great solution: train grandmothers. ,我話：「我哋可以妥協， 可以畀佢哋老公一齊嚟。」 
What's the best way of communicating in the world today? ,結果佢哋老公跟埋嚟 
Television? No. ,當然，女性比男性更有智慧 
Telegraph? No. ,喺六個月內，我哋係點樣練呢啲女性？ 
Telephone? No. ,手語 
"(Laughter) (Applause) So we went to Afghanistan for the first time, and we picked three women and said, ""We want to take them to India."" ",唔用文字 
"They said, ""Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms, and you want to take them to India."" ",唔用講嘢 
"I said, ""I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."" ",只用手語 
So I took the husbands along. ,就喺六個月內 佢哋就成為咗太陽能工程師 
"Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men. ",佢哋返去自己條村度 裝設太陽能發電設施 
"In six months, how do we train these women? ",呢啲女性返去 為阿富汗第一條村提供太陽能電力 同開辦工作坊 阿富汗第一個靠太陽能發電嘅村落 就靠三位女性親手建立 
Sign language. ,呢位女性係一個非比尋常嘅婆婆 
You don't choose the written word. ,55 歲，已經為阿富汗二百間房屋 提供太陽能電力 
You don't choose the spoken word. ,而且無一間冧過 
You use sign language. ,呢位阿婆去咗阿富汗政府嘅工程部門 話畀個部門知交流電同直流電嘅分別 
And in six months they can become solar engineers. ,而嗰位部長唔知個分別 
They go back and solar-electrify their own village. ,嗰三位女性又再培訓另外 27 位女性 為阿富汗一百條村實現太陽能發電 
"This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village, set up a workshop -- the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan [was] by the three women. ",我哋去咗非洲，做咗同樣嘅事 
This woman is an extraordinary grandmother. ,呢啲女性嚟自八、九個國家，坐埋一齊 講唔同嘅語言，互相傾偈 只係唔會聽得明對方講嘢 
"55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan. ",但佢哋嘅肢體語言犀利 
And they haven't collapsed. ,足以令佢哋可以明白對方 就係咁，佢哋學有所成 成為咗太陽能工程師 
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC. ,我亦都去咗塞拉利昂 有一晚個首相經過呢條村 
He didn't know. ,佢揸返轉頭，問呢度發生咗咩事 
Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan. ,村民話：「就係呢兩位阿婆…」 「阿婆？」首相難以置信 
"We went to Africa, and we did the same thing. ",「佢哋去咗邊度？」 
"All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries, all chatting to each other, not understanding a word, because they're all speaking a different language. ",啲人答︰「佢哋喺印度返嚟。」 首相之後見總統，話： 
But their body language is great. ,「你知唔知我哋國家 有一個靠太陽能供電嘅村？」 
They're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers. ,總統話：「唔知道。」 第二日內閣一半嘅成員 都去拜訪呢啲阿婆 
"I went to Sierra Leone, and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night -- comes across this village. ",佢哋想知點樣做到 
"Comes back, goes into the village, says, ""Well what's the story?"" ",總統傳召咗我 問我可唔可以幫佢培訓 150 位阿婆 
"They said, ""These two grandmothers ... "" ""Grandmothers?"" The minister couldn't believe what was happening. ",我話：「總統，我唔得。 
"Where did they go? ""Went to India and back."" ",不過呢啲阿婆可以做到。」 
Went straight to the president. ,總統為我哋喺塞拉利昂 興建咗第一間赤腳培訓中心 
"He said, ""Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"" ",之後有 150 位阿婆喺呢度受訓 
"He said, ""No."" Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day. ",喺甘比亞，我哋都挑選咗一位阿婆 
What's the story. ,我哋去咗呢條村 
"So he summoned me and said, ""Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"" ",我好知道要揀邊個女性 
"I said, ""I can't, Mr. President. ",但成條村嘅人都推薦： 「呢兩位女性適合。」 
"But they will. The grandmothers will."" ",我話：「唔係，我想要呢位女士。」 
So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone. ,佢哋話：「點解？ 你同佢溝通唔到，你又唔識佢。」 
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone. ,我話：「我鍾意佢嘅身體語言， 同埋佢講嘢嘅方式。」 
Gambia: we went to select a grandmother in Gambia. ,但啲人話，佢老公比較麻煩 
Went to this village. ,咁我哋叫佢老公出嚟 佢老公大搖大擺行過嚟 十足政客咁，揸住手機話「唔得！」 
I knew which woman I would like to take. ,我問點解？ 
"The community got together and said, ""Take these two women."" ",佢話︰「睇下我老婆幾靚。」 我話：「係，佢係好靚。」 
"I said, ""No, I want to take this woman."" ",佢話：「如果佢同某個 印度男人私奔，咁點算？」 
"They said, ""Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."" ",呢個係佢最大顧慮 
"I said, ""I like the body language. I like the way she speaks."" ",我話：「佢會開心生活， 每日同你喺電話傾偈。」 
Difficult husband; not possible. ,我想講，佢離開之前嘅性格十足阿婆咁 但返到嚟之後就成隻老虎咁 
"Called the husband, the husband came, swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. ""Not possible."" ",佢返到嚟，落咗飛機 好似退役士兵咁接受記者訪問 
"Why not? ""The woman, look how beautiful she is."" ",佢應付到全國嘅傳媒 就好似一位明星咁 
"I said, ""Yeah, she is very beautiful."" ",我六個月之後返去搵佢 
What happens if she runs off with an Indian man? ,問佢老公去咗邊 佢話：「唔知去咗邊度滾， 但我懶得理。」 
That was his biggest fear. ,（笑聲） 成功嘅案例 
"I said, ""She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile."" ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 最後，我想講 你唔使去出邊先揾到解決方法 
She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger. ,聽下周圍嘅人嘅建議 
She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran. ,佢哋總會畀到解決方法你 而且全世界都揾到呢啲人 
"She handled the national press, and she was a star. ",所以你唔使煩惱 
"And when I went back six months later, I said, ""Where's your husband?"" ",唔好聽世界銀行講 聽實實在在、唔離地嘅普通人講 
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter. ",佢哋知道點樣解決問題 
(Laughter) Success story. ,最後我引用聖雄甘地一句話 
(Laughter) (Applause) I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside. ,「佢哋開頭忽視你， 然後嘲笑你， 繼而同你爭， 最後你就係贏家。」 
Look for solutions within. ,多謝大家 
They're all over the world. ,（掌聲） 
Don't even worry. ,
"Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground. ","（音乐） 你刚刚听到嘅， 就系从2007年诺尔飓风中记低嘅 气压计,强风和温度嘅度数嘅协奏曲。 "
They have all the solutions in the world. ,音乐家们演奏嘅其实系一个3D嘅音乐数据图，就好似呢果。 
I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi. ,每一粒珠子，每一条彩色线， 都代表佐一种天气元素， 亦代表佐一种音符。 
"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win. ",我发现天气好有趣。 
Thank you. ,佢系由我地大部分人都睇唔到嘅 各种系统构成嘅。 
(Applause) ,所以，我用佐雕塑同音乐 来实现佢，令佢“可视”， 而且“可触”，“可听”。 
,我嘅工作嘅开始都好简单。 
"(Music) What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007. ",我用很简易嘅方法， 来从特定环境入边抽取信息， 几乎所有工具都可以从五金店入边买到。 
The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this. ,然后，我将我得到嘅呢地信息同我系网上稳到嘅—— 果地从气象站，海上浮标上得到嘅 卫星图像，天气数据信息进行对比。 
"Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note. ",既有历史数据，亦有现实数据。 
I find weather extremely fascinating. ,然后，我将呢地数字汇编系呢地写字板上面，就系你宜家睇到呢个。 
Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us. ,上面写满佐数字。 
"So I use sculpture and music to make it, not just visible, but also tactile and audible. ",由呢地数字出发， 我由两到三种变量开始。 
All of my work begins very simple. ,“翻译”过程开始啦。 
I extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices -- generally anything I can find in the hardware store. ,我嘅“翻译”介质就系一个好简单嘅竹篮。 
"I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet -- satellite images, weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys. ",一个篮，有横向同纵向嘅元素。 
That's both historical as well as real data. ,当我赋予呢地横向、纵向嘅元素新嘅意义时， 我就可以用呢地随着时间变化嘅数据点， 来创造呢种艺术嘅形式。 
And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here. ,我用天然芦苇， 因为天然嘅芦苇很有韧性， 我无法完全控制佢。 
These clipboards are filled with numbers. ,呢个意味着，系呢地数据控制着形式， 而唔系我。 
"And from all of these numbers, I start with only two or three variables. ",我最终得到嘅就系好似呢地嘅形式。 
That begins my translation process. ,呢地完全由天气数据或者系科学数据 构成嘅形式。 
My translation medium is a very simple basket. ,每一粒彩珠，彩条， 代表佐一种天气元素。 
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements. ,呢地元素系一起，唔单单建构出一种形式， 更建构佐一种两位空间 无法表达出嘅一种 元素间嘅行为关系。 
"When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements, I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form. ",你如果行近D，你会睇到 呢个完全系由数字搭建而成嘅。 
"I use natural reed, because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control. ",呢地垂直嘅元素 代表一日之内特定嘅时间。 
"That means that it is the numbers that control the form, not me. ",所以，一圈代表佐24个小时。 
What I come up with are forms like these. ,不过佢亦都表示佐温度嘅范围。 
These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data. ,系呢上边，我可以加入涨潮嘅度数， 水温，气温同埋月相。 
"Every colored bead, every colored string, represents a weather element. ",我都将呢地天气数据转化成佐音符。 
"And together, these elements, not only construct the form, but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two-dimensional graph. ",乐谱呢种方式，俾佐我一种翻译信息 更细腻， 更无损嘅方式。 
"When you step closer, you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers. ",呢地乐谱都系由天气数据编成嘅。 
The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day. ,每一种颜色，每一条线， 都系一种音乐元素。 
"So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline. ",加埋一齐，呢地变量就构成佐一份乐谱。 
But it's also used to assign a temperature range. ,我同音乐家们合作演奏呢地乐谱。 
"On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings, water temperature, air temperature and Moon phases. ",佢地系“1913三重奏”， 演奏梗我一件被Milwakee 艺术博物馆 收藏嘅作品。 
I also translate weather data into musical scores. ,同时，我又以呢地乐谱为蓝本， 将佢地翻译成甘样嘅雕塑作品， 佢地一样可以发挥 令天气3D“可视化”嘅作用， 不过依家，佢地嵌入佐 音符嘅视觉形式， 所以佢可以好似乐谱一样被阅读。 
And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it. ,正系因为佢挑战佐我地以前嘅假想， 即系对艺术同科学界内嘅可视语言嘅界定， 令我对佢喜爱有加。 
So all of these scores are made up of weather data. ,要点样睇呢件作品 取决于你将佢摆系边。 
"Every single color, dot, every single line, is a weather element. ",如果你摆系博物馆入边，佢就系件雕塑。 
"And together, these variables construct a score. ",摆系科学博物馆入边， 佢就变成佐一件3D可视嘅数据模型。 
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians. ,你将佢摆系音乐厅度， 佢突然间就会变成佐一份乐谱。 
This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum. ,我好中意呢个， 因为观者关于视觉语言嘅定义 被挑战佐， 系科学，艺术，定系音乐嘅一部分？（求指教~） 
"Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this, that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization, but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score, so it can actually be read as a musical score. ",我中意呢个嘅另一个原因， 就系佢提供佐另外一种 接近呢地复杂嘅科学嘅方法。 
"What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science. ",唔系所有人都系学自然科学嘅博士。 
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it. ,对于我来讲，呢个就系我接近科学嘅方法。 
"You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture. ",多谢。 
"You place it in a science museum, it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data. ",（掌声） 
"You place it in a music hall, it all of a sudden becomes a musical score. ",
"And I really like that, because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music. ",大家好，我叫哈桑，系一個藝術家 
The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science. ,通常我咁樣講 大家會望住我問：“你系畫畫噶？” 
And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science. ,或者“你從事邉方面嘅藝術？” 
"So for me, that was my way into it. ",其實我做嘅大部分工作 都系同工作方法論有關 而唔系具體某一種學科 或者某一種技術 
Thank you. ,我所感興趣嘅系用創意方式解決問題 
(Applause) ,而且幾年前我的確遇到少少問題 
,等我講畀你聽 
Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist. ,事情發生系呢度 
"And usually when I tell people I'm an artist, they just look at me and say, ""Do you paint?"" ",底特律機場，2002年六月19號 
"or ""What kind of medium do you work in?"" ",我參加完一個海外展覽準備飛返美國 
Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique. ,就嚟要飛嘅時候 被FBI帶走，去見一個FBI探員 行入一間細房 他問咗我各種各樣嘅問題 “你係邊度？做咗乜嘢？同邊個講過嘢？ 
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving. ,“點解要去個度？邊個出旅費？” 乜都問 
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago. ,突然間毫無根據 佢問我：“九月12號你係邊度？” 
So let me show you a little of that. ,大部分人被問到九月12號係邉 
So it started over here. ,或者任何一日 都會話：“我唔系好記得，不過可以查下” 
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002. ,所以我就攞出我部PDA 我話：“我地睇下九月12號嘅行程” 
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas. ,九月12號，早上十點到十點半，交咗倉庫保管費 
"And as I was coming back, well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent, and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- ""Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with? ",十點半到12點，我同朱迪思見面，佢系我當時嘅一個研究生 
"Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?"" -- all these little details. ",十二點到下午三點，我教初級班 三點到六點，教高級班 
"And then literally just out of nowhere, the guy asks me, ""Where were you September 12th?"" ",“你11號係邉？”“10號係邉？” 
"And when most of us get asked, ""Where were you September 12th?"" ",“29、30號係邊？” 
"or any date for that fact, it's like, ""I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."" ",“十月五號咧？” 
"So I pulled out my little PDA, and I said, ""Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."" ",我地翻閱咗我六個月嘅記錄 
"I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill. ",佢大概估唔到我將每日行程 記得咁詳盡 
"From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time. ",好彩我有記 因為我著橙色監等服唔好睇 
"From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class, 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class. ",（笑聲） 佢問我 （掌聲） “你租呢個倉庫 “用來裝乜嘢？” 
"Where were you the 11th? ""Where were you the 10th?"" ",倉庫位於佛羅里達州坦帕市 我話：“裝我系佛羅里達唔著嘅冬裝 
Where were you the 29th? the 30th? ,“同埋我間爛公寓裝唔落嘅傢俬 
Where were you October 5th? ,“類似車庫大平賣個啲嘢 “因為我鐘意執垃圾” 
We read about six months of my calendar. ,佢非常疑惑咁望著我話：“冇爆炸物？” 
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did. ,（笑聲） 我答佢：“冇啊，我可以肯定 
"But good thing I did, because I don't look good in orange. ",“如果有的話，我實記得” 
"(Laughter) So he asked me -- (Applause) ""So this storage unit that you paid the rent on, what did you have in it?"" ",他仲系有啲迷惑 我諗任何人同我傾多幾句 都會知道我唔系恐怖份子 
"This was in Tampa, Florida, so I was like, ""Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida. ",所以我地就坐係個度 反反復複問答咗大概個半鐘 佢終於講：“得了，搜齊資料了 
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment. ,“我會發送去坦帕辦公室，系佢地負責嘅 
"Just assorted garage sale junk, because I'm a pack rat."" ",“佢地會同你跟進，我地會處理好” 
"And he looks at me really confused and says, ""No explosives?"" ",我話：“好極了” 
"(Laughter) I was like, ""No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives. ",我返到屋企電話就響了 一個男人介紹咗佢自己 
"And if there were, I would have remembered that one."" ",呢度就系FBI係坦帕嘅辦公地點 我係個度六個月 系出出入入，唔系連續六個月 
"And he's still a little confused, but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat. ",順便講下，你地知道係美國 聯邦大樓系唔畀影相噶 但系Google可以幫你影 
"And so we're sitting there, and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth, he says, ""Okay, I have enough information here. ",Google嘅夥計，多謝曬 
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this. ,（掌聲） 我經常出入呢棟建築 
"They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."" ",佢地嘅問題包括 “你有否目睹或者參與任何 “可能對美國或者其他國家有害嘅行動？” 
"I was like, ""Great."" ",當你接受審問嘅時候，要考慮 自己嘅心情 
"So I got home and the phone rings, and a man introduced himself. ",因為基本上你對著嘅 系掌握生殺大權嘅人 
"Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth, not six months continuously. ",或者其他問題——其實係進行測謊嘅時候 我連續測過九次先確認清白 其中一個測謊問題系… 
"By the way, you folks know that in the United States, you can't take photographs of federal buildings, but Google can do it for you. ",第一個系“你系唔系叫哈桑？”“系” 
"So to the folks from Google, thank you. ",“呢度系唔系佛羅里達？”“系”“今日系唔系星期二？”“系” 
(Applause) So I spent a lot of time in this building. ,因為你只可以回答系定唔系 
"Questions like: ""Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"" ",當然，跟住落來嘅問題就系 “你系唔系屬於任何想要危害美國嘅組織？” 
And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this. ,我係大學做嘢 
You're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death. ,（笑聲） 於是我回答：“或者你可以直接問下我啲同事” 
"Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph, which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was ... ",不過佢地話：“除咗之前講過個啲 “你系唔系屬於任何想要危害美國嘅組織？” 
"well the first one was, ""Is your name Hasan?"" ""Yes."" ",我回答：“唔系” 
"Are we in Florida? ""Yes."" ""Is today Tuesday?"" ""Yes."" ",咁樣過咗六個月 測謊九次之後 佢地話：“一切正常” 
Because you have to base it on a yes or no. ,我話：“我知，我一直都想話畀你地知 
"Then, of course, the next question is: ""Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"" ",“我知我冇問題” 
I work at a university. ,佢地奇怪咁望著我 
"(Laughter) So I was like, ""Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."" ",我話：“夥計，我成日出差” 
"But they said, ""Okay, aside from what we had discussed, do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"" ",我同FBI講 
"I was like, ""No."" ",“你地最好連阿拉斯加都通知到 “唔好到時又嚟一次” 
"So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs, they said, ""Hey, everything's fine."" ",我系真系擔心 
"I was like, ""I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along. ",佢話：“如果你遇到麻煩 “打畀我地，我地會搞掂” 
"I know everything's fine."" ",所以自此之後，我出發去第二度之前都會打畀FBI 
So they're looking at me really odd. ,同佢地講：“老友，我要去呢度，航班號幾多 
"And it's like, ""Guys, I travel a lot."" ",“西北航空七號班機飛去西雅圖” “時間系三月12號”之類 
This is with the FBI. ,幾個星期之後，我又會電話知會一聲 
"And I was like, ""All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo, and here we go all over again."" ",佢地冇叫我咁做，系我想咁做 
And there was a sincere concern there. ,想話：“夥計 
"And he was like, ""You know, if you get into trouble, give us a call -- we'll take care of it."" ",“我唔想你地誤會我有乜嘢突然行動” 
"So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI. ",（笑聲） “唔想你地以為我要走路 
"I would tell them, ""Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight. ",“講聲你地知，小心” 
"Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th"" or whatever. ",於是我就不斷不斷咁樣做 
"A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know. ",之後電話變咗電子郵件 電子郵件仲越寫越長 
"It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to. ",帶埋相片 旅行貼士 
"Just wanted to say, ""Hey guys. ",我識得做網頁 
"Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."" ",所以我整咗呢個網站，打開畀你地睇下 
"(Laughter) ""I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee. ",系我2003年設計嘅 
"Just letting you know. Heads up."" ",可以睇到我每時每刻嘅行蹤 
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over. ,我寫咗個手機程序 
"And then the phone calls turned into emails, and the emails got longer and longer and longer ... ",基本上我嘅諗法系，你想監視我，冇問題 
"with pictures, with travel tips. ",但我會監視我自己，唔緊要 
Then I'd make websites. ,你唔需要浪費精力同埋人手 
And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here. ,等我嚟幫你 
So I actually designed this back in 2003. ,係過程中，我開始思考，佢地對我仲有乜嘢瞭解？ 
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment. ,佢地可能掌握咗我全部飛行記錄 所以我決定將我從出世以來嘅飛行記錄放上網 
I wrote some code for my mobile phone. ,你可以見到，Delta 1252 從堪薩斯飛去亞特蘭大 
"Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool. ",你睇，呢啲系我食過嘅飛機餐 
But I'll watch myself. It's okay. ,呢個系Delta 719 從甘乃迪機場飛去三藩市 
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources. ,見到未？佢地唔畀我帶刀上飛機 但系佢地會係飛機上畀我一把 
And I'll help you out. ,（笑聲） 呢啲系我逛過嘅機場 因為我鐘意機場 
"So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me? ",呢個系五月19號星期二係甘乃迪機場 
"Well they probably have all my flight records, so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online. ",呢個系華沙 
"So you can see, Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta. ",星加坡，你可以見到，機場冇乜人 
"And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes. ",呢啲圖片嘅攝影者 可以系任何人 
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco. ,但如果同其他數據互相參考 基本上你就系用FBI探員嘅方式 整理出頭緒 
"See that? They won't let me on a plane with that, but they'll give it to me on the plane. ",如果你不得已 要證明自己每時每刻嘅行蹤 你可以用非常特別嘅方式嚟回應 
"(Laughter) These are the airports that I hang out in, because I like airports. ",我受到懷疑嘅個段時間 根本冇諗過“藝術項目” 
"That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday. ",我當然唔可能諗，好了，有工開了 
This is in Warsaw. ,但經歷之後，諗通發生咗乜嘢之後 
"Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty. ",將各種細節砌埋一齊 用呢種方式自我探索成件事 最後慢慢演變 就成為咗呢個項目 
These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone. ,呢啲系我幫襯過嘅一部分士多 因為佢地想知道我去過邉 
"But if you can cross-reference this with the other data, then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together. ",我係呢度買過鴨醬 地點系達利市農場路99號 時間系11月15號星期日 
"And when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence, you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner. ",一家韓國超市 買緊泡菜，因為我鐘意食 
"At the time that this was going on, the last thing on my mind was ""art project."" ",仲係個邊買咗蟹 係愛莫利維爾嘅超市買咗豬腸 
"I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here. ",係西奧克蘭買咗洗衣液 系東奧克蘭，唔好意思 
"But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened? ",仲買過醃海蜇 地點系東布倫瑞克18大道上嘅香港超市 
"And after piecing together this, this and this, this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this, and it actually became this project. ",如果你點開我嘅銀行記錄 就會見到 系五月九號呢日 我係瓦列霍嘅超市入過$14.79嘅油 
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know. ,所以唔單只系我係度提供信息 仲有第三方參與提供 獨立嘅第三方，即系我嘅銀行 可以證明我當時的確係個度 
"This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday, November 15th. ",所以有幾個點可以交叉對比 
At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi. ,仲可以攞出證明 
"And I bought some crabs too right around there, and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville. ",有陣時只系買咗少少嘢 
"And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland -- East Oakland, sorry. ",譬如34美分嘅外匯手續費 
And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick. ,呢啲全部系從我嘅銀行帳戶提取出來噶 可以一目了然 
"Now if you go to my bank records, it'll actually show something from there, so you know that, on May 9th, that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo. ",有陣時信息好多 
"So not only that I'm giving this information here and there, but now there's a third party, an independent third party, my bank, that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time. ",譬如呢個系我係三藩市嘅舊公寓 
"So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced. ",有陣時系咁樣 
And there's a verification taking place. ,有陣時系咁，鹽湖城嘅一條空走廊 一月22號 
Sometimes they're really small purchases. ,我可以話畀你知我當時係邊度同邊個一齊 因為FBI就系要呢啲信息 
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee. ,每件事嘅每個小細節都要話畀佢地知 
"All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts, and everything pops up right away. ",我經常出街 
Sometimes there's a lot of information. ,呢個系內華達艾爾科嘅一個停車場 係80號公路邉 時間系八月19號晚上8:01 
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was. ,我仲經常去加油站入油，呢個系空嘅火車站 
And then sometimes you get this. ,所以我有多個資料庫 
"Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City, January 22nd. ",包含成千上萬張照片 
"And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was, because this is what I had to do with the FBI. ",我個網站依家有四萬六千張相 FBI已經全部睇過曬 至少我相信佢地睇過 
I had to tell them every little detail of everything. ,有陣時信息少 譬如得張空床 
I spend a lot of time on the road. ,有陣時淨系得文字信息冇圖像 
"This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada off of Route 80 at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th. ",譬如咁樣 
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations. ,呢個系我係加州最鐘意嘅三文治鋪 越南三文治 
So there's multiple databases. ,我將信息分門別類 包括係出邊食嘅飯 空火車站，空加油站 
And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images. ,呢啲系我自己係屋企煮嘅飯 
"There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site, and the FBI has seen all of them -- at least I trust they've seen all of them. ",點樣證明系係屋企？ 
"And then sometimes you don't get much information at all, you just get this empty bed. ",可以見到同一只碟出現好多次 
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information. ,呢點需要你去觀察推理 
So you get something like this. ,有啲資料庫非常特定 
"This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California -- Vietnamese sandwich. ",呢啲系我係墨西哥城食嘅粟米卷 係一個火車站附近 從七月五號到六號 
"So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations, empty gas stations. ",中午11:39食嘅系呢個 
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home. ,呢個系下晝1:56食嘅，呢個系4:59食嘅 
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home? ,每隔一陣我就會幫我嘅生活印時章 
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times. ,隔一陣就影張相 
"So again, you have to do some detective work here. ",依家全部用iPhone搞掂 直接就可以上傳到我嘅服務器 服務器會進行後端工作 將信息分類放置 
So sometimes the databases get so specific. ,FBI想知道我係邊度上廁所 因為佢地要瞭解我嘅行動 
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth. ,12月四號我去咗呢度 
At 11:39 a.m. was this one. ,2009年六月14號星期日 大概下晝兩點 係緬因州斯科希根，係我嘅公寓入邉 
At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one. ,你依家見到嘅 系零零碎碎嘅信息 
So I time-stamp my life every few moments. ,上我嘅網站仲可以見到好多其他嘢 
Every few moments I shoot the image. ,講真，個界面唔系咁好用 
"Now it's all done on my iPhone, and it all goes straight up to my server, and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together. ",應該話系幾難用 
"They need to know where I'm doing my business, because they want to know about my business. ",其中一個難用嘅原因 就系信息太全面了 讀起上來唔方便 
"So on December 4th, I went here. ",我將呢啲信息放出來 基本上就系將我嘅所有嘢話畀你知 
"And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there. ",但系儘管我透露咗 好多信息 我嘅生活卻保持住高度隱蔽唔受打擾 
So what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information. ,外人其實對我知之甚少 
"If you go to my site, there's tons of things. ",所以我得出咗結論 要保護私隱 尤其系係呢個時代，乜都有記載 乜都有存檔，有記錄 根本冇必要再刪除信息 
"And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface. ",當所有資料都曝光了，你應該點做？ 
It's actually quite user-unfriendly. ,你應該掌握控制權 
"And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness, is that everything is there, but you have to really work through it. ",主動提供資料 同被動任人搜集資料 系非常唔同噶 
"So by me putting all this information out there, what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything. ",仲有一點非常有趣 就系情報機構 唔理系邉一個 佢地嘅運作原理相同 信息就系佢地嘅商品 或者系有限嘅獲取信息嘅權利 
"But in this barrage of noise that I'm putting out, I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life. ",佢地嘅信息之所以有價值 系因為其他人冇權獲取 
And you know very little about me actually. ,我唔通過中間人 而系直接將信息畀你 咁樣FBI掌握嘅信息就毫無價值了 佢地嘅信息貨幣就貶值了 
"And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy, particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded, there's no need to delete information anymore. ",我知道係個人層面 呢個純粹系象徵性做法 
So what do you do when everything is out there? ,但系如果係美國嘅三億人 
Well you have to take control over it. ,都開始咁樣做 情報系統就必須要全部由頭 重新設計 
"And if I give you this information directly, it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces. ",因為如果大家將信息全部攞出來分享，佢地就唔適用了 
"The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information. ",已經有呢種趨勢 
"And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it. ",我啱啱開始呢個項目嘅時候 好多人同我講 “點解你要話畀大家知你係邊度做緊乜嘢？ 
"And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value, so thus devaluing their currency. ",“點解你要發呢啲相？” 
"And I understand that, on an individual level, it's purely symbolic. ",當時社交網絡仲未興起 七億五千萬人 仲未開始發表狀態 或者係社交網打招呼 
But if 300 million people in the U.S. ,從某種意義來講，我好開心我完全脫節 
"started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up. ",我依家仲做緊呢個項目，但系已經過時了 因為你地都做緊同樣嘅事 
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. ,呢啲系我地大家日常都做噶 唔理你有冇意識到 
And we're getting to that. ,我地係度建立緊我地自己嘅檔案 
"When I first started this project, people were looking at me and saying, ""Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at? ",我有啲朋友成日話 “你諗太多了，點解要做埋曬啲無謂嘢 
"Why are you posting these photos?"" ",“又冇人真系會睇 
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people. ,“冇人會來煩你噶” 
"So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete. ",所以我做嘅其中一樣嘢 就系仔細查看我嘅服務器日誌 
"I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it. ",因為同監視有關 
"This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis, whether we're aware of it or not. ",我要睇下邊個係度監視我 
So we're creating our own archives and so on. ,結果發現呢啲 
"And you know, some of my friends have always said, ""Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this? ",呢啲系部分抽樣日誌 
Because no one's really watching. ,只系好少一部分，你可以見到邊個來過 
"No one's really going to bother you."" ",我精簡出一個列表畀你地睇 
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully. ,你可以見到國土安全局經常光臨 國土安全局 
Because it's about surveillance. ,國家安全局都經常來 
I'm watching who's watching me. ,其實我搬咗去佢地附近，就係佢地條街下邊 
And I came up with these. ,中央情報局 
So these are some of my sample logs. ,總統執行辦公室 
"And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there. ",唔知點解，不過佢地真系來過 
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see. ,我諗系因為佢地鐘意藝術 
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security. ,我好開心係呢啲部門有藝術愛好者 
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by. ,多謝你地，感激不盡 
I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now. ,（掌聲） 布魯諾·朱撒尼：哈桑，好奇問一句 
Central Intelligence Agency. ,你話依家信息系自動從你部iPhone放上網 但系相片同埋信息都要靠你來拍攝輸入 
Executive Office of the President. ,咁你一日要花幾多個鐘來做呢啲嘢？ 
"Not really sure why they show up, but they do. ",哈桑：幾乎唔使 
I think they kind of like to look at art. ,影相上傳 同發短訊冇乜區別 
And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields. ,就好似查郵箱 
So thank you very much. I appreciate it. ,以前唔做呢啲嘢個陣日子照樣過 
"(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious. ",依家只不過多咗件事 
"You said, ""Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,"" but actually you do take the pictures and put on information. ",我地更新狀態嘅時候 根本唔會諗要使幾長時間 
So how many hours of the day does that take? ,其實只不過系係手機度按幾下 發送，搞掂 
HE: Almost none. ,網絡個邉就會自動整理了 
It's no different than sending a text. ,布魯諾：如果你去咗一個上唔到網嘅地方，FBI咪會發癲？ 
It's no different than checking an email. ,哈桑：就好似我最後講嘅 
"It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those. ",有我最後出現嘅地點記錄就得了 
So it's just become another day. ,譬如我要飛12個鐘 我會上傳出發嘅機場信息 
"I mean, when we update a status message, we don't really think about how long that's going to take. ",布魯諾：哈桑，非常多謝你（哈桑：多謝） （掌聲） 
"So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks, send, and then it's done. ",
And everything's automated at the other end. ,十年前，我創辦咗“隨地即興” 當時我啱搬去紐約，對表演同喜劇非常感興趣。 
"BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy? ",不過我初嚟甫到，上唔到舞臺 所以决定要喺公眾場合創造我自己唧舞臺 
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at. ,第一個要俾你哋睇唧喺 我策劃唧“第一屆唔著褲坐地鐵” 時間喺2002年1月 
So it holds onto the very last point. ,依位女士喺依段片唧主角 
"So if I'm on a 12-hour flight, you'll see the last airport that I departed from. ",佢唔知自己被人影緊 
"BG: Hasan, thank you very much. (HE: Thank you.) (Applause) ",因為我哋用唧喺偷拍用唧攝影機 
,地點喺紐約6号線唧 
I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy. ,依度喺依条線唧第二個站 
"Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage, so I decided to create my own in public places. ",上嚟两个丹麥男子 
So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride. ,坐咗系攝影機隔離 
"Now, this took place in January of 2002. ",著住啡色外套裹個就喺我 室外溫度喺零下1度左右 
And this woman is the star of the video. ,我戴住帽同圍巾 個女仔就快要發現我喇 
She doesn't know she's being filmed. ,（笑聲） 可以睇到，我無著褲 
She's being filmed with a hidden camera. ,（笑聲） 所以而家 而家，佢注意到我了 但喺喺紐約，你隨時都可能喺地鐵見到怪人 一個人無著褲，一啲都唔出奇 
This is on the 6 train in New York City. ,所以佢繼續睇佢唧書，咁啱得咁巧，佢本書唧名喺《強姦》 
And this is the first stop along the line. ,（笑聲） 
These are two Danish guys who come in and sit down next to the hidden camera. ,嗱，佢意識到有奇怪唧事發生 但喺佢即刻又繼續正常唧生活 
And that's me right there in a brown coat. ,與此同時，我有6個朋友 喺接落嚟唧6個站，都凈喺著住底褲，等緊車 
I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf. ,然後逐一上車 我哋會表現到唔識對方 
"(Laughter) And as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants. ",只喺咁啱大家都喺寒冬中唧一日 唔记得著褲 
"(Laughter) At this point -- at this point she's noticed me, but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car. ",（笑聲） 到咗而家 佢決定要將本強姦書擺埋一邊喇 
One person's not that unusual. ,（笑聲） 然後放多啲精力喺發生喺佢周圍唧事 
"She goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled ""Rape."" ",同时，裹兩個坐喺攝影機旁邊唧丹麥男子 已經笑到停唔到喇 佢哋覺得我哋無著褲喺佢哋成世人見過最搞笑唧事 
"(Laughter) So she's noticed the unusual thing, but she's gone back to her normal life. ",留心睇下個女人，佢同個兩個男子有眼神交流喇 
"Now, in the meantime, I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well. ",（笑聲） 依段片入邊，我最中意依嗰時刻 因為喺仲未同其他人有交流之前 個女人覺得我哋唧行為有啲得人驚 又或者佢會感到疑惑 
They're going to be entering this car one by one. ,但喺當佢開始同其他人有交流之後 我哋无着裤就变成一件搞笑唧事喇 列车而家进入 
"And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made, forgetting our pants on this cold January day. ",6号线唧第三個站喇 
"(Laughter) (Laughter continues) So at this point, she decides to put the rape book away. ",（笑聲） 段片唔會播曬成個過程 到而家為止，後邊仲有四個站 
(Laughter) And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings. ,一共7個男人都好似我咁，凈喺著住底褲 
"In the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera, they're cracking up. ",喺第八個站，有個女仔會帶住一個大帆布袋上車 然後對所有人講佢有長褲平賣，一蚊美金一條 好似其他人喺車上賣電池同糖一樣 
They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before. ,我哋都買咗條褲，著上身之後 就對賣褲個女仔講：“太多謝你了。我今日就系爭依樣嘢。” 然後就一句解釋都唔咁落車 向住唔同唧方向離開 
"(Laughter) And I love that moment in this video, because before it became a shared experience, it was something that was maybe a little bit scary, or something that was at least confusing to her. ",（掌聲） 多謝 
"And then, once it became a shared experience, it was funny and something that she could laugh at. ",講返啱啱段片 
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line. ,我實在太中意個女仔唧反應了 
(Laughter) So the video won't show everything. ,嗰日後尾我睇返段片 啓發我要做多啲類似唧事 
This goes on for another four stops. ,爾“隨地即興”唧宗旨之一 就喺引起公眾關注 對其他人黎講都喺一個積極唧經歷 
"At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train. ","我知喺有整蠱人唧感覺餓,但喺會喺一個好好唧故仔 "
"We all very matter-of-factly bought a pair of pants, put them on and said, ""Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today,"" and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions. ",個女人唧反應啓發咗我 舉辦第二屆“唔著褲坐地鐵” 
(Applause) Thank you. ,而且每年我哋都要有咁唧一日 
So that's a still from the video there. ,今年一月，喺“唔著褲坐地鐵”唧第十載 一共有3，500個嚟自唔同背景唧人 齋著住底褲，出現系紐約地鐵上 幾乎每一臺列車上都可以見到佢哋 全球仲有50個城市唧人 
And I love that girl's reaction so much. ,都參與其中 （笑聲） 
And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do. ,我喺紐約一間劇院開始教授即興表演 識咗好多好有創意既人、演員同喜劇明星 我開始收集 對依類型演出有興趣唧人唧聯繫方式 擴大我啲表演唧規模 
And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people. ,有一日，我行過紐約聯合廣場 
"It's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell. ",見到一棟樓 佢喺喺2005年建成唧 
And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride. ,有個女仔喺一個櫥窗入邊跳舞 望落好奇怪啦 
And we've continued to do it every year. ,因為周圍都好暗，得啲霓虹燈由後邊照住佢 好似佢就系舞臺上邊咁 
"This January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in New York -- almost every single train line in the city. ",我就諗唔通點解佢會做啲咁唧嘢 約摸15秒之後，佢個朋友出現 
"And also in 50 other cities around the world, people participated. ",個朋友之前一直匿喺展板後邊 佢哋狂笑，然後攬咗下對方之後跑住咁離開 
"(Laughter) As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians, I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects. ",我估就應該喺佢哋玩緊大冒險 
So I could do more large-scale projects. ,我都得到啓發啦 
"Well, one day I was walking through Union Square, and I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005. ",望住棟樓，一共有70個咁既櫥窗 然後我就知道我要做啲咩啦 （笑聲） 
There was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing. ,依嗰計劃唧名叫做“多啲抬頭看”。我哋一共有70個人著到全身黑 
"It was very peculiar, because it was dark out, but she was backlit with florescent lighting. ",未經過批准 
She was very much onstage and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it. ,因為我哋唔想比商場知道我哋要做依樣嘢 
"After about 15 seconds, her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display. ",我就企喺公園度畀信號 
"They laughed, hugged each other and ran away. ",第一個信號喺要所有人舉起一個四尺長唧字母 拼埋一起就喺“多啲抬頭看”唧英文 依次計劃唧名 
Maybe she had been dared to do this. ,第二個信號就喺要佢哋喺咁跳 
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do. ,你哋可以見到喇 
(Laughter) So this project is called Look Up More. ,（笑聲） 然後就開始跳舞，開頭喺各個人都跳 
We had 70 actors dress in black. ,跟住落嚟就系獨舞 所有人都會指向裹個人唧方向 （笑聲） 
We didn't let the stores know we were coming. ,然後我又畀出一個新信號 表示下一個獨舞唧喺喺某商店櫥窗唧裹個人 然後佢就開始跳 仲有好多其他形式唧表演 
And I stood in the park giving signals. ,佢哋會上下跳 
"The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out ""Look Up More,"" the name of the project. ",訓落地下 
The second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together. ,我就著住件T恤，企喺人群中 用我只手同一個垃圾桶 黎畀信號 
You'll see that start right here. ,因為地點喺喺聯合廣場公園，就喺地鐵站隔離 到咗最後，應該有幾百人 停低，抬起頭 睇我哋做緊乜 
(Laughter) And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance. ,仲有啲影得好啲唧相 
And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them. ,依嗰計劃 只喺受到短短10幾秒唧啓發 仲要喺我咁啱撞到唧 
"(Laughter) So then I gave a new hand signal, which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21, and he danced. ",下一個計劃我想要同你哋分享唧 喺有個我完全唔識唧人，喺2006年，發咗封電子郵件畀我 
There were several other activities. ,佢喺美國德克薩斯州唧一個高中細路 佢話：“你應該嗌人，越多人越好 著住藍色polo恤衫，同啡色長褲 喺Best Buy(美國一間數碼商店）入邊企下。”（佢哋唧制服喺藍衫啡褲） 
"We had people jumping up and down, people dropping to the ground. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 我即刻寫返封信畀個細路 話：“好！ 我依個週末就試下！多謝！” 
"And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt, putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement. ",接落嚟就喺過日條片 
"And because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station, there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing. ",2005年 
There's a better photo of it. ,喺紐約唧依間商場入邊 
So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon. ,一共有大概80個人參與依次計劃 佢哋一個個咁行入商場 
The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger. ,其中個8歲唧細路女，有個10歲唧細路女 
"A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said, ""You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around."" ",有個20歲唧細路女 仲有個65歲唧高齡男人 
"(Laughter) (Applause) So I wrote this high school kid back immediately and I said, ""Yes, you are correct. ",參與今次計劃唧真喺咩年齡都有 
"I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you."" ",我同啲人講：“唔好表現到你真喺喺裹度做嘢咁 
So here's the video. ,但喺都唔好表現到你喺度行街 
"So again, this is 2005. ",就咁企喺度，不過唔好對住啲產品。” 
"We had about 80 people show up to participate, entering one by one. ",而家你可以見到商場唧員工 佢哋件藍色恤衫上邊喺有個黃色牌唧 
"There was an eight-year-old girl, a 10-year-old girl. ",其他人都喺我哋計劃唧人 
There was also a 65-year-old man who participated. ,（笑聲） 商場比較低層唧員工覺得我哋好搞笑 甚至有啲人由休息室入邊行出嚟，攞住部相機 
So a very diverse group of people. ,要同我哋唧人合影 有啲人就想整蠱我哋，要我哋去倉庫 
"(Laughter) And I told people, ""Don't work. Don't actually do work. ",搬哋好重唧電視畀顧客 
"But also, don't shop. ",不過，商場經理同保安 就唔覺得我哋搞笑喇 喺依段片，你地可以見到 
"Just stand around and don't face products."" ",佢哋著住黃色或者黑色恤衫 
Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt. ,我哋喺裹度大概有10分鐘 經理就決定要打911報警喇 
Everybody else is one of our actors. ,（笑聲） 然後我哋就開始周圍跑 通知其他人警察要嚟喇！睇住啊！警察要嚟喇！ 
(Laughter) The lower-level employees thought it was very funny. ,可以見到警察就喺裹度 
Several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us. ,著住黑色制服，畀人偷拍緊 
A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers. ,最後，個警察同商場經理講 事實上，我哋唧行為唔犯法 無法律規定話唔比著藍色polo恤衫同緋色褲 
"The managers and the security guards, on the other hand, did not find it particularly funny. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 多謝 
You can see them in this footage. ,（掌聲） 我哋喺商場入邊有20分鐘，然後好開心咁離開 
And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911. ,個經理有嘗試 搵我哋唧偷拍攝影機 
"(Laughter) So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming, ""Watch out, the cops are coming."" ",佢哋都捉到幾個我哋唧人放住臺偷拍攝影機喺帆布袋入邊 
And you can see the cops in this footage right here. ,但喺有一個人無畀人捉到 佢帶住個空帶入去商場 然後去到相機攝影機唧區域 將個空白帶放入商場唧相機 扮喺度試機 
"That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera. ",我好中意依嗰諗法，用商場自己唧產品嚟影商場入邊發生唧事 
"Ultimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not, in fact, illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants. ",（笑聲） 我覺得我哋最好唧喺喺特定場地 有特定原因唧計劃 有一朝，我坐緊地鐵 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. ,要系第三十五街站專線 
(Applause) So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store. ,裹個站有兩條超長唧電梯 不過喺電梯上邊你會覺得好壓抑，而且喺依一個好多人唧早上 
One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras. ,我一我決定要喺度搞D乜嘢 
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags. ,可以令人覺得開心唧，雖然只喺一個早上 
But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop. ,然後系2009年冬天 有一朝喺八點半 
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them. ,上班高峰期 
(Laughter) I think our best projects are ones that are site-specific and happen at a particular place for a reason. ,室外好鬼凍 
"And one morning, I was riding the subway. ",啲人都喺從皇后區坐過黎唧 由E號線轉過6號線 
I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators. ,個個都坐緊依兩條超長唧電梯 喺佢哋返工唧路上 
"And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded. ",（笑聲） （笑聲） （掌聲） 多謝 
So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning. ,依張向影得好啲 
So this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8:30 in the morning. ,佢裹日擊掌2000次 依嗰計劃前後佢都有洗手 所以無病倒 依次活動都喺無經過批准唧 
It's morning rush hour. ,不過好似都無人理 依幾年 
It's very cold outside. ,我見過喺網上匿名留言中 關於“隨地即興”最常見唧評論喺 “依班人實在太得閒了。” 
"People are coming in from Queens, transferring from the E train to the 6 train. ",唔喺個個人都會中意你做唧嘢 因為網上評論，我面皮都厚咗好多 但喺就喺放唔低依嗰人講唧嘢 因為講真我哋都好鬼唔得閑 “隨地即興”唧人 
And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs. ,同紐約市其他人一樣，都唔乜空餘時間 我哋只喺間中 選擇一種唔同唧方式嚟消磨時間 
[Rob wants] [to give you] (Laughter) [a high five!] (Laughter) [Get ready!] (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. ,每年秋季唧每個週末 成千上萬人 聚埋喺足球場睇波 點解我就唔見有人話啲睇波唧人 
So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better. ,“裹啲喺足球場唧人實在太得閒喇！” 不過其實裹啲睇波人都好忙 
"He gave 2,000 high fives that day, and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick. ",不過搵個週末下晝 
"And that was done also without permission, although no one seemed to care. ",喺足球場睇波，無乜嘢唔好 不過我覺得 
"So I'd say over the years, one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is: ""These people have too much time on their hands."" ",搵日下晝，喺紐約中央車站 同200人一齊挨凍 或者著住《捉鬼敢死隊》唧制服 喺紐約公眾圖書館入邊跑嚟跑去 
"And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do, and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments, but that one's always bothered me, because we don't have too much time on our hands. ",（笑聲） 或者同3000人一齊，喺公園入邊 用MP3同步停住同一首歌，一齊無聲咁跳舞 又或者為咗準備即興音樂劇 喺超市突然間開始唱歌 又或者一班人盛裝打扮，沖入個海度 
"The participants in Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers, they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way. ",細細個裹陣，大人都會教我哋點玩 但喺佢哋都無話我哋知點解我哋要玩 
"You know, every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games. ",大家都好自然咁接受玩喺一件好事 
"And I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game, ""All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."" ",依嗰就喺“隨地即興”想要傳達唧信息 
And of course they don't. ,玩無原因 我哋亦唔需要一個原因去玩 
"It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon, watching a football game in a stadium. ",只要件事好玩 個諗法睇落會好玩 同埋睇唧人開心 我哋就滿足了 
But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library. ,作為成年人 我哋要識得諗話玩喺無最佳方式唧 多謝 
"(Laughter) Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park, or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical, or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire. ",（掌聲） 
"(Laughter) You know, as kids, we're taught to play. ",
And we're never given a reason why we should play. ,有啲嘢我想講畀你哋聽 係好大件事 
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing. ,我哋由呢度開始 
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point. ,六千五百萬年前 啲恐龍好慘 
"We don't need a reason. As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time, then that's enough for us. ",（笑） 有一塊寬六英里嘅石頭飛落來撞落地球 速度大概係 步槍子彈嘅五十倍 佢即刻一次過釋放晒所有能量 
"And I think, as adults, we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play. ",而且引起咗爆炸 大聲到震耳欲聾 
(Applause) ,如果你將所有 喺冷戰高峰時期製造出來嘅原子彈 喺同一時間綁埋一齊之後引爆 噉就會釋放出 小行星能量嘅百萬分之一 
,啲恐龍真係好慘 
I want to talk to you about something kind of big. ,好 
We'll start here. ,六英里寬嘅石頭係非常之大嘅 
Sixty-five million years ago -- (Laughter) the dinosaurs had a bad day. ,我哋都住係博爾德 
"(Laughter) A chunk of rock six miles across, moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet, slammed into the Earth. ",如果你望出窗外你可以睇到朗斯山峰 你好可能覺得佢好熟 依家，將朗斯山峰掘出來 將佢放喺太空 
"It released its energy all at once, and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing. ",將米克山掘出來 
"If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War, lumped them together, and blew them up at the same time, that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment. ",同樣擺上太空 
The dinosaurs had a really bad day. ,仲有珠穆朗瑪峰同埋 K2 
OK? ,同埋印第安山峰都放上太空 
"Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large. ",然之後你就知 我哋喺度講緊幾多石頭 
We all live here in Boulder. ,我哋知佢有咁大係因為 佢嘅衝擊力同埋佢留低嘅隕石坑 
"If you look out your window and see Longs Peak -- you're probably familiar with it -- now, scoop up Longs Peak and put it out in space. ",佢撞落今日墨西哥灣嘅猶加敦 
"Take ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker. ",你可以睇到呢度就係猶加敦半島 如果你認到東岸嘅科蘇梅爾嘅話 
"Lump that in there, and put that in space as well. ",就睇到個坑有幾大 
And Mt. Everest. And K2. ,個坑非常之大，畀你感受下佢嘅規模 
And the Indian peaks. ,幅圖比例係一比五十英里 
"Then you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about, OK? ",或者一比一百公里 呢個坑成三百公里寬或者兩百英里寬 隕石撞落嘅一刻產生大量塵土 塵土燒著嘅火擴散到全世界 升起嘅塵埃足以遮住太陽 
We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left. ,殞石毀滅咗地球上百分之七十五嘅生物 
"It hit in what we now know as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico. ",不過唔係所有嘅小行星都咁大 
"You can see here, there's the Yucatan Peninsula, if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there. ",有啲比較細 
Here is how big of a crater was left. ,呢度有係一個小行星撞落美國 時間係 1992 年 10 月 
It was huge. ,佢喺星期五晚上撞落來 
"The scale here is 50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers on the bottom. ",點解講佢呢？ 
"This thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet, threw up enough dust to block out the sun. ",因為當時 攝影機啱啱開始流行 啲人呢就會將佢哋帶喺身邊 爹地媽咪帶住攝像機 去拍仔女嘅足球比賽 
It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth. ,星期五嗰晚呢個小行星落咗落來 所以啲人可以捕捉到小行星墜落 一路穿過西維珍尼亞州、馬里蘭州 賓夕法尼亞州同新澤西州 直到佢擊中咗一部紐約嘅車 
"Now, not all asteroids are that big. ",（笑） 依家，呢個唔係一個 200 英里寬嘅坑 但跟住落來你哋可以睇到 粒隕石同一個足球差唔多大 擊中咗嗰部車 
Some of them are smaller. ,不過當呢粒小行星進入地球時 可能係一部校車嘅晒士 由於高温擦過大氣壓 
Here is one that came in over the United States in October of 1992. ,佢開始燃燒、解體 解體之後嘅石頭 只係對地面造成咗一啲破壞 
It came in on a Friday night. ,你哋唔會希望石頭落喺你嘅腳或者頭 因為會好痛 
Why is that important? ,但係你知細細嚿石 唔會毀滅所有地球上嘅生命 
"Because back then, video cameras were just starting to become popular, and parents would bring them to their kids' football games to film their kids playing football. ",之不過 唔使六英里寬嘅小行星 都可以造成好大破壞 
"And since this came in on a Friday, they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York. ",喺分類上，除咗細隕石同大隕石之外 有中型隕石 如果你有去過亞利桑那州 溫斯洛附近嘅沙漠 嗰度有個中型隕石嘅坑 因為佢太標誌性 所以佢嘅名叫流星坑 
"(Laughter) Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater, but then again, you can see the rock, which is sitting right here, about the size of a football, that hit that car and did that damage. ",爲咗讓你哋對晒士有個概念 呢個就有 1 英里寬 
"Now, this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in. ",如果你望上高，嗰個係停車場 而嗰啲就係旅行車 
"It broke up through atmospheric pressure, it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage. ",所以佢有 1 英里寬，600 英尺深 
"Now, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head, because it would do that to it. ",形成呢個坑嘅小行星 大概有 30 到 50 碼寬 差唔多係呢度麥基禮堂嘅晒士 
"But it won't wipe out, you know, all life on Earth, so that's fine. ",當時小行星以高速衝落來 撞擊地面 以近二千萬噸原子彈嘅能量爆炸 係一個重磅炸彈 
"But it turns out, you don't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage. ",呢件事發生喺 5 萬年前 令一啲水牛或者羚羊 或者生活喺沙漠嘅動物消失 但佢唔太可能毀滅成個地球 
"There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock, and in fact, if any of you have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona, there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called ""Meteor Crater."" ",因為我哋發現 要造成大損傷，唔一定要撞落地面度 
"To give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide. ",喺 1908 年，西伯利亞上空 近通古斯卡地區—— 對於係丹．艾克羅伊德支持者 同時睇過《捉鬼特工隊》嘅人來講 當丹．艾克羅伊德講到 1909 年西伯利亞爆炸以來 最大嘅交叉維度裂縫—— 佢講錯咗日期，不過冇影響（笑） 
"If you look up at the top, that's a parking lot, and those are recreational vehicles right there. ",其實事情發生喺 1908 年 不過我可以當佢冇錯—— 
"So it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep. ",（笑） 當時另一粒殞石進入地球嘅大氣層 而且喺上空離地面幾英里爆炸 
"The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across, so roughly the size of Macky Auditorium here. ",爆炸釋放出來嘅熱量引發地面森林大火 而且衝擊波將幾百平方英里嘅樹推倒 
"It came in at speeds that were tremendous, slammed into the ground, blew up, and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb -- a very hefty bomb. ",造成巨大嘅破壞 
"This was 50,000 years ago, so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope, or something like that out in the desert, but it probably would not have caused global devastation. ",呢次嘅隕石 差唔多係我哋依家坐嘅演講廳嘅大細 
It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage. ,隕石由金屬構成 因為金屬更加硬 所以殞石先可以落到地面 
"Now, in 1908, over Siberia, near the Tunguska region -- for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw ""Ghostbusters,"" when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of 1909, where he got the date wrong, but that's OK. ",通古斯卡上空嘅石頭 好可能係由岩石構成 於是乎易碎 所以至會喺空中爆炸 
(Laughter) It was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that. ,呢兩次隕石事件 都引起相等於二千萬噸嘅大爆炸 
"(Laughter) Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground, several miles up above the surface of the Earth. ",當呢啲隕石爆炸時 佢哋唔會破壞全球生態 
"The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it, and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles. ",佢哋唔係毀滅恐龍嗰類嘢 
This did a huge amount of damage. ,佢哋唔夠大 
"And again, this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in. ",但係佢哋會破壞全球經濟 因為佢哋唔使撞擊都能夠破壞經濟 
"In Meteor Crater, it was made of metal, and metal is much tougher, so it made it to the ground. ",佢哋唔使毀滅全球都已經有破壞力 
"The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air. ",如果任何一粒小行星求其撞向一笪地方 就會引起恐慌 
"Either way, these are tremendous explosions -- 20 megatons. ",但係如果佢撞落一個重要城市—— 雖然唔係最重要嘅城市 但係撞落全球經濟裏邊 比較重要嘅城市—— 咁對我哋文明嚟講 就係大破壞 
"Now, when these things blow up, they're not going to do global ecological damage. ",我依家已經嚇到你連屎都出咗來 （笑） 我哋可以做啲咩嘢？ 
They're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did. ,呢個係潛在威脅嚟 
They're just not big enough. ,"而其實 我哋已經有 6,500 萬年 冇遇到毀滅恐龍嘅巨大能量 "
"But they will do global economic damage, because they don't have to hit, necessarily, to do this kind of damage. ",畢竟大行星撞地球係好罕見 
They don't have to do global devastation. ,但行星越細，就越有可能撞擊地球 但小行星撞地球一般都講緊千年一次 或者每幾百年或者幾千年一次 
"If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere, it would cause a panic. ",就算係咁，我哋都要小心啲先得 
"But if it came over a city, an important city -- not that any city is more important than others, but some of them we depend on more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization. ",咁，我哋要對行星做啲乜嘢呢？ 
"So, now that I've scared the crap out of you -- (Laughter) what can we do about this? ",第一件事係要搵佢哋 
This is a potential threat. ,呢張相影 2009 年 一粒經過地球嘅小行星 
Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer for 65 million years. ,佢就喺呢度 
They're very rare. ,但你哋會發現佢係非常細 
"The smaller ones happen more often, but probably on the order of a millennium, every few centuries or every few thousand years. ",我都唔知坐喺最後嗰排嘅你哋 係咪可以睇到佢 
But it's still something to be aware of. ,呢啲只係星星 
"Well, what do we do about them? ",呢個係一個 30 碼寬嘅岩石 差唔多同 5 萬年前 喺通古斯卡上空爆炸 然後撞擊亞利桑那州嗰啲隕石一樣大 
The first thing we have to do is find them. ,呢啲行星好細、好難發現 
This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009. ,而且天空實在太大嘞 
It's right here. ,但我哋必須搵到佢哋 
But you can see that it's extremely faint. ,好消息係，我哋已經搵緊佢哋啦 
I don't know if you can see that in the back row. ,NASA 出資咗做呢件事 國家科學基金同埋其他國家 都對呢件事有興趣 
These are just stars. ,我哋製造緊可以察覺威脅嘅太空望遠鏡 
"This is a rock that was about 30 yards across, so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago. ",係好大嘅進步來 不過下一步又係咩嘢呢？ 
These things are faint. ,第二步就係如果我哋發現 一粒小行星撞向地球時 
"They're hard to see, and the sky is really big. ",我哋要阻止佢。咁點做呢？ 你哋好可能聽過小行星阿波菲斯 
We have to find these things first. ,如果你冇，你好快會聽到 
"Well, the good news is, we're looking for them. ",如果你聽過瑪雅 2012 預言 你就會聽到小行星阿波菲斯 因為你哋無論如何 都走唔甩世界末日 
NASA has devoted money to this; the National Science Foundation and other countries are interested in doing this. ,阿波菲斯小行星喺 2004 年被發現 
We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat. ,佢差唔多有 250 米寬 所以佢好大。你哋知喇，係大晒士 仲大過足球場 
That's a great first step. But what's the second step? ,佢仲會喺 2029 年 4 月經過地球 
"The second step is if we see one heading toward us, we have to stop it. ",佢靠得咁近 甚至乎會來到氣象衛星下面 
What do we do? ,如果佢正常運動 地球嘅重力會扭曲佢嘅軌道 如果佢穿過一個區域空間 一個叫做鎖匙眼嘅豆角形狀區域 地球重力就會令佢扭曲 恰恰七年之後 喺 2036 年 4 月 13 號 即係一個星期五……（笑） 你一定預唔到咁嘅事︰ 阿波菲斯將會撞埋來我哋度 
"If you haven't yet, you will. ",佢有 250 米寬 所以將會造成巨大破壞 
"If you've heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse, you're going to hear about Apophis, because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks, anyway. ",依家好消息係 佢穿過鎖匙眼同撞到我哋嘅幾率 係百萬分之一 係非常非常之細嘅幾率 所以我自己唔會因為擔心佢而瞓唔著 
(Laughter) Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004. ,我唔認為阿波菲斯係一個問題 事實上，塞翁失馬焉知非福 
"It's roughly 250 [meters] across, so it's pretty big -- bigger than a football stadium. ",阿波菲斯令我哋認識小行星嘅危險 
And it's going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029. ,阿波菲斯喺幾年前被發現 當時仲諗幾年後可能會撞落地球 
And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites. ,但宜家佢唔會 而且仲畀咗我哋一個機會 來研究呢類小行星 
"The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it's just right, if it passes through this region of space, this kidney-bean-shaped region called the keyhole, the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later, on April 13 -- which is a Friday, I'll note -- in the year 2036 -- (Laughter) you can't plan that kind of stuff -- (Laughter) Apophis is going to hit us. ",我哋過去對鎖匙眼認知甚少 不過依家已經好清楚嘞 而且我哋明白到了解小行星係非常重要 因為如果唔係 你點阻止呢類小行星呢—— 
"And it's 250 meters across, so it would do unbelievable damage. ",等我問你，如果你企喺路上 突然有部車衝來你度，你會點做呢？ 
"The good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly -- very, very low odds. ",你會咁做 
I don't think Apophis is a problem. ,係咪？走。部車剛好同你擦身而過 
"In fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise, because it woke us up to the dangers of these things. ",但係我哋唔可以移走地球 至少冇咁易，但係我哋可以移走小行星 
This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now. ,而且睇來，我哋甚至已經移走過小行星 
"It won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids. ",2005 年，NASA 發射咗 一個叫深層衝擊嘅探測器 探測器其中一部份 撞入咗一粒彗星嘅核心 
"We didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes, and now we do, and it turns out that's really important, because how do you stop an asteroid like this? ",彗星好似小行星 
"Well, let me ask you: What happens if you're standing in the road and a car's headed for you? ",嗰次目的唔係要將佢推到第二度 而係造一個坑挖掘 以瞭解彗星表面之下係咩嘢物質 我哋嗰次從中的確學到啲嘢 
What do you do? ,我哋的確將小行星移動咗小小 雖然唔多，但唔係重點 
"You do this. Right? Move, and the car goes past you. ",不過，諗下 呢個每秒圍繞太陽 10-20 英里 
"But we can't move the Earth, at least not easily, but we can move a small asteroid. ",而我哋發射咗一部太空探測器 而且擊中佢 
"And it turns out, we've even done it. ",雖然件事好難，但係我哋做到 
"In the year 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact, which slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet. ",即係話我哋可以繼續做 
Comets are very much like asteroids. ,如果我哋見到一粒小行星撞埋來 而且正正咁對住我哋咁 而我哋有兩年時間？ 唔驚！我哋會擊中佢 
"The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way; the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet, which we learned quite a bit about. ",如果你哋睇開戲 可能會諗 點解我哋唔用核武？ 
"We did move the comet a little tiny bit -- not very much, but that wasn't the point. ",係可以嘅，但問題係時間 
"However, think about this: This thing is orbiting the Sun at 10, 20 miles per second. ",如果你用核武來打佢 你要喺幾百萬分之秒裏邊引爆原子彈 如果唔係就打唔中 而且仲有好多其他問題 
"We shot a space probe at it and hit it, OK? ",核武好高難度 如果只係要去撞呢？咁就易好多 
"Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it. ",我諗 NASA 可以做到 
That means we can do it again. ,佢哋證明咗佢哋係得（笑） 
"If we see an asteroid that's coming toward us, headed right for us, and we have two years to go? ",問題係如果撞到小行星 你就會改變佢嘅軌道 然之後你再測量佢嘅軌道，卻發現 弊！我哋將佢推入咗鎖匙眼 即係話佢將會係三年之後撞擊我哋！ 
"You know, if you watch the movies -- (Laughter) you might think: Why don't we use a nuclear weapon? ",我嘅觀點係，唔緊要 
"Well, you can try that, but the problem is timing. ",佢唔會喺六個月之內撞到我哋 咁就好啦 
"Shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing, you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance, or else you'll miss it. ",依家我哋有 3 年去做嘢 
And there are a lot of other problems with that; it's very hard to do. ,你可以再次擊中佢 
But just hitting something? That's pretty easy. ,但咁樣係一件好蠢嘅事 因為你會推佢入第三個鎖匙眼 所以你唔會咁做 
"I think even NASA can do that, and proved that they can. ",跟住係我鍾意嘅部份︰ 
"(Laughter) The problem is, if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit, you measure the orbit, then you find out, oh yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole, and now it's going to hit us in three years. ",（笑） 「呯一聲！ 我哋正面迎擊小行星之後， 我哋就有咗天鵝絨手套！」 
"Well, my opinion is: fine! ",（笑） 有一群科學家、工程師同埋太空人 自稱係 B612 基金會 
It's not hitting us in six months -- that's good. ,但對於讀過《小王子》嘅人 你會明白意思︰ 小王子住喺 一個叫做 B612 嘅小行星上 上邊有好多聰明人，有男有女 
Now we have three years to do something else. ,太空人、工程師 
And you can hit it again. ,阿波羅 9 號太空人 拉塞爾．施威卡特都喺上面 
"That's kind of ham-fisted; you might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever, so you don't do that. ",我朋友丹．德達整咗呢幅圖 佢依家就喺博爾德核桃街嘅 西南研究中心工作 
And this is the part -- it's the part I just love. ,佢為呢樣嘢做咗一幅圖 
"(Laughter) After the big macho ""Grr ... bam! We're gonna hit this thing in the face,"" then we bring in the velvet gloves. ",同時佢就係為佢哋做嘢嘅 其中一位太空人 
"(Laughter) There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts, and they call themselves The B612 Foundation. ",如果我哋發現 一粒即將撞擊地球嘅小行星 而我哋有足夠嘅時間嘅話 我哋可以移佢去一個更安全嘅軌道 
"For those of you who've read ""The Little Prince,"" you understand that reference, I hope -- the little prince lived on an asteroid called B612. ",但我哋依家做緊嘅係發射 一粒 1-2 噸重嘅探測器 
"These are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts, like I said, engineers. ",佢唔一定要幾噸咁大 你只要將佢停近小行星 
"Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this. ",你唔需要登陸小行星 因為小行星來回震動，所以好難登陸 
"Dan Durda, my friend who made this image, works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, on Walnut Street. ",不如先靠近佢哋 
He created this image for this. ,小行星嘅重力會拉埋探測器 
He's actually one of the astronomers who works for them. ,而探測器又只有幾噸重 
"If we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth and we have enough time, we can hit it to move it into a better orbit. ",探測器嘅重力細 但足以拉動小行星 再加上本身嘅火箭裝置—— 噢，你雖然睇唔到佢 但係嗰度有火箭嘅噴焰—— 小行星同探測器之間嘅重力 將兩者連埋起來 如果你慢慢移動探測器 而又非常非常細力嘅話 你就可以好輕鬆咁將小行星 送入地球上一個安全軌道 
But then what we do is launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two. ,甚至可以上去採集礦物 但係嗰個完全係另一件事 我唔會深入呢個話題（笑） 
"It doesn't have to be huge -- a couple of tons, not that big -- and you park it near the asteroid. ",但係我哋會因此暴富！ 
"You don't land on it, because these things are tumbling end over end. ",（笑） 有得諗，好冇？ 
It's very hard to land on them. ,雖然目前有巨大殞石 將會撞落地球，造成破壞 
Instead you get near it. ,但係我哋已經諗到點樣解決 每一步都已經就緒 
"The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe, and the probe has a couple of tons of mass. ",我哋有太空人用望遠鏡搵緊佢哋 
"It has a little tiny bit of gravity, but it's enough that it can pull the asteroid, and you have your rocket set up -- you can barely see it here, but there's rocket plumes -- and these guys are connected by their own gravity, and if you move the probe very slowly -- very, very gently, you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit. ",我哋有聰明人 關注小行星而且諗緊方法解決 而且我哋有科技輔助—— 
"You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it, although that's a whole other thing; I won't go into that. ",實際上呢個探測器唔可以使用化學火箭 
(Laughter) But we'd be rich! ,化學火箭嘅推力大得制 
"(Laughter) So think about this, right? ",探測器會打唔中 
"There are these giant rocks flying out there, and they're hitting us, and they're doing damage to us. ",所以我哋發明咗叫做離子推動器嘅嘢 佢係一個推力非常細嘅引擎 
"But we've figured out how to do this, and all the pieces are in place to do this. ",產生相當於一張擺喺手上嘅紙嘅力 但係佢可以連續幾個月到幾年 提供微小嘅推力 
"We have astronomers with telescopes, looking for them. ",如果呢度有人係《星際旅行》 原版系列嘅支持者就會知道 佢哋揸住一部有離子推動器嘅外星飛船 而且斯波克話︰「佢哋有精密嘅科技。 
"We have very, very smart people, who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem, and we have the technology to do this. ",憑住呢個推動器， 佢哋領先我哋 100 年。」 
This probe actually can't use chemical rockets. ,耶！我哋依家都有咗離子推動器（笑） 
"Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push. ",我哋冇企業號 但係我哋有離子推動器 
The probe would just shoot away. ,（掌聲） 係斯波克話嘅 
"We invented something called an ion drive, which is a very, very, very low-thrust engine. ",（笑） 所以…… 
"It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand -- incredibly light, but it can run for months and years, providing that very gentle push. ",呢個就係分別 就係我哋同恐龍嘅分別 
"If anybody here is a fan of the original ""Star Trek,"" they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive, and Spock said, ""They're very technically sophisticated. ",佢哋俾殞石滅絕，但我哋唔一定 
"They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."" ",我哋同恐龍嘅分別在於我哋有太空計劃 而且我哋可以投票改變未來 
"Yeah, we have an ion drive now. ",（笑） 我哋有能力去改變未來 
"We don't have the Enterprise, but we've got an ion drive now. ",六千五百萬年後 我哋嘅骨頭唔會喺博物館裡面惹塵 
(Laughter) (Applause) Spock. ,多謝晒 
(Laughter) So ... ,（掌聲） 
That's the difference -- that's the difference between us and the dinosaurs. ,
This happened to them. ,依位喺東尼，佢喺我唧學生。 
"The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote, and so we can change our future. ",佢同我差唔多大， 喺圣昆廷州立監獄唧監友。 
(Laughter) We have the ability to change our future. ,喺佢16歲唧時候， 有一日突然間，事情就咁發生： ”支槍喺媽媽唧。 
"Sixty-five million years from now, we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum. ",我開頭諗住求其開一槍，嚇下個飛仔。 
Thank you very much. ,佢搶咗我哋唧錢，我就搶佢唧錢，教訓下佢。 
(Applause) ,到最後，我就諗：‘唔得，我唔可以咁做。’ 我朋友就話：‘快啲啦，快啲開始啦。’ 我就話：‘好啦。’” 就喺依兩個字，東尼永遠都會記住， 因為接落嚟佢見到唧，就喺警察， 
,個飛仔訓喺地上，訓喺血入邊。 
Meet Tony. He's my student. ,佢犯咗謀殺罪-25年到終身監禁 如果好彩唧話，50年後會得到假釋， 不過東尼就唔喺咁好彩了。 
"He's about my age, and he's in San Quentin State Prison. ",當我哋喺監獄唧哲學課見面唧時候， 我話：“依堂課我哋要討論唧喺道德唧基礎，” 東尼就打斷我： 
"When Tony was 16 years old, one day, one moment, ""It was mom's gun. ",“你憑咩教我對同錯啊？ 
"Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk. ",我知咩喺錯唧。我做過錯事。 
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him. ,每一日每個我見到唧每一個人， 我見到唧每一面墻，都話我知我就喺一個錯誤。 
"Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.' My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.' I say, 'Let's do this.'"" And those three words, Tony's going to remember, because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop. ",只要一日唔離開依度，我就一直都會咩住依個名號。 
"There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood. ",我喺一個囚犯；我就喺‘錯誤’。 所以你憑咩話我知咩喺對同錯啊？” 
"And that's felony murder -- 25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky, and Tony's not feeling very lucky. ",我就同東尼講： “唔好意思，不過個問題比你想像中要難。 
"So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say, ""In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"" Tony interrupts me. ",你覺得你知道咩喺對同錯？ 
"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong? 
I know what is wrong. I have done wrong. 
I am told every day, by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong. 
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name. 
I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong? ",咁你可唔可以話我知咩喺錯？ 
"So I say to Tony, ""Sorry, but it's worse than you think. ",你唔可以齋同我舉例， 
You think you know right and wrong? ,我想知道錯誤唧本質喺乜嘢， 
Then can you tell me what wrong is? ,錯誤唧理念，喺一個點唧理念？ 
"No, don't just give me an example. ",喺乜嘢令一樣嘢變成錯唧？ 
"I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong. ",我哋點知一樣嘢喺錯唧？或者你同我唧諗法會唔一樣， 
What is that idea? ,或者我哋兩個之中有一個唧諗法喺錯唧。 
What makes something wrong? ,可能喺你，可能喺我，但喺我哋唔喺嚟交換思想唧； 個個人都有佢哋自己唧諗法， 
How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree. ,我哋喺度唧目的喺學習知識， 
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong. ,我哋唧敵人喺輕率。依啲就喺哲學。” 
"Maybe it's you, maybe it's me -- but we're not here to trade opinions; everyone's got an opinion. ",然後東尼就開始有啲改變了。 
We are here for knowledge. ,“可能我唧諗法喺錯唧，我已經厭倦咗一直都喺錯唧， 
"Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy."" ",我想知咩喺錯誤， 
And something changes for Tony. ,我想瞭解多啲我知道唧嘢。” 
"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong. 
I want to know what is wrong. 
I want to know what I know. ",喺過一刻，東尼見到唧就喺哲學計劃， 一個以奇跡為開端唧計劃-- 康德稱之為“頭頂唧星空 同心中唧道德法則，喚起我哋唧讚歎同敬畏。” 
"What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy, the project that begins in wonder -- what Kant called ""admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within."" ",作為大地生物之一，我哋又點知道依啲嘢唧呢？ 
What can creatures like us know of such things? ,就喺依個計劃，一直提醒我哋生存唧條件-- 海德格爾稱之為“存在唧意義”。 
"It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence -- what Heidegger called ""the always already there."" ",就喺依個計劃，一直質疑我哋唧信念同佢哋唧原因-- 蘇格拉底稱之為“受考驗唧生活”。 
"It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it -- what Socrates called ""the examined life."" ",蘇格拉底，一個聰明到瞭解自己無知唧男人， 
"Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing. ",佢喺監獄中去世， 不過佢唧哲學得意留存。 
"Socrates died in prison, his philosophy intact. ",東尼開始做佢唧功課， 
So Tony starts doing his homework. ,學習原因、結果同關係， 學習邏輯同謬論， 
"He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations, his logic, his fallacies. ",最後，佢喺哲學方面變得好專業。 
"Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle. ",雖然佢個人被困喺監獄，但喺佢唧思想卻好自由。 
"His body is in prison, but his mind is free. ",東尼仲學識本體論混雜， 認識論焦慮， 倫理性質疑，同埋形而上學既謬論。 
"Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous, the epistemologically anxious, the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous. ",依啲分別喺柏拉圖、笛卡兒、尼采、 同克林頓唧哲學。 
"That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche and Bill Clinton. ",然後佢最後交咗佢篇論文， 寫唧喺定言令色 聽落對於我哋日常生活唧矛盾嚟講 有啲太嚴肅， 同時依個話題都條件我要話佢知， 如果我哋犯道德錯誤，系咪就會受到譴責， 我講佢知：“我唔知個答案， 
"So when he gives me his final paper, in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure, I say, ""I don't know. ",不如我哋一齊諗下。” 
"Let us think about that."" ",喺果一刻，東尼無任何所謂唧身份， 我同佢只喺兩個人， 
"Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name; it's just the two of us standing there. ",唔喺教授同囚犯， 只喺兩個準備要討論哲學唧人。 
"It is not professor and convict, it is just two minds ready to do philosophy. ",然後我就同東尼講： “快啲開始啦！” 
"And I say to Tony, ""Let's do this."" ",多謝 
Thank you. ,（掌聲） 
(Applause) ,
,有幾多人填寫網頁表格時 需要識別變形驗證碼？ 
How many of you had to fill out a web form where you've been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this? ,有幾多人覺得哩樣嘢真係好煩？ 
How many of you found it really annoying? ,都唔少啊。哩樣嘢就係我發明嘅 
"(Laughter) OK, outstanding. So I invented that. ",（笑聲） 或者講我係發明嘅其中一個 
(Laughter) Or I was one of the people who did it. ,哩樣嘢叫 CAPTCHA 佢之所以會出現喺網頁度 
That thing is called a CAPTCHA. ,係因為電腦要確認你、填格嘅 哩個人係一個人類 而唔係電腦程式 為咗千萬次重複填表嘅電腦程式 
"And it is there to make sure you, the entity filling out the form, are a human and not a computer program that was written to submit the form millions of times. ",至所以有變形驗證碼 係因為正常人讀哩啲扭曲文字 完全冇難度 但電腦就仲未做到 
"The reason it works is because humans, at least non-visually-impaired humans, have no trouble reading these distorted characters, whereas programs can't do it as well yet. ",譬如，喺 Ticketmaster 網站上 你要輸入哩啲變形驗證碼嘅原因 係為咗防止黃牛用程式 每次兩張咁買成幾萬張飛 
"In the case of Ticketmaster, the reason you have to type these characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets, two at a time. ",驗證碼喺網絡十分普遍 
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet. ,既然我哋咁頻繁用到佢 於是好多時候用戶遇到一啲問題 
"And since they're used so often, a lot of times the sequence of random characters shown to the user is not so fortunate. ",哩度係一個來自雅虎註冊頁嘅例子 
So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page. ,展示畀用戶嘅隨機字符「WAIT」 咁啱可以組成一個英文字「等待」 
"The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W, A, I, T, which, of course, spell a word. ",最有趣嘅係 20 分鐘後雅虎網上支援組收到訊息 
But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later. ,（文字：幫我啊！ 我都等咗廿幾分鐘，畫面依然冇郁） （笑聲） 佢仲以為網站叫佢等 
[Help! I've been waiting for over 20 minutes and nothing happens.] (Laughter) This person thought they needed to wait. ,當然冇嘢比哩個人幾騎 
"This, of course, is not as bad as this poor person. ",（笑聲） 驗證碼計劃係我哋十多年前 喺卡內基梅隆大學搞起嘅 之後開始被廣泛應用 
"(Laughter) CAPTCHA Project is something that we did at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago, and it's been used everywhere. ",宜家等我來講下我哋幾年後 搞嘅另一個項目 即係驗證碼嘅進化版 我哋稱之為「reCAPTCHA」 
"Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later, which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA. ",哩個項目最先喺卡內基梅隆大學開始 之後仲成為一間公司 大概一年半之前 
"This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA, which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon, then we turned it into a start-up company. ",谷歌收購埋哩間公司 
"And then about a year and a half ago, Google actually acquired this company. ",宜家等我來講講哩個項目係點開始嘅 
Let me tell you what this project started. ,哩個項目出於以下嘅事實： 全球每日輸入大概 2 億次驗證碼 
This project started from the following realization: It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world. ,我第一次聽到嘅時候都幾自豪 我諗，我哋嘅研究都幾大影響喔 
"When I first heard this, I was quite proud of myself. ",跟住我就覺得唔對路 
But then I started feeling bad. ,因為你每輸入一次驗證碼 你就浪費咗 10 秒鐘嘅時間 
"Here's the thing: each time you type a CAPTCHA, essentially, you waste 10 seconds of your time. ",如果你將佢乘以 2 億 咁人類因為輸入驗證碼 而每日浪費咗 50 萬個小時 
"And if you multiply that by 200 million, you get that humanity is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs. ",所以我就開始覺得唔爽 
(Laughter) So then I started feeling bad. ,（笑聲） 跟住我就開始諗 嗯，當然啦 我哋冇可能放棄驗證碼糸統㗎嘛 因為網絡安全旨意佢 但係咪有辦法可以利用佢 來為人類做啲好事？ 
"(Laughter) And then I started thinking, of course, we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs, because the security of the web depends on them. ",嗯，關鍵在於 
"So see, here's the thing. ",當你輸入一個驗證碼嘅時候 喺嗰 10 秒鐘 你嘅大腦係度做緊一啲好神奇嘅 而電腦未做到嘅嘢 
"While you're typing a CAPTCHA, during those 10 seconds, your brain is doing something amazing. ",我哋可唔可以用哩 10 秒 做啲有用嘅嘢呢？ 
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds? ,換個講法 係唔係有啲計算機無法解決嘅龐大問題 而我哋可以將佢分為 10 個 10 秒嘅子問題呢？ 咁樣，每次有人輸入一個驗證碼嘅時候 佢哋就解決咗哩個問題嘅其中一部分 
"Is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve, yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA, they solve a little bit of this problem? ",答案係肯定嘅 而哩個就係我哋做緊嘅嘢 你可能唔知道 宜家你每次輸入驗證碼嘅時候 
"And the answer to that is ""yes,"" and this is what we're doing now. ",你唔單止證明咗自己人類嘅身份 同時亦喺度幫緊我哋數碼化圖書 
"Nowadays, while you're typing a CAPTCHA, not only are you authenticating yourself as a human, but in addition you're helping us to digitize books. ",等我來解釋一下： 
Let me explain how this works. ,目前已經有好多項目做緊圖書數碼化 
There's a lot of projects trying to digitize books. ,谷歌有一個 「互聯網檔案計劃」都有一個 
Google has one. The Internet Archive has one. ,亞馬遜同埋 Kindle 亦都試緊數碼化圖書 基本上，數碼化圖書要由一本舊書開始 
"Amazon, with the Kindle, is trying to digitize books. ",你睇過書㗎吓？ 一本書？ 
"You've seen those things, right? ",（笑聲） 
Like a book? ,你從一本實體書開始，掃描佢每一頁 
(Laughter) So you start with a book and then you scan it. ,掃描一本書 就好似對本書每一頁影一張相 
"Now, scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page. ",畀到你每一頁嘅樣貌 
It gives you an image for every page. ,哩啲影像包括咗書每一頁嘅文字 
This is an image with text for every page of the book. ,下一步就係電腦需要認到 哩個影像入邊嘅所有文字 目前使用嘅技術叫做 OCR 
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher the words in this image. ,即係「光學字符識別」 OCR 首先獲取文字嘅影像 然後嘗試辨認出 出現喺嗰個影像入邊嘅文字 
"That's using a technology called OCR, for optical character recognition, which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there. ",問題在於 OCR 並唔完美 
"Now, the problem is that OCR is not perfect. ",尤其用喺古書嘅時候 古書上面嘅墨跡已經變淡 紙質開始變黃 好多文字 OCR 認唔到 
"Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow, OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words. ",譬如，五十幾年前嘅書 當中大概有 30% 嘅文字 唔可以俾電腦識別 
"For things that were written more than 50 years ago, the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words. ",所以，我哋喺度做緊嘅嘢 就係將所有哩啲電腦認唔到嘅文字 攞出來 等人喺網上輸入驗證碼嘅同時 幫我哋認啲字 
So now we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we're getting people to read them for us while they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet. ,所以，下一次你輸入驗證碼嘅時候 你輸入嘅嗰啲文字實質上 來自被數碼化緊嘅圖書 而所有哩些文字都係電腦認唔到嘅 
"So the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing are actually words from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize. ",另外，宜家之所以出現兩組文字 而唔係一組文字 係因為其中一組文字 係系統喺書入邊認唔到嘅字 
"The reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book, it didn't know what it was and it's going to present it to you. ",但係既然佢唔知答案係乜嘢 佢都唔可以判斷你認得啱唔啱 
"But since it doesn't know the answer, it cannot grade it. ",所以我哋嘅做法就係 畀一組系統已知嘅文字組合你 
"So we give you another word, for which the system does know the answer. ",我哋唔講畀你知邊個打邊個 我哋淨係講「請將兩個組合輸入」 
"We don't tell you which one's which and we say, please type both. ",如果你正確輸入電腦已知嘅組合 電腦就認為你係人類 同時對你輸入嘅另一個組合多幾分信心 
"And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system knows the answer, it assumes you are human and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly. ",如果我哋對 10 個人重複哩個過程 而佢哋都輸入咗個新詞係乜嘢 咁我哋就可以正確咁數碼化多一個詞語 哩樣就係系統嘅運作原理 
"And if we repeat this process to 10 different people and they agree on what the new word is, then we get one more word digitized accurately. ",同時，因為我哋已經喺三四年前 發佈咗哩個系統 
So this is how the system works. ,好多網站已經由以前嘥用戶時間嘅 舊驗證碼系統 轉去哩個新嘅 可以幫助數碼化圖書嘅系統 例如，喺 Ticketmaster 嘅網站上 
"And since we released it about three or four years ago, a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA, where people wasted their time, to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books. ",你每一次買飛，都係幫緊數碼化圖書 喺臉書，你每一次加好友或者打招呼 
"So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster, you help to digitize a book. ",你都係幫緊數碼化圖書 推特同埋另外 35 萬個網站 都用緊 reCAPTCHA 
"Facebook: Every time you add a friend or poke somebody, you help to digitize a book. ",事實上，使用 reCAPTCHA 嘅 網站數量如此之多 以至到我哋每日數碼化嘅文字數量 亦都十分之高 
And the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words we're digitizing per day is really large. ,"大概有 1,000 萬之多 相當於每年數碼化咗 250 萬本書 "
"It's about 100 million a day, which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year. ",而哩一切都係一個字一個字咁 由用戶喺網上輸入驗證碼得來嘅 
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet. ,（鼓掌） 當然 既然我哋每日都可以完成咁多字 有趣嘅事就有可能會發生 
"(Applause) Now, of course, since we're doing so many words per day, funny things can happen. ",尤其而家，我哋同時向用戶展示 兩個隨機產生、並列出現嘅英文單詞 
This is especially true because now we're giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other. ,好笑嘅嘢會發生 
So funny things can happen. ,譬如，我哋展示咗哩個詞語 
"For example, we presented this word. ",詞語「基督徒」冇乜問題 
"It's the word ""Christians""; there's nothing wrong with it. ",但係如果你同另外一個隨機選嘅詞語 擺埋一齊 就可能搞禍咗 我哋就見到咁樣嘅組合 （英文意思：壞基督徒） 
"But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word, bad things can happen. ",但更衰嘅係 哩组文字咁啱出現喺一個叫 「上帝王國嘅使館」嘅網站上 
"[bad Christians] But it's even worse, because the website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God. ",（笑聲） 哎呀 
(Laughter) Oops. ,（笑聲） 哩度仲有一個 JohnEdwards.com 
(Laughter) Here's another really bad one. ,（譯：可惡嘅自由派） （笑聲） 所以我哋每日都喺度侮辱人 
JohnEdwards.com [Damn liberal] (Laughter) So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday. ,當然，我哋不單止侮辱人 
"Of course, we're not just insulting people. ",既然我哋隨機產生兩組字 有趣嘅嘢可能會發生 
"Here's the thing. Since we're presenting two randomly chosen words, interesting things can happen. ",所以佢實際上催生咗 一個十分龐大 有成千上萬人參與嘅互聯網潮流 叫「驗證碼嘅藝術」 
"So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in, which is called CAPTCHA art. ",我相信你哋在座一啲人已經聽過 
I'm sure some of you have heard about it. ,佢係咁運作嘅 
Here's how it works. ,想像你自己正喺度用緊互聯網 如果你見到一個有啲奇怪嘅驗證碼 好似咁 （譯：隱形嘅土司機） 
"Imagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar, like this CAPTCHA. ",然後，你應該做嘅係將佢截圖落來 
[invisible toaster] What you're supposed to do is you take a screenshot of it. ,跟住，當然啦，你將個驗證碼填好 因為咁樣已經幫緊我哋數碼化圖書 
"Then of course, you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book. ",所以，你首先截圖落來 然後畫一啲同佢相關嘅嘢 
But first you take a screenshot and then you draw something that is related to it. ,（笑聲） 就係咁 
(Laughter) That's how it works. ,哩度有成千上萬咁樣嘅作品 
(Laughter) There are tens of thousands of these. ,有啲都好可愛咖 （譯：捉緊佢） 
Some of them are very cute. ,（笑聲） 有啲更加搞笑 
[clenched it] (Laughter) Some of them are funnier. ,（譯：飲大咗嘅建國者） （笑聲） 仲有一啲 譬如「古生物學嘅史維錘」 
"[stoned Founders] (Laughter) And some of them, like paleontological shvisle ... ",佢哋包括饒舌家 Snoop Dogg 
(Laughter) they contain Snoop Dogg. ,（笑聲） 哩個係我最鐘意嘅 reCAPTCHA 數字 
"(Laughter) OK, so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA. ",我最鐘意嘅部分 
So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project. ,7 億 5 千萬哩個數字 係通過 reCAPTCHA 幫我哋 數碼化圖書嘅人數 剛好世界超過百分之一嘅人口 已經幫過我哋數碼化人類知識 
"This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA: 750 million, a little over 10 percent of the world's population, has helped us digitize human knowledge. ",就係哩個數字激勵我去研究一個問題： 
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda. ,如果你睇睇人類嘅大型成就 嗰啲歷史上人類合力完成嘅大事 譬如，建造埃及金字塔 或者巴拿馬運河 或者將人類送上月球 哩度有一個幾有趣嘅 關於呢啲大事嘅事實 就係佢哋全部都係 由差唔多數量嘅人完成嘅 
"So the question that motivates my research is the following: If you look at humanity's large-scale achievements, these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically -- like, for example, building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon -- there is a curious fact about them, and it is that they were all done with about the same number of people. ",好奇怪，佢哋全部都係 由差唔多 10 萬人完成嘅 
"It's weird; they were all done with about 100,000 people. ",原因係，喺互聯網出現之前 集合超過 10 萬人 ——唔好講話畀錢佢哋 係幾乎冇可能嘅 
"And the reason for that is because, before the Internet, coordinating more than 100,000 people, let alone paying them, was essentially impossible. ",但係因為有咗互聯網 我啱啱展示畀你哋嘅項目 就有 7 億 5 千萬人參與 來幫我哋數碼化人類知識 
"But now with the Internet, I've just shown you a project where we've gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge. ",所以激勵我研究嘅問題就係 如果我哋可以用 10萬人 將人類送上月球 我哋可以用 1億人做啲乜嘢？ 
"So the question that motivates my research is, if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000, what can we do with 100 million? ",基於哩個問題 我哋開展咗好多唔同嘅項目 
"So based on this question, we've had a lot of different projects that we've been working on. ",等我同你哋介紹下我最為之興奮嘅一個 
Let me tell you about one that I'm most excited about. ,哩個項目我哋已經半公開地 進行咗差唔多一年半 
This is something that we've been semiquietly working on for the last year and a half or so. ,佢仲未正式運行，叫做 Duolingo 
It hasn't yet been launched. It's called Duolingo. ,因為我哋仲未投入使用，所以，噓！ 
"Since it hasn't been launched, shhh! ",（笑聲） 我相信你哋都會守口如瓶嘅 
"(Laughter) Yeah, I can trust you'll do that. ",哩個項目係咁樣開始嘅 
So this is the project. Here's how it started. ,我向我嘅研究生 Severin Hacker 提出一個問題 
"It started with me posing a question to my graduate student, Severin Hacker. ",——哩個就係佢 我向佢提咗一個問題 
"OK, that's Severin Hacker. ",——順便一提，你冇聽錯 佢確實姓「Hacker（譯︰駭客）」 
"By the way, you did hear me correctly; his last name is Hacker. ",我向佢提出咗哩個問題： 我哋點樣先可以叫 1 億人義務咁 幫手將互聯網翻譯成主要嘅語言？ 
(Laughter) So I posed this question to him: How can we get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free? ,嗯，關於哩個題目我哋有好多嘢可以講 
There's a lot of things to say about this question. ,首先係翻譯網頁 
"First of all, translating the web. ",互聯網分為多種語言 
"Right now, the web is partitioned into multiple languages. ",其中一大部分係英文 如果你唔識英文 你就冇辦法接觸到互聯網 
A large fraction of it is in English. ,但同時亦有一大部分係其他語言 同樣，如果你唔識嗰啲語言 你亦無法接觸到互聯網 所以我好想可以將整個互聯網 或者至少係大部分 
"But there's large fractions in other different languages, and if you don't know them, you can't access it. ",翻譯成每一種主要語言 
"So I would like to translate all of the web, or at least most of it, into every major language. ",哩個就係我想做嘅事 
That's what I would like to do. ,但有啲人可能會問 點解唔用電腦來翻譯呢？ 
"Now, some of you may say, why can't we use computers to translate? ",既然機器翻譯已經開始出現 
Machine translation is starting to translate some sentences here and there. ,點解我哋唔用佢翻譯整個互聯網呢？ 
Why can't we use it to translate the web? ,唔， 問題在於，機器翻譯仲未夠成熟 而且哩個問題喺未來 15、20 年 亦唔一定解決到 機器翻譯出錯太多 
The problem with that is it's not yet good enough and it probably won't be for the next 15 to 20 years. ,即使佢冇出錯 但因為佢出錯太多 你好難講應唔應該信佢 
"It makes a lot of mistakes. Even when it doesn't, since it makes so many mistakes, you don't know whether to trust it or not. ",舉一個機器翻譯嘅例子 
So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine. ,哩個係一篇網上論壇嘅帖文 
"Actually, it was a forum post. ",由一位網民發表 問一個關於 Java 語言嘅問題 
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript. ,帖文由日文譯成英文 
It was translated from Japanese into English. ,你可以睇 
So I'll just let you read. ,哩個人首先為使用電腦翻譯而道歉 
This person starts apologizing for the fact that it's translated with a computer. ,下一個句子開始 
So the next sentence is going to be the preamble to the question. ,佢喺度解釋緊一啲嘢 
So he's just explaining something. ,請留意，哩個係一個 關於 Java 語言嘅問題 
"Remember, it's a question about JavaScript. ",（譯：常常，山羊時間安裝 一個錯誤係嘔吐） （笑聲） 跟著係哩個問題嘅第一個部分 
"[At often, the goat-time install a error is vomit.] (Laughter) Then comes the first part of the question. ",（譯：有幾多次好似風、柱、龍？） （笑聲） 跟住係我最鐘意嘅部分 
"[How many times like the wind, a pole, and the dragon?] (Laughter) Then comes my favorite part of the question. ",（譯：哩個對父親嘅侮辱？） （笑聲） 跟著到咗問題嘅最後部分 成件事我最鐘意嘅部分 
"[This insult to father's stones?] (Laughter) And then comes the ending, which is my favorite part of the whole thing. ",（文字：請為你嘅愚蠢道歉。 哩度有對你嘅好多感謝。） （笑聲） 所以，電腦翻譯未成熟 
"[Please apologize for your stupidity. There are a many thank you.] (Laughter) OK, so computer translation, not yet good enough. ",返返去問題 
So back to the question. ,我哋需要人來翻譯互聯網 
So we need people to translate the whole web. ,你下一個要問嘅問題可能係 點解我哋唔使錢叫人來做呢？ 
"So now the next question you may have is, well, why can't we just pay people to do this? ",我哋可以使錢請專業嘅翻譯家 來翻譯成個互聯網 
We could pay professional translators to translate the whole web. ,我哋可以咁做 
We could do that. ,但不幸嘅係，咁樣可能會非常貴 
"Unfortunately, it would be extremely expensive. ",例如，將互聯網中嘅極小極小嘅一部分 即係維基百科 翻譯成西班牙文 
"For example, translating a tiny fraction of the whole web, Wikipedia, into one other language, Spanish. ",雖然有西班牙文嘅維基百科 但相比於英文維基百科，佢嘅內容好少 大概只有英文維基百科嘅 20% 
"OK? Wikipedia exists in Spanish, but it's very small compared to the size of English. ",如果我哋想將另外嗰 80% 翻譯為西班牙文 
It's about 20 percent of the size of English. ,可能要使五千萬美元 即使係最平嘅服務外包國家 
"If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish, it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is even at the most exploited, outsourcing country out there. ",翻譯費用都會好貴 
So it would be very expensive. ,我哋想做嘅係將 1 億人聯合起來 將互聯網翻譯為任何一種主要語言 而唔使一分一毫 
"So what we want to do is, we want to get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free. ",如果哩個係你想做嘅 你好快就會發現 自己會面臨兩個幾大嘅難題 
"If this is what you want to do, you quickly realize you're going to run into two big hurdles, two big obstacles. ",第一個就係缺少雙語人才 
The first one is a lack of bilinguals. ,我甚至唔知道 係唔係有 1 億擁有足夠雙語能力嘅人 會幫我哋翻譯 
So I don't even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bilingual enough to help us translate. ,哩個係個大問題 
That's a big problem. ,另一個你會遇到嘅問題係缺少鼓勵 
The other problem you're going to run into is a lack of motivation. ,我哋點樣鼓勵人哋義務翻譯網頁呢？ 
How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the web for free? ,通常來講，你必須使錢請人來做哩啲 
"Normally, you have to pay people to do this. ",點樣能夠鼓勵人哋義務來翻譯呢？ 
So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free? ,當我哋開始諗哩啲問題嘅時候 我哋就俾哩兩個難題限住 
"When we were starting to think about this, we were blocked by these two things. ",但後來我哋發現係有辦法嘅 有一個一石二鳥嘅辦法 
"But then we realized, there's a way to solve both these problems with the same solution. ",就係將翻譯語言轉變為大家都想做嘅事 同時又消除冇雙語人才嘅問題 嗰樣就係語言教育啦 
"And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals, and that is language education. ",實際上，現時有超過 12 億人學緊外語 
"So it turns out that today, there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language. ",大家都好想學外語 
People really want to learn a foreign language. ,但唔係單單因為學校被逼咁做 因為喺美國 
And it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school. ,有超過 500 萬人喺軟件上 花費咗超過 500 美元學習一種新語言 
"In the US alone, there are over five million people who have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language. ",所以，大家真係好想學新語言 
So people really want to learn a new language. ,我哋喺過去一年半籌建嘅一個網站 叫 Duolingo Duolingo 嘅基本理念係 人哋可以免費學習一種新語言 同時義務翻譯網頁 
So what we've been working on for the last year and a half is a new website -- it's called Duolingo -- where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the web. ,簡單來講，佢哋喺度通過實踐來學習 
"And so basically, they're learning by doing. ",Duolingo 運作嘅方式係 如果你係初學者 我哋會畀非常非常簡單嘅句子你 
"So the way this works is whenever you're a just a beginner, we give you very simple sentences. ",當然網上有好多簡單嘅句子 
There's a lot of very simple sentences on the web. ,我哋畀你非常非常簡單嘅句子 同每個詞語嘅意思 
We give you very simple sentences along with what each word means. ,隨著你翻譯佢哋 加上睇其他人點樣翻譯佢哋 你就會開始學習嗰種語言 當你變得越來越進階嘅時候 
"And as you translate them and as you see how other people translate them, you start learning the language. ",我哋就會畀你更加複雜句子翻譯 
"And as you get more advanced, we give you more complex sentences to translate. ",無論幾時，你都係通過練習來學習 
"But at all times, you're learning by doing. ",哩種方法瘋狂在於佢真係會成功 
"Now, the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works. ",首先，啲人真係學緊語言 
People are really learning a language. ,我哋已經整好個網站，宜家喺度測試 
We're mostly done building it and now we're testing it. ,人哋真係可以用佢來學習語言 
People really can learn a language with it. ,學出來亦可以同其他領先嘅 語言學習軟件學出來一樣咁好 
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software. ,人哋真係可以學一門語言 唔單止學得一樣好 
So people really do learn a language. ,佢實際上亦更加有趣 
"And not only do they learn it as well, but actually it's more interesting. ",因為喺 Duolingo 啲人用現實材料來學 
"Because with Duolingo, people are learning with real content. ",相對於用教材寫嘅句子 人哋學緊真實嘅內容 從本質上就有趣好多 
"As opposed to learning with made-up sentences, people are learning with real content, which is inherently interesting. ",人哋真係學習一種語言 
So people really do learn a language. ,可能更令人驚奇嘅係 用緊哩個網站嘅人 ——即使佢哋只係初學者 所寫嘅翻譯同嗰啲專業嘅翻譯家 竟然一樣準確 等我舉個例子 
"But perhaps more surprisingly, the translations that we get from people using the site, even though they're just beginners, the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators, which is very surprising. ",哩個係一個從德文翻譯成英文嘅句子 
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English. ,上面係德文 中間係由專業譯者做嘅英文翻譯 我哋為哩個翻譯嘅每個字使咗 20 美仙 
The top is the German. The middle is an English translation that was done by a professional translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation. ,最下面嘅翻譯係由之前完全唔識德文嘅 我哋網站嘅用戶做嘅翻譯 
"And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo, none of whom knew any German before they started using the site. ",你哋可以見到，哩個翻譯係幾完美嘅 
"If you can see, it's pretty much perfect. ",當然，我哋用咗一啲方法 令哩個翻譯同專業翻譯一樣咁好 
"Of course, we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators. ",我哋集合多個用戶嘅翻譯 來得到一個專業譯者水準嘅翻譯 
We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator. ,而即使我哋綜合多個譯者 哩個網站嘅翻譯其實幾快 
"Now, even though we're combining the translations, the site actually can translate pretty fast. ",等我展示一下 哩個係估算我哋可以幾快咁將維基百科 從英文翻譯為西班牙文 
"So let me show you, this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish. ",留意，哩度有五千萬美元嘅價值 
"Remember, this is 50 million dollars' worth of value. ",如果我哋想將維基百科翻譯為西班牙文 以 10 萬活躍用戶來計 我哋可以係 5 星期內完成 
"So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish, we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users. ",以 100 萬活躍用戶來計 我哋可以喺 80 個鐘之內完成 
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users. ,既然我嘅團隊接觸嘅所有項目 都達到百萬用戶 我哋希望可以用哩個項目極快咁翻譯 
"Since all the projects my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users, we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast. ",我對 Duolingo 最為興奮嘅係 佢為語言教育提供咗 一種公平交易嘅商業模式 
"Now, the thing that I'm most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education. ",係咁樣嘅： 目前嘅語言教育模式係學生畀錢 即係學生會畀 500 美元 Rosetta Stone 
"So here's the thing: The current business model for language education is the student pays, and in particular, the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars. ",（笑聲） 哩就係目前嘅商業模式 
(Laughter) That's the current business model. ,哩種商業模式嘅問題係 95% 嘅人口連 500 美元都冇 
The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world's population doesn't have 500 dollars. ,所以佢對貧窮人口係極唔公平嘅 
So it's extremely unfair towards the poor. ,佢完全偏向富裕人口 
This is totally biased towards the rich. ,而且，因為你學緊語言嘅時候 你實際上創造緊價值—— 你翻譯緊嗰啲本來需要錢翻譯嘅嘢 哩個就係我哋貨幣化學習嘅方法 
"Now, see, in Duolingo, because while you learn, you're actually creating value, you're translating stuff -- which, for example, we could charge somebody for translations, so this is how we could monetize this. ",既然佢哋學習嘅時候創造緊價值 佢哋無需付出金錢 只需要付出佢哋嘅時間 
"Since people are creating value while they're learning, they don't have to pay with their money, they pay with their time. ",神奇在於你付出嘅時間 本來就係要來學語言嘅 所以我講 Duolingo 做嘅一件好事 就係提供咗一個公平嘅商業模式 
But the magical thing here is that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language. ,一個唔歧視貧窮嘅模式 
"So the nice thing about Duolingo is, I think, it provides a fair business model -- one that doesn't discriminate against poor people. ",Duolingo 就係哩個網站。多謝 
So here's the site. Thank you. ,（掌聲） 我哋仲未正式發佈 但係如果你去哩個網站 你可以註冊成為非公開測試版本嘅一員 測試版本可能喺未來三四個星期 就會開始 
"(Applause) We haven't yet launched, but if you go there, you can sign up to be part of our private beta, which is probably going to start in three or four weeks. ",Duolingo 仲未有得用著 
We haven't yet launched it. ,順便講一句，雖然係我喺度做哩個演講 但實際上 Duolingo 係一個出色團隊嘅產品 哩個團隊中嘅一些人今日都係哩度 
"By the way, I'm the one talking here, but Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team, some of whom are here. So thank you. ",多謝！ （掌聲） 
(Applause) ,
,我喺度想講蜘蛛有幾勁 同埋我哋可以 從呢種動物身上學幾多嘢 
I'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them. ,蜘蛛真係世界公民 
Spiders are truly global citizens. ,你差唔多可以 喺所有陸生生境上面揾到蜘蛛 
You can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat. ,呢個紅點就係北美洲大盤地 喺嗰度，我同埋我班同事 參與一個高山生物多樣性嘅研究 
"This red dot marks the Great Basin of North America, and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators. ",呢個係我哋其中一個野外考察點 畀你睇下係點嘅樣 呢！呢個藍色點係我一個同事 
"Here's one of our field sites, and just to give you a sense of perspective, this little blue smudge here, that's one of my collaborators. ",呢道雖然寸草不生 但係都有幾多蜘蛛㗎 
"This is a rugged and barren landscape, yet there are quite a few spiders here. ",翻轉嚿石頭 睇下呢隻蟹蛛同隻甲蟲玩雙撲 
Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle. ,蜘蛛唔單止周圍都係 而且仲好多種 
"Spiders are not just everywhere, but they're extremely diverse. ",有記錄嘅都超過四萬種 
"There are over 40,000 described species of spiders. ",為咗明白個數字 呢幅圖比較四萬種蜘蛛 同四百種靈長類動物 
"To put that number into perspective, here's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates. ",蜘蛛種類差唔多 係靈長類種類嘅百幾倍 
There are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates. ,蜘蛛算係好古老嘅生物 
Spiders are also extremely old. ,下面呢道，呢個係地質學嘅時標尺度 上面嘅數字代表幾百萬年前 所以零就代表今日 
"On the bottom here, this is the geologic timescale, and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present, so the zero here, that would be today. ",咁，呢個數字指出 蜘蛛可以追溯到 差唔多三億八千萬年前 
So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years. ,又咁講 呢條打直嘅紅色線 就係人類喺七百萬年前 從猿人分咗出嚟 
"To put that into perspective, this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees, a mere seven million years ago. ",所有蜘蛛喺一生之中總會吐過絲 
All spiders make silk at some point in their life. ,大部分蜘蛛會用上大量嘅絲 而且，蜘蛛絲 對蜘蛛求生同繁殖都幾重要 
"Most spiders use copious amounts of silk, and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction. ",遠古嘅蜘蛛都可以做絲 因為我哋可以從石化咗嘅蜘蛛 身上嘅吐絲頭略知一二 
"Even fossil spiders can make silk, as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider. ",所以，蜘蛛同埋蜘蛛絲 已經存在咗三億八千萬年 
So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years. ,你唔使同蜘蛛相處太耐 就可以明白到蜘蛛絲 對蜘蛛一生有幾重要 
It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life. ,蜘蛛用絲有好多原因 例如搖曳安全拖絲 包裹蜘蛛蛋以供繁殖 保護性撤退 同埋獵食 
"Spiders use silk for many purposes, including the trailing safety dragline, wrapping eggs for reproduction, protective retreats and catching prey. ",蜘蛛絲有好多種 
There are many kinds of spider silk. ,譬如，呢隻園蛛可以做 七種唔同嘅蜘蛛絲 
"For example, this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks. ",當你睇呢個環形蜘蛛網時 你其實睇緊好多種蜘蛛絲纖維 
"When you look at this orb web, you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers. ",網圈同網輻係由一種蜘蛛絲做 但螺旋捕網卻係由兩種唔同嘅蜘蛛絲： 小絲體同埋粘滴組成 
"The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk, while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks: the filament and the sticky droplet. ",蜘蛛係點樣整到咁多種蜘蛛絲呢？ 
How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk? ,要揾答案，你就要睇埋啲蜘蛛嘅吐絲頭 
"To answer that, you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider. ",蜘蛛絲從吐絲頭嗰度出嚟 對於我哋蜘蛛絲生物學家嚟講 吐絲頭就係蜘蛛嘅「生意」來源 （笑聲） 我哋用咗好長日子…… 
"So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for those of us spider silk biologists, this is what we call the ""business end"" of the spider. (Laughter) We spend long days ... ",嘻，唔好笑，我嘅生活係咁 
Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life. ,（笑聲） 我哋日以繼夜盯實蜘蛛呢部分 
(Laughter) We spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider. ,以下就係我睇到嘅嘢 
And this is what we see. ,好多纖維從吐絲頭嗰度出嚟 再深入啲睇 每個吐絲頭上面有好多個咀 
"You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets, because each spinneret has many spigots on it. ",每款絲纖維喺唔同嘅咀度噴出嚟 如果你從纖維追溯入返蜘蛛身體 你揾到嘅係 每一個咀連接住獨立嘅絲腺體 絲腺體好似一個裝住好多絲蛋白嘅囊 
"Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot, and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider, what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside. ",如果你有機會解剖圓網蜘蛛 我希望你有機會揾到 一個好靚、半透明嘅絲腺體 
"So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb-web-weaving spider, and I hope you do, what you would find is a bounty of beautiful, translucent silk glands. ",每隻蜘蛛裡面，有幾百個絲腺體 有時，甚至成千個 
"Inside each spider, there are hundreds of silk glands, sometimes thousands. ",呢啲絲腺體可以分為七類 
These can be grouped into seven categories. ,佢哋大細、外形唔同 有時顏色都唔同 
"They differ by size, shape, and sometimes even color. ",喺圓網蜘蛛裡面 你可以揾到七種絲腺體 即係我喺呢張圖描述咁 我哋從一點鐘位置開始睇 嗰啲係小管狀嘅絲腺體 負責製造卵囊體外絲 
"In an orb-web-weaving spider, you can find seven types of silk glands, and what I have depicted here in this picture, let's start at the one o'clock position, there's tubuliform silk glands, which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac. ",呢啲係聚狀絲腺同埋鞭狀絲腺 聚狀絲腺同鞭狀絲腺一齊製造 圓網蜘蛛網上面好黐嘅螺旋捕網 
There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web. ,梨渦狀絲腺製造黐固劑 即係黐住蜘蛛絲同埋基質嘅嘢 
Pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement -- that's the silk that's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate. ,葡萄串狀絲用嚟包住獵物 
"There's also aciniform silk, which is used to wrap prey. ",小壺腹狀絲用嚟起網 
Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction. ,研究得最多嘅絲： 大壺腹狀絲 
And the most studied silk line of them all: major ampullate silk. ,呢種絲用嚟做圈、輻，同搖曳安全拖絲 
"This is the silk that's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web, and also the safety trailing dragline. ",咁蜘蛛絲究竟係點㗎呢？ 
"But what, exactly, is spider silk? ",蜘蛛絲差唔多全部由蛋白質造成 
Spider silk is almost entirely protein. ,絕大部分呢啲蛋白質 都能夠由單基因家族解釋 所以，我哋今日睇到不同種類嘅蜘蛛絲 都係由單基因家族所編碼而成 因此，可以假設 原始蜘蛛祖先只係做一種絲 同埋喺過去嘅三億八千萬年 有一種蜘蛛絲基因複製咗 跟着，分開演變、專門化 同一條基因不停不停咁重複以上 最後演化出大量唔同樣嘅蜘蛛絲 
"Nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family, so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family, so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk, and over the last 380 million years, that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged, specialized, over and over and over again, to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today. ",但所有呢啲蜘蛛絲都有幾個共同點 譬如佢哋都係好長 同其他蛋白質比較，佢哋長得出奇 
"There are several features that all these silks have in common. They all have a common design, such as they're all very long -- they're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins. ",佢哋又高度重複 同埋擁有好多甘氨酸 同丙氨酸類型嘅氨基酸 
"They're very repetitive, and they're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine. ",為咗將一粒蜘蛛絲蛋白形象化 呢條係拖絲蛋白 正確啲嚟講 係黑寡婦蜘蛛吐出嚟嘅 拖絲蛋白嘅其中一部分 
"To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like, this is a dragline silk protein, it's just a portion of it, from the black widow spider. ",呢款蛋白序列，我好鐘意日日夜夜睇住 （笑聲） 你呢道睇到嘅字母係氨基酸嘅簡寫 我用綠色標示甘氨酸 紅色標示丙氨酸 你會睇到好多 G 呀同 A 呀 
"This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night. (Laughter) So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored in the glycines with green, and the alanines in red, and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's. ",同埋好多短又重複嘅序列 所以舉例嚟講 有好多多聚丙氨酸 或者寫做 A，就係 AAAAA 亦都有 GGQ，同埋有 GGY 
"You can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again, so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's, AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY. ",你想像呢啲短嘅序列組成詞語 而詞言轉過嚟又組成句子 
"You can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words, and these words occur in sentences. ",舉個例，呢道等如一句句子 綠色呢部分同埋紅色呢部分嘅 多聚丙氨酸會不斷重複 以至你會見到一條絲分子裡面 有幾何級數嘅氨基酸序列 
"So for example this would be one sentence, and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine, that repeats over and over and over again, and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule. ",同一隻蜘蛛吐嘅絲 可以有好唔同嘅重複序列 
Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences. ,喺熒光幕頂上面 你見到園金蛛嘅拖絲嘅重複單位 
"At the top of the screen, you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider. ",個重複單位好短 喺下面，呢個就係同一隻蜘蛛嘅 卵鞘或者小管狀絲蛋白嘅重複序列 你可以見到呢啲絲蛋白有幾唔同 所以，呢個就係 蜘蛛絲基因家族多元化嘅美 重複單位唔單止每個長度不一 
"It's short. And on the bottom, this is the repeat sequence for the egg case, or tubuliform silk protein, for the exact same spider. And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are -- so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family. ",佢哋嘅序列都唔同 
You can see that the repeat units differ in length. They also differ in sequence. ,而家，我再將甘氨酸填上綠色 丙氨酸填紅色 絲氨酸，即係大楷 S，填紫色 咁樣，你能夠見到 上面嗰啲重複單位 差唔多都係綠色、紅色 同埋下面嘅重複單位好多都係紫色 
"So I've colored in the glycines again in green, alanine in red, and the serines, the letter S, in purple. And you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red, and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple. ",我哋生物學家嘗試用 呢啲序列、呢啲氨基酸序列 去解釋絲纖維嘅機械特性 
"What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences, these amino acid sequences, to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers. ",蜘蛛將佢哋啲絲全部用喺身體出面 對我哋嚟講真係好方便 
"Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body. ",因為咁樣令測試蜘蛛絲超簡單 要知道，我哋喺實驗室度 係喺空氣之中測試蜘蛛絲嘅 務求同實際蜘蛛 用佢哋嘅絲蛋白環境一模一樣 
"This makes testing spider silk really, really easy to do in the laboratory, because we're actually, you know, testing it in air that's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins. ",量度蜘蛛絲特性嘅定量方法 包括有延展測試 亦即係拉痕纖維兩端，令佢好貼服咁 
"So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing, which is basically, you know, tugging on one end of the fiber, very amenable. ",呢個應力應變曲線 由測試同一隻蜘蛛製造嘅 五條纖維所產生 
Here are stress-strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider. ,喺度，你見到五種纖維有唔同特性 
So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors. ,你睇下條縱軸嗰個應力 如果你睇呢啲纖維嘅最大應力值 你就睇到真係好多變化 事實上，拖絲或者壺腹狀絲 係呢啲纖維裡面最強嘅 
"Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis, that's stress. If you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers, you can see that there's a lot of variation, and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk, is the strongest of these fibers. ",我哋諗，因為拖絲 係用嚟做蜘蛛網嘅圈同輻 所以要好強 
"We think that's because the dragline silk, which is used to make the frame and radii for a web, needs to be very strong. ",但如果你睇張力 即係纖維可以拉幾長 如果你睇著個最大數值 呢道，又係好多變化 好明顯，係鞭毛狀絲或者捕旋小絲勝出 
"On the other hand, if you were to look at strain -- this is how much a fiber can be extended -- if you look at the maximum value here, again, there's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform, or the capture spiral filament. ",實際上，鞭毛狀纖維 可以真係拉長超過一倍 
"In fact, this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length. ",所以絲纖維有唔同嘅強度 同埋唔同嘅伸展能力 
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility. ,至於螺旋捕網 佢要夠延伸力 去吸收飛行獵物嘅衝擊 
"In the case of the capture spiral, it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey. ",如果佢唔能夠延伸好多 咁當昆蟲撞埋蜘蛛網嗰陣 就會彈翻出去 
"If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then basically when an insect hit the web, it would just trampoline right off of it. ",所以如果成個蜘蛛網都係用拖絲所做 昆蟲只會成日彈入又彈出 但係，如果真係用 超級伸展嘅捕蟲螺旋絲 個網就有能力吸收衝擊、捕著獵物 
"So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really, really stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey. ",由於蜘蛛造嘅纖維當中有唔細嘅變化 
There's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make. ,所以我哋戲稱蜘蛛個肚為「工具箱」 
We call that the tool kit of a spider. ,令佢哋有足夠款式嘅纖維同環境互動 
That's what the spider has to interact with their environment. ,但係，蜘蛛種類之間嘅差異係點嘅呢？ 不如睇下唔同蜘蛛但同一種嘅絲？ 
"But how about variation among spider species, so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders? ",呢個領域大部分地方都未探討過 但係，我呢道有啲數據可以畀你睇 
This is an area that's largely unexplored but here's a little bit of data I can show you. ,呢道比較 21 種蜘蛛所吐嘅拖絲 
This is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by 21 species of spiders. ,有啲係圓網蜘蛛 有啲唔係圓網蜘蛛 
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders. ,有人曾經假設過 圓網蜘蛛好似金蛛咁擁有最韌嘅拖絲 因為佢哋一定要捕捉飛行獵物 
"It's been hypothesized that orb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here, should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey. ",呢道你睇緊嘅韌度圖 圖上面黑點越高，代表越韌 
"What you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph, the higher the toughness. ",呢道幅進化樹圖係說明 21 種蜘蛛基因關係 我填咗圓網蜘蛛黃色 
"The 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows their genetic relationships, and I've colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders. ",而兩個紅箭咀就指向 新婦蛛同埋十字園蛛嘅韌度值 
"If you look right here at the two red arrows, they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus. ",講開新婦蛛同埋十字園蛛 合成蜘蛛絲嘅研究嘅大部分時間同金錢 都用喺複製呢兩種蜘蛛嘅拖絲蛋白 
These are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins. ,但係，佢哋嘅拖絲唔係最韌嘅 
"Yet, their draglines are not the toughest. ",事實上，呢個調查發現最韌嘅拖絲 係白色呢部分，一種圓網蜘蛛造嘅拖絲 
"In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region, a non orb-web-weaving spider. ",呢條拖線由花皮蛛所吐 
"This is the dragline spun by scytodes, the spitting spider. ",花皮蛛根本唔用網嚟捕獵 而係潜伏一旁 等待獵物慢慢走近自己 然後噴啲好似絲嘅毒液落昆蟲度 
"Scytodes doesn't use a web at all to catch prey. Instead, scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect. ",令獵物唔郁得 花皮蜘蛛就係用絲線捕獵 
Think of hunting with silly string. ,我哋唔知點解花皮蛛需要咁韌嘅拖絲 但就係好似呢啲不尋常發現 令生物勘探咁刺激同有價值 
"We don't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline, but it's unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile. ",不尋常發現幫我哋衝破想像嘅限制 
It frees us from the constraints of our imagination. ,而家，我準備標上 尼龍纖維、蠶蟲絲 羊毛、克維拉 同埋炭纖維嘅韌值 
"Now I'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber, bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk -- wool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers. ",你可以見到 差唔多所有蜘蛛嘅拖絲都比以上物料韌 
And what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them. ,蜘蛛絲之所以咁特別 同吸引仿生學家注意 係因為佢柔合強度、伸展度，同埋韌度 亦因為咁，人類轉向 從大自然尋找解决方法 
"It's the combination of strength, extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special, and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists, so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions. ",蜘蛛絲嘅強度、伸展度，同埋韌度 加上蜘蛛絲唔會引致免疫反應嘅特點 令到蜘蛛絲應用喺生物醫學上相當吸引 例如，作為人造肌腱嘅物料 用於引導神經再生 同作為組織生長嘅支架 
"And the strength, extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response, have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications, for example, as a component of artificial tendons, for serving as guides to regrow nerves, and for scaffolds for tissue growth. ",蜘蛛絲嘅防彈特性亦都非常有應用潛力 
Spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities. ,蜘蛛絲可以用於盔甲同裝備保護上 令佢哋更輕、更柔韌 
Silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today. ,蜘蛛絲除咗有仿生學應用價值之外 蜘蛛絲仲會令人陶醉 
"In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks, personally, I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself. ",我好鍾意當我喺實驗室嗰時 有一條新嘅蜘蛛絲序列送入嚟 
"I love when I'm in the laboratory, a new spider silk sequence comes in. ",呢樣嘢係最正嘅 （笑聲） 我覺得，蜘蛛好似 同我分享緊一個遠古秘密 所以我會用我嘅餘生研究蜘蛛絲 
"That's just the best. (Laughter) It's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me, and that's why I'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk. ",下次，當你見到蜘蛛網時 唔該，停一停 睇埋啲一種人類已知最高性能嘅材料 
"The next time you see a spider web, please, pause and look a little closer. ",借用文學嘅一句話 一隻叫夏洛特嘅蜘蛛話︰ 「蜘蛛絲係偉大嘅。」 多謝 （鼓掌） 
"To borrow from the writings of a spider named Charlotte, silk is terrific. ",（鼓掌） 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) ,
,好多好多年前 我就以阿富汗為終點開始旅行 旅程由我嘅國家 波蘭嘅東邊界開始 
"My travels to Afghanistan began many, many years ago on the eastern border of my country, my homeland, Poland. ",我行過 嫲嫲故仔入邊嘅森林 
I was walking through the forests of my grandmother's tales. ,個森林周圍都係墓地 墓地背後，代表 20 世紀 成千上萬嘅人 被放逐或殺害 
"A land where every field hides a grave, where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century. ",但係喺生靈塗炭之外 我發現咗一片温暖嘅土地 
"Behind the destruction, I found a soul of places. ",我遇到謙遜嘅人 
I met humble people. ,我聽到佢哋祈禱 我食佢哋食嘅麵包 
I heard their prayer and ate their bread. ,從東歐到中亞 我行咗 20 年 我穿過高加索山脈 行過咗中東 北非 同俄羅斯 
"Then I have been walking East for 20 years -- from Eastern Europe to Central Asia -- through the Caucasus Mountains, Middle East, North Africa, Russia. ",喺呢啲地方我仲遇到更加多謙遜嘅人 
And I ever met more humble people. ,我食佢哋嘅麵包，聽佢哋祈禱 
And I shared their bread and their prayer. ,依個就係我去阿富汗嘅原因 
This is why I went to Afghanistan. ,有一日，我行過 奧克蘇斯河上條橋 
"One day, I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River. ",我獨自一人行 
I was alone on foot. ,個阿富汗士兵見到我嘅時候都好驚訝 甚至唔記得喺我嘅護照上蓋章 
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport. ,但係佢哋畀咗杯茶我 
But he gave me a cup of tea. ,我覺得 佢嘅驚訝反而保護咗我 
And I understood that his surprise was my protection. ,由阿富汗接壤伊朗邊境 到阿富汗嘅瓦罕走廊 我騎過馬 撐過艇，搭過順風車 
"So I have been walking and traveling, by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking, from Iran's border to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor. ",通過依種方式 我發現咗阿富汗神秘嘅一面 
"And in this way I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan. ",我僅有嘅物件 就係本筆記簿同部相機 
My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica. ,我聽到伊斯蘭教蘇菲派祈禱 蘇菲派係一班謙遜嘅穆斯林 但係塔利班分子好憎佢哋 
"I heard prayers of the Sufi -- humble Muslims, hated by the Taliban. ",仲有不為人知嘅河流 從直布羅陀到印度 扯上好多神秘嘅嘢 
"Hidden river, interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India. ",喺清真寺，信徒 會以淚水祝福 恭敬嘅外國人 而且會當係寶咁歡迎佢哋 
"The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears, and welcomed as a gift. ",關於依個國家同人民 我哋知道幾多？ 我哋只係假扮保護佢哋 我哋又有幾瞭解啲鄉鎮？ 嗰度唯一嘅止痛藥 唯一止餓嘅食物 係鴉片 
"What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect, about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium? ",依班身處喀布爾屋頂上嘅人 係戰爭 10 年後 染上鴉片癮 
These are opium-addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war. ,依啲係遊牧民族嘅女仔 佢哋成為咗阿富汗商人嘅性工具 
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen. ,戰爭 10 年後 我哋對呢度嘅女性瞭解幾多？ 
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war? ,佢哋身上套住個中國造嘅 尼龍袋 係所謂嘅穆斯林傳統波卡服裝 
"Clothed in this nylon bag, made in China, with the name of burqa. ",有一日 我見到阿富汗最大嘅學校 係間女校 
"I saw one day, the largest school in Afghanistan, a girls' school. ",有一萬三千個女仔 喺依度返學 佢哋喺地牢一間房上堂 入邊周圍滿佈蝎子 
"13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground, full of scorpions. ",但係佢哋對學習嘅熱愛 令我熱淚盈眶 
And their love [for studying] was so big that I cried. ,我哋又知道幾多 嗰啲夠膽送自己個女去返學嘅家長 受到幾多 阿富汗恐怖分子嘅死亡恐嚇？ 
What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh? ,依個地區好危險，周圍都係塔利班份子 但係啲女仔都讀到書 
"The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban, and they did it. ",我想幫啲無辦法出聲嘅人 講出佢哋嘅故仔 向外界展示佢哋不為人知嘅一面 展示喺依場遊戲嘅帷幕後邊 被媒體、全世界 所遺忘嘅小小世界 
"My aim is to give a voice to the silent people, to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game, the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict. ",多謝 
Thanks. ,（掌聲） 
(Applause) ,
,我喺呢度同大家討論 大自然嘅無形性經濟 
I'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature. ,但壞消息係 大自然嘅後勤部門其實未運作 所以仲未出發票 
"The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet, so those invoices don't get issued. ",但我哋需要處理呢個問題 
But we need to do something about this problem. ,我一出嚟就從事市場專業 一直都冇改 不過最近我大部分精力都投放到 研究人類開採返嚟嘅自然資源嘅價值 但佢哋仍然未有所謂嘅價錢牌 
"I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest, but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature, and which doesn't get priced by the markets. ",一個名為 TEEB 嘅計劃喺 2007 年開始 由一班 G8+5 嘅環保官員成立 
"A project called TEEB was started in 2007, and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G8+5. ",佢哋嘅理念 源自斯特恩勳爵嘅苛刻見解 
And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern. ,佢哋問咗自己一個問題： 如果經濟可以說服到人 及早對抗氣候變化 咁點解唔可以說服人類做保育？ 
"They asked themselves a question: If economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change, well why can't the same be done for conservation? ",點解同一道理唔可以套用到大自然呢？ 
Why can't an equivalent case be made for nature? ,而答案係：無錯，可以 
"And the answer is: Yeah, it can. ",但並唔係咁直接 
But it's not that straightforward. ,生物多樣性係地球上活生生嘅結構 而並非死沉沉嘅氣體 
"Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas. ",佢存在嘅層面有 生態系統、物種同基因 規模又以國際、國內、本地、社區計 斯特恩勳爵同佢嘅團隊 為自然界付出嘅努力殊不簡單 
"It exists in many layers, ecosystems, species and genes across many scales -- international, national, local, community -- and doing for nature what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy. ",而我哋開始咗第一步 
"And yet, we began. ",個計劃由一份中期報告開始 喺短時間之內綜合咗 大量由研究員搜集返嚟 關於呢個課題嘅資料 
"We began the project with an interim report, which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many, many researchers. ",而喺我哋編輯嘅結果之中 有一個驚人嘅發現 就係其實我哋損失緊自然資源 即係從大自然畀我哋嘅恩賜縮細緊 
"And amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that, in fact, we were losing natural capital -- the benefits that flow from nature to us. ",原來我哋以驚人嘅速度消耗嘅自然資源 價值高達 2 至 4 萬億美元 
"We were losing it at an extraordinary rate -- in fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth of natural capital. ",報告喺 2008 年發表 亦即係金融海嘯嘅時候 當時市場已經虧損達 2.5 萬億美元 
"This came out in 2008, which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars. ",自然資源損耗嘅規模亦達到同一規模 
So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss. ,於是我哋開始 為國際社會 為各個政府 為本地政府同商界 為全球人類，為你同我 喺去年喺聯合國 針對大自然嘅無形性經濟同解決方法 發表咗呢堆報告 
"We then have gone on since to present for [the] international community, for governments, for local governments and for business and for people, for you and me, a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year, which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it. ",究竟係咩呢？ 
What is this about? ,一幅大家好熟悉嘅圖片 亞馬遜雨林 
A picture that you're familiar with -- the Amazon rainforests. ,佢係一個巨大嘅碳庫存 一個擁有生物多樣性嘅庫存 但好多人都唔知 佢亦係一個雨水工廠 
"It's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity, but what people don't really know is this also is a rain factory. ",因為當東北信風橫過亞馬遜嘅時候 會有效咁收集水氣 
"Because the northeastern trade winds, as they go over the Amazonas, effectively gather the water vapor. ",每日大約二百億噸水氣被東北信風吸走 慢慢冷卻成雨水 落到拉普拉塔河盆 
"Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds, and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin. ","呢個降雨循環、呢個雨水工廠 有效咁孕育著 一個價值達 2,400 千億美元 位處拉丁美洲嘅農業經濟 "
"This rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory, effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth in Latin America. ",但有一個問題 究竟烏拉圭、巴拉圭、阿根廷 仲有巴西嘅馬托格羅索州 為呢個咁重要嘅經濟來源 或者為亞馬遜生產雨水畀咗幾多錢呢？ 
"But the question arises: Okay, so how much do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall? ",答案係冇 係零 
"And the answer is zilch, exactly zero. ",呢個就係大自然嘅無形性經濟 
That's the economic invisibility of nature. ,呢個情況唔可以持續落去 因為經濟誘因同經濟不利因素好強大 
"That can't keep going on, because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful. ",經濟已經成為政策嘅籌碼 
Economics has become the currency of policy. ,除非我哋正視呢個無形性經濟 否則我哋會面對一如所料嘅後果 目送珍貴嘅天然財產逐漸惡化同消失 
"And unless we address this invisibility, we are going to get the results that we are seeing, which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset. ",呢個唔單止關係到亞馬遜同雨林 
"It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests. ",無論邊個層面 無論係生態系統、物種定係基因層面 呢個問題都係存在 
"No matter what level you look at, whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level, we see the same problem again and again. ",雨林嘅雨水循環同水調節 係屬於生態系統層 
So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level. ,"喺物種層 有人估計過昆蟲傳播花粉 蜜蜂為果實授粉等等 價值約為 1,900 億美元 "
"At the species level, it's been estimated that insect-based pollination, bees pollinating fruit and so on, is something like 190 billion dollars-worth. ",呢個差不多相當於 全球總農產量百分之 8 
That's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally. ,但我哋完全忽略咗呢點 
It completely passes below the radar screen. ,但蜜蜂幾時有開過張發票畀我哋？ 
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice? ,或者，從基因層面睇嘅話 六成藥物都係從雨林或暗礁中提煉出嚟 
"Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level, 60 percent of medicines were prospected, were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef. ",同樣人類唔洗一分一毫就得到 
"Once again, most of that doesn't get paid. ",呢樣帶我去問題嘅另一面 就係應該邊個收錢？ 
"And that brings me to another aspect of this, which is, to whom should this get paid? ",呢啲基因物質如果屬於任何人嘅話 大概屬於貧窮社區嘅人 佢哋嘅知識幫研究員搵到化學分子 令化學分子最終成為藥物 
"That genetic material probably belonged, if it could belong to anyone, to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule, which then became the medicine. ",但現實佢哋一無所得 
They were the ones that didn't get paid. ,如果你睇下物種層次 你見到魚類 
"And if you look at the species level, you saw about fish. ",今日，海洋漁產嘅損耗非常顯著 迅速危及窮人、漁民嘅生計 
"Today, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor, the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods, to feed their families. ",全球大約 10 億人依賴海裏邊嘅魚為生 
"Something like a billion people depend on fish, the quantity of fish in the oceans. ",10 億人依賴魚類 作為動物蛋白質嘅主要來源 
A billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein. ,目前魚類損耗速度係一個巨大嘅人禍 會造成一個前所未有嘅健康問題 
"And at this rate at which we are losing fish, it is a human problem of enormous dimensions, a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before. ",最後，喺生態系統層面 無論講緊樹林嘅防洪或者防旱功能 以至貧困嘅農民外出收集枯枝落葉 供家畜家畜用 或者佢哋嘅妻子去樹林執柴 到最後窮人係最依賴生態系統嘅一班人 
"And finally, at the ecosystem level, whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests, or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats, or whether it's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest, it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services. ",我哋研究估計 喺巴西、印度、印尼等國家 縱使生態系統服務 呢類從大自然免費流到人類嘅資源 或者佔國內生產總值百分比唔多 由百分之 2 到 15 不等 但係如果呢啲國家計埋大自然資源 對貧窮人口嘅價值 得出嘅數字係佔國內生產總值 百分之 45、75 甚至 90 
"We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia, even though ecosystem services -- these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free -- they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP -- two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent -- but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor, the answers are more like 45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent. ",差異就係呢度 
That's the difference. ,因為佢哋對貧窮嘅人嚟講好重要 
Because these are important benefits for the poor. ,如果你破壞呢個珍貴資源 亦即係生態系統 或者任由佢惡化 你就唔可以指望有正常嘅發展模式 
"And you can't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset, the most important asset, which is your development asset, that is ecological infrastructure. ",情況將會有幾壞？ 
How bad can things get? ,呢度有張叫做平均物種豐度度嘅圖片 
Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance. ,基本上量度老虎、蟾蜍、壁蝨 諸如此類嘅數量 又或者計唔同物種嘅生物質 
"It's basically a measure of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around. ",綠色部分代表百分比 
The green represents the percentage. ,先睇綠色嘅話 呢度大概有百分之 80 至 100 
"If you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent. ",再睇黃色，就有百分之 40 至 60 
"If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent. ",呢個係對比原有數量嘅百分比 即係工業化前，1750年 
"And these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak, the pre-industrial era, 1750. ",而家我會畀大家睇 目前情況不變會造成咩後果 
Now I'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this. ,只需要留意印度、中國、歐洲 同非洲撒哈拉以南嘅顏色改變 我哋以不可持續嘅速度消耗全球生物質 
"And just watch the change in colors in India, China, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us. ",再睇 
See that again. ,僅存綠色嘅地方，好遺憾 只係類似戈壁沙漠嘅地方 譬如苔原同撒哈拉 
"The only places that remain green -- and that's not good news -- is, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert, like the tundra and like the Sahara. ",不過無用，因為呢啲地方物種好少 生物量又唔多 
But that doesn't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place. ,呢個就係挑戰所在 
This is the challenge. ,之所以有轉變，歸根究底 我認為係一個基本問題 我哋忽視咗公共利益同私人利益嘅差別 
"The reason this is happening boils down, in my mind, to one basic problem, which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits. ",我哋一向漠視公共財富 純粹因為大家覺得係公共嘅 所以就冇理 
"We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth, it's common goods. ","泰國有一個例子 由於嗰度紅樹林價值唔高 以佢哋九年生命大概值 600 美元 相比作為養蝦場嘅價值 約莫係 9,600 美元 啲人就將紅樹林改為養蝦場 紅樹林就係咁逐漸絕跡 "
"And here's an example from Thailand where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much -- it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured -- compared to its value as a shrimp farm, which is more like $9,600, there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms. ","如果仔細睇下得出嚟 嗰 9,000 美元嘅獲利 當中接近 8,000 美元其實都係補貼 "
"But of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are, almost 8,000 of those dollars are, in fact, subsidies. ","所以權衡利弊嘅時候 就會發現實際利潤分別係 1,200 美元同 600 美元 "
"So you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600. ",咁樣唔難明白 
That's not that hard. ,另外 如果計算將養蝦場嘅土地恢復生產用途 代價將會係幾多？ 
"But on the other hand, if you start measuring, how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use? ","一旦土地裏邊嘅鹽同化學起咗作用 恢復成本大概係 12,000 美元 "
"Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects, that answer is more like $12,000 of cost. ","但保留紅樹林嘅好處 包括抵禦風暴、颱風同為窮人提供漁獲 價值有成 11,000 美元 "
"And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries, that provide fish for the poor, that answer is more like $11,000. ",試下從另一角度去睇 
So now look at the different lens. ,如果從公共財富出發 而非私人利益 我哋會得到一個好唔同嘅答案︰ 就係好明顯，保育比破壞更加合理 
"If you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits, you get a completely different answer, which is clearly conservation makes more sense, and not destruction. ",但呢個係咪只係泰國南部嘅情況？ 
So is this just a story from South Thailand? ,唔係，呢個係全世界嘅狀況 
"Sorry, this is a global story. ",以同一條數計…… 過去十年有一個組織 TRUCOST 以同一條數計 
"And here's what the same calculation looks like, which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years -- by a group called TRUCOST. ","佢哋為最頂尖 3,000 家公司 計經濟外部性 "
"And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations, what are the externalities? ",換句話說 如果照正常營商，成本係幾多？ 
"In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual? ",呢度唔係指非法勾當 而係講一般營商會排放氣體、改變氣候 
"This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual, which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost. ",因此一般營商會附帶著經濟成本 一般營商會放出污染物 所以附帶著經濟成本、健康成本等等 
"It causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost, health cost and so on. ",至於淡水利用 
Use of freshwater. ,如果你喺鄉村耕地旁邊 鑽鑿水源去煉焦炭 雖然無違法，但的確賠上社區 
"If you drill water to make coke near a village farm, that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community. ",我哋可以阻止嗎？點樣阻止？ 
"Can we stop this, and how? ",我認為第一件事係需要認識自然資源 
I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital. ,簡單講生物就係自然資源 我哋需要認識自然資源 同埋將佢擺入我哋嘅模式入面 
"Basically the stuff of life is natural capital, and we need to recognize and build that into our systems. ",當量度國民生產總值 呢個作為國家經濟表現嘅指標時 我哋並無包括最珍貴嘅自然界資源 
"When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level, we don't include our biggest asset at the country level. ",當我哋睇公司業績 我哋亦無包括公司對大自然嘅影響 以及營商帶嚟嘅社會代價 
"When we measure corporate performances, we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society. ",咁嘅計算方法一定要停用 
That has to stop. ,呢個亦係我目前最有興趣嘅嘢 
"In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase. ",之前我搞咗一個綠色審計計劃 
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project. ,大約喺 2000 年代初 當時印度一心想 令國內生產總值呯呯聲咁上 藉此推動發展 同時眼看著中國 有百分之 8 至 10 嘅增長 佢哋問，點解我哋做唔到？ 
"That was in the early 2000s when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth as the means forward -- looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent and wondering, why can we do the same? ",我同幾個朋友都覺得成件事唔合理 
And a few friends of mine and I decided this doesn't make sense. ,認為追上國內生產總值 只會為社會帶嚟更多代價同損失 
This is going to create more cost to society and more losses. ,於是我哋決定做大規模審計 為印度同佢各個邦做綠色審計 
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states. ,我嘅興趣就係咁樣開始 後來演變成 TEEB 計劃 
That's how my interests began and went to the TEEB project. ,終於，可以喺國家層面 審計呢種綠色帳單！ 
"Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun. ",而世界銀行亦確認咗呢個計畫 開展名為 WAVES 嘅計劃 全名叫生態系統價值審計及估值計劃 
And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they've started a project called WAVES -- Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services. ,但審計生態層對上嘅商界層面都重要嘅 
"But calculating this at the next level, that means at the business sector level, is important. ",事實上我哋亦都喺 TEEB 計劃裏邊做過 
And actually we've done this with the TEEB project. ,我哋做咗一個好棘手嘅個案︰ 中國嘅伐林問題 
"We've done this for a very difficult case, which was for deforestation in China. ",呢個問題係重要嘅 因為中國喺 1997 年 黃河足足乾涸咗九個月 造成農業嚴重損失 對社會帶嚟損失同禍害 
"This is important, because in China in 1997, the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society. ","一年後長江泛濫 造成差唔多 5,500 人死亡 "
"Just a year later the Yangtze flooded, causing something like 5,500 deaths. ",好明顯，伐林就係問題根源 
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation. ,伐林好大程度上同建造業有關 
It was associated largely with the construction industry. ,之後中國政府明智作出回應 禁止咗砍伐林木 
And the Chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling. ,回顧 40 年 如果當初我哋有計埋呢啲大自然成本 包括表土流失、水道乾涸 同生產力損失 因為上述原因以及伐木等等 對本地社區造成嘅損失 呢啲成本幾乎係 木材市價嘅兩倍 
"A retrospective on 40 years shows that if we had accounted for these costs -- the cost of loss of topsoil, the cost of loss of waterways, the lost productivity, the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors, desertification and so on -- those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber. ",北京市場上嘅木材價格 理應因此上漲到三倍 以反映中國社會付出嘅天然代價 
"So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within China. ",當然，經一事長一智 
"Of course, after the event one can be wise. ",應對嘅辦法就係喺公司嘅層面做 並且由公司帶頭做起 盡可能為包含自然成本嘅界別審計 同埋披露當中嘅自然成本 
"The way to do this is to do it on a company basis, to take leadership forward, and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost, and to disclose these answers. ",有人曾經問我 若果考慮對印尼雨林嘅影響 聯合利華定係寶潔比較傷害低？ 
"Someone once asked me, ""Who is better or worse, is it Unilever or is it P&amp;G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"" ",我唔識答，因為呢兩家公司雖然好專業 但都無計算或披露過經濟外部性 
"And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies, good though they are and professional though they are, do not calculate or disclose their externalities. ",如果我哋睇下彪馬等嘅公司 佢哋嘅行政總裁兼董事長 Jochen Zeitz 曾經喺一個活動同我講 佢會比我更加早落實個計劃 
"But if we look at companies like PUMA -- Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman, once challenged me at a function, saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it. ",我哋大概同期落實咗個計劃 而佢真係有做 
"Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it. ",佢基本上為彪馬計算自然成本 
He's basically worked the cost to PUMA. ,"彪馬有 27 億美元營業額 有 3 億美元利潤 除稅後有 2 億美元 同埋有 9,400 萬美元 經濟外部性同營商成本 "
"PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover, 300 million dollars of profits, 200 million dollars after tax, 94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business. ",情况雖然不利 但佢哋有信心同勇氣講︰ 「我哋計緊呢樣嘢呀， 
"Now that's not a happy situation for them, but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say, ""Here's what we are measuring. ",因為我哋深知， 唔去計永遠都管理唔到。」 
"We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure."" ",呢個例子，可以作為大家示範 
"That's an example, I think, for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from. ",亦令我哋感到安慰 如果更多公司都願意做 如果更多界別參與 分析員、企業分析員 好似我哋咁嘅人、消費者 或者非牟利組織 去審視同比較企業嘅社會表現 
"If more companies did this, and if more sectors engaged this as sectors, you could have analysts, business analysts, and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies. ",雖然未成事，但已經有例可循 
"Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out. ",係可以做到嘅！ 
This can be done. ,我好慶幸英國特許會計師公會 
And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K. ,已經成立一個國際聯盟進行計算工作 
"has already set up a coalition to do this, an international coalition. ",另一個我喜歡嘅方法 就係創造綠色碳市場 
"The other favorite, if you like, solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets. ",講開又講，我真係好鐘意 經濟外部性嘅計數同綠色碳市場 
"And by the way, these are my favorites -- externalities calculation and green carbon markets. ",TEEB 有超過 12 組不同方案 包括評估保護區、為生態系統服務結算 同埋生態驗證 
"TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites. ",而上述呢三樣係我最鐘意嘅 咁咩係綠色碳？ 
What's green carbon? ,而家我哋有嘅係啡色碳市場 
Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace. ,呢個市場不斷排放二氧化碳 
It's about energy emissions. ,歐盟排放交易體系就係其中主要市場 
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace. ,由於發行過度，呢個體系表現唔理想 
It's not doing too well. We've over-issued. ,有啲似通脹：你大量發鈔 然後一如所料，價格下降 
"A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency, you get what you see, declining prices. ",呢啲全都同能源、工業有關 
But that's all about energy and industry. ,但我哋忽略咗其他排放 例如黑色碳，即係煤煙 
"But what we're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon, that is soot. ",我哋亦忽略咗藍色碳 即係最大嘅碳庫存 佔總碳庫存超過百分之 55 
"What we're also missing is blue carbon, which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon -- more than 55 percent. ",所謂藍色碳 係指海洋同大氣層之間嘅流動 好欣慰，藍色碳差不多係收支平衡 
"Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa, is more or less balanced. ",事實上，海洋吸收嘅 大約係我哋排放嘅四分一 吸收會導致海洋酸化 或者鹼度下降 
"In fact, what's being absorbed is something like 25 percent of our emissions, which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans. ",我哋稍後再講 
More of that in a minute. ,最後，綠色碳指砍伐樹林 仲有係來自農業嘅甲烷排放 
"And finally, there's deforestation, and there's emission of methane from agriculture. ",綠色碳加埋藍色碳 合共佔我哋排放嘅四分一 
"Green carbon, which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions, and blue carbon together comprise 25 percent of our emissions. ",我哋其實已經有方法 就係透過一個 REDD Plus 嘅結構 或者機制 減少因伐林同林地惡化而造成碳排放 
"We have the means already in our hands, through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus -- a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. ",挪威為咗推行 Red Plus 計劃 已分別投放 10 億元落印尼同巴西 
And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme. ,進展係有 
So we actually have some movement forward. ,但仍然要花好多工夫 
But the thing is to do a lot more of that. ,咁問題解決到嗎？經濟可以解決到嗎？ 
Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything? ,未必 
Well I'm afraid not. ,因為仲有海洋、珊瑚礁 
"There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs. ",你哋睇睇 佢哋遍佈全球 由密克羅西尼亞 一直到印尼、馬來西亞 印度、馬達加斯加 到加勒比海西面 
"As you can see, they cut across the entire globe all the way from Micronesia across Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar and to the West of the Caribbean. ",呢啲紅點、紅色區域 基本上為過五億人口提供糧食同生計 
"These red dots, these red areas, basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people. ",即係大概佔全球八分一人口 
So that's almost an eighth of society. ,不幸嘅係，珊瑚礁消失緊 而科學家指出 大氣中嘅二氧化碳 只要超過百萬分之 350 珊瑚礁就會有生存危險 我哋唔單止危害到 整個珊瑚物種、溫水珊瑚 同埋海洋四分一魚類 仲危及超過五億人嘅生命同生計 呢五億人身處發展中嘅貧窮國家 
"And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost -- and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs -- we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species, the warm water corals, we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans, but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than 500 million people who live in the developing world in poor countries. ",因此喺氣候和談裏邊 限制二氧化碳喺百萬分之 450 同埋限制氣温上升兩度 都似乎係合乎道德嘅 
"So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations, what we have done is we've made an ethical choice. ",而我哋社會亦似乎經過道德思考 選擇放棄珊瑚礁 
We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs. ,但我想喺完結前講 放棄珊瑚礁呢件事我哋或者已經做咗 
Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that. ,但大家諗下後果 所以請大家唔好繼續咁做 
"Let's think about it and what it means, but please, let's not do more of that. ",因為我哋擁有嘅生態建設 同自然資本就得咁多 
Because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital. ,我哋唔可再負擔合乎道德嘅錯 
I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices. ,多謝各位 
Thank you. ,（掌聲） 
(Applause) ,
,我過去 10 年 飽受痛苦同屈辱 就係為咗： 自我提升 
"I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation, hopefully for a good cause, which is self-improvement. ",我從三方面入手 
And I've done this in three parts. ,首先係由智慧入手 
So first I started with the mind. ,我決定由字母 A 到 Z 睇晒大英百科全書 嚟令自己聰明啲 準確啲嚟講 係由 a-ak 到 Zywiec 睇晒 
"And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z -- or, more precisely, from ""a-ak"" to ""Zywiec."" ",依張相係全個系列嘅圖書 
And here's a little image of that. ,可以話，嗰年係好精彩嘅一年 
And this was an amazing year. ,亦係好有趣嘅經歷 
It was really a fascinating journey. ,不過都有痛苦嘅時候 特別係對我身邊嘅人 
"It was painful at times, especially for those around me. ",每次如果我傾計時講咗無關嘅嘢 我老婆就會罰我 1 美金 
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation. ,所以依個方法有缺點 
So it had its downsides. ,不過之後 我決定要提升我嘅精神水平 
"But after that, I decided to work on the spirit. ",上年我講過 我一直都無信仰 
"As I mentioned last year, I grew up with no religion at all. ",我係猶太人 但就同橄欖花園係美國一間 賣意大利菜嘅餐廳一樣搞笑 
"I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. ",（笑聲） 其實唔係 
(Laughter) Not really. ,我決定要通過親身經歷 嚟學習《聖經》 同埋我嘅民族歷史 
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it. ,我跟足《聖經》同《十誡》 入邊所有嘅規矩 
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible. ,譬如話留鬚 因為《利未記》提到唔畀剃鬚 
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave. ,依個就係我留咗一年鬚嘅樣啦 
So this is what I looked like by the end. ,多謝你哋嘅反應 
Thank you for that reaction. ,（笑聲） 我望落有啲似摩西 或者 Ted Kaczynski 
"(Laughter) I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski. ",兩個都有啲似啦 
I got both of them. ,剪過之後就咁嘅樣 
So there was the topiary there. ,仲有隻綿羊 
And there's the sheep. ,喺三部曲嘅最後一部裏邊 我想將重點放喺身體 我嘗試活得健康、成為最健康嘅人 
"Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be, the healthiest person alive. ",所以我過去幾年就係做緊依啲嘢 
So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years. ,而前幾個月我先啱啱完成依啲嘢 
And I just finished a couple of months ago. ,我想講：感謝上帝！ 
"And I have to say, thank God. ",因為咁健康生活真係好攞命 
Because living so healthily was killing me. ,（笑聲） 真係好難頂 因為你要做好多好多嘢 多到難以置信 
"(Laughter) It was so overwhelming, because the amount of things you have to do, it's just mind-boggling. ",我聽過所有專家嘅意見 仲同過好多醫學專家傾過計 
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers. ,佢哋個個都話我知我要做嘅嘢 
And they were telling me all the things I had to do. ,包括要正確飲食 做運動、冥想同埋養狗 因為呢啲都可以降血壓 
"I had to eat right, exercise, meditate, pet dogs, because that lowers the blood pressure. ","我又喺跑步機上邊邊跑邊寫書 結果用咗我大概跑 1,000 英里嘅時間 嚟寫一本書 "
"I wrote the book on a treadmill, and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book. ",我仲要搽太陽油 
I had to put on sunscreen. ,搽太陽油係好大工程嚟 因為如果你聽皮膚科醫生嘅話 你需要搽一個細酒杯嘅份量 
"This was no small feat, because if you listen to dermatologists, they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen. ",而且每四個鐘就要補搽一次 
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours. ,我估有一半寫書嘅時間用咗嚟搽太陽油 
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen. ,於是我變成一隻搽咗油嘅冬甩 有成差唔多一年 
I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year. ,然後到洗手 
There was the washing of hands. ,我要好認真咁洗 
I had to do that properly. ,而且我個免疫醫生話 要抹乾淨屋企所有遙控同手機 因為佢哋都係細菌嘅樂園 
"And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house, because those are just orgies of germs. ",又一次用咗我好多時間 
So that took a lot of time. ,我仲開始用萬事安全嘅心態生活 因為咁樣生活先至健康 
"I also tried to be the safest person I could be, because that's a part of health. ",丹麥安全局推廣一個運動 
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council. ,倡議「行路戴頭盔係好事」 
"They started a public campaign that says, ""A walking helmet is a good helmet."" ",佢哋認為唔單止踩單車嘅時候要戴頭盔 行路嘅時候都要 
"So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking, but also for walking around. ",你哋睇下 佢哋行街都戴頭盔 
And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets. ,（笑聲） 係呀，我都跟住做 
"(Laughter) Well yeah, I tried that. ",我承認我係有啲極端 
"Now it's a little extreme, I admit. ",但係如果你諗諗 正如魔鬼經濟學嘅作家所寫 如果以每公里計 飲醉酒跌死嘅人多過醉酒駕駛死嘅人 
"But if you think about this, this is actually -- the ""Freakonomics"" authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving. ",如果你飲咗酒 咁你今晚要諗下喇 
So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. ,我最終都完成咗呢三部曲 而亦可以話係成功嘅 
"So I finished, and it was a success in a sense. ",所有健康指標都朝住正確嘅方向發展 
All of the markers went in the right direction. ,我嘅膽固醇降低咗，體重減少咗 我老婆唔再話我肥 
"My cholesterol went down, I lost weight, my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant. ",所以幾好 
So that was nice. ,總體嚟講幾成功 
And it was successful overall. ,我都意識到我太健康喇 
"But I also learned that I was too healthy, and that was unhealthy. ",但咁樣其實唔健康 因為太專注做健康嘅嘢 令我忽略咗我嘅屋企人同朋友 
I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family. ,正如 Dan Buettner 話 一個強大嘅社交網絡 對我哋嘅健康非常重要 
"And as Dan Buettner can tell you, having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. ",最後我完成咗依個健康計劃 
So I finished. ,不過健康計劃結束之後嘅一個禮拜 我停曬所有健康習慣 
And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over. ,做返以前嘅自己，放縱自己 
"I went to the dark side, and I just indulged myself. ",好啲似羅馬帝國卡利古拉暴君一樣 
It was like something out of Caligula. ,（笑聲） 不過唔包括性方面 
(Laughter) Without the sex part. ,因為我屋企有三個小朋友 所以唔會喺性方面放縱 
"Because I have three young kids, so that wasn't happening. ",不過我絕對有暴飲暴食 
"But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely. ",但最後我做返健康嘅嘢 
And I finally have stabilized. ,宜家我回復正常 做返好多健康習慣 不過我冇再戴頭盔行路 
So now I'm back to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore -- but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year. ,依個健康計劃改變咗我嘅生活 
It was really a life-changing project. ,但我無時間同你哋一一列舉 
"And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them. ",等我簡短咁講兩點 
Let me just tell you two really quickly. ,第一，令我好意外嘅 就係我宜家嘅生活更加靜 
The first is -- and this was surprising to me; I didn't expect this to come out -- but I live a much quieter life now. ,我哋生活喺一個好嘈嘅環境 
Because we live in such a noisy world. ,火車、飛機同汽車 仲有電視機上 Bill O'Reilly 呢個人 都好嘈 
"There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy. ",（笑聲） 好多人都低估咗、忽略依個健康風險 噪音好明顯會影響我哋嘅聽力 而且仲會引起戰鬥或逃跑反應 
"(Laughter) And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard -- not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does, but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response. ",一下好大嘅聲會引起你嘅戰鬥或逃跑反應 
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going. ,幾年之後就會造成慢性嘅破壞 例如破壞心血管 
"And this, over the years, can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage. ",世界衛生組織進行做咗一項大研究 並且喺今年啱啱發布 
The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year. ,依項研究喺歐洲進行 
And it was done in Europe. ,佢哋估計 每年歐洲因為噪音污染 令一百六十萬人損失咗一年嘅健康生活 
And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution. ,所以佢哋認為噪音可以致命 
So they think it's actually very deadly. ,另外 噪音對個腦都唔好 
"And by the way, it's also terrible for your brain. ",佢會破壞你嘅知覺 
It really impairs cognition. ,就連美國建國之父都知道 
And our Founding Fathers knew about this. ,因為當佢哋撰寫《美國憲法》嘅時候 佢哋曾經喺大堂外嘅石卵 鋪滿泥土嚟減低噪音 等佢哋可以專心寫 
"When they wrote the Constitution, they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate. ",所以，如果無減噪技術 美國可能唔存在 
"So without noise reduction technology, our country would not exist. ",作為一個愛國者 我覺得戴耳塞同耳機非常重要 而且佢仲好意外咁改善我嘅生活 
"So as a patriot, I felt it was important to -- I wear all the earplugs and the earphones, and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way. ",第二點，亦都係最後一樣我想要講嘅 依個亦係 TED 醫學嘅主題︰ 就係快樂對於健康好重要 以我為例 家下我維持到嘅健康行為 都係一啲會令我開心嘅 
"And the second point I want to make, the final point, is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED -- that joy is so important to your health, that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them. ",舉一個例子：食物 
And just to give you one instance of this: food. ,垃圾食物行業非常擅於帶畀我哋快樂 同埋知道咩可以令我哋最開心 
The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. ,但我認為我哋可以將佢哋嘅技巧 用喺健康食物之上 
But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food. ,譬如話 我哋好喜歡脆口、有口感嘅嘢 
"To give just one example, we love crunchiness, mouthfeel. ",所以我嘗試將香脆口感融入我嘅食譜 例如放啲瓜子 
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds. ,雖然可能你會以為自己食緊粟米片 
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos. ,（笑聲） 咁食法仲可以令我變得更健康 
(Laughter) And it has made me a healthier person. ,就係咁 
So that is it. ,依個計劃嘅書會喺 4 月出版 
The book about it comes out in April. ,叫做《Drop Dead Healthy》 
"It's called ""Drop Dead Healthy."" ",我希望喺新書宣傳途中唔會病倒 
And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour. ,呢個係我最大願望 
So thank you very much. ,多謝各位！ （掌聲） 
(Applause) ,
,喺 TED 嘅網站入邊 一共有超過一千個演講 
There's currently over a thousand TED Talks on the TED website. ,我諗你哋多數都會覺得 好勁啊！ 但係我就唔係咁諗 
"And I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic, except for me, I don't agree with this. ",我覺得依個係一個難題 
I think we have a situation here. ,因為你諗下，一千個演講意味著 有超過一千個諗法值得我哋傳播 
"Because if you think about it, 1,000 TED Talks, that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading. ",邊有可能 傳播依一千個諗法？ 
How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas? ,就算你諗住睇曬依一千條片 將所有嘢塞入你個腦 你都需要 超過 250 個鐘 
"Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos, it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so. ",我就計咗條數 
And I did a little calculation of this. ,每睇一條片造成嘅經濟損失大概係 一萬五千美金 
"The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000. ",既然佢會引起咁嘅經濟損失 我就諗我哋需要一個解决措施 
"So having seen this danger to the economy, I thought, we need to find a solution to this problem. ",跟住我會講下我嘅做法 
Here's my approach to it all. ,觀望現實情況 有一千個演講 
"If you look at the current situation, you have a thousand TED Talks. ","每個演講嘅平均長度係 約 2,300 個英文字 "
"Each of those TED Talks has an average length of about 2,300 words. ",計下個總數 所有演講加起身一共有 230 萬個英文字 係《聖經》嘅三倍 
"Now take this together, and you end up with 2.3 million words of TED Talks, which is about three Bibles-worth of content. ","問題就係 一個演講真係需要 2,300 字咩？ "
"(Laughter) The obvious question here is, does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words? ",可唔可以短啲啊？ 
Isn't there something shorter? ,"如果你想宣揚你嘅諗法 你絕對可以將佢縮到短過 2,300 字 "
"I mean, if you have an idea worth spreading, surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words. ",唯一嘅問題係可以縮到幾短啊？ 
"The only question is, how short can you get? ",一個演講你最少需要幾個英文字呢？ 
What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TED Talk? ,"我諗緊依個問題嘅時候 傳奇作家海明威出現喺我腦海 佢曾經講過依六個英文字 For sale: baby shoes, never worn （譯︰全新嬰兒鞋出售） 係佢寫過最好嘅小說 "
"While I was pondering this question, I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway, who allegedly said that these six words here: ""For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"" were the best novel he had ever written. ",我仲見過一個「六字傳記」計劃 所有人都用六個英文字總結佢哋嘅生平 譬如： 「搵到真愛，卻同另一個結緍。」 
"And I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs where people were asked, take your whole life and please sum this up into six words, such as these here: ""Found true love, married someone else."" ",「生活空虛，好弊。」 
"Or ""Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."" ",——我好鐘意第二個 
I actually like that one. ,如果一篇小說可以濃縮成六個英文字 人嘅一生可以用六個英文字黎總結 咁一個演講都只需要六個英文字 
"So if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words, you don't need more than six words for a TED Talk. ",中午飯之前就可以聽曬 今日所有演講喇！ 
We could have been done by lunch here. ,"（笑聲） 如果將所有演講進行濃縮 就可以由 230 萬英文字減到 6,000 "
"(Laughter) And if you did this for all thousand TED Talks, you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000. ",我覺得幾好啊 
So I thought this was quite worthwhile. ,然後我就開始嗌我所有嘅朋友 用六個英文字總結佢哋最鐘意嘅演講 
"So I started asking all my friends, please take your favorite TED Talk and put that into six words. ",依啲就係其中一啲例子，我覺得都幾好 
So here are some of the results that I received. ,譬如話 Dan Pink 關於動機嘅演講︰ 「唔要紅蘿蔔，唔要棍，淨係要意義。」 
I think they're quite nice. ,佢講得幾好，未睇過嘅快啲去睇下 依三句基本上就係佢十八分半鐘講嘅嘢 
"For example, Dan Pink's talk on motivation, which was pretty good, if you haven't seen it: ""Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."" ",仲有人直接引用演講者嘅說話 
"It's what he's basically talking about in those 18,5 minutes. ",例如 Nathan Myhrvold 嘅風格演講 同埋 Tim Ferriss 嘅演講 Tim Ferriss 嘅演講有時比較激動 宜家嘅問題係 如果我想有系統咁總結啲演講 
"Or some even included references to the speakers, such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style, or the one of Tim Ferriss, which might be considered a bit strenuous at times. ",我應該會有好多概要 不過會有好多敵人 所以我需要一個新方法 
"The challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this, I would probably end up with a lot of summaries, but not with many friends in the end. ",最好係只需要陌生人嘅 
"So I had to find a different method, preferably involving total strangers. ",好好彩，有一個叫做 Mechanical Turk 嘅網站 你可以喺上邊發佈你唔想自己做嘅嘢 譬如話「唔該幫我用三個英文字 總結依篇文章」 
"And luckily, there's a website for that, called Mechanical Turk, which is a website where you can post tasks that you don't want to do yourself, such as ""Please summarize this text for me in six words."" ",我無通過任何低成本國家 嚟完成依個任務 不過我發現我淨係需要用 10 美分 我覺得好鬼平 
"And I didn't allow any low-cost countries to work on this, but I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents, which I think is a pretty good price. ",但係就算係咁 都無可能逐個濃縮曬所有演講 
"Even then, unfortunately, it's not possible to summarize each TED Talk individually. ",因為如果你計下，有一千個演講 一個演講 10 美分 一個演講需要至少寫兩個概要 因為買返嚟嘅概要有可能質素好差 
"Because if you do the math, you have a thousand TED Talks, you pay 10 cents each; you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks, because some of them will probably be, or are, really bad. ",結果就會變成我要畀幾百蚊美金 
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars. ,所以我又諗到個新方法 我就諗所有演講都係關於 幾個固定嘅話題 
"So I thought of a different way, by thinking, well, the talks revolve around certain themes. ",如果我唔使人逐個總結 而係一次過畀佢哋 10 個演講 然後要佢哋用六個英文字 總結依 10 個演講 
"So what if I don't let people summarize individual TED Talks to six words, but give them 10 TED Talks at the same time and say, ""Please do a six-word summary for that one."" ",我就可以將成本減少百分之九十 
I would cut my costs by 90 percent. ,用 60 蚊美金 我就可以將一千個演講 濃縮成 600 個概要 幾好啊！ 
"So for $60, I could summarize a thousand TED Talks into just 600 summaries, which would actually be quite nice. ",你哋可能會覺得 10 個演講變成 6 個英文字 根本無可能 
"Some of you might actually right now be thinking, it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks summarized into just six words. ",事實係有可能嘅 統計學教授 Hans Rosling 嘅例子 可以證明 
"But it's actually not, because there's an example by statistics professor Hans Rosling. ",——我諗你哋都睇過佢嘅演講 
I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks. ,佢喺網上有 8 個演講 全部基本上可以用一句話嚟總結 所有演講都係想話我哋知︰ 「我哋嘅直覺一啲都唔準。 
"He's got eight talks online, and those can basically be summed up into just four words, because that's all he's basically showing us, our intuition is really bad. ",佢次次都證明我哋係錯嘅。」 
He always proves us wrong. ,講返網上請嘅人 佢哋做出嚟嘅嘢唔係太好 
"So people on the Internet, some didn't do so well. ",當我嗌佢哋將 10 個演講 縮成 6 個英文字嘅時候 有啲人就偷懶喇！ 佢哋都畀啲好行嘅嘢 
"And when I asked them to summarize the 10 TED Talks at the same time, some took the easy route out. ",有哋仲好無恥用六個英文字駁返我 問我最近係咪沉迷於網絡搜尋 
There were others -- and I found this quite cheeky -- They used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately. ,我諗唔明點解有人會咁做 有人甚至憑空作個總結出嚟 
"(Laughter) And finally also, I never understood this, some people really came up with their own version of the truth. ",我唔知啲演講係咪真係有依啲內容 
I don't know any TED Talk that contains this. ,不過 結果真係好令人驚奇 
"But, oh well. ",所有我請求嘅演講批次 都得到好多有意義嘅概要 
"In the end, however, and this is really amazing, for each of those 10 TED Talk clusters that I submitted, I actually received meaningful summaries. ",依啲係我比較鐘意嘅 
Here are some of my favorites. ,例如所有關於食物嘅演講 有人總結成： 「食物塑造身體、大腦同環境」 我覺得唔錯 關於幸福感嘅： 
"For example, for the TED Talks about food, someone summed this up into: ""Food shaping body, brains and environment,"" which I think is pretty good. ",「努力得到幸福等如邁向不幸。」 
"Or happiness: ""Striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness."" ",到依度 我係由一千個演講開始 濃縮到 600 組六個英文字概要 
So here I was. ,聽落幾好 但係當你望住依 600 個概要 其實都幾多 
"Actually, it sounded nice in the beginning, but when you look at 600 summaries, it's quite a lot, it's a huge list. ",然後我就諗，或者可以再濃縮 製造一個概要嘅概要 ——我的確做咗依件事 
"(Laughter) So I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries, and this is exactly what I did. ",我將依 600 個概要 根據網上評分分成 9 組 然後搵人將佢哋濃縮 
"So I took the 600 summaries that I had, put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com and asked people to do summaries of those. ",今次又有誤解喇！ 
"Again, there were some misunderstandings. ",有人以為我想喺依啲咁精彩嘅演講入邊 搵一句好易上口嘅口號 
"For example, when I had a cluster of all the ""Beautiful"" talks, someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick-up line. ",不過令我驚訝嘅係 再一次，我請嘅人都做到嘢 
"But in the end, amazingly, again, people were able to do it. ",例如所有有關膽量嘅演講 總結成「人亡」或者「人受難」 或者「總有簡單嘅解決方法」 
"For example, all the courageous TED Talks: ""People dying"" or ""People suffering"" was also one, ""with easy solutions around."" ",仲有個令人詫異嘅演講總結成： 「星際古典樂作曲家嘅相。」 
"Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping TED Talk: ""Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer."" ",依嗰就係精粹所在 
I mean that's the essence of it all. ,宜家我有 9 組非常概要 
"Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean, it's already quite a reduction. ",但係當你做得越耐，你就越唔滿足 
"But of course, once you are that far, you're not really satisfied. ",就好似精餾釀酒一樣 你想得到最精餾嘅 所以我由一千個演講開始 
"I wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery, starting out with a thousand TED Talks. ",我想將一千個演講濃縮成六個英文字 百分之 99.9997 嘅縮減率 
I wanted to have a thousand TED Talks summarized into just six words -- which would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content. ,不過我凈係畀咗 99.5 美金 總經費少於一百美金 
And I would only pay $99.50 -- so stay even below $100 for it. ,今次一共有 50 個概要 
So I had 50 overall summaries done. ,25 美分一篇 因為我諗著今次難啲，所以費用會多啲 
This time I paid 25 cents because I thought the task was a bit harder. ,但不幸，我最初收到嘅結果 其中六個令我有啲失望 
"And unfortunately, when I first received the answers -- and here, you'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed. ",你哋應該會同意 佢哋都總結咗 TED 嘅某啲方面 但係感覺佢哋有啲平淡 有或者佢哋都分別總結咗 TED 嘅一個方面 
"Because I think you'll agree, they all summarize some aspect of TED, but to me, they felt a bit bland, or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them. ",然後我差唔多要放棄喇！ 直到有一晚，我開始組合依啲字 結果發現咗一個好好嘅方法 
"So I was almost ready to give up when one night, I played around with these sentences and found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here. ",依個就係 通過眾籌力量、價值 99.5 美金嘅 一千演講六個英文字概要： Why the worry? I'd rather wonder （譯︰憂乜鬼？噢就算） 
"So here it is, a crowd-sourced, six-word summary of a thousand TED Talks at the value of $99.50: ""Why the worry? I'd rather wonder."" ",多謝

,我哋唔會投資喺受害者身上 我哋投資喺生還者身上 
"We do not invest in victims, we invest in survivors. ",無論受害者嘅故事係點 始終影響我哋對女性嘅睇法 只不過影響可以係大或者細咁解 
"And in ways both big and small, the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women. ",我哋唔會相信未見過嘅嘢 
You can't count what you don't see. ,所以我哋唔會投資喺見唔到嘅嘢 
And we don't invest in what's invisible to us. ,但呢個就係對抗逆境嘅面孔 
But this is the face of resilience. ,六年前，我開始撰寫 關於女性企業家 面對逆境時同面對完逆境嘅報導 
"Six years ago, I started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict. ",我打算寫一個好鼓舞嘅經濟故事 一個背後有著勁人 但未為人所知 而應該受關注嘅故事 
"I set out to write a compelling economic story, one that had great characters, that no one else was telling, and one that I thought mattered. ",而嗰啲勁人全部都係女性嚟 
And that turned out to be women. ,我三十歲時離開 美國廣播公司新聞部我鍾意嘅崗位 去咗讀商學院 一個我冇乜認識嘅方向 
"I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30 for business school, a path I knew almost nothing about. ",喺馬利蘭州同我一齊成長嘅女性 無一個大學畢業 更遑論係商學院畢業 
"None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland had graduated from college, let alone considered business school. ",佢哋為咗子女、屋租張羅 而喺出邊賺錢 
But they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent. ,從小我就睇到 一份可以帶嚟富足收入嘅工 對經濟上過得非常之艱難嘅家庭嚟講 可以帶嚟莫大轉變 
And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling. ,講起工作 就先要講企業家 
"So if you're going to talk about jobs, then you have to talk about entrepreneurs. ",而如果你講緊 逆境之中同經歷逆境之後嘅企業家 就不得不提女性 因為佢哋一向都被忽略 
"And if you're talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post-conflict settings, then you must talk about women, because they are the population you have left. ",盧旺達經歷完種族屠殺之後 有 77% 人口係女性 
Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was 77 percent female. ,我想介紹我遇過嘅女性企業家 以及佢哋過去以嚟教我嘅嘢 
I want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs I've met and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years. ,2005 年我喺阿富汗 為《金融時報》做採訪 我喺當地認識咗 Kamila 一位啱啱拒絕咗 國際組織一份月薪接近二千美元嘅工 嘅年輕女子 
"I went to Afghanistan in 2005 to work on a Financial Times piece, and there I met Kamila, a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month -- an astronomical sum in that context. ",佢拒絕 係因為要開展佢嘅事業 向阿富汗人提供企業顧問服務 傳授營商技巧 
"And she had turned it down, she said, because she was going to start her next business, an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around Afghanistan. ",佢認為商業發展對佢國家嘅前途好重要 
"Business, she said, was critical to her country's future. ",因為各國撤出阿富汗之後 營商可以為國家帶嚟和平同安全 
"Because long after this round of internationals left, business would help keep her country peaceful and secure. ",而且營商對女性尤為重要 因為有收入就令佢哋獲得尊重 對女性嚟講，金錢就等如權力 
And she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women. ,聽完之後，我非常之驚訝 
So I was amazed. ,因為呢位女子從未享受過和平嘅生活 聽落佢好似《飛黃騰達》嘅參加者一樣 
"I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from ""The Apprentice."" ",（笑聲） 我問佢︰「你點解對做生意知咁多？ 
"(Laughter) So I asked her, ""How in the world do you know this much about business? ",點解咁有熱情？」 
"Why are you so passionate?"" ",佢答我︰「Gayle， 呢個已經係我第三次做生意。 
"She said, ""Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business. ",我第一個生意係製衣， 喺塔利斑管治嗰陣就已經開始。 
My first business was a dressmaking business I started under the Taliban. ,呢個生意好利害， 因為我哋為鄰近嘅婦女提供咗工作， 
"And that was actually an excellent business, because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood. ",我就係咁成為企業家。」 
"And that's really how I became an entrepreneur."" ",試諗下 喺嗰度嘅女仔當時連街都出唔到 但就冒住生命危險創業 
Think about this: Here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets. ,正當經濟一片蕭條 其他人只可以賣洋娃娃 鞋帶、窗同門去糊口 呢啲女仔已經喺生存同飢餓之間 為好多人帶嚟改變 
"And at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive, these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many. ",但我唔可以撇低呢啲故事唔寫 因為我之後去到邊 都遇到更多呢類型嘅女性 但無人知道佢哋 或者無興趣想知佢哋 
"I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either, because everywhere I went I met more of these women who no one seemed to know about, or even wish to. ",我之後去波斯尼亞做訪問 見到一位國際貨幣基金組織官員 佢同我講︰「Gayle， 我唔相信波斯尼亞有女性從事商業。 但路口附近就有位女士賣芝士， 
"I went on to Bosnia, and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said, ""You know, Gayle, I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia, but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road. ",或者你可以訪問下佢。」 
"So maybe you could interview her."" ",於是我繼續做採訪 同一日我認識咗 Narcisa Kavazovic 佢喺昔日薩拉熱窩戰綫上面開咗間工廠 
So I went out reporting and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic who at that point was opening a new factory on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo. ,佢喺棄置嘅車房開始佢嘅事業 織床單同枕頭袋 之後拎著製成品攞去全市嘅市場度賣 收入支撐十二、三個屋企人 
"She had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage, sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the 12 or 13 family members who were counting on her for survival. ",當時佢有二十個員工，大部分係女性 員工早就送咗仔女返學 
"By the time we met, she had 20 employees, most of them women, who were sending their boys and their girls to school. ",而 Narcisa 只係做咗生意冇耐嘅女性 
And she was just the start. ,之後我仲遇見不同嘅女性 有賣精油，有賣酒 甚至有經營全國最大嘅廣告商 
"I met women running essential oils businesses, wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency. ",所有呢的故事 都變成咗《先驅論壇報》嘅頭版 
So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover. ,當報紙一登出呢啲故事 我即刻發電郵畀 嗰位國際貨幣基金組織官員 
"And when this story posted, I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official. ",我話︰「如果你要喺下次嘅投資會 做企業家嘅專題， 呢度就有一班女性企業家你可以搵。」 
"And I said, ""Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference, here are a couple of women."" ",（掌聲） 但再諗下 
(Applause) But think about this. ,嗰位官員未必係唯一睇小女性嘅人 
The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro. ,呢種偏見，不論係咪特登 係無處不在嘅 更加唔好講對兩性錯得好緊要嘅觀念 
"The biases, whether intentional or otherwise, are pervasive, and so are the misleading mental images. ",例如當你見到「微型金融」呢個詞語 你哋有咩聯想？ 
"If you see the word ""microfinance,"" what comes to mind? ",好多人諗到女性 
Most people say women. ,但如果見到「企業家」呢個詞語 大部份人會諗到男性 
"And if you see the word ""entrepreneur,"" most people think men. ",點解呢？ 
Why is that? ,因為一提到女性 我哋就諗起「卑微」、「弱小」 
Because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women. ,微型金融係一個強大嘅工具 令女性可以自給自足同識得自我尊重 但女性唔要小小嘅希望同抱負 佢哋要嘅係對自己抱有更大嘅期望 
"Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect, but we must move beyond micro-hopes and micro-ambitions for women, because they have so much greater hopes for themselves. ",佢哋唔再係微小，而係越嚟越重要 
They want to move from micro to medium and beyond. ,好多範疇都有女性嘅存在 
"And in many places, they're there. ",喺美國，由女性持有嘅公司 去到 2018 年會創造到 550 萬個職位 
"In the U.S., women-owned businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018. ",喺南韓同印尼 有近 50 萬間公司由女性擁有 
"In South Korea and Indonesia, women own nearly half a million firms. ",喺中國，有兩成嘅小企業由女性經營 
"China, women run 20 percent of all small businesses. ",喺發展中國家 女性經營小企業嘅數字 更加達到 40% 至 50% 
"And in the developing world overall, That figure is 40 to 50 percent. ",差不多我去過嘅地方 我都遇到犀利嘅企業家 佢哋尋求融資、開拓市場 建立生意網絡 
"Nearly everywhere I go, I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance, access to markets and established business networks. ",但佢哋經常被人忽視 因為人哋好難協助佢哋 
They are often ignored because they're harder to help. ,借五萬蚊比借五百蚊有更加大風險 
"It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan than it is to give a 500 dollar loan. ",世界銀行最近指出女性墮入生產力陷阱 
"And as the World Bank recently noted, women are stuck in a productivity trap. ",因為經營小企業嘅女性 得唔到資金擴展業務 而經營更小型生意嘅女性 就更加發展唔到 
Those in small businesses can't get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness can't grow out of them. ,最近我喺美國國務院 遇到一位嚟自加納嘅女企業家 
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana. ,佢係賣朱古力嘅 
She sells chocolates. ,佢嚟到 唔係為咗資金援助或者微型貸款 
"And she had come to Washington, not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan. ",而係嚟尋求大筆投資 去起工廠、買機器、生產朱古力 出口去非洲、歐洲同中東 以至其他地方 佢需要資金聘請超過 20 位 已經幫佢打工嘅員工 亦需要資金可以幫助佢嘅國家經濟起飛 
"She had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to Africa, Europe, the Middle East and far beyond -- capital that would help her to employ more than the 20 people that she already has working for her, and capital that would fuel her own country's economic climb. ",好消息係我哋知咩嘢係可行 
The great news is we already know what works. ,因為理論同數據已經証明咗 
Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us. ,我哋唔需要諗度 一個解決辦法出嚟 因為我哋已經有現金流貸款 現金流貸款係根據收入 而唔係資產而定嘅 貸款採用安全合同而非附屬合同 因為女性通常冇土地做抵押 
"We don't need to invent solutions because we have them -- cash flow loans based in income rather than assets, loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral, because women often don't own land. ",Kiva.org 呢個微型貸款機構 就係試行緊小型同中型嘅眾籌貸款 
"And Kiva.org, the microlender, is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans. ",但呢個試驗只係起步 
And that's just to start. ,最近好流行講︰ 「女性係新興市場中嘅新興市場」 
"Recently it has become very much in fashion to call women ""the emerging market of the emerging market."" ",我認為無得頂 
I think that is terrific. ,點解呢？ 
You know why? ,因為以我從事金融業知道 過去十年有五千億美金注入咗新興市場 
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade. ,而因為投資者喺經濟放緩嘅時候 睇到有回報潛力 所以佢哋設計咗 專為新興市場而設嘅 金融產品同金融創新方案 
"Because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth, and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets. ",我哋如果可以唔講浮誇嘅說話 而係將五千億用嚟釋放 女性潛在嘅經濟能力 係幾咁好呢？ 
How wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest 500 billion dollars unleashing women's economic potential? ,想像下呢的資金 對職位、生產力、就業、兒童嘅營養 產婦死亡率、識字率，以至更加多嘅嘢 幫助有幾大 
"Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs, productivity, employment, child nutrition, maternal mortality, literacy and much, much more. ",因為世界經濟論壇指出 越小性別差距，越可以提高經濟競爭力 
"Because, as the World Economic Forum noted, smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness. ",無一個國家可以消除 兩性參與商業活動上嘅不公現象 絕對無 
And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- not one. ,於是呢個就係一個大好機會喇 
So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity. ,我哋仲有好多改善空間 
We have so much room to grow. ,所以呢個唔係為咗做好事 而係為咗全球嘅發展同全球嘅就業 
"So you see, this is not about doing good, this is about global growth and global employment. ",所以女性就業問題 在於我哋點投資同點看待女性 
It is about how we invest and it's about how we see women. ,女性已經唔只係一半人口同小數 
And women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group. ,（掌聲） 我經常同同行討論 佢哋話︰「Gayle，呢啲報導好正， 但你只係寫緊啲特殊例子。」 
"(Applause) Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me, ""Gayle, these are great stories, but you're really writing about the exceptions."" ",我真係因為佢哋嘅話而停落嚟 
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons. ,原因有幾個 首先，所謂特殊例子真係有好多 而且每個都好重要 
"First of all, for exceptions, there are a lot of them and they're important. ",第二，當我哋講成功男士嘅時候 我哋會以佢哋為 偶像、先驅或者搞創新嘅人 
"Secondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding, we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated. ",並尊佢哋為學習對象 但一講女性 我哋就當佢哋只係例外 或者奇人咁去忽視 
"And when we talk about women, they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored. ",最終，每一個國家要變嘅話 都要靠呢班特殊例子嘅人 
"And finally, there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional. ",咁點解我哋唔為呢啲 創造就業、帶嚟改變嘅人鼓掌？ 反而對佢哋視而不見呢？ 
So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them? ,韌力對我嚟講係好切身嘅嘢 韌力改變咗我好多 
This topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life. ,我屋企係個單親家庭 母親日頭喺電話公司工作 夜晚賣廚具用品 於是我可以接觸好多嘢 
My mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold Tupperware at night so that I could have every opportunity possible. ,我哋盡量用優惠卷買嘢 選擇分期供款同買二手貨 當我媽媽患末期乳癌、唔可以再做嘢 我哋甚至要申請食物卷 
"We shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores, and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work, we even applied for food stamps. ",當時我大概九、十歲 我覺得自己好可憐 但媽媽會同我講︰「乖女， 同世界上嘅慘劇相比，你算好好啦！」 
"And when I would feel sorry for myself as nine or 10 year-old girls do, she would say to me, ""My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies, yours is not a three."" ",（笑聲） 當我準備考商學院嘅時候 我覺得自己無咩機會 亦無人知我去考 嗰陣我去搵我阿姨 我阿姨佢長期被丈夫虐待 但最終好彩嘅身心幸存咁離咗婚 
"(Laughter) And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn't do it and nobody I knew had done it, I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact. ",佢同我講︰ 「千祈唔好比其他人限制你。」 
"And she told me, ""Never import other people's limitations."" ",我當時又去咗搵婆婆呻 佢不但係二戰軍人 仲喺電影工業做咗半個世紀 又由我 13 歲開始就照顧我 我嗰陣同婆婆講 我驚如果去咗外國深造 而放棄美國廣播公司呢份荀工 我以後都唔會再搵嘢做 但佢講︰「阿妹，我話你知兩樣嘢。 
"And when I complained to my grandmother, a World War II veteran who worked in film for 50 years and who supported me from the age of 13, that I was terrified that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC for a fellowship overseas, I would never ever, ever find another job, she said, ""Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things. ",第一，唔會有人放棄獎學金； 第二，麥記成日都請人㗎。」 
"First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright, and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."" ",（笑聲） 「你會搵到工嘅，放膽去啦！」 
"(Laughter) ""You will find a job. Take the leap."" ",我屋企嘅女性並唔係咩特殊例子 
The women in my family are not exceptions. ,喺呢個講座同喺洛杉磯睇直播嘅女性 
The women in this room and watching in L.A. ,仲有全球各哋嘅女性 都唔係咩特殊例子 
and all around the world are not exceptions. ,我哋唔係小數 
We are not a special interest group. ,而係大多數 
We are the majority. ,我哋經常低估自己，亦被人輕視 
"And for far too long, we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others. ",作為女性 係時候要望高啲、遠啲 同投資多啲 令全世界嘅女性受益 
"It is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women, to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world. ",我哋有能力改變 而且咁樣做唔單止為女性 仲係為全球經濟 全球經濟極需要女性嘅貢獻 
"We can make a difference, and make a difference, not just for women, but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions. ",我哋一齊就會有能力 去令呢類所謂特殊例子變成主導 
Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule. ,當我哋對自己嘅睇法有所改變 其他人都會跟隨 
"When we change the way we see ourselves, others will follow. ",我哋係時候去諗得更遠大 
And it is time for all of us to think bigger. ,多謝各位 
Thank you very much. ,（掌聲） 
(Applause) ,
,我喺哩度同大家分享我嘅攝影作品 
I'm here to share my photography. ,但係哩張都算係攝影咩？ 
Or is it photography? ,雖然佢係一張相 但係你冇辦法用相機影出來 
"Because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera. ",我對攝影嘅興趣始於我十五歲嗰時 得到嘅第一部數碼相機 
"Yet, my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15. ",我對攝影嘅熱愛混雜著 我早期對畫畫嘅熱愛 但攝影又唔同畫畫 因為攝影指嘅係拍攝前嘅計劃 
"It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different, because using the camera, the process was in the planning instead. ",當你用相機㩒快門嘅一刻 攝影就會完咗 
"And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger. ",所以，對於我來講，攝影更加在於 喺啱嘅時間喺啱嘅地方影 
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time. ,我覺得每個人都可以做到哩一點 
I felt like anyone could do that. ,所以我就想做啲唔同嘅嘢 我想令攝影變成 一樣由㩒快門一刻先至開始嘅嘢 
"So I wanted to create something different, something where the process starts when you press the trigger. ",好似哩幅相咁： 一條繁忙嘅街道進行緊施工 
Photos like this: construction going on along a busy road. ,但係佢有個位係意想不到嘅扭曲咗 
But it has an unexpected twist. ,除此之外 佢保持咗一定程度嘅真實感 
"And despite that, it retains a level of realism. ",又或者好似咁樣嘅相咁—— 無論係灰暗定係鮮豔 啲相都有一個共通點︰ 就係保持一定程度嘅真實感 
"Or photos like these -- both dark and colorful, but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism. ",當我講真實感嘅時候 我嘅意思係相片嘅真實感 
"When I say realism, I mean photo-realism. ",因為相中嘅影像 並唔係嗰啲你可以真正捕捉到嘅嘢 但我總係想令啲影像望落去 好似真係可以被相機真正捕捉咁樣 
"Because, of course, it's not something you can capture really, but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph. ",我想令到啲人睇相嗰陣 會花時間搵出當中嘅有違常理嘅地方 
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick. ,所以，哩啲相嘅功能 更多嘅係傳遞一種想法 而唔係捕捉一個時刻 
So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really. ,但係係咩方法令到佢望落去咁真呢？ 
But what's the trick that makes it look realistic? ,係因為細節嗎？ 定係因為顏色？ 
Is it something about the details or the colors? ,係因為光線？ 
Is it something about the light? ,係乜嘢造成錯覺？ 
What creates the illusion? ,有時，視角就係錯覺 
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion. ,但講到底，錯覺 同我哋點樣解讀世界有關 同埋世界係點樣喺二維平面上面重現 
"But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface. ",乜嘢係真實並唔重要 重要嘅係我哋望落去覺得乜嘢係真實 
"It's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic really. ",所以，我認為道理好簡單 
So I think the basics are quite simple. ,我就將每一張相當成係 一幅現實生活嘅拼圖 你可以利用生活中唔同嘅事物 去合成出一幅假嘅圖片 
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality. ,等我舉一個簡單嘅例子 
And let me show you a simple example. ,哩度有三個完全可以想像得到嘅物體 亦即係我哋嘅三維世界入面 可以搵得到嘅嘢 
"Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects, something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world. ",但用一種特定嘅方式將佢哋組合 就可以創造出一啲睇上去 仍然係三維同真實嘅嘢 
"But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, like it could exist. ",但同時，我哋知道佢哋冇可能存在 
"But at the same time, we know it can't. ",所以我哋呃咗我哋嘅大腦 因為我哋大腦只會接受合常理嘅嘢 
"So we trick our brains, because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense. ",同樣欺騙大腦嘅過程 發生喺合成嘅相裏面 
And I see the same process with combining photographs. ,合成嘅相就係 組合現實生活中不同嘅事物 
It's just really about combining different realities. ,為咗令張相望落去真實 我哋需要放一啲我哋冇諗過嘅嘢落去 又或者放我哋日常生活中 一定會見到嘅嘢落去 
"So the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives. ",但當相組合嘅時候 仔細考慮就變得好重要 因為如果唔仔細考慮構圖嘅話 
"But when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow. ",睇上去就會怪怪地 所以我會話，要做到真實嘅效果 需要遵守三個簡單嘅規則 
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result. ,正如你所見，哩啲圖片並非十分特別 
"As you can see, these images aren't really special. ",但組合起嚟，佢哋可以做到咁樣嘅效果 
"But combined, they can create something like this. ",所以，第一條規則係 被組合嘅相片需要有同樣嘅拍攝視角 
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective. ,第二，組合嘅相片 需要有同樣類型嘅光線 
"Secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light. ",哩兩張圖片都滿足咗哩兩項要求—— 喺同樣嘅高度影嘅，有同樣嘅光線 
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light. ,第三項規則 在於設法使到兩張圖片 連接得天衣無縫、睇唔到分界 
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless. ,令到人哋講唔出張相係點樣合成 
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed. ,透過將兩張圖片喺交界處嘅 顏色、對比度同亮度整到一樣 再加上一啲圖像嘅缺陷 譬如︰景深、不飽和顏色同雜訊 我哋消除咗圖像之間嘅邊界 令佢望落去好似一張相咁 而每一張相可能含少包至過百層嘅圖片 
"So by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise, we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically. ",哩度係另一個例子 
So here's another example. ,有啲人會認為佢係一幅風景照 只不過圖像嘅下半部係經過處理嘅 
(Laughter) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated. ,但係實際上哩幅相完全係 由唔同地方嘅相人工合成嘅 
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations. ,我個人認為創造一個地方 比搵到一個地方容易 因為你可以盡情將諗法表達出嚟 而唔使受地方限制 
"I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head. ",但係哩樣嘢確實需要好多計劃功夫 
But it does require a lot of planning. ,我有哩個諗法嘅時候係冬天 所以我有幾個月嘅時間去計劃 去搵到唔同嘅地點 做哩張相嘅材料 
"And getting this idea during winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically. ",咁，舉例嚟講 哩條魚係喺一個釣魚嘅旅途中拍到嘅 
"So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip. ",河嘅兩邊係兩笪地方 
The shores are from a different location. ,水面下嘅部分係喺一個採石場度拍嘅 
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit. ,係啊，我甚至將小島上嘅屋變成紅色 畀佢望落去更加似喺瑞典 
"And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish. ",（笑聲） 我認為要塑造真實嘅感覺 關鍵在於計劃 
"So to achieve a realistic result, I think it comes down to planning. ",佢總係由一幅草圖、一個諗法開始 
"It always starts with a sketch, an idea. ",然後由唔同嘅場景組合起嚟 
Then it's about combining the different photographs. ,哩度每幅相都係精心計劃過嘅 
And here every piece is very well planned. ,如果你用心拍攝哩啲場景 合成之後嘅相出嚟嘅效果 都會相當靚同埋真實 
"And if you do a good job capturing the photos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic. ",所以話，成件事所有嘅工具都有齊嘞 爭嘅係大家嘅想像力 
"So all the tools are out there, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination. ",多謝大家 （掌聲） 
(Applause) ,
,"每一年淨喺美國 就有 2,077,000 對新人 作出法律同信仰嘅承諾 同另一半一齊度過一生一世 （臺下笑聲） 同以後唔再同其他人上床 "
"Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together -- (Laughter) And not to have sex with anyone else. ",男嘅就買戒指，女嘅就揀好婚紗 
"He buys a ring, she buys a dress. ",兩個人一齊買嘢 
They go shopping for all sorts of things. ,女方會帶男方到舞蹈會所一齊學社交舞 
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom-dancing lessons. ,最後大日子降臨 
And the big day comes. ,佢哋會喺神同家人 仲有女方爸爸以往嘅生意夥伴面前發誓 無論貧窮、絕症、不幸 都動搖唔到男女雙方嘅愛同承諾 
"And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with, and they'll vow that nothing -- not abject poverty, not life-threatening illness, not complete and utter misery -- will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion. ",（臺下笑聲） 呢啲天真嘅後生仔女 承諾無論係更年期 中年危機或者肥胖 都願意同甘共苦、守望相助 直至其中一個安息 
"(Laughter) These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and midlife crises and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain, until that far-off day, when one of them is finally able to rest in peace. ",（笑聲） 因為佢哋唔使再忍受對方嘅鼻鼾聲 
"(Laughter) You know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore. ",婚禮當日，佢哋會變成醉貓 仲會向對方嘅面掟蛋糕 同一齊跳 Marcarena 舞 
And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each other's faces and do the Macarena. ,而我哋所有朋友會企喺一邊 向佢哋一齊拉禮炮開香檳 然後飲免費喜酒 仲有祝一對新人百年好合 
"And we'll be there, showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time ... ",雖然，我哋知道 根據統計 有一半嘅新人十年之內會離婚 
"even though we know, statistically, half of them will be divorced within a decade. ",（臺下笑聲） 當然，另外半數嘅新人唔會，啱唔啱？ 
"(Laughter) Of course, the other half won't, right? ",佢哋會一路唔記得結婚週年紀念日 仲會為咗去邊度度假起爭執 甚至爭論究竟要將廁紙卷 向上拉定向下拉 
They'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating -- (Laughter) Which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll. ,但係有一部分夫妻 當兩個都唔可以再食固體食物時 都依然享受二人生活 
And some of them will even still be enjoying each other's company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore. ,研究員想知道呢啲夫婦點做到 
And researchers want to know why. ,我嘅意思係，唔需要做 雙盲或者假藥嘅研究 先至了解到一份婚姻點解會失敗︰ 唔尊重、無聊 用太多時間喺 Facebook 同其他人發生性關係，都係原因 
"I mean, look -- it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work: disrespect, boredom, too much time on Facebook, having sex with other people. ",但係上述四樣嘢係可以調返轉︰ 尊重、刺激 上唔到網 同埋必須遵守嘅一夫一妻制 但就算做足呢四樣嘢 婚姻都未必維持到 
"But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect, excitement, a broken Internet connection, mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a handbasket. ",咁樣，嗰啲成功嘅婚姻 到底係點樣維繫嘅呢？ 
"So, what's going on when it doesn't? ",嗰啲白頭到老嘅夫婦有啲咩共同之處？ 
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common? ,佢哋係點樣做到嘅？ 
What are they doing right? ,我哋要點樣向佢哋學習？ 
What can we learn from them? ,再者，如果你仲係單身而又快樂 咁點解你要放棄原有嘅生活 去搵一個會令你下半世 都不得安寧嘅另一半？ 
"And if you're still happily sleeping solo, why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life? ",研究員用咗你哋嘅納稅錢 嘗試揾出箇中原因 
"Well, researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out. ",佢哋跟蹤嗰啲幸福小夫妻 觀察佢哋嘅一舉一動，包括特殊癖好 
They stalk blissful couples and study their every move and mannerism. ,然後佢哋揾出有咩因素令佢哋與別不同 得以避免重蹈鄰居同朋友嘅覆轍 
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends. ,最後得出來嘅結果係 呢啲成功故事嘅共同點 唔止係唔會對另一半不忠 
"And it turns out, the success stories share a few similarities, beyond that they don't have sex with other people. ",舉例，成功嘅婚姻關係 太太通常會比丈夫來得瘦同好睇 
"For instance, in the happiest marriages, the wife is thinner and better-looking than the husband. ",（臺下笑聲） 顯然係啱嘅 
(Laughter) Obvious. Right? ,顯然呢個係成功婚姻嘅要素 因為女人注重身形同外貌 而男人只對性有興趣 而且最好係身形同外觀比自己好嘅女人 
"It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss, because women -- we care a great deal about being thin and good-looking, whereas men mostly care about sex, ideally, with women who are thinner and better looking than they are. ",呢個研究有一樣嘢可取︰ 就係冇話女人一定要瘦至幸福 
"The beauty of this research, though, is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy. ",我哋淨係需要比另一半瘦就得啦 
We just have to be thinner than our partners. ,所以與其試勻所有節食同運動嘅方法 我哋淨係需要等另一半變肥 （笑聲） 或者我哋可以整多幾個批 
"So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising, we just need to wait for them to get fat -- (Laughter) Maybe bake a few pies. ",呢個係好消息 亦唔係咁複雜難明 
"This is good information to have, and it's not that complicated. ",（笑聲） 研究同時指出 幸福夫妻只會睇正面嘅嘢 
(Laughter) Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives. ,例如，一位幸福嘅太太 
For example: the happy wife. ,與其指出丈夫嘅肚腩有幾大 或者建議佢去跑步 佢會講 「嘩，親愛嘅， 多謝你任由自己嘅身形走樣 嚟令到我瘦啲。」 
"Instead of pointing out her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run, she might say, ""Wow, honey, thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner."" ",（笑聲） 呢啲夫婦會喺任何情況 都會向好嘅一面睇 
(Laughter) These are couples who can find good in any situation. ,「啱啊， 一場大火燒曬， 
"Yeah, it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire. 
But it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars. 
And it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm. ",但係喺星空之下瞓覺都唔錯啊。 
"(Laughter) One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do housework, the more attractive his wife will find him. ",有你身上嘅肥肉真係太好啦， 
Because we needed a study to tell us this. ,可以保暖我哋。」 我最鐘意嘅研究顯示 老公越係肯去做家務 老婆越係覺得老公有吸引力 
(Laughter) But here's what's going on here. ,因為我哋正需要研究 話畀我哋知呢樣嘢…… 
"The more attractive she finds him, the more sex they have; the more sex they have, the nicer he is to her; the nicer he is to her, the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed, and ultimately, they live happily ever after. ",（笑聲） 成個流程就係 
"In other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department. ",老婆越係覺得老公吸引 就越係願意做愛 佢哋越係做得多愛 老公就越係對老婆好 老公越對老婆好 老婆就越唔會埋怨佢喺床上亂放濕毛巾 咁佢哋就會長長久久喺埋一齊 
Here's an interesting one. ,換言之，男士們︰ 你哋應該返去屋企改下嘞 
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. ,有個研究好有趣 
"This is an actual study, and let me clarify: the researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness, or even studying old journals. ",有個研究顯示 人喺童年影相嘅時候笑 就越唔會離婚 
The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures. ,呢個研究係真嘅 等我澄清一下︰ 呢啲研究員唔係睇啲人 對自己童年開心程度畀幾多分 或者研究舊文獻 
"Now, I don't know how old all of you are, but when I was a kid, your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called ""film."" ",研究數據係完全基於 研究對象喺相入邊睇起來開唔開心 
"And, by God, film was expensive. ",我唔清楚各位嘅年齡 但我仲係細個陣 父母影相嘅時候會攞一部特別嘅相機 裏面裝住叫一樣嘢叫菲林嘅嘢 
"They didn't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest, smiliest one for the Christmas card. ",菲林好貴嘅 
"Oh, no. ",菲林亦唔冇得用快門連拍三百張 然後畀你揀笑容最燦爛嘅一張 來做聖誕卡 
"They dressed you up, they lined you up, and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye. ",你就想啦 
"But still, I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce. ",攝影師只會幫你著靚件衫，企好 再叫你喺佢嘅要求底下 喺架爛鬼相機面前笑 或者你可以做吻別生日派對嘅姿勢 
"So, what else can you do to safeguard your marriage? ",但係，我仍然有一大堆 虛偽嘅童年開心照 但我好開心 因為根據研究我會冇咁容易離婚 
Do not win an Oscar for best actress. ,咁仲又有咩可以維繫你嘅婚姻呢？ 
(Laughter) I'm serious. ,千奇唔好攞奧斯卡最佳女演員獎 
"Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Halle Berry, Hilary Swank, Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon -- all of them single, soon after taking home that statue. ",（臺下笑聲） 我係認真嘅 
They actually call it the Oscar curse. ,"Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Hallie Berry, Hillary Swank Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon 佢哋全部喺攞完獎之後就離婚 "
It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided. ,啲人稱呢個係奧斯卡詛咒 
And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous. ,佢係婚姻嘅終結之物 係一定要避免嘅嘢 
"It turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet. ",但呢唔係淨淨係攞演藝獎先至危險 
"(Laughter) Apparently, the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us, but it obviously hasn't and it probably never will, makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison. ",連睇齣愛情喜劇都一樣會令關係破碎 
"And theoretically, I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash, we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we've got it pretty good. ",（臺下笑聲） 顯然 睇齣愛情喜劇搞到關係破裂呢樣嘢 未試過喺我哋身上發生 亦唔太可能發生 但喜劇亦令我哋現實生活睇起嚟更慘 
"(Laughter) Drinking alcohol, it seems, is bad for your marriage. ",理論上 如果我哋反而揀一齣有謀殺案 或者汽車爆炸死人嘅戲睇 我哋離開戲院嗰陣 反而覺得自己幾好呀 
Yeah. ,（笑聲） 飲酒睇起來會破壞婚姻 
I can't tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it at the headline. ,係啊 
But here's a scary one: divorce is contagious. ,飲酒我講唔到啲咩 因為我讀完個標題就冇再讀落去 
"That's right, when you have a close couple friend split up, it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent. ",但係跟住落嚟就更恐怖： 離婚係會傳染嘅 
"Now, I have to say, I don't get this one at all. ",非常正確。當你嘅朋友選擇離婚 你自己離婚嘅幾率會上升 75% 
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony. ,但我又唔太贊同呢一點 
And I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could. ,我同我老公身邊嘅好多朋友 都係離婚分家收場 然後到咗我哋咁嘅年紀 面對呢個色情聊天、偉哥 同用網上戀愛交友盛行嘅年代 好辛苦咁做返單身 
So now you may be wondering: Why does anyone get married ever? ,我自己興幸可以以朋友為鑒 而唔需要終身婚姻質詢 
"Well, the US federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse. ",宜家你會諗，點解要結婚？ 
"A list that includes visitation rights in jail, but hopefully, you'll never need that one. ",基本上美國政府會對已婚者 提供超過一千項福利 
"But beyond the profound federal perks, married people make more money. ",包括另一半坐監時探監嘅權利 ——但我諗你哋唔需要呢樣啦 
"We're healthier, physically and emotionally. ",除咗呢啲福利 已婚夫婦嘅收入更高 
"We produce happier, more stable and more successful kids. ",身體更健康 心智更開朗 
"We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends, believe it or not. ",我哋可以培育更健康、更穩重 同更成功嘅下一代 
"We even live longer, which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place. ",信唔信都好，我哋比單身嘅朋友 有更多嘅性生活 
"(Laughter) Now, if you're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return, I can't tell you how to find a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness, who prefers horror movies and doesn't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce, but I can only encourage you to try, because the benefits, as I've pointed out, are significant. ",我哋活得更長命 你亦可以用長命做理由 同你心儀嘅人講「我要同你結婚」 
"The bottom line is: whether you're in it or you're searching for it, I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting. ",（笑聲） 宜家你可能體驗唔到 夫婦共同報稅嘅好處 我教唔到你點揾到一個鐘意做家務 有幾乎理想嘅身材同魅力 又鐘意睇恐怖片 但身邊又唔多離婚嘅朋友嘅男人或女人 但係我只係可以建議你試一試 因為好處——正如我所講 對你好有影響 
So I hope you'll use the information I've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors. ,重點係︰無論你已婚 或者仲喺度揾另一半 我相信婚姻係一個 值得去經營同維護嘅公司 
"For instance, in my marriage, I'd say I'm doing OK. ",所以我希望你哋可以善用今日學到嘅嘢 用自己嘅強項嚟抗衡自己嘅風險 
"One the one hand, I have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome. ",例如，我覺得我個人嘅婚姻尚可啦 
So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up. ,喺一方面 我老公嘅身材冇得頂 仲好英俊 
"And like I said, we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up. ",所以我絕對有需要谷肥佢 
So we have to keep an eye on that. ,正如我所講 我哋有離婚嘅朋友秘密 或者無意咁想拆散我哋 
And we do like a cocktail or two. ,所以我哋要多加留意人哋嘅一舉一動 
"On the other hand, I have the fake happy picture thing. ",我哋有時仲會歎一兩杯雞尾酒 
"And also, my husband does a lot around the house, and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives. ",喺另一方面 我有好多假開心相 
So I've got all those things going for me. ,我老公又會不停咁做家務 亦喺有生之年樂意唔睇愛情喜劇 
"But just in case, I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon. ",於是我擁有美好婚姻嘅一切 
"And for the good of your relationships, I would encourage you to do the same. ",但為咗以防萬一 我會更加努力唔攞奧斯卡獎 
I'll see you at the bar. ,你哋為咗自己嘅婚姻 我建議你哋都做同樣嘅事 
(Laughter) (Applause) ,做完之後，我哋下次出嚟飲酒傾 
,（掌聲） 
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us. ,
"We perish, they survive; we have one life, they have many lives, and in each life they can mean different things. ",我哋人類創造嘅事物有一個特點 就係佢哋壽命好長，甚至超越人類 
"Which means that, while we all have one biography, they have many. ",就算人類滅亡，佢哋依然存在 我哋只有一條命 但佢哋卻能夠保存好多代 喺唔同嘅時代 佢哋代表嘅意義都唔一樣 
"I want this morning to talk about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies -- of one particular object, one remarkable thing. ",就好似當一個人一世只會有一份傳記 但一件文物因為經歷好多世紀 都唔會只得一份傳記 
"It doesn't, I agree, look very much. ",我想今日主題係 一件物件嘅一份傳記 正確嚟講係一件物件嘅好幾份傳記 我所講嘅物件非常之奇特 
It's about the size of a rugby ball. ,我同意佢睇起嚟冇咩特別 
"It's made of clay, and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape, covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun. ",大概就同一個橄欖球差唔多大 
"And as you can see, it's been knocked about a bit, which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879. ",由陶土做成 倒模成為圓柱體 有人先喺上面刻滿密密麻麻嘅文字 之後放喺太陽底下曬乾 
"But today, this thing is, I believe, a major player in the politics of the Middle East. ","唔難發現佢有一部分受損 受損其實好正常 因為佢有 2,500 歲嘞 直到 1879 年先至被挖出來 "
And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet. ,我相信呢件嘢喺中東政局上 扮演咗好重要嘅角色 
"The story begins in the Iran-Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces, the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change. ",呢件文物承載咗好多膾炙人口嘅故事 而呢啲故事到而家仲未結束 
"And I want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with, Belshazzar's feast -- because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war of 539 BC. ",故事係從兩伊戰爭嗰時開始嘅 亦係伊拉克被攻打、獨裁政權垮臺 政權改變嗰段時間開始嘅 
And the parallels between the events of 539 BC and 2003 and in between are startling. ,我會從上述一連串嘅事件當中 揀一段講起 我諗大部分嘅人應該都好熟呢個故事 就係伯沙撒嘅盛宴 因為我哋要講嘅 係公元前 539 年嘅兩伊戰爭 
"What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting, now in the National Gallery in London, illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures. ",公元前 539 年嘅兩伊戰爭 同公元 2003 年嘅兩伊戰爭 兩個戰爭嘅相似程度真係好令人意外 
And you all know roughly the story. ,宜家你哋睇到嘅係 現存於倫敦國家美術館嘅林布藍作品 呢幅畫描述希伯來經文中 先知但以理嘅預言 
"Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon. ",呢個故事你哋或多或少都知道少少 
"Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels. ",伯沙撒係尼布甲尼撒嘅仔 尼布甲尼撒征服咗以色列 再劫掠耶路撒冷 俘虜當地人民 將猶太人仲有神殿嘅神器帶返巴比倫 
And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon. ,佢褻瀆神殿再搜刮神殿嘅寶物 
"Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast. ",耶路撒冷神殿嘅大型金屬容器 都被帶返巴比倫 
"And in order to make it even more exciting, he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun, and he brings out the temple vessels. ",尼布甲尼撒嘅仔伯沙撒 決定辦一場宴會 
"He's already at war with the Iranians, with the king of Persia. ",為咗要炒熱氣氛 佢將褻瀆神嘅行為加入餘興節目當中 佢攞出神器…… 
"And that night, Daniel tells us, at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall, ""You are weighed in the balance and found wanting, and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians."" ",當時佢正喺度同伊朗人打仗 同波斯王打仗 
"And that very night Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell. ",嗰晚，但以理話畀我哋聽 喺宴會嘅關鍵時刻出現咗一隻手 嗰隻手喺牆上寫︰ 「你被秤喺天秤上，秤出你虧欠人， 你嘅國要交畀瑪代人同波斯人。」 
"It is, of course, a great moment in the history of the Jewish people. ",就喺嗰晚 波斯王居魯士出征巴比倫 就咁，伯沙撒嘅王國滅亡 
It's a great story. It's story we all know. ,當然對於希伯來人嚟講 呢段係非常重要嘅歷史 
The writing on the wall is part of our everyday language. ,呢個故事唔單止犀利，仲家傳戶曉 
"What happened next was remarkable, and it's where our cylinder enters the story. ",英文「牆上嘅字」就係咁嚟 
"Cyrus, king of the Persians, has entered Babylon without a fight -- the great empire of Babylon, which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean, falls to Cyrus. ",接落嚟發生嘅事十分精彩 就係同我哋剛才講嘅圓柱有關 
And Cyrus makes a declaration. ,波斯王居魯士不費一兵一卒 就得到巴比倫 巴比倫王國 一路從伊拉克中南部到地中海 最後都落喺居魯士度 
"And that is what this cylinder is, the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people. ",後來居魯士發表一項宣言 
"In ringing Babylonian -- it was written in Babylonian -- he says, ""I am Cyrus, king of all the universe, the great king, the powerful king, king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."" ",於是個宣言就刻喺個圓柱體上 所以圓柱嘅意義在︰ 上帝帶領統治者頒布宣言 叫佢推翻伊拉克暴君 令人民得享自由 
They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see. ,為咗低訊息畀巴比倫人 居魯士喺圓柱上用巴比倫文寫 「朕乃居魯士、宇宙之王、 偉大之王、強盛之王、 巴比倫之王、世界之王。」 
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. ,由此可見波斯人鐘意誇張講嘢 
"And it's written, as we'll see in due course, by very skilled P.R. consultants. ",亦係歷史上第一份 由戰勝國發佈嘅新聞稿 
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising. ,稍後我哋就會知道 呢段內容係由技巧高超嘅公關寫出嚟嘅 
"And what is the great king, the powerful king, the king of the four quarters of the world going to do? ",所以誇張成咁都冇咩大不了 
"He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon, he will at once let all the peoples that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar -- have captured and enslaved go free. ",咁接落嚟 嗰個偉大之王、強盛之王、世界之王 要做咩呢？ 
"And more important, he will let them all recover the gods, the statues, the temple vessels that had been confiscated. ",佢接著又講，既然已經征服巴比倫 佢馬上要畀嗰啲 被巴比倫人俘嘅 尼布甲尼撒人同伯沙撒人 重獲自由同返返家鄉 
"All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home, and they'll take with them their gods. ",但更重要嘅係 佢仲歸還咗曾被沒收嘅 神像、塑像以及神器 
"And they'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way, in their own place. ",於是 所有被巴比倫人鎮壓、被趕走嘅人 都可以回家 都能夠帶埋佢哋嘅神返去 
"This is the decree, this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews, after the exile in Babylon, the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon, weeping when they remembered Jerusalem, those Jews were allowed to go home. ",佢哋亦都可以重修祭壇 以佢哋嘅方式、喺屬於佢哋嘅地方 崇拜佢哋嘅神 
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple. ,所以呢件文物就係最好嘅證物 證明猶太人流亡到巴比倫之後 坐喺巴比倫水邊為耶路撒冷而啜泣 到最後重獲自由嘅嗰段歲月 
It's a central document in Jewish history. ,佢哋得以返回耶路撒冷重建神殿 
"And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms. ",呢段係猶太歷史中嘅核心文獻 
This is the Jewish version of the same story. ,喺希伯來經文中嘅《歷代志》 同《以斯拉記》之中 都有記載到同一件事 
"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia, 'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem. 
Who is there among you of his people? 
The Lord God be with him, and let him go up.' ""Go up"" -- aaleh. ",猶太版本裏面 
"The central element, still, of the notion of return, a central part of the life of Judaism. ",波斯王居魯士話︰ 「耶和華天上嘅神 已將天下萬國賜畀我， 又囑咐我 喺猶大嘅耶路撒冷為佢建造殿宇。 
"As you all know, that return from exile, the second temple, reshaped Judaism. ",你哋凡做佢子民嘅， 
"And that change, that great historic moment, was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia, reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay. ",可以上去。 願你與耶和華同在。」 至於「上去」 
"Two great texts, what about the politics? ",即重返耶路撒冷，呢個想法 依然係猶太教文化嘅核心 
What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history. ,相信大家都知 耶路撒冷嘅回歸，以至日後嘅第二神殿 都重塑咗猶太教 
"The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians, united under Cyrus, became the first great world empire. ",呢個改變係歷史上嘅重要一刻 亦係全靠波斯王居魯士實現 佢仲將件事寫喺希伯來文經文裏邊 同用巴比倫文寫喺陶器上 
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC. ,所以兩份都係好優秀嘅文獻 咁政治方面又係點呢？ 
"And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control. ",接落嚟發生嘅事 對中東歷史產生咗重大嘅轉變 
"This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it. ",居魯士統治伊朗帝國、瑪代人同波斯人 建立世上第一個大帝國 
It was the largest empire the world had known until then. ,居魯士嘅霸業從西元前 530 年開始 
"Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale. ",及至佢個仔大流士時 整個地中海東部都納入咗波斯帝國版圖 
And it had to be run in a quite new way. ,事實上，呢個帝國 即係我哋宜家所知嘅中東 因為有呢個帝國，先至有宜家嘅中東 
It had to be run in different languages. ,波斯帝國係當時世界上最大嘅帝國 
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing. ,更重要嘅係 佢係第一個大規模出現多元文化 同多元信仰嘅國家 
"And it had to recognize their different habits, different peoples, different religions, different faiths. ",所以佢必須以新嘅方式治理 
All of those are respected by Cyrus. ,必須以各種語言運作 
"Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society. ",巴比倫語版本嘅政令就證明真有此事 
"And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen, and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander. ",波斯帝國必須包容國內 唔同嘅習俗、種族、宗教、信仰 
"It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit, and a unit where people of different faiths could live together. ",居魯士不單尊重呢啲差異 
The Greek invasions ended that. ,居魯士仲樹立咗典範 教我哋點樣治理 一個蘊含多元種族、信仰同文化嘅社會 
"And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented. ",結果就係 佢建立咗一個橫跨好多地方嘅大帝國 就好似螢幕見到一樣 呢個帝國維持咗 200 年咁耐 直到亞歷山大出現為止 
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central. ,波斯帝國為統一中東埋下伏筆 雖則統一，但唔同信仰嘅人都可以共融 
"The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book ""Cyropaedia"" promoting Cyrus as the great ruler. ",但係希臘人入侵令統一夢落空 
"And throughout European culture afterward, Cyrus remained the model. ",因為亞歷山大無力維持政權 令呢個帝國隨後四分五裂 
This is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was. ,但居魯士所代表嘅仍然係文化核心 
And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution. ,喺希臘史學家色諾芬所寫嘅書 《居魯士嘅教育》 佢推崇居魯士係偉大嘅統治者 
Jefferson was a great admirer -- the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state. ,及至喺日後歐洲文化裏面 居魯士仍然係一個不朽嘅典範 
"Meanwhile, back in Babylon, things had not been going well. ",呢幅係 16 世紀時嘅圖畫 用嚟證明啲人推崇居魯士到有幾交關 
"After Alexander, the other empires, Babylon declines, falls into ruins, and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon. ",色諾芬喺書中描述 居魯士點樣治理一個多元嘅社會 而呢本書非常之偉大 因為佢啟發咗發起美國獨立戰爭嘅人 
And it enters now another story. ,傑佛遜就係其中一位仰慕居魯士嘅人 居魯士示範咗 要點樣喺 18 世紀嘅新國家當中 創造寬容嘅宗教氛圍 
It enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century: Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them? ,宜家我哋返到巴比倫 但嗰度嘅情況似乎唔太樂觀 
We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures. ,喺亞歷山大之後 巴比倫日漸衰落 所有證明巴比倫曾經強盛嘅證據 都消失匿跡 直到 1879 年 大英博物館嘅人員 喺巴比倫挖出嘅呢個圓柱 
No other evidence. ,宜家又喺另一個故事嘞 
"Suddenly, this appeared. ",19 世紀中葉時 曾經有一場大規模嘅辯論 就係「經文真係可信嗎？ 我哋應該信經文嗎？」 
"And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution, by geology, here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true. ",喺希伯來經文裏邊 我哋只能瞭解到 猶太人嘅回歸同居魯士嘅法令 
It's a great 19th century moment. ,當我哋搵唔到其他證據時 
"But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true, hurrah for archeology, but the interpretation was rather more complicated. ",進化論同地質學卻開始冒起 
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect. ,震驚當時相信經文同創世紀嘅人 但有證據指經文內容係真嘅 
"The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk. ",所以呢個係 19 世紀嘅偉大時刻 
"And, not surprisingly, they tell you that all this was done by Marduk. ",但從此以後，事情越嚟越複雜 要點樣去詮釋經文，係更加困難嘅課題 
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name. ",因為圓柱所陳述嘅 同希伯來經文中陳述嘅 有一個主要嘅差異 
"Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand, calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon. ",圓柱體上嘅巴比倫語 係由信奉巴比倫之神 馬爾杜克嘅祭司所寫嘅 
"Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great, generous things of setting the people free. ",可想而知 佢哋會講︰ 「呢一切都係馬爾杜克嘅神蹟， 
And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk. ,我哋所信奉嘅神馬爾杜克召喚居魯士。 
"The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament, you will not be surprised to learn, take a rather different view of this. ",馬爾杜克拉著居魯士嘅手， 命佢帶領佢嘅子民， 並授予佢統治巴比倫嘅權力。 
"For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen. ",馬爾杜克同居魯士講， 佢會釋放異族人民。 
It can only be Jehovah. ,咁偉大而慷慨嘅壯舉 就係我哋要感激同崇拜 馬爾杜克嘅原因。」 
"And so in Isaiah, we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this, not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name, also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people. ",而喺希伯來嘅舊約聖經 作者對呢件事有截然不同嘅睇法 但其實又冇咩好驚奇嘅 
"It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event, two different religious takeovers of a political fact. ",當然對佢哋嚟講 呢一切絕唔可能係馬爾杜克嘅功勞 
"God, we know, is usually on the side of the big battalions. ",因為只有係耶和華先做得到 
"The question is, which god was it? ",以賽亞書寫話︰ 「功勞皆屬以色列嘅主， 而唔係馬爾杜克。 以色列嘅主同樣召喚咗居魯士， 同樣拉住居魯士嘅手， 同樣命佢管好佢嘅子民。」 
And the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion. ,呢個例子講明 同一件事可以有不同嘅宗教詮釋 或者同一件政治事件 可以有不同嘅宗教取態 
"And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah, and yet, Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk. ",我哋都知道神多數站喺強大嘅一方 
"And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this, because he says, this is God speaking, of course, ""I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me."" ",問題係，到底邊個嘅神做嘅？ 
I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah. ,呢場辯論，令 19 世紀嘅人睇到 希伯來經文 只係偌大嘅宗教世界嘅一小部分 
"And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk. ",可以肯定嘅係 圓柱比以賽亞書更早出現 而耶和華所講嘅語言 同馬爾杜克所講嘅十分類似 
"Because interestingly, of course, Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts. ",以賽亞知道呢件事，應該唔合理 因為佢話——當然係神嘅話語︰ 「你哋雖然唔識我， 但我叫你哋個名。」 
(Laughter) That's 1879. ,我諗大家都同意 居魯士並唔知自己 依照緊耶和華嘅指令行事 
"40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world. ",同樣，如果佢知道 佢係聽咗馬爾杜克嘅話先做呢件事 
"This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return. ",佢會嚇一大跳 因為有趣嘅係，居魯士係伊朗人 而伊朗人會拜神 喺呢兩份經文中 根本就冇提過伊朗人嗰班嘅神 
And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic. ,（笑聲） 呢年係 1879 年 
"And across Eastern Europe, Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem. ",再過 40 年 我哋嚟到 1917 年 亦係呢個圓柱體進入另一個世界嘅一年 
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan. ,1917 年可以話係現代政治嘅一年 因為呢年發表咗貝爾福宣言 而且中東嘅新王國同英國 決定建立一個猶太人國家 畀猶太人返去建國 
You all know what happened. ,東歐嘅嘅猶太人一聽到就反應熱烈 
"The state of Israel is setup, and 50 years later, in the late 60s, it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over. ",幾乎到咗瘋狂嘅地步 因為整個東歐嘅猶太人 會將居魯士同喬治五世嘅畫像平排展示 因為呢兩位偉大君王都曾經 應允猶太人回歸耶路撒冷 
And another story of the cylinder begins. ,呢一刻居魯士圓柱 又再一次吸引大眾嘅目光 圓柱上嘅文字描繪咗 1918 年戰事完結之後發生嘅事 亦視為係神嘅旨意嘅一部份 
"The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide, has to be kept safe from communism, and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran, the Shah. ",我諗大家都清楚接住落嚟嘅事 
"And so the Shah invents an Iranian history, or a return to Iranian history, that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder. ",以色列復國 然後再多 50年 到 1960 年代尾，英國失去咗帝國地位 
"When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis, he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran, and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty. ",但同時圓柱體嘅另一段故事就開始咗 
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah. ,英國同美國決定 為咗唔令以色列受到共產主義嘅荼毒 英美於是建立咗伊朗、推舉咗伊朗王 
"10 years later, another story: Iranian Revolution, 1979. ",於是伊朗王建立伊朗歷史 或者可以話帶領伊朗重回歷史正軌 令伊朗王自己成為伊朗傳統嘅核心 伊朗王下令發行 刻有自己肖像以及居魯士圓柱嘅硬幣 
"Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus; we're not interested in that history, we're interested in Islamic Iran -- until Iraq, the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region, attacks. ",伊朗王喺波斯波利斯舉行慶典時 希望居魯士圓柱能回歸伊朗 於是大英博物館借出圓柱 運往德黑蘭 用嚟做巴列為王朝慶典 
Then another Iran-Iraq war. ,居魯士圓柱就係伊朗王權力嘅保證 
"And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past, their great past when they fought Iraq and won. ",十年過後 喺1979 年嘅伊朗革命裏面 發生咗另一段故事 
"It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians -- Muslims and non-Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran, people who are devout, not devout. ",今次唔再講居魯士圓柱 因為伊斯蘭革命先係主角 我哋有興趣嘅係 俾伊拉克打之前嘅伊斯蘭時期嘅伊朗 當時伊拉克被公認為區內大國 
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus. ,而呢場又係另一場兩伊戰爭 
"So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together, as we've been doing, the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan. ",伊朗喺呢場仗裏面致勝關鍵在於 伊朗人記得佢哋輝煌嘅過去 
It's the only object they want. ,同時揾到一個團結嘅象徵 令所有伊朗人團結一致 唔理係伊斯蘭教徒、非伊斯蘭教徒 定係基督教徒、祆教徒、伊朗嘅猶太人 虔誠嘅人、唔虔誠嘅人 
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder. ,都因為居魯士圓柱而團結 
"And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time. ",所以當大英博物館 同德黑蘭國家博物館合作時 就好似我哋一直以嚟做緊一樣 伊朗人只係同我哋借一樣嘢 
"It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions, Mrs. Ardakani. ",佢哋只想要呢樣嘢 
It was a huge event. ,佢哋想借嘅就係居魯士圓柱 
This is the other side of that same picture. ,嚿年 居魯士圓柱第二次運往德黑蘭 
It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months. ,正如你哋見到嘅 佢由德黑蘭國家博物館館長 艾達卡妮女士親手放入盒裡邊 艾達卡妮女士同好多伊朗婦女一樣 坐到好高職位 
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West. ,嗰次圓柱入盒係大事 
"And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means, but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland, the champion, of course, of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples, tolerant of all faiths. ",呢張係另一張相，但拍攝角度相反 
"And in the current Iran, Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of. ",幾個月之後 已經有一二百萬人嚟過呢度 一睹居魯士圓柱嘅風采 
"To see this object in Tehran, thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it. ",咁嘅人次超過西方國家 最高嘅展覽入場人次 
"It became a great emblem, a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad. ",今次展覧引發啲人辯論圓柱嘅意義 同居魯士想表達嘅係乜 但最終，居魯士就好似圓柱描述咁 係守衛家園嘅勇士 係伊朗人心目中嘅英雄 同埋各信仰裏面嘅精神人物 
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed? ,喺現代伊朗議會 有一啲席位係留畀祆教徒同基督教徒 
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated? ,呢個係值得引以為傲嘅事 數以千計嘅猶太人從伊朗趕到德黑蘭 就為咗睇居魯士圓柱嘅廬山真面目 
"This is heady national rhetoric, and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return. ",圓柱係偉大嘅象徵 亦係用嚟辯論伊朗對內與對外嘅意義 
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran. ,伊朗仲會唔會 為被欺壓嘅人民挺身而出？ 
It was a narrative presented by the president himself. ,伊朗會唔會 畀被暴君奴役、剝削嘅人重獲自由？ 
"And for me, to take this object to Iran, to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is, what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today. ",呢個係好多人討論嘅全國議題 呢個議題仲喺一次 慶祝文物回歸嘅盛會之中討論 
"It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration. ",相裏邊係放大版嘅居魯士圓柱 同好多伊朗歷史偉人 
It stands with the American constitution. ,伊朗總統喺展覽開幕當日親自發表演講 
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta. ,對我嚟講，能夠將居魯士圓柱帶返伊朗 代表圓柱能夠成為 一場高層次、偉大辯論嘅材料 去探討伊朗嘅定位 探討世界上存在著幾多個伊朗 探討伊朗唔同嘅歷史 點樣塑造今日嘅世界 
"It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region. ",呢場辯論仲未結束 正反論述會繼續出現 居魯士圓柱係人類其中一個 申明己志嘅物件 
A replica of this is at the United Nations. ,佢嘅地位有如美國憲法咁高 
"In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place. ",佢肯定比大憲章 更能論述咩叫真正嘅自由 
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures. ,佢亦係一份文獻 對伊朗同成個地區有好多嘅意義 
"It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories. ",居魯士圓柱嘅複製品存放喺聯合國 
"And what story of the Middle East, what story of the world, do you want to see reflecting what is said, what is expressed in this cylinder? ",今年秋天喺紐約辯論中東未來嘅會上 你會見到佢嘅蹤影 
"The right of peoples to live together in the same state, worshiping differently, freely -- a Middle East, a world, in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate. ",我希望以一個問題完結我今日嘅演講 居魯士圓柱接住會咩新故事呢？ 
"In the world of the Middle East at the moment, the debates are, as you know, shrill. ",可以肯定嘅係 居魯士圓柱會出現喺更多中東故事裏邊 
"But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing, the Cyrus cylinder. ",而你哋想 中東，以至全世界會有點樣嘅故事 去應驗圓柱所講嘅嘢呢？ 
Thank you. ,意思係，不同種族、不同信仰嘅人民 能夠喺同一個國家自由生活 做唔同嘅事 意思係，無論係中東 抑或係世界嘅任何一角落 宗教唔分化人或者引起紛爭 
(Applause) ,但喺宜家嘅中東世界 紛爭，依然激烈 
,但我相信 喺紛爭當中，最明智、最強大嘅聲音 好可能係靜默嘅居魯士圓柱 
"(Applause) (Video) Announcer: Threats, in the wake of Bin Laden's death, have spiked. ",多謝 
Announcer Two: Famine in Somalia. Announcer Three: Police pepper spray. ,（掌聲） 
Announcer Four: Vicious cartels. Announcer Five: Caustic cruise lines. ,
Announcer Six: Societal decay. Announcer Seven: 65 dead. ,（掌聲） （賓拉登死後，威脅層出不窮。） 
Announcer Eight: Tsunami warning. Announcer Nine: Cyberattacks. ,（索馬利亞嘅飢荒。） （警方用嘅胡椒噴霧。）

Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years. ,（經濟衰退。債務拖欠。 世界末日。埃及。敘利亞。） 
The point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to. ,（危機。死亡。災難。） 
And there's a very good reason for that. ,「喔！我嘅天啊！」 
"Every second of every day, our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains. ",呢啲新聞頭條只係我喺過去六個月 收集到嘅一小部分 同過去六日嘅頭條 或者過去六年嘅頭條冇咩差別 
"And because nothing is more important to us than survival, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala. ",重點係，新聞媒體 鐘意報導負面新聞 因為呢類新聞可以吸引我哋關注 
"Now the amygdala is our early warning detector, our danger detector. ",理由係 
It sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us. ,每日 我哋接收嘅資訊 超過我哋大腦負荷 
"So given a dozen news stories, we will preferentially look at the negative news. ",對我哋嚟講 冇嘢比生存更加重要 我哋嘅大腦接收信息嘅第一站 係一片發現已久嘅 叫做「扁桃體」嘅腦葉 
"And that old newspaper saying, ""If it bleeds it leads,"" is very true. ",扁桃體係我哋身體最初期嘅 警告同危險偵測系統 
"So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we're pessimistic. ",佢搜尋同整理所有訊息 揾出喺環境裡邊對我哋有害嘅物質 
It's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse. ,所以喺眾多嘅新聞裡邊 我哋會鍾意睇 負面嘅新聞 
But perhaps that's not the case. ,有一份舊報紙寫話： 「有血嘅嘢最好賣。」 呢句嘢好啱 
"Perhaps instead, it's the distortions brought to us of what's really going on. ",宜家各種數碼設備 一個禮拜七日、一日 24 小時 猛咁對我哋輸啲負面新聞 唔怪得我哋咁悲觀 
"Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are, in fact, accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance. ",難怪啲人諗 世界越來越冇希望 
"Now I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems -- climate crisis, species extinction, water and energy shortage -- we surely do. ",事實上可能唔係噉 
"And as humans, we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance, but ultimately we knock them down. ",其實，有可能係 媒體帶畀我哋嘅消息 係扭曲咗嘅 
So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going. ,可能我哋喺上個世紀 藉一連串努力 而創造嘅進步 加速到一個位 使我哋喺未來三十年有潛力 去創造一個富足嘅世界 
"Over the last hundred years, the average human lifespan has more than doubled, average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled. ",我唔係話 我哋冇問題 氣候危機、物種滅絕、水源同能源匱乏 呢哋問題都一直存在 
Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10. ,身為人類，我哋比其他動物 早睇到問題好多 然後我哋解決呢哋問題 
"Add to that the cost of food, electricity, transportation, communication have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold. ",我哋睇下 上個世紀到底發生咗咩事 同我哋下一步會去邊到 
"Steve Pinker has showed us that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history. ",過去百幾年嚟 人類嘅平均壽命係以前嘅兩倍 通貨膨脹調整之後 嘅各國平均國民所得 係以前嘅三倍 
And Charles Kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years. ,童年嘅死亡率 都下降到原來嘅十分之一 
We truly are living in an extraordinary time. ,仲有，糧食、電能、 交通、通訊嘅花費 變成以前嘅十分之一到千分之一 
And many people forget this. ,史迪芬．平克話俾我哋聽 宜家係 人類史上最和平嘅時代 
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher. ,Charles Kenny 話 過去 130 年，全球識字率 從 25% 升到 80% 
"In fact, we redefine what poverty means. ",我哋宜家生活喺一個黃金時期 
"Think of this, in America today, the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile phones, air conditioning and cars. ",但係好多人都唔記得呢樣嘢 
"The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet, could have never dreamed of such luxuries. ",我哋不斷噉將期望設得越來越高 
"Underpinning much of this is technology, and of late, exponentially growing technologies. ",事實上，我哋重寫咗貧窮嘅定義 
"My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law, and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months. ",諗下宜家嘅美國 喺貧窮線以下嘅大多數人 都仲擁有水、電、馬桶、冰箱 電視、手機 甚至冷氣同車 
That's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s. ,上個世紀最富有嘅強盜、貴族、國王 都冇呢啲奢侈品 
Now look at this curve. ,令呢種現象出現 全靠以前嘅科技 以至最近嘅 幾何級數發展嘅科技 
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years. ,我嘅好朋友 Ray Kurzweil 畫咗一幅圖 說明只要物件變成資訊科技工具 就會按著摩爾定律嘅曲線 每一至兩年 性能就會翻倍 
I want you to notice two things from this curve. ,咁就係點解你哋衫袋裡邊嘅手機 比起 70 年代嘅超級電腦 仲要平咗一百萬倍 同快咗一千倍 
"Number one, how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time, war time and peace time, recession, depression and boom time. ",睇下呢個曲線 
This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers. ,呢個係一百幾年前嘅摩爾定律 
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges. ,留意下呢條曲線上嘅兩樣嘢 
"And also, even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left, it's curving upwards. ",第一，條曲綫好平穩 唔受時期嘅好壞，或者戰爭同和平 經濟衰退、低迷或者繁榮嘅影響 
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster. ,個結果就係速度快嘅電腦 用來造更快嘅電腦 
"And on this curve, riding on Moore's Law, are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us. ",電腦冇因爲任何我哋面對嘅問題而慢咗 
"Cloud computing, what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing; sensors and networks; robotics; 3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet; synthetic biology; fuels, vaccines and foods; digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I. ",雖然曲線圖採用咗 對數曲線 佢嘅方向係向上嘅 
"I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM's Watson? ",即係，科技進步嘅比率 越來越快 
"I mean, that was epic. ",喺呢條摩爾定律曲線上邊 係一連串可供我哋利用嘅 強大而先進嘅科技 
"In fact, I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could. ",我喺 Autodesk 嘅朋友 叫雲端運算做無限運算 感應器。網路。自動化設備 3D 印刷有可能喺全球將產品 大眾化同人性化 人造生物學 燃料、疫苗同食物 數位醫學。納米材料。人工智慧 
"And I love this: ""Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents."" ",在座有幾多人睇到 IBM 沃森 喺《危險邊緣》贏通街？ 
Jeopardy's not an easy game. ,嗰次個節目真係好經典 
It's about the nuance of human language. ,我摷勻好多報紙 想揾個最好嘅頭條 
And imagine if you would A.I.'s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone. ,我好鐘意呢個：《沃森擊敗人類對手》 
"Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University. ",《危險邊緣》呢個比賽好難 
"And we teach our students all of these technologies, and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges. ",字眼上差小小，答案就唔一樣 
And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade. ,想像一下 呢種雲端嘅人工智慧 喺人人嘅手機度都有 
"Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today. ",四年前喺 TED Ray Kurzweil 同我創辦咗 一間叫「奇點大學」嘅新大學 
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous. ,我哋向學生傳授呢啲全部嘅科技 尤其係點樣用嚟 解決人類面對嘅巨大挑戰 
Today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that. ,每一年， 我哋要求佢哋 開新公司、開發新產品或者新服務 希望喺十年內 幫助到十億人 
"When I think about creating abundance, it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet; it's about creating a life of possibility. ",試諗下，呢班學生真係 可以幫到十億人 
It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant. ,呢種諗法喺 30 年前係幾荒唐 
"You see, scarcity is contextual, and technology is a resource-liberating force. ",宜家我哋可以講出邊間公司 喺度做緊呢件事 
Let me give you an example. ,對我來講，創造富足嘅社會 唔係話要世界上 每個人都享受奢華生活 而係要創造出生活嘅可能性 
So this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid-1800s. ,係要使我哋缺乏嘅嘢 變得豐富 
He's the dude on the left. ,每個人缺乏嘅嘢唔同 而科技係一個解放資源嘅力量 
He invited over to dinner the king of Siam. ,我舉個例 
"All of Napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils, Napoleon himself with gold utensils. ",呢個係十八世紀中葉 關於拿破崙三世嘅故事 
"But the King of Siam, he was fed with aluminum utensils. ",佢就係左邊嗰個人 
"You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and platinum. ",佢邀請暹羅國王 共進晚餐 
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum. ,拿破崙嘅成個軍隊 用銀製餐具 拿破崙自己就用金製餐具 
"You see, even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass, it doesn't come as a pure metal. ",但係暹羅國王 用嘅竟然係鋁製餐具 
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates. ,原來 鋁曾經係世上最貴嘅金屬 甚至貴過黃金同埋白金 
But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality. ,咁就係點解華盛頓紀念碑嘅頂端 係由鋁所製成 
So let's project this analogy going forward. ,雖然鋁嘅礦量 佔地球質量嘅 8.3% 但係金屬鋁好罕見 鋁多數喺礦物裡邊 
We think about energy scarcity. ,佢多數同氧或者矽酸鹽 反應生成化合物 
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year. ",有咗電解科技之後 提煉鋁就變得好平 平到用完就掟 
16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface every 88 minutes. ,如此類推 
"It's not about being scarce, it's about accessibility. ",我哋試諗下能源缺乏 
And there's good news here. ,"各位 我哋生活緊嘅地球，係一個 擁有我哋一年用嘅能源 5,000 倍嘅星球 "
"For the first time, this year the cost of solar-generated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India -- 8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees. ",每 88 分鐘就有 16 兆瓦嘅能源 來到地球嘅表面 
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year. ,所以問題唔係缺乏 而係獲取能源嘅途徑 
"Last month, MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average. ",有個好消息 
"And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water. ",今年係印度有史以來第一次 太陽能發電嘅花費 係柴油發電嘅一半 8.8 盧比對 17 盧比 
Now we talk about water wars. ,舊年太陽能發電花費就降咗一半 
"Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth, in 1990 after it just passed Saturn? ",上個月麻省理工學院發表咗一項研究 話喺 2020 年之前 美國陽光充足嘅地區 太陽能電嘅平均價格 會降到 6 仙美金一度 宜家平均一度要 1 毫 5 仙美元 
He took a famous photo. What was it called? ,我哋有咗充足嘅能源 我哋就會有充足嘅水源 
Because we live on a water planet. ,我哋來講下水源嘅戰爭 
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water. ,你記唔記得 1990 年 無人探測船航海家 1 號 飛過土星之後 卡爾．薩根叫探測船擰轉身 同太陽系影張全家福 
"Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet, but here too there is hope. ",嗰張相好出名，叫咩？ 
"And there is technology coming online, not 10, 20 years from now, right now. ",《蒼藍小點》 我哋住喺一個水星球 
"There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials. ",一個 70% 嘅表面俾水覆蓋嘅星球 
"And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators, I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator. ",其中 97.5% 係鹹水 2% 係冰 我哋喺度爭地球上 0.5% 嘅水 
"It's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- saltwater, polluted water, latrine -- at less than two cents a liter. ",天無絕人之路 有一個新科技出現咗 唔係喺十、二十年後 係宜家 
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world. ,納米科技同納米材料誕生咗 
"And if that pans out, which I have every confidence it will, Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet. ",我今朝同 Dean Kamen 傾偈 佢係一個偉大嘅 DIY 發明家 佢畀我同你哋分享 佢嘅發明︰「Slingshot」 可能好多人都聽過 佢係一個宿舍用嘅冰箱噉大 
"This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology, that exists today. ",佢可以 每日淨化一千升嘅水 咩水都可以淨化 鹹水、污染水、廁所污水 而且成本低於一升 2 仙美元 
And we've seen this in cellphones. ,可口可樂董事長啱啱批准咗 一個大規模嘅實驗 喺發展中國家試用幾百套呢種設備 
"My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013. ",如果成功—— 當然我有信心佢會成功 可口可樂公司就會 將呢個計畫推廣至 全球 206 個國家 
"Think about it, that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did 25 years ago. ",呢種創新就係 現代科技帶來嘅 
"And if they're on a smartphone on Google, they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago. ",手機就係表表者 
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted. ,天啊，喺 2013 之前 手機喺開發中國家嘅使用率 就嚟達到 70% 
"Better than that, the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS, HD video and still images, libraries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone. ",試諗下 一個肯尼亞馬賽族戰士用嘅手機 比 25 年前雷根總統在位時 
Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health. ,用嘅通訊產品仲要好 如果佢哋用谷歌嘅智能手機 佢哋就比 15 年前克林頓總統在位時 
"Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize. ",接收到更多嘅知識同資訊 佢哋生活喺一個 資訊同通訊都充足嘅世界 冇人原本預料到嘅 
"We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to, because it's got A.I., you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick. ",更好嘅係 以前花費 好幾十萬美金嘅嘢： GPS、高畫質影片、靜止圖像 書庫、音樂庫 醫療診斷科技 宜家都漸漸融入 你哋嘅手機度 
"And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors. ",而最好嘅係 醫療成本會下降 
"So literally, imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers. ",上個月我好榮幸同高通基金會一齊宣布 高通 Tricorder X 大獎 
"When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recognize, it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place. ",我哋向全球嘅參賽者提出挑戰 要求將呢啲全部功能 融合入一個移動設備度 佢要有人工智慧，令你可以同佢講嘢 你可以對佢咳或者做手指血液採樣 
"But here, here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance. ",要贏得呢個獎，個儀器嘅診斷技術 要好過一隊摞牌營業嘅醫師 
I call it the rising billion. ,想像一下呢個儀器 可以被用喺缺乏醫生嘅發展中國家 發展中國家有全世界 25% 嘅病症 但係只有全世界 1.3% 嘅醫務人員 
So the white lines here are population. ,當呢個儀器遇到一個 RNA 或者 DNA 排列 係佢未見過嘅 佢就會通報美國疾病防治中心 進而防止疾病從一個地區蔓延開去 
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth. ,至於為世界帶來富足嘅 最強大力量 
"And by the way, the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy. ",我叫佢做「上升十億」 
"In 2010, we had just short of two billion people online, connected. ",白線代表人口 
"By 2020, that's going from two billion to five billion Internet users. ",我哋啱啱超過咗七十億大關 
Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation. ,順便提一下 防止人口爆炸嘅最大力量 就是教育 同埋醫療 
What will these people want? ,喺 2010 年 全球有唔到 20 億人口 上網 
What will they consume? What will they desire? ,到 2020 年 網民從 20 億 躍進到 50 億 
"And rather than having economic shutdown, we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever. ",新加入嘅 30 億人口 之前從來冇上過網 但佢哋終於能夠同個世界對話 
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy. ,呢啲人想要咩？ 
"And they will get healthier by using the Tricorder, and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy, and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing [become] more productive than ever before. ",佢哋會消費咩？佢哋渴望咩？ 
"So what could three billion rising, healthy, educated, productive members of humanity bring to us? ",經濟唔會再蕭條 而係要迎接有史以來最繁榮嘅經濟 
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before. ,呢啲人意味著 有幾十兆美元 投入全球嘅經濟市場 
"What about giving the oppressed, wherever they might be, the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever? ",佢哋就會藉由 Tricorder 診斷儀器變得更健康 同藉由可漢學院接受好嘅教育 佢哋可以藉使用 3D 打印技術同無限運算功能 變得更有生產力 
What will these three billion people bring? ,所以呢 30 億 健康、教育良好同高生産力嘅人口 能帶畀我哋咩？ 
What about contributions we can't even predict? ,之前講到被忽視嘅聲音 
"The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past. ",世界各地 被壓迫嘅聲音 宜家終於會被聽到 同受重視 
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited. ,呢 30 億人能帶來咩？ 
There is a program that some of you might have heard of. ,佢哋帶來嘅貢獻可能冇人可以估算 
It's a game called Foldit. ,我喺 X 大獎學到嘅一件事 就係即使係一個細團隊 當佢嘅目標明確同俾熱情所驅動 都可以做一番大事業 完成喺以前 只有大企業同政府先至作到嘅事 
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle. ,最尾，我想分享一個故事 佢真係好激勵我 
And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold. ,應該有人聽過呢個項目 
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality. ,有個遊戲叫 Foldit 
And it's very important for research in medicine. ,佢係由西雅圖華盛頓大學開發嘅 
"And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem. ",佢係一個遊戲 玩家可以決定胺基酸嘅排列順序 進而計算出蛋白質跟住會點折疊 
And this game has been played by university professors and so forth. ,蛋白質嘅折疊決定咗佢嘅結構同埋功能 
"And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it. ",呢樣對藥物嘅研究好重要 
"And it showed that, in fact, today, the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers. ",目前為止，呢個問題得超級電腦先做到 
"And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder. ",呢個遊戲 最初俾大學教授之類嘅人玩 
"Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet. ",宜家有幾十萬人 上網玩緊 
We have the tools with this exponential technology. ,事實顯示 人類對模式嘅識別 好過宜家最好嘅電腦 
We have the passion of the DIY innovator. ,呢啲玩家都想知道 世界上最識折疊蛋白質嘅人係邊個 佢唔係麻省理工學院嘅一個教授 唔係加州理工學院嘅一個學生 佢係一個住喺英國曼徹斯特嘅女人 喺日頭 佢係一個復健診所嘅行政助理 到咗晚黑，她就係 世界上最會折疊蛋白質嘅人 
We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist. ,各位 係咩嘢令我 對未來非常有信心? 係因為我哋宜家活得更自主更有能力 可以應對各種巨大嘅挑戰 
"And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges, to do that which we must do. ",我哋嘅科技幾何級數發展 
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead. ,我哋有 DIY 發明家嘅熱情 
Thank you. ,我哋亦都有科技慈善家嘅資本 
(Applause) ,仲有 30 億第一次接觸互聯網嘅人 嚟幫我哋解決艱鉅嘅難題 做我哋應該做嘅嘢 
,未來嘅黃金年代等緊我哋 
"This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block. ",多謝 
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together. ,（掌聲） 
Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world. ,
"They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time. ",你哋可能會覺得好奇怪 但我實在太鍾意水泥磚喇 
Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time. ,世界上第一嚿水泥磚喺 1868 年製造 當時生產水泥磚得一個要求： 就係要有固定嘅尺寸 因為咁樣先能夠磚搭磚 
"Almost a hundred years later in 1947, LEGO came up with this. ",好快咁，水泥磚變成咗 世界上最常用嘅建築材料 
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick. ,我哋可以用佢嚟起建築物，例如屋、橋 一磚一磚咁建造 
"And in a few short years, LEGO bricks took place in every household. ",水泥磚已經成為現今嘅建材 
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet. ,大約一百年之後，喺 1947 年 樂高生產出呢個 
"You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings. ",佢哋稱為「自動組裝積木」嘅嘢 
LEGO made it accessible. ,短短幾年後 樂高積木成為咗每個家庭必備嘅玩具 
"LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination. ",據估計，樂高生產咗超過四千億嚿積木 平均全球每個人有 75 嚿積木 
"Meanwhile the exact same year, at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced, the next building block. ",你唔需要係工程師 都可以起到靚屋、靚橋 或者其它好靚嘅建築 
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive. ,樂高令你嘅想像變成實物 
"Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time. ",樂高運用水泥磚嘅概念 將佢轉化成發揮我哋想像力嘅積木 
But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts. ,喺同一年 貝爾實驗室準備發表 一個電路組件嘅革新︰電晶體 
"I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that. ",電晶體係一樣塑膠製嘅電子元件 佢會帶領我哋進入一個 積木靜止堆埋一齊 但係積木之間會產生作用嘅世界 
"Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers. ",雖然電晶體同水泥磚一樣 畀到你整更大、更複雜嘅電路 
A few years ago I started developing littleBits. ,但佢哋最大嘅差別係 電晶體係專門畀專家玩嘅 
Let me show you how they work. ,但我唔係好同意呢個講法 所以我想推翻呢個講法 
LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function. ,八年前我喺媒體實驗室 著手開發呢個計畫 就係點樣將工程師嘅技術 畀到藝術家同設計師用到？ 
"They're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors. ",幾年前我開始研發 littleBits 
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets. ,我畀你哋睇下佢點運作 
So you can't put them the wrong way. ,littleBits 係電子元件 每一小嚿都有特定嘅功能 
"Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire. ",佢哋設計成會發光、發聲 有電動功能同感應功能 
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits. ,而佢最好玩嘅部分就係 佢哋靠磁鐵連接埋一齊 
"You put a blue to a green, you can make light. ",所以你唔會搞錯佢哋嘅方向 
You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer. ,佢哋用顏色嚟區分 綠色係輸出，藍色係電源 粉紅色係輸入，橙色係電線 
"Switch out the knob for a pulse module, which is here, and now you've made a little blinker. ",只要將藍色同綠色連埋一齊 你就可以開始做啲大啲嘅電路 
Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine. ,藍色同綠色接埋一齊，佢就會發光 
"So beyond simple play, littleBits are actually pretty powerful. ",當你將旋鈕駁喺中間，你就可以較光暗 
"Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures. ",攞走旋鈕，換做脈衝元件 咁樣，你就可以整到閃光 
"So to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower. ",再加上一個聲音元件 咁你就整咗一個警報器 
The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library. ,不過佢好嘈呀 雖然呢啲示範睇落簡單 但 littleBits 其實好強大 
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick. ,要編寫 littleBits 我哋唔需要識寫程式 接電線或者焊接 只要做好簡單嘅直覺動作就得嘞 
"Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors -- everything should be accessible. ",要令佢閃得快啲或慢啲 你只需要轉下呢個掣就可以 
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them. ,littleBits 個構思係 佢係一個愈做愈大嘅知識庫 
And it's been an incredible experience. ,我哋都想呢一嚿現成嘅積木 做到各式各樣嘅功能︰ 
The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools. ,光、聲音、太陽能板、摩打等等 
"For example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch. ",我哋畀過小朋友玩 littleBits 
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools. ,呢個對小朋友嚟講真係好難得嘅體驗 
"So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material. ",好處係佢哋開始了解 每日圍繞佢哋 而學校又唔會教嘅嘅電子設備 
"Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles, we have Geordie making ... ",譬如一盞夜燈係點樣運作 或者電梯門點樣維持開住嘅狀態 又或者 iPod 嘅螢幕點樣對觸控有反應 
"(Clanging) (Buzzing) A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them ""Make something."" ",我哋都會將 littleBits 拎畀設計學校使用 
"Here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball. ",我哋仲令到一啲 完全無電子相關經驗嘅設計師 開始將 littleBits 當成一種材料 
"(Laughter) But wait, this is actually my favorite project. ",你睇，絨布同紙做嘅水瓶 喬迪整咗呢樣嘢⋯ 
It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark. ,（鈴聲） （叭 ~ 叭叭） 幾個禮拜前我哋將 littleBits 帶到 羅德島設計學院 介紹畀一啲同樣 無工程學相關經驗嘅設計師玩 我哋畀啲硬紙板、木板同紙佢哋 等佢哋做啲嘢 
"(Laughter) To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became just another material. ",畀一樣佢哋整嘅嘢你哋睇 「天女散花加農砲」 
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone. ,（笑聲） 但呢個真係我最鍾意嘅一個 
So littleBits is open-source. ,佢係用泥膠做嘅龍蝦 佢好怕黑 
"You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself. ",（笑聲） 對唔係工程師嘅人嚟講 littleBits 成為咗另一種材料 電子零件變咗一種材料 
"We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is ours. ",我哋希望呢種材料人人都用得到 
So go ahead and start inventing. ,littleBits 係個共享資源 
Thank you. ,你可以去我哋嘅網站下載設計稿 自己郁手做 
(Applause) ,我哋想啟發創作者、發明家同貢獻者 因為我哋住嘅呢個互動嘅世界 係屬於我哋嘅 
,所以，我哋一齊開始發明喇！ 
"Hi, my name is Frank, and I collect secrets. ",多謝 
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004. ,（掌聲） 
"I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards, just like this. ",
"They were blank on one side, and on the other side I listed some simple instructions. ",大家好，我叫 Frank 我收集人哋嘅秘密 
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they'd never told anyone before. ,而一切都源於我 2004 年 11 月一個瘋狂嘅諗法 
"And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington, D.C., not knowing what to expect. ",我當時打印咗三千張 已經印好回郵地址嘅明信片 就好似呢張一樣咁 
But soon the idea began spreading virally. ,呢啲明信片一面係空白嘅 而另一面有啲簡單指引 
People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards. ,我叫每個人匿名寫上 一個佢哋從未話過俾人知嘅秘密 
"I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox, not just with postmarks from Washington, D.C., but from Texas, California, Vancouver, New Zealand, Iraq. ",而我喺華盛頓街頭 隨機派發呢啲明信片 當時我都唔知結果會點 
Soon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy. ,但無幾耐呢個主意非常快傳出去 
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world. ,大家開始買同整自己嘅明信片 
And this is my postcard collection today. ,我開始喺我屋企信箱收到明信片 唔單只嚟自華盛頓 仲有德州、加州、溫哥華 紐西蘭、伊拉克呢啲地方 
You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets. ,再過多一陣 我呢個瘋狂主意開始無咁瘋狂 
"What I'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection, starting with this one. ",PostSecret.com 係世界上 最多人訪問嘅零廣告博客 
"I found these stamps as a child, and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to. 
I never did have someone. ",而呢個，就係我目前收集過嘅明信片 
Secrets can take many forms. ,你可以睇到我老婆 好努力咁將一磚明信片 放上一個有超過 50 萬 秘密明信片金字塔上 
They can be shocking or silly or soulful. ,而我宜家想做嘅事 係同你哋分享嗰啲明信片入邊 一啲非常特別嘅秘密 我哋從呢個開始啦 
They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet. ,「我細個揾到呢啲郵票。 我等咗一世人， 去等我可以將郵票寄俾某個人。 
(Laughter) Maybe one of you sent this one in. ,而我一直都無等到呢個人。」 
This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard. ,秘密有好多種形態 
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side. ,可以係驚訝嘅、傻奸奸嘅 或者震撼人心嘅 
"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents. 
I've found love. I'm happy. ",秘密可以將我哋連接到人性最深處 或者將我哋連到去從來未見過嘅人 
"Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas, of frailty and heroism, playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now. ",（笑聲） 可能你哋中間有一個人 寄咗呢張俾我 
Everyone who knew me before 9/11 believes I'm dead. ,我唔知 呢張明信片證明咗 當人整明信片俾我時 可以有嘅創作力量 
"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people, so sometimes I didn't wear panties, and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself. ",呢個好明顯用半個星巴克咖啡杯整 杯嘅另一面係一張郵票加我屋企地址 
(Laughter) This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you. ,「親愛嘅生母，我有好好嘅養父母， 
I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students. ,我搵到愛，我非常開心。」 
And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students. ,秘密可以令我哋諗起 無數同脆弱或者英雄主義有關 而又無聲無色喺身邊發生嘅人生戲劇 即使係今時今日亦都一樣 
And this next postcard was made out of one of those photos. ,「所有喺九一一之前識得我嘅人， 都以為我死咗。」 
"And I should also mention that, just like today, at that PostSecret event, I was using a wireless microphone. ",「我曾經同一班 好嚴謹嘅宗教人士一齊工作， 所以我有時會唔著底褲， 然後對自己偷笑。」 
"Your mic wasn't off during sound check. 
We all heard you pee. ",（笑聲） 跟住呢個，喺分享之前需要講解少少 
"(Laughter) This was really embarrassing when it happened, until I realized it could have been worse. ",我鐘意去學校演講 同埋同學生分享秘密同故事 
Right. You know what I'm saying. ,有時我講完之後 會留喺度簽書、同學生影相 
"(Laughter) ""Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn't use. ",跟住落嚟呢張明信片 就係從其中一張相製作而成 
"I feel like the happiest person on Earth (now.)"" ""One of these men is the father of my son. ",我同時想講嘅係，好似今日咁 喺嗰個 PostSecret 活動上 我係用無線咪 
"He pays me a lot to keep it a secret."" ",「你嗰咪試音期間無閂到， 
"(Laughter) ""That Saturday when you wondered where I was, well, I was getting your ring. ",所以我哋全部人聽到你屙尿。」 
"It's in my pocket right now."" ",（笑聲） 呢件事發生嘅時候真係好尷尬 不過我意識到其實可能會更加尷尬 
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine's Day. ,（笑聲） 係唔係？你明我講咩啦 
"It was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column. ",「呢封信裏邊， 有我一張無用到、撕碎咗嘅 自殺留言紙。 
And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard. ,我宜家感覺我係世界上最幸福嘅人。」 「呢張相入面其中一個男人 係我個仔嘅老豆， 
"And he said, ""Frank, I've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life."" ",佢俾咗我一大筆錢去保守呢個秘密。」 
"He said, ""My knees are still shaking."" ",（笑聲） 「你估緊我去邊度嘅嗰個星期六， 其實我喺度買戒指俾你。 
"He said, ""For three years, my girlfriend and I, we've made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud. ",隻戒指宜家喺我衫袋裡面。」 
"I read some to her, she reads some to me."" ",兩年前嘅情人節 我將呢張明信片放上 PostSecret 博客上 
"He says, ""It's really brought us closer together through the years. ",張明信片喺嗰頁最底、最尾 
"And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom, I was beside myself. ",但當呢張明信片只係擺咗幾個鐘 我就收到寄出呢張明信片嘅男人 發來嘅一封好開心嘅電郵 
"And I tried to act calm, not to give anything away. ",佢話︰「Frank，我一定要同你分享 呢件啱啱喺我生命中發生嘅事。 
"And just like every Sunday, we started reading the secrets out loud to each other."" ",佢話︰「我只腳仲有啲震。」 
"He said, ""But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one."" ",佢話，「三年嚟，女朋友同我 習慣禮拜日朝早 一齊去睇 PostSecret 博客， 同埋一齊大聲讀出上面嘅秘密。 
"She got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her. ",我讀俾佢聽，佢又讀俾我聽。」 
"And he said, ""She read it once and then she read it again."" ",佢跟住講，「咁多年嚟， 呢個習慣令我哋更加親密。 
"And she turned to him and said, ""Is that our cat?"" ",所以當我發覺 你將我對女朋友驚喜求婚嘅明信片 擺咗喺博客嘅最尾時， 我真係唔知點算。 
"(Laughter) And when she saw him, he was down on one knee, he had the ring out. ",所以我嘗試表現得好冷靜， 
"He popped the question, she said yes. It was a very happy ending. ",一句關於求婚嘅事都冇講。 然後就好似每個禮拜日咁， 我哋開始互相大聲讀出一啲秘密。」 
"So I emailed him back and I said, ""Please share with me an image, something, that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending."" ",佢話︰「但呢次我女朋友 讀出秘密都讀得特別慢。」 
And he emailed me this picture. ,但最終女朋友都讀曬 然後嚟到最尾一個秘密 
"(Laughter) ""I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer. ",關於佢對女朋友求婚一事 個男人話︰ 「我女朋友讀完呢個秘密一次， 
"I finally got the pictures developed and I'd love to give them to you."" ",又讀多一次。」 然後女朋友轉身對住佢講 「唔係我哋嘅貓咩？」 
"This picture never got returned back to the people who lost it, but this secret has impacted many lives, starting with a student up in Canada named Matty. ",（笑聲） 當女朋友轉身見到佢嘅時候 佢已經單膝跪係度，攞出戒指 
"Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website, a website called IFoundYourCamera. ",問咗嗰個問題，女朋友應承咗 
"Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they've found, memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos. ",最尾大團圓結局 所以我回覆佢話︰ 「唔該寄畀我一張相，或者乜都好， 我想將呢件事同 成個 PostSecret 社區分享， 等大家知道你哋個童話故事結局。」 
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week. ,然後佢寄咗呢張相畀我 
And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for. ,（笑聲） 「我喺 Lollapalooza 揾到你部相機， 
This one's my favorite. ,我終於晒咗裏面啲相， 希望可以將啲相畀返你。」 
(Laughter) Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers. ,呢啲相一直都返唔到 唔見咗呢啲相嘅人度 但呢個秘密影響咗好多人 包括有一個加拿大學生 Matty 
"And it might seem like a simple idea, and it is, but the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge. ",Matty 被呢個秘密啟發 佢創立自己一個網站 叫 IFoundYourCamera 
Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture. ,Matty 邀請大家 將街上執到嘅數碼相機 同有著相片、但遺失咗嘅 USB 都寄比佢 
"That's me, my husband and son. 
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother. 
Thank you for making your site. 
These pictures mean more to me than you know. 
My son's birth is on this camera. 
He turns four tomorrow. ",Matty 將呢啲相過到嚟電腦 每個星期都將啲相擺喺佢嘅網站 
"Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans, sometimes going through language barriers. ",然之後人哋就上佢個網站 睇下有無佢哋唔見咗嘅相 或者幫人哋揾返 佢哋好迫切要揾返嘅相 
This is the last postcard I have to share with you today. ,呢張係我最鍾意嘅 
When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again. ,（笑聲） Matty 揾到呢種普通嘅方法 同埋利用陌生人嘅善意 
"When I posted this secret, dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones, sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years, messages from family or friends who had died. ",雖然個意念簡單 不過就對人嘅生活有好大影響 
"They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them, it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive. ",Matty 同我分享 呢張相裡面嘅媽媽發嚟嘅 一封非常感人嘅郵件 
One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother. ,「呢個係我，我老公，同我個仔。 
Secrets can take many forms. ,其他相係我大病嘅嫲嫲。 
They can be shocking or silly or soulful. ,多謝你創建呢個網站， 
They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet again. ,呢啲相對於我嘅意義大到你估唔到。 
Voicemail recording: First saved voice message. ,相機裡面有我仔仔出世嘅相。 
Grandma: ? It's somebody's birthday today ? ? Somebody's birthday today ? ? The candles are lighted ? ? on somebody's cake ? ? And we're all invited ? ? for somebody's sake ? You're 21 years old today. ,佢聽日就四歲生日啦。」 
"Have a real happy birthday, and I love you. ",你哋呢度見到嘅相同埋其他幾千張 都返返去唔見咗相嘅人度 有時要穿洋過海 有時仲要跨過語言障礙 
I'll say bye for now. ,呢張係我今日最後想分享嘅一張明信片 
FW: Thank you. ,「當我愛嘅人喺我手機裡面 留低語音留言時， 我會存低，因為怕佢哋某一日離世， 而我再無辦法聽到佢哋把聲。」 
(Applause) Thank you. ,當我分享呢個秘密時 有好多人將佢哋手機裡面嘅 語音留言傳過來 當中有啲留言甚至係佢哋擺咗好多年 都係一啲逝去嘅親人、朋友嘅信息 
"(Applause) June Cohen: Frank, that was beautiful, so touching. ",佢哋話，保留呢啲聲音同分享呢啲聲音 其實係延續心愛嘅人嘅精神 
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard? ,有一個後生女發佈咗 佢嫲嫲留畀佢最後一條語音留言 
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret? ,秘密有好多種形態 
FW: I have one of my own secrets in every book. ,佢哋可以係震撼或者傻傻地嘅 亦可以係觸動人心 
"I think in some ways, the reason I started the project, even though I didn't know it at the time, was because I was struggling with my own secrets. ",秘密可以將我哋連接到 心入邊最深處嘅人性 或者連接到我哋再無可能見到嘅人 
"And it was through crowd-sourcing, it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me, that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me. ",語音留言：第一條已儲存語音留言 
JC: And has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book? ,嫲嫲：♫ 係某人生日 ♫ ♫ 某人生日 ♫ ♫ 蠟燭喺某人嘅蛋糕上被點著 ♫ ♫ 我哋都因為某人而被邀請過嚟 ♫ 你今日 21 歲啦 
Has anyone in your life been able to tell? ,過一個真正開心嘅生日，我愛你 
"FW: Sometimes I share that information, yeah. ",我講拜拜啦 
(Laughter) (Applause) ,講者︰多謝 
,（鼓掌） 多謝 
"Four years ago today, exactly, actually, I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. ",（鼓掌） 主持︰Frank 頭先真係太美麗、太感人啦 
"Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com. ",你有無試過寄自己一張明信片呢？ 
"My name's Tavi Gevinson, and the title of my talk is ""Still Figuring It Out,"" and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme, and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint. (Laughter) So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist. ",你有無將自己嘅秘密 擺喺 PostSecret 上面呢？ 
"I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character, and, you know, movies and TV shows, these things have influence. My own website. ",講者︰每本書裡面 都有我自己嘅一個秘密 
"So I think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted, and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot, like a Catwoman type, or she plays her sexuality up a lot, and it's seen as power. ",我覺得我開始呢個計劃 即使當時我無意識到 係因為我自己唔知 點樣去處理我嘅秘密 
But they're not strong characters who happen to be female. ,正係因為大家所有嘅秘密 因為陌生人對我表現善意 我先可以平復我過去難以磨滅嘅事 
"They're completely flat, and they're basically cardboard characters. ",主持︰咁有無人知道書入邊 邊啲係你嘅秘密呢？ 
"The problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand, and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple, when, in actuality, women are complicated, women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy, but because people are crazy, and women happen to be people. (Laughter) So the flaws are the key. ",有無人講得出你嘅秘密呢？ 
I'm not the first person to say this. ,講者︰會呀。我有時都會分享下架！ 
"What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws, who is maybe not immediately likable, but eventually relatable. ",（笑聲） （鼓掌） 
"I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it, so just wanted to acknowledge shows like ""Mad Men,"" movies like ""Bridesmaids,"" whose female characters or protagonists are complex, multifaceted. ",
"Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO that premiers next month, ""Girls,"" she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions, and that feels accurate for all people, but you don't see women represented like that as much. ",啱啱四年前嘅今日 我開咗個叫做 Style Rookie 嘅時尚博客 
"Congrats, guys. (Laughs) But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way, and one group that we'll focus on today are teens, because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out, and in the '90s there was ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""My So-Called Life,"" and their characters, Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase, I mean, the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically, but those shows only lasted a season each, and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since. ",2011 年 9 月 我又開咗個畀後生女睇嘅 叫 Rookiemag.com 嘅網上雜誌 
"So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) — around the time when I was, when I started watching those TV shows. ",我係 Tavi Gevinson …… 我今日演講嘅主題係「仍在探索中」 為咗配合今日嘅主題 我專登用咗微軟嘅畫圖程序做幻燈片 我唔係唔識用 微軟嘅投影片程序 （笑聲） 呢個網站係為少女度身製作 我係一個女權主義者 
"I was ending middle school, starting high school -- I'm a sophomore now — and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl. ",我算係流行文化嘅狂熱擁躉 對電影、電視裡邊嘅 女強人嘅角色好有研究 媒體對我嘅網站有好大嘅影響 
You can't be smart and pretty. ,所以，我認為女強人嘅定義 經常俾人曲解 結果性格多面化嘅女超人 就變成只有一種特質，好似貓女 佢專賣自己嘅性感 因為性感象徵力量 
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion. ,但係佢哋係強嘅女性角色 唔係女性嘅強人形象 
"You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people, usually men, will think of you. ",全都係平淡無奇 到好似個紙片人 
"So I was trying to figure all that out, and I felt a little confused, and I said so on my blog, and I said that I wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one-dimensional strong character empowerment thing because I think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs, never being insecure, never having doubts, having all of the answers. And this is not true, and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion, a conversation, a process, and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since. ",咁問題就嚟咗 啲人期望女人簡單易明 而啲女人就好希望 自己真係咁簡單 現實中，女人係複雜嘅動物 女人係多面嘅，唔係因為佢哋癲 而係有因為人就係癲嘅 而女人咁啱就係人 （笑聲） 所以缺點其實就係關鍵 
"But, yeah. ",我唔係第一個噉講嘅人 
"So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing, their photography, whatever, to be a member of our staff. ",女強人吸引人嘅地方就係 佢嘅弱點同缺點 你開頭可能唔係好鍾意佢 但係佢最終會令你有同感 
"I got about 3,000 emails. ",我既然提及呢個問題 就要提及有參與解決問題嘅人 譬如電視劇《廣告狂人》 同埋電影《最爆伴娘團》 佢哋有複雜同多面嘅女性角色 
"My editorial director and I went through them and put together a staff of people, and we launched last September. ",屏幕上嘅人係莉娜．丹恩 佢嘅新作《紐約叻女》 下個月喺 HBO 首播 佢講過，佢製作呢部戯 因為佢識得嘅女人 內心都係矛盾嘅 但係女人喺戲裏邊好少表現到咁 
"And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter, where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers, we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to give girls the answers, and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves, but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission, they can ask their own questions, find their own answers, all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out. ",各位男士，你哋好彩嘞 （笑聲） 但我覺得有幾類型嘅女性嘅內心矛盾 仲未俾戲塑造到 其中一類係青少年 因為青少年會係特別拗 同仲係喺度探索 90 年代有《怪胎與宅男》 同埋《我所謂的生活》同裡邊嘅角色 Lindsay Weir 同埋 Angela Chase 成部戯嘅前設 基本就係人物自我探索嘅過程 可惜呢兩套戯都只係播咗一季 從此之後，我再冇見到類似嘅電視節目 
"So I'm not saying, ""Be like us,"" and ""We're perfect role models,"" because we're not, but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions. ",呢個係我個腦 （笑聲） 喺我睇電視劇時嘅圖解 
"I mean, we have articles called ""On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"" but we also have articles like, oops -- I'm figuring it out! ",我啱啱讀完初中升高中 宜家，我讀緊二年級 我一直想 從我收到嘅互相矛盾嘅信息裡邊揾到平衡 
"Ha ha. (Laughter) If you use that, you can get away with anything. ",你唔可以又聰明又靚 
"We also have articles called ""How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."" ",係女權主義者嘅話，就唔可以追求時尚 
"So all of that being said, I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site, that aren't just about being totally powerful, maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those. ",如果你唔係在乎其他人 尤其係男人嘅眼光 你就唔會在乎扮靚 
"So what I you to take away from my talk, the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks. ",所以我一路都喺度諗 我覺得有啲迷茫 我喺我嘅博客有提過 我講過我想開設 一個專為女仔設定嘅網站 一個唔係一邊倒嘅 強勢嘅授權嘅嘢 因為噉會令女生卻步 同令佢哋對女權主義產生誤解 以為佢哋要成為女權主義者 就要同女權主義嘅信念完全一致 唔可以冇信心，唔可以有疑慮 要識得所有嘢 現實唔係噉嘅 我明白咗女權主義唔係一本規則 而係討論、對話、過程之後 我就冇覺得咁矛盾喇 呢個係我上年整嘅雜誌嘅其中兩頁 我開始自己搞啲插圖 
"Like, that's all you have to do. (Laughter) Because my favorite thing about her, other than, like, everything, is that she is very -- has always been unapologetically present on stage, and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them, and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks. ",呃，係噉 
Thank you. (Applause) ,我喺博客度講過 我想開始為女生出版刊物 亦邀請大家投稿，文章，攝影，咩都得 然後成為雜誌社嘅一員 
,我大約收到三千封電郵 
I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence. ,總編同我睇過所有嘅電郵 組咗一班員工 係上年九月創刊 
"I'm going to start way back in the third grade at Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio. ",呢個係我哋第一封 編輯致讀者嘅信嘅摘錄 話 Rookie 雜誌唔係咩都識 我哋仲係探索緊 重點唔係為女生提供答案 更加唔係限制佢哋自己搵答案嘅自由 而係鼓勵佢哋 使佢哋明白佢哋自己有話事權 佢哋可以自己問問題 自己揾答案等等 我哋一直嘗試提供 一個探索同解決唔同困惑嘅空間 
I remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project. ,我晤係話：「你好似我哋咁。」 抑或「我哋係楷模」 因為我哋根本唔係 但我哋只想俾女生 一個展示唔同嘅性格特質嘅地方 
He was making a horse out of the clay our teacher kept under the sink. ,我哋有篇文章叫做 《認真看待妳自己： 點樣唔在意人哋嘅睇法》 但我哋都有文章，好似係 哎呀，我探索緊！ 
"And at one point, one of the girls that was sitting at his table, seeing what he was doing, leaned over and said to him, ""That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse."" ",哈哈！ （笑聲） 呢一招真係免死金牌 
And Brian's shoulders sank. ,我哋都有文章 叫做《點可以喺五分鐘之內 扮成你冇淨係喺度喊》 
And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin. ,以上全部，我真係好欣賞 電影中嘅角色 同我哋網站上嘅文章 所講嘅唔只做有力量嘅人 仲要接受自己 有自信心同埋接受自身嘅缺點 
I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again. ,我希望你從今次演講中得到總結係 要學習史蒂薇．尼克斯 
"And I wonder how often that happens, you know? ",學佢就係你要做嘅嘢 （笑聲） 因為我最鍾意佢嘅就係 其實佢咩我都好鍾意 佢係好，一直 喺台上好從容 唔會為自己嘅缺點而道歉 亦唔會想調和自己互相矛盾嘅感情 佢令你聆聽佢哋，令你思考 冇錯，請學習一下史蒂薇．尼克斯 
"It seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class, a lot of them want to come up after class and tell me about their similar experience, how a teacher shut them down, or how a student was particularly cruel to them. ",多謝各位 （鼓掌） 
And then some kind of opt out of thinking of themselves as creative at that point. ,
"And I see that opting out that happens in childhood, and it moves in and becomes more ingrained, even, by the time you get to adult life. ",今日我想同你哋講有關創作自信嘅嘢 
So we see a lot of this. ,由我三年班開始講起 嗰時我喺俄亥俄州巴伯頓嘅 奧克戴爾學校返學 
"When we have a workshop or when we have clients in to work with us side by side, eventually we get to the point in the process that's kind of fuzzy or unconventional. ",我記得有一日 我最好嘅朋友布萊恩喺度整緊一個模型 
"And eventually, these big-shot executives whip out their BlackBerrys and they say they have to make really important phone calls, and they head for the exits. ",佢用黏土整緊隻馬 平時老師擺啲黏土喺鋅盆下面 
And they're just so uncomfortable. ,唔知幾時，有個坐喺佢隔離嘅女仔 一路睇佢做緊咩嘢 埃過去，同佢講︰ 「嗰堆嘢都唔似馬嘅，真係差嘞」 
"When we track them down and ask them what's going on, they say something like, ""I'm just not the creative type."" ",布萊恩縮埋膀頭 
But we know that's not true. ,將黏土馬搓埋一舊，揼咗落垃圾桶度 
"If they stick with the process, if they stick with it, they end up doing amazing things. ",從此我再無見過布萊恩做類似嘅模型 
And they surprise themselves at just how innovative they and their teams really are. ,但我想問佢呢種事係唔係幾常發生 
"So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have, that you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged; if you don't say the right creative thing, you're going to be judged. ",每次我同我班學生講布萊恩嘅故仔 好多學生好似都想落堂之後留低 同我講返佢哋類似嘅經驗 講老師點樣貶低佢哋 或者某個同學對佢特別唔友善 
"And I had a major breakthrough, when I met the psychologist Albert Bandura. ",而有啲學生甚至因為咁 而之後唔再認為自己有創意 
"I don't know if you know Albert Bandura, but if you go to Wikipedia, it says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history -- you know, like Freud, Skinner, somebody and Bandura. ",我發現喺童年時否定自己有創意 到大個只會令呢種諗法更加根深柢固 
(Laughter) Bandura is 86 and he still works at Stanford. ,我哋見過好多呢類嘅例子 
And he's just a lovely guy. ,當我哋有個工作坊 或者客人同我哋一齊做某個項目 我哋總會去到一個地步 就係迷失或者遇到少見嘅情況 
"So I went to see him, because he's just worked on phobias for a long time, which I'm very interested in. ",最後嗰啲高層就會攞部黑莓手機出嚟 話要打好重要嘅電話 然後走咗 
"He had developed this way, this, kind of, methodology, that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time, like, in four hours. ",佢哋感到唔自在 
And we talked about snakes -- I don't know why -- we talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia. ,當我哋追問佢哋發生咗咩事 佢哋講埋曬啲「我唔係創意型人」嘅嘢 
"And it was really enjoyable, really interesting. ",但係我哋知道，佢哋講嘅唔係真嘅 
"He told me that he'd invite the test subject in, and he'd say, ""You know, there's a snake in the next room and we're going to go in there."" ",如果佢哋堅持落去，堅持成個過程 最終佢哋會做到大嘢出嚟 
"To which, he reported, most of them replied, ""Hell no! I'm not going in there, certainly if there's a snake in there."" ",同埋佢哋會驚訝佢哋自己 同埋團隊可以幾咁有創意 
But Bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful. ,所以我一直研究緊呢種怕被人審嘅恐懼 即係你唔做嘢係因為驚被人審 你怕因為講唔出 「正確創意嘅嘢」而被審 
So he'd take people to this two-way mirror looking into the room where the snake was. ,當我見過心理學家阿爾波特．班杜拉 我有一個大突破 
And he'd get them comfortable with that. ,我唔知你識唔識阿爾波特．班杜拉 但係你去睇下維基百科 維基百科話，佢係歷史上 第四個最重要嘅心理學家 好似弗洛伊德、史金納、某學者 同埋班都那咁重要 
"Then through a series of steps, he'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open, and they'd be looking in there. ",班都那今年 86 歲仍然喺史丹福工作 
And he'd get them comfortable with that. ,佢真係好得意 
"And then many more steps later, baby steps, they'd be in the room, they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on, and they'd eventually touch the snake. ",由於佢長時間研究恐懼症 而我對呢個題目好有興趣 所以我走去揾佢 
"And when they touched the snake, everything was fine. They were cured. ",佢發展咗呢種方法 可以喺好短時間入面醫好病人 喺四個鐘頭入面 佢醫好恐懼症嘅比率相當之高 
"In fact, everything was better than fine. ",我同佢講到蛇 但我唔知點解我哋會講蛇 我哋講到蛇同怕蛇嘅恐懼症 
"These people who had lifelong fears of snakes were saying things like, ""Look how beautiful that snake is."" ",同佢真係好好傾 傾嘅內容都非常之有趣 
And they were holding it in their laps. ,佢同我講，佢曾經召募過參加者 然後同佢哋講︰「你知嘛， 隔離房有條蛇喺度， 而家我哋準備入去。」 
"Bandura calls this process ""guided mastery."" ",佢話，大多數嘅受訪者回答 「千奇唔好。如果入面有條蛇喺度， 我肯定唔會入去㗎。」 
I love that term: guided mastery. ,但係班都那有一個百發百中嘅方法 
And something else happened. ,可以一步一步帶啲參加者 去到呢塊單向透明鏡 望入去有條蛇嘅嗰間房 
These people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives. ,等佢哋覺得自在啲 
"They tried harder, they persevered longer, and they were more resilient in the face of failure. ",然後經過一連串嘅步驟 佢帶啲人企喺門口，打開度門 畀佢哋望入去房入面 令佢哋感覺自在啲 
They just gained a new confidence. ,之後佢仲一步一步做咗好多微小嘅嘢 
"And Bandura calls that confidence ""self-efficacy,"" the sense that you can change the world and that you can attain what you set out to do. ",最後佢哋入咗間房 帶住一隻好似焊接工用嘅皮手套摸條蛇 
"Well, meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me, because I realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we've seen happen for the last 30 years: that we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative, and we could take them through a series of steps, kind of like a series of small successes, and they turn fear into familiarity. ",當佢哋摸條蛇嗰時，一切正常 
That transformation is amazing. ,佢哋嘅恐懼症冇咗 所有嘢都解決晒 
We see it at the d.school all the time. ,呢班人以前成日都驚蛇 依家就講「睇下條蛇幾靚」 
"People from all different kinds of disciplines, they think of themselves as only analytical. ",佢哋仲擺條蛇响膝頭度 
"And they come in and they go through the process, our process, they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently. ",班都那叫呢個過程做「引導式精熟」 
And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person. ,我鍾意呢個術語 
So I thought one of the things I'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like. ,呢班經歷咗個過程同埋摸過條蛇嘅人 
"To me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz. ",往後對生活中其他嘅嘢都少咗焦慮 
Doug Dietz is a technical person. ,佢哋更加努力、更加堅持 而且面對失敗時更加有韌性 
He designs large medical imaging equipment. ,佢哋得到「新嘅自信」 
"He's worked for GE, and he's had a fantastic career. ",班都那叫呢種自信做自我效能 嗰種感覺係，你能夠改變世界 同埋你可以達到嗰啲定咗嘅目標 
"But at one point, he had a moment of crisis. ",同班都那見面，真係舒暢 因為我知道呢個出名嘅科學家 用文獻記低同埋用科學方法證明咗 一件我哋三十年嚟見到嘅嘢 就係我哋可以通過一系列步驟 好似係一連串小小嘅創舉 令嗰啲一路覺得自己唔夠創意嘅人 睇住自己可以有幾咁創意 
"He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use, when he saw a young family, and this little girl. ",所以呢個轉變真係勁 
And that little girl was crying and was terrified. ,我哋喺史丹福大學設計學院 成日都見到唔同學科嘅人 
And Doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine. ,佢哋覺得自己剩係得分析能力 
"And this was really disappointing to Doug, because before this time, he was proud of what he did. ",於是佢哋嚟參加我哋成個訓練 完成之後，佢哋建立咗信心 依家佢哋會諗 佢哋唔同咗 
He was saving lives with this machine. ,每次佢哋諗自己係有創意嘅人嘅時候 佢哋都會好開心 
But it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids. ,所以我諗我今日做嘅其中一樣嘢 就係帶你哋體驗下呢個轉變嘅歷程 
"About that time, he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes. ",對我嚟講，個歷程好似 Doug Dietz 一樣 
"He was learning about our process, about design thinking, about empathy, about iterative prototyping. ",Doug Dietz 係一個科技人員 
And he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary. ,佢設計大型醫學影像設備 
He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned. ,佢喺通用電汽返工，佢嘅事業無可限量 
And this is what he came up with. ,但係有一次，佢經歷過一刹那嘅危機 
(Laughter) He turned it into an adventure for the kids. ,當佢喺醫院睇住佢設計嘅 磁力共振掃描機運作 佢遇見一個年輕家庭 當中有個細路女 
"He painted the walls and he painted the machine, and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids, like children's museum people. ",個細路女好驚、喺度喊 
"And now when the kid comes, it's an experience. ",當 Doug Dietz 發現 原來呢間醫院近八成兒科病人 喺用佢設計嘅磁力共振掃描機之前 都要食咗鎮靜劑先 佢覺得好失望 
And they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship. ,因為一路而嚟 佢都為佢所做啲嘢感到自豪 
"And when they come, they say, ""OK, you're going to go into the pirate ship, but be very still, because we don't want the pirates to find you."" ",佢以為佢一直用緊呢部機拯救生命 
"And the results were super dramatic: from something like 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated, to something like 10 percent of the kids needing to be sedated. ",但當佢見到部磁力共振掃描機 嚇親啲小朋友 
"And the hospital and GE were happy, too, because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time, and they could put more kids through the machine in a day. ",佢深受打擊 嗰陣時，佢喺史丹福設計學院返學 
So the quantitative results were great. ,佢學緊我哋關於設計思考、同情心 同迭代原形嘅方法 
But Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative. ,佢想用呢啲新知識去做一啲非凡嘅嘢 
He was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan. ,於是佢重新設計成個掃描過程 
"And when the little girl came out of her scan, she ran up to her mother and said, ""Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"" ",呢個就係佢用嘅新方法 
"(Laughter) And so, I've heard Doug tell the story many times of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it, but I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a tear in his eye. ",佢將成個掃描程序 變成細路嘅探險旅程 
Doug's story takes place in a hospital. ,佢畫啲公仔喺幅牆同埋喺部掃描機度 佢叫識得氹細路嘅人 例如兒童博物館嘅工作人員 去訓練操作員 
I know a thing or two about hospitals. ,依家啲細路嚟到好似一個遊樂場咁 
"A few years ago, I felt a lump on the side of my neck. ",職員會將噪音同埋機器包裝成一個故事 
It was my turn in the MRI machine. ,所以當啲細路嚟到，佢哋會同佢哋講 「你一陣入去嗰隻海盜船度， 但係要好靜，唔好郁， 因為我哋唔想海盜揾到你。」 
"It was cancer, it was the bad kind. ",個效果超好 由八成細路需要食鎮靜劑 到而家只有一成細路要食鎮靜劑 
I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival. ,醫院同通用電氣都好高興 因為唔使每次都叫埋麻醉師嚟 而且日日又可以同多啲細路檢查 
"So while you're sitting around with the other patients, in your pajamas, and everybody's pale and thin -- (Laughter) you know? -- and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays, you think of a lot of things. ",所以出嚟嘅效果好好 
And I thought a lot about: What was my daughter's life going to be like without me? ,但係 Doug Dietz 關心嘅係質量嘅結果 
But you think about other things. ,於是佢陪其中一個媽媽 等佢個細路女掃描完出嚟 
I thought a lot about: What was I put on Earth to do? ,當細路女出嚟嘅時候 細路女走去媽媽度，問媽媽 「媽咪，我哋聽日可唔可以再嚟過呀？」 
What was my calling? What should I do? ,（笑聲） Doug Dietz 講過好多次 佢嘅個人轉變 同埋之後嘅突破性設計 每次佢講呢個細路女嘅故仔 佢都眼濕濕 
I was lucky because I had lots of options. ,Doug Dietz 嘅故事喺醫院發生 
"We'd been working in health and wellness, and K-12, and the developing world. ",我對醫院都咯知一二 
so there were lots of projects that I could work on. ,幾年前，我條頸側邊有塊腫肉 
"But then I decided and committed at this point, to the thing I most wanted to do, which was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way. ",嗰時輪到我去做磁力共振掃描 
"And if I was going to survive, that's what I wanted to do. ",嚿腫肉係腫瘤，係好惡嗰種 
"I survived, just so you know. ",有人同我講，我嘅生存率剩得四成 
(Laughter) (Applause) I really believe that when people gain this confidence -- and we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO -- that they actually start working on the things that are really important in their lives. ,所以當你着著件睡衣 坐喺其他病人嘅身邊 見到個個都面黃肌瘦 而你喺度等緊電療 你會諗好多嘢 你哋經常諗嘅係，我會唔會生存落去？ 
We see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions. ,而我諗得最多嘅係 我個女無咗我會點？ 
"We see them come up with more interesting -- and just more -- ideas, so they can choose from better ideas. ",但係你哋會諗下其他嘅嘢 
And they just make better decisions. ,我諗咗好多嘢，譬如︰ 我嚟呢個世界係做咩嘢㗎 
"I know at TED, you're supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing, isn't that -- everybody has a change-the-world thing? ",我有咩使命；我應該做啲咩嘢… 
"If there is one for me, this is it, to help this happen. ",我好幸運，因為我有好多選擇 
"So I hope you'll join me on my quest, you as, kind of, thought leaders. ",我做過醫療保健界 做過幼兒園到中六嘅教育 仲有發展中國家嘅工作 
"It would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives, like it's some God-given thing, and to have people realize that they're naturally creative, and that those natural people should let their ideas fly; that they should achieve what Bandura calls self-efficacy, that you can do what you set out to do, and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake. ",所以我有好多項目可以做 
Thank you. ,但係呢一刻 我決定要專注做我最想做嘅嘢 就係盡量幫最多嘅人 令佢地重拾失去咗嘅創作自信 
(Applause) ,如果我有命生存落去 呢樣就係我想做嘅嘢 
,我依然生存，正如你所見 
"When I was a child growing up in Maine, one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine, because my parents told me it would bring me luck. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 我真係相信 當人重拾呢份自信心 即係我哋成日喺史丹福設計學院 同 IDEO 見到嘅自信心 佢哋就會認真開始做 一啲佢哋生命中重要嘅嘢 
"But you know, these shells, they're hard to find. ",我哋見到啲人唔再做舊嘅嘢 開始新嘅嘢 
"They're covered in sand, they're difficult to see. ",並且有更加有趣、更加多嘅諗法 從而可以揀比較好嘅諗法 
"However, over time, I got used to looking for them. ",做更加好嘅決定 
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them. ,我知道喺 TED，你係想做嘢改變世界 每個人都有啲嘢想改變世界 
"This grew into a passion for finding things, a love for the past and archaeology. ",對我來講，呢樣嘢係幫人重拾創作自信 
"And eventually, when I started studying Egyptology, I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough. ",我希望你哋可以成為有諗頭嘅人 同我一齊令呢樣嘢發生 
"Because all of the sudden, in Egypt, my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long, next to the Nile. ",如果你哋令呢個世界 唔再分為有創意同無創意 令人相信創意變成係天賦嘅 咁世界就美妙嘞 讓所有人嘅意念都可以隨意飛揚 真正實現班都那講嗰種自我效能 令每個人都能夠做到訂下嘅目標 並且做到創作自信 所以，去摸下條蛇啦！ 
And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities. ,多謝 
This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery. ,（掌聲） 
"For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently. ",
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared. ,我從小喺緬因州長大 細個嗰時我最愛做嘅一件事 就係到海邊執海錢 因為父母話執到海錢會帶嚟好運 
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Mendes. ,但要知道海錢好難搵 
"And the site visibly appears brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color, the site appears as bright pink. ",佢哋畀沙遮住，好難被發現 
What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians. ,只不過，一段時間之後 我已經識點樣搵到佢哋 
"What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Itjtawy, missing for thousands of years. ",我開始憑形狀同紋理嚟搵佢哋 
"Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom, about four thousand years ago. ",我因此開始熱愛尋寶 亦迷上咗研究事物嘅過去同學習考古學 
"The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt, and the site is really important, because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion. ",終於，喺我開始埃及古物學的研究之後 我發覺齋用肉眼搵嘢係唔夠 
"Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive flood plain. ",因為喺我去到埃及之後 我研究嘅沙灘忽然間 由緬因州一個好細嘅沙灘 變成一條八百英哩長嘅尼羅河沙灘 
This area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in size. ,而我要搵嘅嘢亦都由海錢變咗古城 
"The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east, it covered over the city. ",亦因為咁，我開始利用衛星圖片 
"So, how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape? ",我知道如果要將事物的過去完整地呈現出嚟 就要用第二種方法去觀測 
"Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack, blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts. ",所以喺呢度，我會畀大家睇睇 我哋用紅外線進行觀測 
"(Laughter) So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape, very subtle changes. ",呢個係尼羅河三角洲東部嘅 Mendes 
We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow. ,"呢個地方就咁睇起嚟係啡色 但如果我哋用紅外線去睇呢個地點 再加上假色 , 突然變成鮮粉紅 "
"But you can see in more detail, and even more interesting, this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy. ",宜家你哋睇到嘅 係古代埃及人嘅建築材料 同活動對地表造成嘅化學影響 
"So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists to do coring work, which you see here. ",今天我想同各位分享嘅係 我哋點樣利用衛星資料 搵到一座消失咗幾千年嘅 埃及古城伊塔威 
"When I say coring, it's like ice coring, but instead of layers of climate change, you're looking for layers of human occupation. ",伊塔威屬於四千幾年前 古埃及中王國時期 做過超過四百年首都 
"And, five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of pottery. ",伊塔威位於埃及嘅法尤姆市 伊塔威非常重要 因為喺中王國時期，古埃及曾經有過 藝術、建築同宗教方面嘅重大嘅文藝復興 
"What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years, dating to the Middle Kingdom, dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is. ",埃及學家早就知道伊塔威嘅大概位置 約莫位於兩個法老所起嘅呢個城嘅 金字塔附近 就係圖中紅色圈裡邊 即係喺呢個廣闊沖積平原嘅某處 
"We also found work stone -- carnelian, quartz and agate that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here. ",呢個區域非常寬廣 長同闊有成四英哩乘三英哩 
"These might not look like much, but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom, these are the stones that were used. ",尼羅河曾經流經伊塔威西面 但後嚟流經東面 於是覆蓋咗成個城市 
"So, we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site. ",我哋係點樣喺咁大嘅平原裏面 搵一座埋喺地底嘅城市？ 
"We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop, showing that whatever was there was a very important city. ",漫無目的咁搵有如大海撈針 
"No Itjtawy was here yet, but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out. ",（笑聲） 因此我哋用太空總署嘅地形資料 繪製出地形同細微嘅變化 
"And even more importantly, we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well. ",我哋開始見到尼羅河曾經流過嘅地方 
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago. ,我哋覺得紅色圈圈裏面 呢個微微拱起嘅地方 好有可能係伊塔威嘅位置 
"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings. 
So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD. 
(Laughter) Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above. 
It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 

In the past several days, I heard people talking about China. 
And also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet. 
Something is very challenging to me. 
I want to make my friends understand: China is complicated. 
So I always want to tell the story, like, one hand it is that, the other hand is that. 
You can't just tell a one sided story. 
I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country. 
BRIC country means Brazil, Russia, India and China. 
This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy. 
But at the same time, on the other hand, China is a SICK country, the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers -- file. 
He said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea. 
The four countries have no access to Facebook. 
So basically, China is a SICK BRIC country. 
(Laughter) Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet. 
And now, today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years, from that wall. 
So, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones, you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom. 
It prevents weird things from the north. 
Same was true for China. 
In the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng. 
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years. 
But China also has a great firewall. 
That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world. 
It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas, from the universal values, but also to prevent China's own citizens to access the global free Internet, and even separate themselves into blocks, not united. 
So, basically the Internet"" has two Internets. ",於是我哋同埃及科學家合作 進行岩層採樣，就好似呢張咁 
"One is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet. ",岩層採樣就好似冰層採樣咁 唔同嘅係，冰層採樣 在於搵出氣候變化 而岩層採樣只係 搵唔同時代人類嘅活動 
"But if you think the Chinanet is something like a deadland, wasteland, I think it's wrong. ",喺厚厚嘅泥層之下、地面五米之下 我哋搵到咗一層布滿陶器嘅岩層 
"But we also use a very simple metaphor, the cat and the mouse game, to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship, government censorship, the cat, and the Chinese Internet users. That means us, the mouse. ",即係話，喺伊塔威嘅潛在位置 嘅五米深地方 我哋搵到一層有著 幾百年人類活動痕跡嘅岩層 時間仲可以追溯到中王國時期 即係伊塔威嘅存在時間 
But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple. ,同時我哋都搵到工藝石材 光玉隨、石英同瑪瑙 顯示呢度曾經有一間珠寶工坊 
So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version. ,雖然呢啲石頭睇上去唔係好似 但當你諗返中王國時期 製造珠寶時最常用嘅石材 呢啲石頭就係嗰啲石材 
"In China, we have 500 million Internet users. ",宜家我哋發現咗一層有著 好多人類活動痕跡嘅岩層 呢層岩層仲可以 追溯到中王國時期 
"That's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world. ",我哋都有證據顯示呢度曾經有 一間大師級嘅珠寶工坊 證明咗呢度曾經有座非常重要嘅城市 
"So even though China's is a totally censored Internet, but still, Chinese Internet society is really booming. ",雖然伊塔威嘅遺址未顯露出嚟 但我哋會返去嗰度重塑佢嘅原貌 
How to make it? It's simple. ,更重要嘅係 我哋獲得經費，訓練埃及嘅年輕人 利用衛星科技去探索古蹟 
"You have Google, we have Baidu. ",最後，我想用我最愛嘅 古埃及中王國時代名言收結 呢句說話寫喺大約四千多年前嘅伊塔威 
"You have Twitter, we have Weibo. ",「世上最偉大嘅使命 莫過於同他人分享知識」 
"You have Facebook, we have Renren. ",TED 只不過喺公元 1984 年之後成立 
"You have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou. ",（ 笑聲） 但公元前 1984 年 喺一座消失咗唔係好耐嘅城市裏面 發展想法呢樣嘢已經一早開始萌芽 
"The Chinese government blocked every single international Web 2.0 service, and we Chinese copycat every one. ",佢亦證明咗喺海邊執貝殼係有用嘅 
"(Laughter) So, that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship. ",多謝各位 
That's not only to censor you. ,（ 掌聲） 多謝 （ 掌聲） 
Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple: Block and clone. ,
"On the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network, which is very important; people really love social networking. ",過去呢幾日，我都聽到有人 喺度談論緊中國 
"But on the other hand, they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want. ",我亦都有同朋友講到中國 同埋中國嘅互聯網 
"That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China, because they can't accept the fact that Chinese government wants to keep the server. ",雖然要畀朋友知道呢樣嘢係難 
Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands. ,但我想佢哋知道中國係非常複雜 
"For example, Mubarak, he shut down the Internet. ",所以我成日都好想解釋畀大家聽 所有嘢都可以從兩個角度睇 
He wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him. ,你唔可以只係話畀人知故事嘅其中一面 
"But once Netizens can't go online, they go in the street. ",其中一個例子係：中國係金磚四國成員 
And now the result is very simple. ,金磚四國即係巴西 俄羅斯、印度同中國 
We all know Mubarak is technically dead. ,呢幾個發展中國家嘅經濟增長 帶起全世界經濟復蘇 
"But also, Ben Ali, Tunisian president, didn't follow the second rule. ",但同時 中國係另一個分類（SICK）嘅一員 亦喺 Facebook 招股書裏邊 第一次出現嘅術語 
That means keep the server in your hands. ,SICK 嘅國家包括敘利亞 伊朗、中國同北韓 
"He allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service, to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia. ",呢四個國家都禁止人民使用 Facebook 
"So he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption. ",所以基本上中國係一個 SICK （英文有病之意）嘅金磚國家 
The same thing happend. He was the first to topple during the Arab Spring. ,（笑聲） 另外有人計劃監察中國同中國嘅互聯網 
"But those two very smart international censorship policies didn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere, a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials. ",而今日，我想同你講下 我最近幾年對於呢一埲牆嘅個人研究 
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China. ,如果你有睇過《權力遊戲》 你應該會明白一埲巨牆 對古老帝國嚟講有幾重要 
It's the entire population of the United States. ,佢可以隔絕從北方而嚟嘅異物 
"So when these 300 million people, microbloggers, even they block the tweet in our censored platform. ",對中國而言，道理都係一樣 
"But itself -- the Chinanet -- but itself can create very powerful energy, which has never happened in the Chinese history. ",喺中國北面有一埲巨牆，叫長城 
"2011, in July, two [unclear] trains crashed, in Wenzhou, a southern city. ",佢過去保護中國免受外族入侵 足足二千年 
"Right after the train crash, authorities literally wanted to cover up the train, bury the train. ",而今日嘅中國同樣有一道巨大嘅牆 ——防火長城 
So it angered the Chinese Netizens. ,佢係世界上最強大嘅數碼防線 
"The first five days after the train crash, there were 10 million criticisms of the posting on social media, which never happened in Chinese history. ",佢唔單止保護咗中國政權 免受外國嘅普世價值影響 亦都防止咗中國網民 透過互聯網了解世界 甚至將人分成一個個小圈子 而唔係將大家團結起嚟 
"And later this year, the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years. ",所以，互聯網可以分為兩種： 
"And also, recently, very funny debate between the Beijing Environment Ministry and the American Embassy in Beijing because the Ministry blamed the American Embassy for intervening in Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing. ",一個係「互聯網」 一個係「中國互聯網」 
"So, the up is the Embassy data, the PM 2.5. ",不過如果你以為中國互聯網係 一片廢土、無活力嘅地方 
"He showed 148, they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group. ",你就錯嘞 我想用一個簡單嘅比喻——貓同老鼠 嚟形容過去十五年 中國網民同政府網絡審查嘅鬥爭 中國政府係貓 中國嘅網民，即係我哋，係老鼠 
"So a suggestion, it's not good to go outside. ",但係其實唔係咁簡單 
But that is the Ministry's data. He shows 50. ,今日我想用第二種方法解釋 
He says it's good. It's good to go outside. ,中國有五億網民 
But 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy's side. ,亦係全世界最大嘅網民人口 
"I live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window. ",就算點抑制互聯網都好 中國嘅網絡人口始終都會不斷澎漲 
"Why is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship, so booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages. ",咁中國政府點算呢？好簡單 
"You know, Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of a limitation of 140 characters. ",你哋有 Google，我哋有百度 
But in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link. ,你哋有 Twitter，我哋有微博 
"Maybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just ""Aha!"" ",你哋有 Facebook，我哋有人人網 
"(Laughter) But in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters, means a paragraph, a story. ",你哋有 Youtube，我哋有優酷同土豆 
You can almost have all the journalistic elements there. ,中國政府封鎖咗所有 Web 2.0 嘅網站 然後將逐個網站完完全全咁 複製返一個中國版本 
"For example, this is Hamlet, of Shakespeare. ",（笑聲） 因為佢哋唔會淨係封鎖你 
"It's the same content. One, you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets. ",所以我認為呢啲先稱得上精嘅審查方法 
"Chinese is always cheating, right? ",有時中國嘅互聯網政策非常簡單 就係封鎖，然後複製 
"So because of this, the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media, not only a headline to media. ",政府一方面滿足 人民對於社交網絡嘅渴求 呢樣好重要，因為大家都好鐘意社交 
"And also, the clone, Sina company is the guy who cloned Twitter. ",另一方面，政府又將伺服器留喺北京 方便隨時監控 
"It even has its own name, with Weibo. ",呢個亦都係 Google 離開中國嘅原因 因為佢哋唔接受 中國政府保留佢哋嘅伺服器喺中國 
"Weibo is the Chinese translation for ""microblog"". ",但好多阿拉伯嘅獨裁者 都唔明白監管網絡之餘 
It has its own innovation. ,都要畀人民有得上社交網 例如穆巴拉克，佢直接封鎖互聯網 
"At the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter. ",佢想阻止網民批評佢 
"So these innovations and clones, as the Weibo and microblogging, when it came to China in 2009, it immediately became a media platform itself. ",但正正因為網民無得喺網上發聲 佢哋唯有走上街頭 
It became the media platform of 300 million readers. ,依家結果非常明顯 
It became the media. ,我哋都知道穆巴拉克基本上 已經被判死刑，無得翻身 
"Anything not mentioned in Weibo, it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public. ",而突尼西亞總統班阿里 雖然冇阻止人上社交網 
"But also, Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life. ",但佢冇攞返伺服器嘅控制權 
"For example, they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard. ",佢容許 Facebook 呢一個美國本土設立嘅網站 繼續喺突尼西亞營運 
"We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system, because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth: The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs. ",所以佢根本阻止唔到國民 喺網上發佈批評佢貪污腐敗嘅影片 
"So that's why the petitioner, the victims, the peasants, want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government, they want the emperor to settle the problem. ",所以，佢係第一個 喺阿拉伯之春當中被拉落台嘅獨裁者 
"But when more and more people go to Beijing, they also cause the risk of a revolution. ",但係嗰兩個咁犀利嘅國際審查政策 都阻止唔到中國社交網絡 成為一個公開平台 畀網民有機會發表意見 中國官員嘅惡夢亦因為咁而開始咗 
So they send them back in recent years. ,中國有三億微博博客 
And even some of them were put into black jails. ,呢個數字其實就等於美國人口 
"But now we have Weibo, so I call it the Weibo petition. ",當我哋有呢三億微博博客 即使部分微博文章會被刪除 
People just use their cell phones to tweet. ,但中國互聯網嘅力量就會前所未見咁大 
"So your sad stories, by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters, professors or celebrities. ",2011 年 7 月，兩架高鐵喺溫州相撞 
"One of them is Yao Chen, she is the most popular microblogger in China, who has about 21 million followers. ",就喺事件發生後 當局想馬上將高鐵殘駭就地掩埋 
They're almost like a national TV station. ,但咁嘅做法引起中國網民憤怒 
If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her. ,就喺事故發生之後頭五日 喺社交網絡上 有一千萬條批評當局做法嘅貼文 呢樣之前從未試過喺中國發生過 
"So this Weibo social media, even in the censorship, still gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together, talking together. ",冇幾耐之後 鐵道部部長就被革職同埋被判監十年 
"It's like a big TED, right? ",最近中國環保部同美國駐北京大使館 發生咗好有趣嘅事 環保部鬧美國大使館干涉中國內政 指責大使館公佈咗北京嘅空氣污染指數 
"But also, it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China. ",根據大使館嘅數據，PM 2.5 指數有 148 
Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people. ,即係對於身體敏感嘅人嚟講係危險水平 
"But also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping. ",所以大使館建議大家唔好出街 
It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo. ,但係中國環保部公佈嘅數字係 50 
"For example, you can't post the name of the president, Hu Jintao, and also you can't post the city of Chongqing, the name, and until recently, you can't search the surname of top leaders. ",中國政府話空氣質素好好 大家應該出街行下 
"So, the Chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes. ",但係 99% 嘅中國微博博客 都選擇相信大使館嘅數據 
"They even name themselves -- you know, use the name of this world-changing battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab. ",我住喺北京嘅 每日我都係睇美國大使館公佈嘅數據 嚟決定我打唔打開窗好 
"The grass-mud horse is caoníma, is the phonogram for motherfucker, the Netizens call themselves. ",點解喺咁嚴密嘅審查之下 中國社交網絡仍然增長得咁快？ 部分原因係中文呢種語言嘅特性 
"River crab is héxiè, is the phonogram for harmonization, for censorship. ",大家都知道，Twitter 同微博 都有一個特點 就係每段貼文不得超過 140 字 
"So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good. ",但係以英文嚟講 140 個字母只係一句 20 字左右嘅句子 加一條短連結 
"So, when some very political, exciting moments happened, you can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened. ",用德文嘅話可能仲衰 140 個字母可能 只係夠你講一句「呀哈！」 
"Weird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD of Chinese language, you can't understand them. ",（笑聲） 但係中文嘅話 140 字其實 已經代表一個段落，一個故事 
"But you can't even expand more, no, because Chinese Sina Weibo, when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com. ",你用 140 字就可以 幾乎講曬一單嘢嘅來龍去脈 
"That means from the very beginning, Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government, we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime. ",例如呢段莎士比亞名著 《哈姆雷特》嘅節錄 
"For example, anything you want to post, like ""get together"" or ""meet up"" or ""walk,"" it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing. ",中英文係同樣嘅內容 你可以清楚睇到一條中文微博嘅資訊量 等於 3.5 條英文貼文 
"Even if you want to have some gathering, before you go there, the police are already waiting for you. ",中國人成日都作弊㗎啦 
Why? Because they have the data. ,正正因為咁 中國人真真正正當咗微博 係一個正式嘅資訊來源 而唔係只係一堆標題 
They have everything in their hands. ,新浪公司不但止抄襲 Twitter 
So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident. ,新浪公司甚至有個新名，叫微博 
So the crackdown is very serious. ,「微博」有「簡短嘅博文」之意 
But I want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat-and-mouse. ,但平心而論，新浪都有 佢自己嘅創新之處 
"The cat is the censorship, but Chinese is not only one cat, but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats. ",喺回覆功能方面 微博冇整到好似 Twitter 咁 反而係似 Facebook 咁 
"(Laughter) You know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands, so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government, the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing. ",所以當包含抄襲同創新嘅微博 喺 2009 年喺中國市場面世嘅時候 佢即刻變咗資訊平台 
"Without bribing the central cats, he can do nothing, only apologize. ",佢變咗個有三億讀者嘅資訊平台 
"So these three years, in the past three years, social movements about microblogging really changed local government, became more and more transparent, because they can't access the data. ",佢變咗媒體 
The server is in Beijing. ,如果有某啲嘢無出現喺微博 佢喺中國人眼中就會好似無發生過一樣 
"The story about the train crash, maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticisms in five days, but why the Chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online. ",同時，中國社交網絡的確 改變緊中國人嘅思想同生活 
It's never happened before. ,例如，佢令以前發唔到聲嘅人 有渠道發聲 
"And so it's very simple, because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy, this independent kingdom. ",我哋曾經有過上訪制度 一個獨立於司法制度嘅系統 因為中國政府想畀人感覺係 中央政府係關心人民嘅 本地嘅官員係衰人嚟嘅 
So they want an excuse -- public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him. ,所以上訪者、受害者、農民 希望搭火車到北京搵中央政府協助 佢哋想中央解決佢哋嘅問題 
"But also, the Bo Xilai case recently, very big news, he's a princeling. ",但係愈來愈多人上訪又會增加革命風險 
"But from February to April this year, Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors. ",所以政府近年遣返佢哋 
"You can almost joke everything about these princelings, everything! It's almost like you're living in the United States. ",有啲甚至會被拉去坐監 
"But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about Beijing, you definitely will be arrested. ",但係而家我哋有微博 我叫呢樣做「微博上訪」 
So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window. ,人民可以用佢哋嘅電話發文 
"So Chinese in China, censorship is normal. ",所以你嘅悲慘故事 可能會咁啱俾記者、教授 或者名人睇到 
"Something you find is, freedom is weird. ","例如微博女王姚晨 佢係中國最受歡迎嘅微博博客 有大概 2,100 萬粉絲 "
Something will happen behind it. ,姚晨嘅微博簡直係一個全國性嘅電視台 
"Because he was a very popular Leftist leader, so the central government wanted to purge him, and he was very cute, he convinced all the Chinese people, why he is so bad. ",如果你嘅故事俾佢睇中 
"So Weibo, the 300 million public sphere, became a very good, convenient tool for a political fight. ",咁就會有好多人睇到 呢個就係微博，即使有政府審查 都阻止唔到三億嘅微博用家每日傾偈 
"But this technology is very new, but technically is very old. ",就好似大型嘅 TED 咁，係咪？ 
"It was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong, because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government. ",同埋，呢種公眾平台都係 第一次喺中國出現 
"It's very simple, because Chinese central government doesn't need to even lead the public opinion. ",中國人開始學習點樣商議同埋同人呻冤 
They just give them a target window to not censor people. ,但係，隻貓， 即係審查冇停過 
Not censoring in China has become a political tool. ,要喺微博上講一啲敏感字 依然係非常困難 
"So that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse. ",譬如，你唔可以 打國家主席嘅名︰胡錦濤 你亦都唔可以打「重慶」兩個字出嚟 直至最近，你更加唔可以 搜尋最高領導人嘅姓 
Social media changed Chinese mindset. ,但中國人非常擅長玩雙關 近義詞同埋諺語 
"More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright, not some imported American privilege. ",佢哋甚至會將一件事講成係 草泥馬同河蟹之間、影響世界嘅鬥爭 
"But also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to, it's like a training of their citizenship, preparing for future democracy. ",去避過耳目 草泥馬即係羊駝 同粗口「操你媽」發音非常相似 亦係網民對自己嘅稱呼 
"But it didn't change the Chinese political system, and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions. ",河蟹發音近似「和諧」 即係審查、被和諧嘅意思 
"So, what's the future? ",所以草泥馬同河蟹兩個名係絕配 
"After all, we are the mouse. ",當有政治事件發生 你會喺微博見到一個非常奇怪嘅現象 
"Whatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat]. ",好多好奇怪嘅詞語、句子會出現 即使你有個中國語文嘅博士學位 都唔會明白佢哋講嘅嘢 
"There is not only in China, but also in the United States there are some very small, cute but bad cats. ",但係你唔可以走去解釋 因為中國嘅新浪微博係 喺中國封鎖 Twitter 啱啱一個月之後 出現嘅產物 
"(Laughter) SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU. ",即係由一開始 中國政府就已經控制咗微博 即係話微博唔會威脅到中國政權 
"And also, like Facebook and Google, they claim they are friends of the mouse, but sometimes we see them dating the cats. ",你喺微博上發表嘅任何嘢 好似「聚集」、「碰頭」 或者「散步」等等 都會自動紀錄低 攞嚟做政治分析 
So my conclusion is very simple. ,即使你計劃好要集會 喺你到達之前，警察已經嚟到 
"We Chinese fight for our freedom, you just watch your bad cats. ",點解？因為佢哋收到料 
Don't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats. ,佢哋手上有曬所有資料 
"Only in this way, in the future, we will achieve the dreams of the mouse: that we can tweet anytime, anywhere, without fear. ",佢哋可以用 1984 年 查異見者嘅方法去查你 
(Applause) Thank you. ,所以壓制係非常嚴重 
(Applause) ,我又想你留意一件好有趣嘅事 喺貓捉老鼠嘅過程入面，貓係審查者 
,但係中國並唔係得一隻貓 除咗中央貓之外，仲有地方貓 
"You know, we wake up in the morning, you get dressed, put on your shoes, you head out into the world. ",（笑聲） 大家都知道，中央貓控制住伺服器 所以即使網民喺網上批評地區政府 地區政府都無權取得儲存喺北京嘅資料 
"You plan on coming back, getting undressed, going to bed, waking up, doing it again, and that anticipation, that rhythm, helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives, and gives it a measure of predictability. ",如果唔賄賂中央貓 地方貓根本咩都做唔到，只可以道歉 
"Living in New York City, as I do, it's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters, it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck. ",所以過去呢三年間 微博上面嘅社會運動 的確令地區政府愈嚟愈透明 講返轉頭，伺服器喺北京 
"You're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible that just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen. ",而地方政府無能力接觸到啲資料 
"And you never think you're going to be the guy who's walking down the street and, because you choose to go down one side or the other, the rest of your life is changed forever. ",咁喺高鐵追尾事故裏面 問題可能唔係問 點解五日內會有一千萬個批評 而係點解中央政府 會容許人民喺網上自由討論五日 
"And one night, I'm riding the uptown local train. ",同埋點解中央政府 當件事從來無發生過咁 
I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant when I get on the subway. ,理由好簡單，因為最高嘅領導人 都頂唔順呢個部長嘅獨立王國 
I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book. ,所以佢哋需要一個理由去整治佢 而社會輿論係一個非常好嘅理由 
"And I get on the car, and I look, and I notice this couple, college-aged, student-looking kids, a guy and a girl, and they're sitting next to each other, and she's got her leg draped over his knee, and they're doing -- they have this little contraption, and they're tying these knots, and they're doing it with one hand, they're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly, and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it. ",順帶一提，近期嘅薄熙來案 係一件大新聞 佢本身係太子黨 
I've never seen anything like this. ,但係今年二月至四月 微博變咗一個講謠言嘅地方 
It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks. ,你點樣開太子黨玩笑都得 形形式式！就好似你喺美國一樣 
"And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car, and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him. ",但如果你夠膽發表任何 關於北京政變嘅虛假消息 就一定會被人拉 
"He's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches, and — (Laughter) — he looks at them, and then in a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them, and he starts to say, ""You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look, if you do this -- "" and he takes the laces out of their hand, and instantly, he starts tying these knots, and even better than they were doing it, remarkably. ",所以呢次嘅自由係有目的同有限制 
"And it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques, and he's the guy giving the lecture. ",所以喺中國 審查係一件再正常不過嘅事 
"(Laughter) So he starts to tell them, and he's like, ""No, this is very important here. You know, when you're needing these knots, it's going to be, you know, everything's going to be happening at the same time, it's going to be -- you're going to have all this information coming at you, there's going to be organs getting in the way, it's going to be slippery, and it's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand, you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers."" ",你會發現，自由真係好奇怪 
"And at that moment, when I heard that, I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, and what had happened was a gang had come in from Brooklyn. ",自由背後總會發生某啲事 
"As part of an initiation for three of their members, they had to kill somebody, and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street that night, and they jumped on me without a word. ",因為薄熙來曾經係 一個好受歡迎嘅左派領導人 所以中央政府想清算佢 同埋佢好有魅力 佢說服咗中國人民接受佢會咁壞 
"One of the very lucky things, when I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team, so I put my hands up right away, instinctively. ",所以擁有三十億用戶嘅微博公共空間 係一個既好用、又方便嘅政治鬥爭工具 
"The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade, and he went in under my elbow, and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava. ",雖然社交科技好新 但係背後嘅概念仍然係舊 
"If you know anything about anatomy, that's not a good thing to get cut, and everything, of course, on the way up, and then — I still had my hands up — he pulled it out and went for my neck, and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck, and I got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out. ",毛澤東發揚呢個概念 佢曾經帶動幾百萬中國人 喺文革時期挫毀每個地區政府 
"The other guy was still working on me, collapsing my other lung, and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute. ",道理好簡單 中央政府根本連控制民意都唔使 
"I ran down the street and collapsed, and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming. ",佢哋只係需要唔審查人民就得嘞 
"And one of the side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision, so I remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision, and I was moving my head around and we got to St. Vincent's, and we're racing down this hallway, and I see the lights going, and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that. ",喺中國，「不審查」 反而變成一個政治工具 
They don't really go to the usual place that memories go. ,以上就係貓捉老鼠遊戲嘅近況 
"They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def, and George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter) So sometimes, remembering them, it's like, it's not like any other kind of memories. ",社交網絡改變咗中國人嘅思維 
"And I get into the trauma room, and they're waiting for me, and the lights are there, and I'd been able to breathe a little more now, because the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs and I was having a very hard time breathing, but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher. ",越嚟越多嘅中國人重視言論自由同人權 相信呢啲係佢哋與生俱來嘅權利 而唔係由美國入口嘅「特權」 
"And I said, ""Is there anything I can do to help?"" ",同時，社交網絡畀咗中國人 一個全國公開嘅討論空間 畀人民學識行使公民權力 為未來民主做準備 
"and — (Laughter) — the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and I'm turning my head trying to see everybody, and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising, raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh, and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me, and I think, ""He looks Bangladeshi,"" — (Laughter) — and I just have those two facts, and I just think, ""This could work somehow."" (Laughter) And then I go out, and they work on me for the rest of the night, and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there while they did their work, and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines, my cecum, organs I didn't know that I had, and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me, which I thought was great, you know, just a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter) And I came to in the morning. ",但係社交網絡並無改變中國現時嘅政制 而中央政府亦都用 中央化嘅伺服器加強佢嘅政權 用以對抗地區政府同其他勢力 
"Out of anesthetic, he had let them know that he wanted to be there, and he had given me about a two percent chance of living. ",咁未來究竟會係點？ 
"So he was there when I woke up, and it was, waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain. ",始終我哋都係老鼠 
"It was that enveloping, and there was only one spot that didn't hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, and it was my instep, and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb. ",無論未來係點，我哋都應該繼續抵抗貓 
"And I looked up, and he's like, ""Good to see you,"" and I was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything, and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said, ""You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson, and you're going to need all the strength you can get."" ",並唔係淨係中國，美國都需要 因為美國都樣有啲 細細隻、可愛但係壞嘅貓 
"And in those days, my hair was down to my waist, I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried, I owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter) But I had three days of life support, and everybody was expecting, due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that I wasn't going to make it, so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop, and — (Laughter) — when I finally pooped, then that somehow, surgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line, and, um — (Laughter) — on that day, the surgeon came in and whipped the sheet off of me. ",（笑聲） 禁止網絡盜版法案、保護知識產權法案 反假冒貿易協定 跨太平洋戰略經濟夥伴關係協議 知識產權法與權利 
"He had three or four friends with him, and he does that, and they all look, and there was no infection, and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding, and they're like, ""There's no hematomas, blah blah, look at the color,"" and they're talking amongst themselves and I'm, like, this restored automobile that he's just going, ""Yeah, I did that."" (Laughter) And it was just, it was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him over how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter) And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in and everything. ",Facebook 同 Google 話自已係老鼠嘅朋友 但係有時我哋會見到兩間公司同貓一齊 
"And later on, when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time, I went back to him and I was sort of asking him, you know, what am I gonna do? ",所以我嘅結論好簡單 
"And I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said, ""Kid, I saved your life. ",我哋中國人喺中國爭取我哋嘅自由 你哋就睇實你哋嘅衰貓 
"Like, now you can do whatever you want, like, you gotta get on with that. ",唔好畀佢哋同中國貓有合作嘅機會 
It's like I gave you a new car and you're complaining about not finding parking. ,只有做到呢一點 未來我哋先可以實現老鼠嘅夢想： 可以隨時隨地發表任何意見 而唔需要怕被清算 
"Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best. ",（掌聲） 多謝 
"But you're alive. That's what it's about."" ",（掌聲） 
"And then I hear, ""Bing-bong,"" and the subway doors are closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids, and I go, I think to myself, ""I'm going to lift my shirt up and show them,"" — (Laughter) — and then I think, ""No, this is the New York City subway, that's going to lead to other things."" (Laughter) And so I just think, they got their lecture to go to. ",
"I step off, I'm standing on the platform, and I feel my index finger in the first scar that I ever got, from my umbilical cord, and then around that, is traced the last scar that I got from my surgeon, and I think that, that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team, and their training and their skill and, always, a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos. ",我哋朝早起身，著衫著鞋 然後離開屋企 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you. (Applause) ,一日完咗之後 你會返嚟屋企，換衫瞓覺 第二日起身又重覆琴日嘅嘢 就係呢個節奏令到生活有一個結構 幫我哋組織生活 畀到我哋有預算 
,我住喺紐約 紐約喺一個細嘅地方 呢個城市每分每秒 好多人做緊好多嘅嘢 而生命就好似你喺一局入面 同時玩緊幾副啤牌咁 
"I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years. ",所有事情一齊發生係可能嘅 只不過你無諗過事情真嘅會同時發生啫 
"But I want to start with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work. ",你無諗過你會係街上某某人 因為行左或者行右嘅決定 你嘅餘生將會因此改變 
"What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner. ",有一晚我喺郊區坐地鐵 
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped. ,我上咗車，我往往比較警惕 當我撘地鐵時 
"And so I want to tell you about that first, and then go on into where I think love is going. ",我唔似其他人咁載住耳筒或者睇書 
"(Laughter) ""What 'tis to love?"" Shakespeare said. ",我上咗車之後會四圍望 我見到呢對情侶 大約廿歲、似係大學生 一男一女一齊坐 個女仔將隻腳放喺男仔嘅膝頭上面 佢哋玩緊一個小玩意 佢哋喺度打緊一堆繩結 佢哋用一隻手打結 用左手又用右手好快咁打結 然後個女仔將嗰堆繩結 交咗俾個男 
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago. ,到個男仔打結 我從未見過類似嘅嘢 
"I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of the psychological research and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love. ",佢哋好似練習魔術咁 
"The first thing that happens is, a person begins to take on what I call, ""special meaning."" ",到下一個站，有個男人上車 睇佢個樣好似係大學教授 
"As a truck driver once said to me, ""The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."" ",佢嘅真皮斜揹袋塞滿嘢 佢有個文件夾同手提電腦袋 著住斜紋軟呢外套 件外套仲有幾塊真皮補釘 同埋…（笑聲） 佢望住嗰對情侶 然後轉瞬間，佢跪喺佢哋面前 佢開始講︰ 「你哋聽住，你哋應該咁做。 睇住，如果咁樣做…」 佢攞咗佢哋嘅繩結，然後打結 打得比佢哋仲好 
George Bernard Shaw said it differently. ,原來嗰對男女係醫科生 佢哋喺返學途中 準備去上關於最新縫合技術嘅堂 而嗰個男人就係佢哋嘅講師 
Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another. ,（笑聲） 佢就話畀佢哋聽︰「唔喺呀， 當你哋需要打呢啲結嘅時候， 呢度好重要。 所有嘢要係同時發生。 你要處理所有資訊， 又有啲內臟要處理， 啲嘢又跣手。 超越本能咁做係好重要。 用每一隻手，又左手，又右手。 你哋必須喺睇唔到手指嘅情況底下 打到呢啲結。」 
(Laughter) And then you just focus on this person. ,嗰一刻，當我聽到佢咁樣講 我即刻諗返嗰晚我被刺傷喺行人路 當時我俾救護車送到 曼哈頓聖文森醫院急症室 當時發生嘅事係 布魯克林區有三個古惑仔 
"You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. ",因為要行入會儀式 佢哋要殺一個人 而我啱啱好喺布里克街行過 嗰晚，佢哋毫無先兆落就撲向我 
"As Chaucer said, ""Love is blind."" ",但好彩嘅係 我讀聖母院大學時，我係拳擊隊隊員 所以我直覺舉起雙手 
"In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world, and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman. ",右手邊嗰個人有把 10 吋長嘅刀 佢喺我手肘下面出手 把刀跟住上去，刺穿我嘅下腔大靜脈 
It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different from every other car in the parking lot. ,如果你有讀過解剖學嘅話 就知唔係一件好事 當然把刀仲刺埋一路嘅組織 但我仍然舉起雙手 佢就掹出把刀，插落我條頸度 插到剩返刀柄露出嚟 我用右手記嗰個人一拳 就係企喺中間嗰嗰 
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party. ,但係第二個人仍然打我 打傷我另一邊肺部 我還擊嗰個人，爭取一分鐘時間 
"And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat. ",我一直走，最後瞓低咗 救護員喺行人路度幫我插喉 同埋話畀急症室知有人送緊入嚟 
And it goes like this. ,其中一個大量失血嘅副作用就係 你嘅視力會變成管狀視 所以我記得喺擔架上嘅時候 我嘅視力變成亳子咁細 我喺車上另頭咁望 之後我送到去聖文森醫院 我哋喺醫院走廊上面衝 我見到啲燈不斷閃過 都算係記憶中幾特別嘅效果 
It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen. ,咁樣嘅記憶又唔同於一般記憶 
"The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."" ",佢哋似儲存高清錄影帶一樣 存喺保險櫃度 而腦裏邊佐治魯卡斯 會負責所有音響效果 （笑聲） 所以有時諗起呢啲記憶 佢哋唔似其他記憶 
"He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me. ",當我被推到去急症室時 佢哋喺度等緊我，有啲燈喺嗰度 嗰刻我可以呼吸多啲空氣 因為啲血已經流返入我個肺度 我之前一度呼吸困難 嗰刻我瞓喺擔架上 
"But anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them. ",我話：「有咩嘢我可以幫忙呢？」 
You aggrandize them. ,然後…（笑聲） 有個護士雖然好緊張，但都喺度笑 我另個頭嘗試睇睇所有人 然後一個奇怪嘅回憶湧現 就係我喺大學為孟加拉水災災民籌款 然後我望一望麻醉師 佢幫緊我載面罩 我就諗︰「佢好似孟加拉人！」 （笑聲） 就呢兩件事我諗︰ 「呢兩樣嘢有關係嘅」（笑聲） 然後我就冇知覺 佢哋成晚都幫我做手術 醫生輸咗大約 40 包血去保住我條命 醫生仲攞咗我 大約三份之一嘅腸、我嘅盲腸 我都唔知我有嘅器官 佢後嚟話畀我知 佢最後做嘅其中一件事 係幫我割咗闌尾 我覺得幾好 只係腸末端一嚿細嘢 （笑聲） 第二朝我醒返，麻醉藥消散 
"As one Polynesian said, ""I felt like jumping in the sky."" ",佢之前交帶同事話畀佢知 我醒返就搵佢 佢之前仲估我只有百份之二嘅存活率 
You're up all night. You're walking till dawn. ,所以當我醒嗰時，佢喺度 醒返就好似 跌穿結冰嘅湖面、墜入冰湖咁痛苦 
You feel intense elation when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly. ,我全身都痛 除咗我隻腳嘅內弓 比其他地方冇咁痛之外 身體任何一部分都好痛 但係醫生捉住我嘅腳板 用大拇指按摩我嘅腳內弓 
Real dependence on this person. ,我望佢 佢個樣好似同我講「見到你真好」 我當時嘗試記返發生咗乜嘢事 我嘗試諗返所有嘢 但係真係好痛 而佢話︰「我哋無同你剪頭髮， 因為我想你會好似辛普森大力士咁 從頭髮裏面得到力量， 而你會需要所有你攞到嘅力量。」 
"As one businessman in New York said to me, ""Anything she liked, I liked."" ",嗰時候，我嘅頭髮長到條腰 亦都揸電單車，未婚，有一間酒吧 所以嗰時真係好唔一樣 （笑聲） 但係我用咗生命維持器三日 所有人都覺得 佢哋做咗咁多嘢，我唔會生存到 所以有三日 所有人都喺度一係等我死 一係等我屙屎 然後…（笑聲） 最後當我屙屎嘅時候 從手術嘅角度而言 就好似你已經跨越咗生同死嘅界線 然後…（笑聲） 嗰一日，醫生入嚟，拉開我張被 
Simple. Romantic love is very simple. ,佢同三四個人一齊 當佢做檢查嘅時候，嗰幾個人都睇住 佢睇到我無任何感染 佢哋烏低身，戳一戳，推一推 佢哋好似想講︰ 「無血腫，諸如此類。睇下啲顏色。」 佢哋之間喺度傾偈 我就似一部啱啱維修好 嘅私家車，可以行 而醫生好似想講︰ 「耶！我整好啦！」（笑聲） 呢幕真係開心嘅，佢哋之間擊掌 慶祝我手術有幾成功 （笑聲） 我仲有個未縫合嘅傷口 釘同所有嘅嘢 
You become extremely sexually possessive. ,然後，我出院之後 回憶同惡夢令我有段日子好痛苦 我返去搵嗰位醫生 我問佢我可以做乜嘢 
"You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually, you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else. ",佢身為一個醫生，佢基本上咁樣講 「細路，我救咗你， 
"But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely sexually possessive of them. ",你依家可以做你想做嘅事。 你要接受現實，繼續生活落去。 
I think there's a Darwinian purpose to this. ,好似我畀咗架新車你， 你卻喺度投訴揾唔到車位。 
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team. ,出去啦，你做到最好就得㗎嘞。 
"But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving: an intense craving to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally. ",你仲活着。成件事就係咁。」 
"It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you. ",然後我聽到乒乓聲，地鐵門閂緊 我下一個站先落車 於是我望住嗰兩個醫科生 我又諗「我要拉起件衫畀佢哋睇」 （笑聲） 然後我又諗 ︰ 「唔得，呢度係紐約地鐵， 我咁做會有其他後果。」（笑聲） 我諗佢哋都要上堂，所以我冇打擾佢哋 
The other main characteristic is motivation. ,我行出車箱，企喺月台 我將食指放喺 由臍帶造成嘅第一條疤痕 然後圍繞住佢 掃到由外科醫生做嘅最後一條疤痕 我諗呢個偶然 遇到喺街上攞住刀嘅古惑仔 帶我去到我嘅手術團隊 佢哋嘅訓練、佢哋嘅技巧 同埋逢凶化吉嘅運氣 
"The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person. ",多謝 （掌聲） 多謝 嚟到呢裡真係好幸運。多謝 
"And last but not least, it is an obsession. ",
"Before I put these people in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions. ",今日我想跟大家講吓未來世紀兩個最大嘅社會趨勢 或者會係未來一萬年嘅事。 
But my most important question was always the same. ,但我想由我對浪漫愛情嘅研究講起 因為呢樣係我最近期嘅工作 
"It was: ""What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"" ",我同我啲同事將32個瘋狂地戀愛緊嘅人 放入一部大腦功能磁力共振掃描儀 
"And indeed, they would say, ""All day. All night. ",其中17個相戀緊嘅人，佢哋嘅愛有被對方接受 其餘15個人都係瘋狂地愛緊，但佢哋啱啱被人拋棄 
"And then, the very last question -- I would always have to work myself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist. ",我想同你哋講呢件事先 然後再講我覺得愛情會點樣發展 
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation. ,莎士比亞問「愛係乜嘢?」 
My final question was always the same. ,我認為，我們嘅祖先 - 我認為人類一直都喺度思索呢個問題 從他們在100萬年前，圍着營火而坐，觀看星際的時候開始 
"I would say, ""Would you die for him or her?"" ",我開始嘗試了解浪漫愛情係乜嘢 睇翻過去45年以來嘅研究 - 淨係關於心理學嘅研究 我發現當人墜入愛河嘅時候，以下一系列嘅事會發生 
"And, indeed, these people would say ""Yes!"" ",首先發生嘅就是，我所講嘅 一個人開始產生我所講嘅「特殊意義」 
as if I had asked them to pass the salt. ,正如一位貨車司機曾經對我講 佢講：「世界有咗一個新嘅中心點，而呢個中心就係瑪麗安妮」 
I was just staggered by it. ,蕭伯納嘅講法有啲唔同 
"So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. ",佢話：「愛情係高估咗一個女人同另一個女人之間嘅差別」 事實就係咁樣（眾笑) 
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. ,然後你淨係集中喺呢個人身上 
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions. ,你可以列出你唔喜歡佢地乜嘢 但你可以將呢啲嘢放理一邊，淨係專注你自己所做嘅嘢 
"In fact, one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine. ",正如喬叟講：「愛情係盲目嘅」 
"And indeed, that's exactly what happens. ",為咗嘗試了解浪漫愛情 我決定翻讀世界各地嘅詩歌韻文 我想同你分享一段來自第八世紀中國嘅短詩 佢將一個專注地鍾情於一個女人嘅男人描述得淋漓盡致 
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. ,就好似當你瘋狂地愛上咗一個人 當你入到一個停車場嘅時候 嗰個人部車同停車場入面嘅其他車係唔同嘅 
"In fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low. ",就算係晚宴嘅時候，佢哋嘅酒杯都特別同宴會上其他人嘅酒杯唔同 
"But actually, it's a drive. ",而喺呢一首詩入面，一個男人對一張竹蓆情有獨鍾 
"It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind. ",呢首詩嘅作者係元稹，内容係 
"The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work. ",「竹簟衬重茵，未忍都令卷 
The motor of the brain. ,忆昨初来日，看君自施展」 
"And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. ",他迷上咗嗰一張蓆 可能係因為佢大腦嘅多巴胺提升咗 就好似你同我一樣 
"You know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you, and they say, ""No, thank you,"" you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. ",呢個人唔單只產生咗特別嘅意義 你會專注予他們 
"But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected in love will kill for it. ",你會誇大佢。而你會有強烈嘅能量 
People live for love. ,正如一位波利尼西亞人講，「我想喺天上面跳」 
"They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. ",你可以成晚唔瞓。你可以行路到天亮 
"In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. ",事情進展順利嘅時候，你會覺得無比喜悅 但當遇到任何唔如意嘅事，你嘅情緒可以波動到絕望同可怕嘅程度 
I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. ,你會變得好依賴呢個人 
And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. ,正如一位喺紐約嘅商人對我講，佢話「佢鍾意乜，我就鍾意乜。」 
One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification. ,簡單。浪漫愛情是很簡單的。 
"W.H. Auden called it an ""intolerable neural itch,"" and indeed, that's what it is. ",你嘅性佔有欲會變得好強 
"It keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry. ",你知道，如果你隨便同一個人上床 你不會介意佢同其他人上床 
"The second of these three brain systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love. ",但是，當你愛上一個人嘅時候 你對佢嘅性佔有欲會變得非常強烈 
And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner. ,從達爾文理論來講，我認為這一點是有意義嘅 
"And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners. ",整個目的就係將兩人拉埋一齊 等佢地可以一齊開始照顧嬰兒 
You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car. ,但係，浪漫愛情嘅主要特徵係渴望 對某一個人產生嘅強烈渴望，唔單只喺性欲上，喺感情上都係 
It can be focused on nobody. ,你寧願 - 同但上床都唔錯 但你希望佢會打電話畀你，約你去街，等等 然後對你講，佢愛你 
"I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy. ",另一個主要嘅特點係動力 
"And I think that attachment, the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough to raise a child together as a team. ",你大腦嘅摩打會開始郁，你想得到呢個人 
"So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends. ",最後，但唔可以忽視嘅，愛係一種痴迷 
"One of the last 10,000 years and the other, certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner. ",當我將嗰啲人放入磁力共振掃描儀之前 我會問佢地各種問題 
"The first is women working, moving into the workforce. ",但係，最重要嗰個問題是一樣嘅 
I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations. ,呢個問題係：「一日一夜之中，百分之幾嘅時間你會諗住呢個人？」 
"Everywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power, health and education. ",佢地眞係會講「成日。成晚。我無辦法唔去諗佢。」 
It's very slow. ,然後，最後一個問題，我會問佢地 -- 我每次都要為呢個問題作好心理準備 因為我唔係心理學家 
"For every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend. ",喺工作上，我唔會接觸到受過創傷嘅人 
"We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, ""The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."" ",而我最後嗰個問題每次都係一樣 
"And, indeed, that caravan is moving on. ",我會問「你會唔會為佢而死呀？」 
Women are moving back into the job market. ,而事實上，呢啲人會答「會！」 
"And I say back into the job market, because this is not new. ",就好像我問佢地可唔可以遞啲鹽過來 
"For millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work to gather their vegetables. ",真係好得人驚 
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal. ,所以，我哋掃描佢哋嘅大腦，畀佢哋睇吓佢哋情人嘅相片，然後畀佢哋睇一張沒乜特別嘅相片 仲有畀一啲令佢哋分心嘅任務 咁我哋就可以發現 - 睇住同一個腦袋，當佢興奮嘅狀態 
The double income family was the standard. ,同當佢靜止嘅狀態 
"And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. ",我哋發現喺多個大腦區域都有活動 事實上，最重要嘅就係其中一個大腦區域 
"In short, we're really moving forward to the past. ",呢個大腦區域受到可卡因刺激時會活躍起來 
"Then, women's worst invention was the plow. ",事實上就係咁樣 
"With the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful. ",我開始明白，浪漫愛情并唔係一種情感 
"Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. ",我一直認為佢係一系列嘅情緒 從極高至極低 
"In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago. ",但實際上，佢係一個驅動器。佢來自於意念中嘅摩打 
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. ,意念中希望嗰一部分，意念中渴望嗰一部分。 
And it's going to have an impact. ,呢種意念 - 就好似 當你伸手去攞嗰一塊朱古力 當你想升職嘅時侯 
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community. ,大腦入面嘅摩打，係一個驅動器 
"I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love. ",而事實上，我覺得佢比性慾更強烈 
There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. ,你諗吓，如果你要求一個人同你上床，然後佢話「唔好啦，多謝」 你一定不會因為咁而自殺或者陷入抑鬱症 
I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike. ,但係，世界各地，肯定有好多被愛拒絕嘅人都甘心為佢而死 
"There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common. ",人為愛而生。為愛殺人。為愛而死。 
"We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes, ""I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."" ",佢哋有歌曲，詩歌，小說，雕塑，繪畫，神話，傳說。 
But we did not evolve to have the same brain. ,喺超過175個社會裹面，都有呢樣強大嘅大腦系統留低嘅證據 
And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain. ,我認為呢個係地球上最勁嘅大腦系統 佢同時產生無比喜悅同無比悲痛 
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love. ,我認為，佢係三個之中嘅一個 基本上經交配同繁殖演變出來嘅大腦系統， 
One of them is women's verbal ability. ,第一係性慾，追求滿足性嘅欲望 
"Women's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak. ",W.H.奧登叫佢做「頂唔順嘅神經癢」 而事實上就係咁 
Women can talk. ,佢一直煩住你一啲啲，就好似肚餓咁 
"They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words. ",第二個大腦系統係浪漫嘅愛情 嗰種歡欣鼓舞，痴迷嘅熱戀 
"And, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force. ",第三個大腦系統係依戀感 你可以喺老伴身邊感受到嘅平靜同安全 
"Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism. ",我認為性慾嘅進化係為咗帶你走來 去搵一系列嘅伴侶 
And I think that the television is like the global campfire. ,你知道，當你開車嗰陣時你可以感受到 
We sit around it and it shapes our minds. ,注意力唔使特別用喺任何人身上 
"Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producer who calls me, who negotiates what we're going to say, is a woman. ",我覺得愛情係進化出來嘅，令你能夠集中交配嘅精力 任何時間都只係响一個人身上 以節省交配時間同精力 
"In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, ""To have a great writer is to have another government."" ",而我認為，依戀感，第三個大腦系統 進化來使你能夠容忍呢個人（眾笑） 等你們有至少足夠時間一齊養大一個細路 
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women. ,以此序言，我想討論兩個最深長嘅社會趨勢 
"It's one of many, many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. ",過往一萬年- 至少係過去25年 - 對呢三個不同嘅大腦系統會有一定嘅影響 對一個伴侶嘅性慾望，愛情同依戀感 
"They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills. ",首先係婦女工作，進入勞動市場 
They're highly imaginative. ,我從聯合國人口年鑑中查看咗150 或130個社會 
"We now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning. ",喺世界各地，130個國家，其中有129個，婦女唔單只進入就業市場 -- 雖然有時係非常，非常緩慢地，但佢地都進入緊就業市場 -- 而男女之間喺經濟實力，衛生同教育方面 嘅差距慢慢咁縮細 
They tend to be web thinkers. ,好慢咁縮細 
"Because the female parts of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes. ",每一個趨勢 - 喺呢個星球上，都有一個反趨勢 
"They tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers. ",我地都知道佢地嘅存在，然而 - 正如阿拉伯古語 阿拉伯人話「狗可以吠，但車隊仍會向前行」 
"Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern. ",而事實上，呢隊車隊向緊前行 
They're both perfectly good ways of thinking. ,婦女重返就業市場 
We need both of them to get ahead. ,我話重返就業市場，因為呢樣並唔係新事 
"In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world. ",幾百萬年以來，喺非洲嘅草原上 婦女為工作而通勤，收集佢地嘅蔬菜 
And there's also many more male idiots in the world. ,佢地帶百分之六十至八十嘅晚餐返屋企 
"(Laughter) When the male brain works well, it works extremely well. ",雙收入家庭係當時嘅標準 
"And what I really think that we're doing is, we're moving towards a collaborative society, a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed. ",經濟上，社會上同性權力上，當時婦女嘅力量同男人不相百仲 
"But in fact, women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life. ",總之，我地就好似返番去以前 
"Foremost, women are starting to express their sexuality. ",然後，對婦女來講，最弊嘅發明就係犁 
"I'm always astonished when people come to me and say, ""Why is it that men are so adulterous?"" ",隨著人開始用犁耕作後，男人喺角色變得非常強大 
Why do you think more men are adulterous than women? ,婦女失去咗佢地以往採集者嘅任務 但隨着工業革命同後工業革命 佢地返回就業市場 
"Well, men are more adulterous! ",簡言之，佢地重新得到佢地喺100萬年前擁有嘅地位 一萬年前，十萬年前。 
(Laughter) And -- basic math! ,我地依家睇嘅係人類歷史上一個最顯著嘅傳統 
Anyway. ,而佢係會產生影響嘅 
"In the Western world, women start sooner at sex, have more partners, express less remorse for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages in order to get good ones. ",我通常會用成個講議講婦女喺商界嘅影響 
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression. ,我今日只會略略講一下，然後再講性同愛 
"And, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today. ",性別上嘅差異有好多 認為男人跟女人是相同嘅人大慨從來未試過帶大一個男孩同一個女孩吧 
We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality. ,我唔知道佢地點解認為男人因女人都是一樣嘅 
"They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the ""symmetrical marriage,"" or the ""pure marriage,"" or the ""companionate marriage."" ",我地有好多共通點，但喺很多方面 我地無共通點 
"This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit. ",我地係 - 引用泰德休斯嘅話 「我認為，我地係專登生成咁樣嘅 - 我地就好似兩隻腳。我地需要對方先至可以前進」 
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love. ,但係，我地無進化到個大腦一樣 
"91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person. ",我地從大腦中發現越來越多性別上嘅差異 
"People around the world, in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love with the person that they marry. ",我只舉幾個例子，然後就講性與愛。 
"Indeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life. ",其中之一是女人嘅口頭表達能力。女人好講得。 
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend. ,女人有迅速地選擇合適嘅詞語同基本發音嘅能力，而呢個能力 係會隨着雌激素水平上升而題升，喺月經週期嘅中段達到高峰 但即使喺月經期間，佢地嘅語言能力都仲係比一般男人強 
"The first one being women moving into the job market, the second one being the aging world population. ",女人十分「講得」 數百萬年來佢地一直都係咁;文字係婦女嘅工具 
"They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85. ",佢地將嬰兒放喺面前 哄佢，譴責佢，教佢講嘢 
"Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them. ",而事實上，佢地成為緊一股非常強大嘅力量 
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age. ,即使喺印度同日本呢啲國家 儘管婦女未能迅速地進入正規就業市場 佢地好多時投身新聞界 
"For one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies. ",我認為電視就好似全球性嘅營火 
"And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce. ",我地圍着佢坐，佢塑造着我地嘅思想 
"So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline. ",幾乎每次，當我電視上嘅時候，打電話俾我嘅制片人都係女人 同我地談判演講內容嘅總係一個女人 
It may decline some more. ,事實上，索爾仁尼琴曾經講過 「有一個好嘅筆者就係有另一個政府」 
"I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been as interesting as they are now. ",今日，美國百分之五十四嘅作家係女人。 
"Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable. ",呢樣係女性許多，許多特色之其一 佢地可以將呢個能力帶入就業市場 
"And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now. ",佢地有令人難以置信嘅人際技巧，談判技巧 
"However, there's always kinds of complications in this. ",佢地好有想像力 
"These three brain systems -- lust, romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together. ",我地依家知道想像力同長期規劃能力嘅大腦電路系統 
That's why casual sex isn't so casual. ,佢地往往係網絡思想家 
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. ,由於女性嘅大腦部分比男人嘅連接得更好 當女人思考時，佢地往往會收集更多嘅數據 將佢地放入複雜嘅模式，睇到更多選擇同結果 
"Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. ",佢地往往着重於關聯性嘅，整體嘅思想家，我所稱之為嘅網絡思想家 
"With orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment. ",男性嘅傾向係 - 普遍來講 - 往往拋開佢地認為無關嘅 淨係專注於佢地做緊嘅嘢，並用一步一步嘅思維模式運作 
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them. ,呢兩種都是非常好嘅思維方式 
"But these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other. ",我地需要有呢兩種思維方式先可以成功 
"You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners. ",事實上，世上嘅男天才比女嘅多 
"In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time. ",但世上嘅男白痴就更多（眾笑） 
"In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else. ",當男性大腦運作良好嘅時候，佢可運作得非常好。 
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do. ,我確實認為我地建立緊一個合作性嘅社會 喺呢個社會入面，越來越多人會理解男性同女性嘅才能 而被重視同使用 
"So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal that was built to be happy; we are an animal that was built to reproduce. ",但事實上，婦女進入就業市場正產生緊巨大嘅影響 喺性，感情同家庭生活方面 
"I think the happiness we find, we make. ",最重要嘅係，女性正開始表達佢地嘅性特性 
"And I think, however, we can make good relationships with each other. ",我總覺得驚訝，當人哋同我講： 「男人點解咁鍾意去滾呢?」 
So I want to conclude with two things. ,我會講：「你點解覺得男人去滾多過女人呢？」 
"I want to conclude with a worry, and with a wonderful story. ",「哦，總之男人就係鍾意去滾多啲！」 我會講，「咁你認為呢啲男人會同咩人上床呀？」 
The worry is about antidepressants. ,基本嘅數學！（眾笑） 
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States. ,總之。 
And these drugs are going generic. ,喺西方世界裡面，細路女開始 - 女性較早有性行為，而且有更多嘅性伴侶 對佢地有過嘅伴侶比較少後悔 晚婚，少生細路，會離開唔愉快嘅婚姻，去得到更好嘅婚姻 
They are seeping around the world. ,我地睇到女性嘅性表達加強 
"I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13. ",而事實上，我地再次邁向嘅性表現 可能就好似我地一百萬年前喺非洲嘅草原見過嘅 因為呢種性表現就好似我哋 今日喺狩獵同採集性嘅社會裡面可以睇看到嘅 
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13. ,我地有番古老嘅平等形式婚姻 
"I've got nothing against people who take them short term, when they're going through something horrible. ",啲人依家話，二十一世紀 會係佢地所講嘅「對稱婚姻」嘅世紀 或者「純粹婚姻」，或者「伴侶婚姻」 
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else. ,呢樣係一個平等夥伴之間嘅婚姻 返番去一個配合古代人類精神嘅模式 
I would recommend it. ,我地亦都見到浪漫愛情嘅興起 
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term. ,百分之91嘅美國女性，同百分之86嘅美國男人 不會同一個合符嗮佢地要求嘅人結婚 除非佢愛嗰個人 
"And by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit. ",世界各地嘅人，喺37個社會嘅研究 希望會愛佢地嘅結婚對象 
Everybody knows that. ,事實上，盲婚啞嫁嘅包辦婚姻正漸漸没落 
Dopamine is associated with romantic love. ,我甚至認為婚姻可能會變得更加穩定 因為世界上第二大嘅趨勢 
"Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive. ",第一個係婦女進入就業市場 第二個係世界人口老齡化 
"And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm. ",人地依家話，喺美國， 到85歲都仲係算係中年 
"And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment. ",因為就算係呢個最高嘅年齡組別，76至85歲 -- 差唔多百分之四十嘅人身體冇乜問題 
The things are connected in the brain. ,所以，我哋睇到中年嘅延長 
"And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another. ",我查過 - 為我嘅一本書，我查過58個社會離婚嘅數據 
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place. ,我發現，你年紀越大，離婚嘅可能性就越低 
So now -- (Applause) Thank you. ,因此，美國依家嘅離婚率穩定 實際上開始跌 
I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years. ,可能仲會再跌低啲 
I'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike. ,我甚至覺得，隨著偉哥，雌激素補充，髖關節置換 同埋難以置信地有趣嘅女人 --女人從來未試過好似佢地依家咁有趣 
"Why you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike. ",喺呢個星球，女人從來未試過好似依家咁高教育，咁有味道，咁能幹 所以，我眞係認為，如果喺人類進化史上 
"And about a year ago, an Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them. ",我們有機會搞好婚姻，依家就係時候 
"I said, ""I don't know anything about personality. You know? ",但係，有啲嘢都幾複雜 
"I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"" ",呢三個大腦系統：性慾，浪漫愛情同依戀 唔一定成日都可以一齊 但佢地係可以兼容嘅 
"They said, ""Yes."" ",所以隨便嘅性交並唔係咁隨便嘅 
That's my current project; it will be my next book. ,隨着性高潮，你大腦會產生多巴胺 
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another. ,多巴胺關聯到浪漫愛情 所以你可以愛上一個隨便性交嘅伴侶 有咗性高潮，你會產生大量嘅催產素同加壓素 
Timing is important. Proximity is important. ,使你聯系到依戀感 
Mystery is important. ,因為咁，你可以感受到同另一個人嘅宇宙結合 當你同佢造完愛之後 
"You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love. ",但呢三個大腦系統：性慾，浪漫愛情同依戀 並唔一定係彼此相連嘅 
"You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your ""love map,"" an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up. ",你可以對你嘅長期伴侶有深厚感情同依戀 同時可以對另一個人有強烈嘅浪漫愛情感覺 同時又可對其他人有性慾 
"And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems. ",總之，同一時間我哋能夠愛多過一個人 
And that's what I'm now contributing to this. ,事實上，當你夜晚瞓喺床上面 你嘅感覺可以從對一個人深厚的依附轉到 對另一個人嘅浪漫愛意 
"But I want to tell you a story, to illustrate. ",就好像喺你個腦袋裏面開緊一個委員會會議 正當你試圖決定點做 
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love. ,所以坦白講，我唔認為，我哋呢樣生物，注定係快樂嘅 人類呢樣動物係為繁殖而生嘅 
"I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too, the magic of it. ",我認為，我哋揾到嘅幸福係要靠我哋自己去創造嘅 
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one -- probably a true story. ,不過，我認為我哋可以建立良好嘅關係 
It was a graduate student -- I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues -- Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook. ,因此，我想總結兩件事 我想以憂慮來總結 
That's where we put our people in the MRI machine. ,我有一個憂慮 - 同一個美好嘅故事 
"And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him. ",我擔心嘅係對抗抑鬱嘅藥物 
And they were all at a conference in Beijing. ,每年喺美國有超過一億張抗抑鬱藥嘅處方被派發 
"And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody, you can drive up the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love. ",而呢啲藥物變得通用 
(Laughter) So he decided he'd put science to work. ,佢地滲透世界各地 
"And sure enough -- I've never been in one, but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting. ",我認識一個使用呢啲抗抑鬱藥嘅女仔，增強五羥色胺嘅藥 從佢13歲開始，佢一直使用再攝取抑製劑 - 加強羥色胺嘅抗抑鬱藥 
"He figured that this would drive up the dopamine, and she'd fall in love with him. ",佢依家23歲。佢從13歲開始就一直使用呢啲藥物 
So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time. ,我唔反對人哋短期性地使用呢啲藥物 當佢哋經歷緊非常可怕嘅事情 
"An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up and she says, ""Wasn't that wonderful?"" ",當佢地想自殺或殺死人哋嘅時候 
"And, ""Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"" ",我會推薦佢地用呢啲藥物 
(Laughter) (Applause) There's magic to love! ,但係，喺美國越來越多人長期服用呢啲藥物 事實上，呢啲藥物嘅作用係提高羥色胺嘅水平 
"(Applause) But I will end by saying that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner. ",提高咗羥色胺嘅水平，多巴胺會被抑制 
"They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called ""this mortal coil."" ",大家都知道 
Thank you. ,多巴胺係聯系着浪漫愛情嘅 
,抗抑鬱藥唔單只抑制多巴胺，佢仲會會埋沒性慾 
"It's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey, to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me. ",當你埋沒咗性慾，你亦埋沒咗性高潮 
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago when an extended illness changed the way I could access the world. ,當你埋沒咗高潮，你亦埋沒咗嗰堆聯系着依戀感嘅化學物 
"When I started using the wheelchair, it was a tremendous new freedom. ",大腦入面嘅嘢係連接住嘅 
I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted. ,當你篡改大腦其中一個系統嘅時候 你會整到另一個系統 
It was like having an enormous new toy. ,我只係簡單地講，冇愛嘅世界是一個枯燥嘅地方 
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again. ,所以，依家 - （掌聲） - 謝謝你。 我想用一個小故事去結束。然後，一個意見。 
Just being out on the street was exhilarating. ,我花咗30年去學習浪漫愛情，性同依戀 
"But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom, people's reaction completely changed towards me. ",我係雙胞胎，我對點解我地都係一樣而感興趣 
"It was as if they couldn't see me anymore, as if an invisibility cloak had descended. ",點解你同我都咁相似，點解伊拉克人同日本人 澳洲原住民同喺亞馬遜河嘅人都咁相似 
They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair. ,大約一年前，一個網絡交友服務嘅綱站，Match.com，來揾我 問我可唔可以幫佢哋設計一個新嘅交友網站 
"When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair, they used words like ""limitation,"" ""fear,"" ""pity"" and ""restriction."" ",我話:「我對人物個性咩都唔識。你知道嗎？」 
I realized I'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level. ,「我唔知呀。你真係認為我係合適嘅人選？」 
A part of me had become alienated from myself. ,佢地話：「係」 我開始諗點解你會愛上呢個人，而唔係嗰個人 
"I was seeing myself not from my perspective, but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people's responses to me. ",呢樣就係我當前嘅項目，係我下一本書嘅題材 
"As a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience, new narratives to reclaim my identity. ",有各種原因令你愛上一個人，而唔係其他人 
"[""Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' — Davis 2009, TEDx Women""] I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair -- a power chair -- to negotiate the world. ",時間非常重要。距離嘅遠近亦係重要 
"I was working to transform these internalized responses, to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when I started using a wheelchair, by creating unexpected images. ",神秘感係重要嘅。你愛上嘅人係要有點神秘感嘅 
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with. ,部分原因係神秘感可提升係大腦中嘅多巴胺 可能將你推入戀愛嘅門檻 
"When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom, it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people. ",你愛上嘅人會吻合你嘅「愛圖」 係你由童年時，無意識地建立嘅特性清單 
"It seemed to open up new perspectives, and therein lay the paradigm shift. ",我亦認為你變得 被某啲人吸引，其實是因為你們有互相配合嘅大腦系統 
It showed that an arts practice can remake one's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar. ,而呢樣正係我依家想講嘅 
"So when I began to dive, in 2005, I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does, but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure, completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair. ",但我想同你講一個故事 - 去描述 
"So I thought, ""I wonder what'll happen if I put the two together?"" (Laughter) (Applause) And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years. ",我一直喺度講愛嘅生物學源頭 
"So to give you an idea of what that's like, I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle, and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on. ",我都想同你講一啲關於愛嘅文化 佢嘅魔力 
"(Music) (Applause) It is the most amazing experience, beyond most other things I've experienced in life. ",呢個故事係由人哋講我知嘅，而佢又係聽另一個人講嘅 可能係真人真事 佢係個研究生 - 係我喺羅格斯大學嘅兩位同事 - 
I literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom. ,阿倫係喺石溪嘅紐約州立大學 
And the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too. ,喺我哋將人放入磁力共振掃描儀嘅地方 
"Their eyes literally light up, and they say things like, ""I want one of those,"" or, ""If you can do that, I can do anything."" ",呢位研究生瘋狂地愛上咗另一個研究生 但係佢(女)並唔愛佢(男) 
"And I'm thinking, it's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for, or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair, they have to think in a completely new way. ",有一次但佢地去咗北京開會 佢從我哋嘅研究上知道，如果你同一個人去做一啲新奇嘅事 
And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives. ,你可以提升喺大腦中嘅多巴胺 或者能夠觸發大腦系統感到浪漫愛情 （眾笑） 
"For me, this means that they're seeing the value of difference, the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation, we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives. ",所以，佢決定試驗一下呢個科學理論 佢邀請呢位姑娘去同佢一齊坐人力車 
"For me, the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation. ",果然 - 我從來未坐過 聽講佢哋從巴士同貨車之間穿插 好瘋狂，好嘈，好令人興奮 
"In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair ""Portal,"" because it's literally pushed me through into a new way of being, into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness. ",佢估計，今次實可以提升多巴胺 令佢愛上佢 
"And the other thing is, that because nobody's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before, and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing, being and knowing, now you have this concept in your mind. ",佢地出發啦，途中佢(女)猛咁尖叫又攬住佢(男) 一路笑住度過咗一段美好嘅時間 
You're all part of the artwork too. ,一個鐘頭後，當佢哋落人力車嘅時候 佢(女)舉高雙手話：「好正呀!」 
(Applause) ,「嗰個車伕眞靚仔！」 
,（眾笑）（鼓掌） 愛嘅魔力! 
"It was a Saturday afternoon in May, and I suddenly realized that the next day was Mother's Day, and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom, so I started thinking about what should I get my mom for Mother's Day? ",不過，去總結，我想講，幾百萬年前，我哋進化咗三個基本驅動器 性慾，浪漫愛情同對長期伴侶嘅依戀 呢啲電路巳深深地嵌入咗人類大腦入面 
"I thought, why don't I make her an interactive Mother's Day card using the Scratch software that I'd been developing with my research group at the MIT Media Lab? ",只要我哋呢樣物種生存落去，佢地都會生存落去 正如莎士比亞所謂嘅「這凡人的盤繞」 
"We developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations, and then share their creations with one another. ",多謝。 （鼓掌） 
"So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch to make an interactive card for my mom. ",
"Before making my own Mother's Day card, I thought I would take a look at the Scratch website. ",好高興可以响呢度 同大家分享我嘅心路歷程 同埋講下呢張輪椅帶畀我嘅自由 
"So over the last several years, kids around the world ages 8 and up, have shared their projects, and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects, whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards. ",十六年前我開始坐輪椅 一場大病令我唔可以 好似以前咁接觸世界 
"So in the search box I typed in ""Mother's Day,"" and I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards that showed up on the Scratch website, many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself. ",當我開始坐輪椅 佢帶畀我全新嘅自由 
So I started taking a look at them. (Music) I saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day. ,我曾經以為 病後傷殘，下半世一定唔好過 
And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom. ,但呢張輪椅就好似一件神奇玩具 
"Another one was an interactive project where, when you moved the mouse over the letters of ""Happy Mom Day,"" it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan. ",令我可以出返去吹風 
"(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative about how she had Googled to find out when Mother's Day was happening. ",而且，可以出到街真係好爽！ 
"(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening, she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting of how much she loved her mom. ",雖然重獲自由，我真係好開心 但街外人對我嘅態度就完全唔同晒 
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects. ,佢哋好似當我透明 就好似我著咗件隱形斗篷咁 
"In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project, I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter) And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would. ",佢哋帶住一份成見嚟睇我 覺得我坐輪椅就一定會係點點點 
"She wrote back to me and she said, ""I'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."" ",當我問「一提起輪椅 你哋會諗起乜嘢？」 佢哋會話「局限」、「恐慌」 「可憐」、「無自由」 
"So my mom was happy, and that made me happy, but actually I was even happier for another reason. ",我發現我都受到呢啲成見影響 亦令我從根本對自己嘅睇法唔同咗 
I was happy because these kids were using Scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would. ,感覺自己有一部份唔再係自己咁 
"As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards, you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies. ",我再唔係由自己嘅觀點出發去審視自己 而係受其他人對我嘅睇法影響 
What do I mean by fluent? ,於是我覺得咁唔掂 我要活出自己嘅故事 我要重新演繹，定義自我 [ （投影片）尋找自我： 喺活出自己嘅故事時， 
I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves and to start expressing their ideas. ,我哋學識認真看待 寫自己生命的一字一句。 —— Davis 2009， TEDx 女性中發表 ] 我開始做一啲作品 旨在向大家傳遞 我坐輪椅嘅嗰份內心喜悅同自由 我叫佢做能量椅 因為可以同個世界摙過 
"When you become fluent with language, it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend. ",我將我內心嘅感受盡量傳遞出嚟 透過破格嘅攝影 去改變當初我開始坐輪椅時 對自己嘅成見 
And it's similar with new technologies. ,張輪椅變咗一件我可以又寫又畫嘅嘢 
"By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards, these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies. ",當我開始為自己留下快樂同自由嘅印記 外界對我嘅作品有反應，令我好雀躍 
"Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this, because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology. ",呢啲作品好似打開咗新嘅視野 引領藝術轉型 
"I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as ""digital natives."" ",藝術創作可以重塑一個人嘅自我觀感 同時改變固有睇法，改變成見 
But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term. ,當我 2005 年開始坐輪椅潛水 我發現水肺潛水裝置同輪椅 都一樣畀到你水底嘅自由 可以話水肺潛水帶畀人嘅印象 係充滿刺激同歷奇 而且同輪椅畀人嘅印象完全唔同 
I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives. ,我心諗：唔知兩件事擺埋一齊會點呢？ （笑聲、掌聲） 最終我哋真係做咗部潛水輪椅 而且响過去七年 佢帶我體驗咗非一般嘅水底旅行 
"When you really look at it, how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies? ",為咗令你哋明白我講嘅經歷 我想同大家分享呢件法寶 帶畀我嘅其中一段體驗 同埋佢帶咗我去嘅世界有幾咁精彩 
"You often see them in situations like this, or like this, and there's no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming. ",（音樂） （掌聲） 呢個係我呢世人至今最精彩嘅體驗 以前種種都無得比 
But that doesn't really make you fluent. ,我基本上可以自由咁郁動 360 度通行無阻 體驗至高無上嘅快樂同自由 
"So young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies, but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies. ",至於令我喜出望外，妙不可言嘅係 其他人似乎都可以感同身受 
It's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies. ,佢哋對眼當堂發晒光 又話：「我都想要要部咁嘅嘢！」 又有話：「如果你連潛水做得到， 我冇嘢唔可以做唔到！」 
"And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies? ",我覺得，因為嗰一刻 佢哋睇緊一件嘢係佢哋前所未見 或者超乎佢哋想像 打破晒佢哋對輪椅嘅觀感 以致令佢哋重新看待輪椅 
"And that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs, or code. ",我同時覺得 潛水輪椅想法出現嘅嗰一刻 將自由嘅呢一份情懷感染到其他人 
"So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code. ",呢件事話畀我哋聽 普通人都睇得到差異嘅價值 同箇中嘅快樂 當我哋唔係著眼於損傷或者局限 而係用新視野、新角度去睇 我哋就會發現力量同喜悅 
"You know, in recent years, there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code. ",輪椅係一部轉化器 
"You look online, you'll see places like Codecademy and events like CoderDojo and sites like Girls Who Code, or Black Girls Code. ",我而家叫呢部潛水輪椅做「變身器」 係因為佢令我踏入全新嘅生命 揭開人生新一頁，對自我有新嘅覺悟 
It seems that everybody is getting into the act. ,因為之前無人見過潛水輪椅係點 所以潛水輪椅面世 象徵著新睇法、新認知 而家呢種睇法都响大家心中紮實 
"You know, just at the beginning of this year, at the turn of the new year, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn to code in 2012. ",所以你哋都係作品嘅一部份喇！ 
"A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that all of its first graders should learn to code. ",（掌聲） 
And that triggered a debate in the U.K. ,
about whether all the children there should learn to code. ,嗰日係五月一個星期六嘅下晝 我突然意識到聽日就係母親節 而我仲未準備禮物俾我媽咪 所以我開始諗 我要送佢乜嘢做母親節禮物呢? 
"Now, for some of you, when you hear about this, it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code. ",我諗點解唔利用我同我嘅研究小組 喺麻省理工媒體實驗室開發嘅軟件 Scratch 嚟做張有互動嘅母親節卡俾佢呢? 
"When many people think of coding, they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub-community of people are going to be doing, and they think of coding looking like this. ",我哋整咗呢個軟件 令人可以輕鬆創作佢哋自己 有互動功能嘅故事、遊戲或者動畫 而且同人分享佢哋嘅創作 
"And in fact, if this is what coding is like, it will only be a narrow sub-community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code. ",於是我諗或者呢個係一個好機會 利用 Scratch 去整一張互動嘅卡俾我媽咪 
But coding doesn't have to be like this. ,喺我做母親節卡之前 我諗我可以先睇睇 Scratch 個網站 
Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch. ,過去幾年，世界各地八歲以上嘅小朋友 分享咗佢哋嘅作品 所以我諗喺呢三百萬件作品裏邊 會唔會有人上載咗母親節卡呢 
"So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together. ",所以我就喺搜尋嗰度打「母親節」 我又驚訝又開心睇到 成頁有好多好多嘅母親節卡 好多卡都係由一啲 好似我噉鍾意拖著做嘅人 喺 24 小時之內上載嘅 
"In this case, you take a move block, snap it into a stack, and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story, in this case controlling the big fish. ",當我開始睇呢啲作品 （音樂） 我睇到一張特寫小貓 同小貓媽咪一齊嘅卡片 卡中嘅小貓祝媽咪母親節快樂 
"After you've created your program, you can click on ""share,"" and then share your project with other people, so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well. ",作者仲非常貼心噉 為佢自己母親整咗一個重播按鈕 
"So, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing you can do with Scratch. ",另一個係互動作品 當你將滑鼠移到 「母親節快樂」嘅字上面時 會出現一句特別嘅母親節嘅祝福句子 
"Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website, there's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork, and, yes, interactive Mother's Day cards. ",(音樂) 而喺呢件作品 創作者講述佢自己 點樣用谷歌搵出母親節係幾時 
"So I think there's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this, to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world. ",(打字聲) 而當佢知道母親節係幾時嗰陣 佢立即送出特別嘅母親節祝福 去表達佢有幾愛佢媽媽 
And it doesn't just stay on the screen. ,我真係好鍾意 睇呢啲作品、同呢啲作品互動 
You can also code to interact with the physical world around you. ,事實上，由於我太鍾意呢啲作品 原本諗著親手整張 但後來就直接將十幾個作品嘅連結 發送俾我媽咪 （笑聲） 而其實，佢嘅反應就係我想要嘅 
"Here's an example from Hong Kong, where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor, so the light sensor detects the hole in the board, so as they move the physical saw, the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree. ",佢回覆我話 「我非常為我嘅仔仔感到驕傲 佢能夠整到噉嘅軟件 令小朋友可以整母親節卡 送俾佢哋嘅媽媽。」 
We're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us. ,所以見到我媽咪好高興，我都好開心 但事實上我仲有一個更開心嘅原因 
"This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we'll be releasing in the next few months, and we're looking again to be able to push you in new directions. ",我開心係因為呢啲小朋友能夠按照 我哋希望見到嘅用法去用 Scratch 
Here's an example. ,當佢哋製作互動母親節卡嘅時候 你可以睇到佢哋真係 愈嚟愈對新科技純熟 
It uses the webcam. ,噉純熟係咩呢? 
"And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug. ",我係指佢哋可以開始表達佢哋自己 開始表達佢哋嘅諗法 
"So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect, where you interact with gestures in the world. ",當你開始對一種語言純熟嘅時候 意味著你可以喺你嘅日記上面寫嘢 或者話講笑話俾人哋聴 或者寫封信俾朋友 
"But instead of just playing someone else's game, you get to create the games, and if you see someone else's game, you can just say ""see inside,"" and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it. ",新科技都係同樣道理 
"So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is, and then, if there's so much video motion, it will then tell the balloon to pop. ",透過書寫或者創作呢啲互動嘅母親節卡 呢啲小朋友會俾人睇到 佢哋對呢啲新科技有幾純熟 
"The same way that this uses the camera to get information into Scratch, you can also use the microphone. ",你或者對呢樣嘢唔覺得驚訝 因為好多時人都會覺得 現今年輕人可以用科技做各式各樣嘅嘢 
Here's an example of a project using the microphone. ,我嘅意思係 我哋都聽過年輕人被稱為「數碼原生代」 
So I'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices. ,某種程度上 我認為呢個用詞係有點問題嘅 
"(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping) (Laughter) (Applause) As kids are creating projects like this, they're learning to code, but even more importantly, they're coding to learn. ",但我就唔太肯定 我哋應唔應該將年輕人視作數碼原生代 
"Because as they learn to code, it enables them to learn many other things, opens up many new opportunities for learning. ",當你真係去睇呢樣嘢 年輕人花大部分時間喺新科技嗰度 究竟係點嘅一回事呢? 
"Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing. ",你經常見到嘅情況會係噉樣 或者噉樣 可以肯定嘅係年輕人對於上網 上網聊天、發短訊同打機 都好自在、好熟 
"When you learn to read and write, it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things. ",但呢啲並唔會真係令你純熟 
"When you learn to read, you can then read to learn. ",今日嘅年輕人對於新科技嘅互動 好有經驗同埋好熟識 但對於利用新科技去創作同表達嘅人 就少得多 
And it's the same thing with coding. ,即係話佢哋識得用新科技去睇嘢 但唔識得用新科技去寫嘢一樣 
"If you learn to code, you can code to learn. ",而我就真係好想知道 點樣能夠令年輕人對科技更純熟 令佢哋能夠用新科技去創作 
Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious. ,即係話佢哋能夠 寫自己嘅電腦程式，或者寫編碼 
You learn more about how computers work. ,於是，有趣地，人就開始認清 學習寫編碼嘅重要性 
But that's just where it starts. ,你知道近幾年有幾百個新機構同新網站 幫助年輕人學習編寫編碼 
"When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn many other things. ",你見到網上有類似 Codeacademy 噉樣嘅地方 有類似 CoderDojo 一樣嘅活動 又有似 Girls Who Code 或者 Black Girls Code 呢一類嘅網站 
Let me show you an example. ,每一個人似乎都開始參與其中 
"Here's another project, and I saw this when I was visiting one of the computer clubhouses. ",你知道嗎，就喺年初 踏入新一年嗰陣 紐約市長彭博為佢自己定下咗新年目標 就係要喺 2012 年學識寫編碼 
These are after-school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low-income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies. ,幾個月後，愛沙尼亞政府決定 全國一年級學生都要學寫編碼 
"And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago, I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one, and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game, but also he wanted to do more. ",呢樣嘢喺英國激發咗一場辯論 
He wanted to keep score. ,係咪要俾全部小朋友學寫編碼 
"So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish, but he wanted to keep score, so that each time the big fish eats the little fish, the score would go up and it would keep track, and he didn't know how to do that. ",宜家，你哋部分人，聽到呢個提議時 或者會覺得有啲奇怪 做乜每個人都要學寫編碼 
So I showed him. ,當大部分人聽到編碼，佢哋會諗起 只有少數人會做嘅嘢 呢個就係佢哋對編碼嘅印象 
"In Scratch, you can create something called a variable. ",事實上，假如程式真係噉嘅樣 只會有好少人 就係嗰啲 有特別嘅數學技能同科技背景嘅人 至會寫編碼 
I'll call it score. ,但寫編碼唔需要噉樣 
"And that creates some new blocks for you, and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score, so each time I click on ""change score,"" it increments the score. ",就等我俾你睇下Scratch 裏邊嘅編碼 係點樣啦 
"So I showed this to the clubhouse member -- let's call him Victor -- and Victor, when he saw that this block would let him increment the score, he knew exactly what to do. ",喺 Scratch 裏面寫編碼 就好似砌積木噉 
He took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish. ,喺呢個情況下 你移動一舊積木 將佢同其他積木堆埋一齊 嗰堆積木就會控制 你嘅遊戲或者故事裏邊唔同角色嘅行為 呢個例子裏面就係要控制一條大魚 
"So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish, he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one. ",當你整咗個程式之後 你可以點選「分享」 然後你就可以將你個程式同其他人分享 人哋就可以用到你嘅程式 而且可以對個程式做修改 
And it's in fact working. ,當然，整一個同魚有關嘅遊戲並唔係 Scratch 唯一可以做嘅嘢 
"And he saw this, and he was so excited, he reached his hand out to me, and he said, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" ",喺 Scratch 網站度幾百萬嘅項目裏面 由動畫故事 到學校科學專題研究 動漫劇集 虛擬建築工具箱 經典電玩遊戲嘅重新製作 民意調查 三角幾何學教學 互動藝術作品都應有盡有 當然仲有互動嘅母親節賀卡 
"And what went through my mind was, how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables? (Laughter) It doesn't happen in most classrooms, but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables, they don't know why they're learning it. ",所以我認為啲人可以透過呢個軟件 用好多唔用嘅方式表達自己嘅心意 仲有記低同埋分享俾全世界知 佢哋嘅諗法 
"It's nothing that, really, they can make use of. ",而且，佢唔止剩係喺電腦螢幕裏面 
"When you learn ideas like this in Scratch, you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you, that you can understand the reason for learning variables, and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better. ",你可以寫一啲 可以同你周圍現實世界互動嘅編碼 
"Victor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools, but he really didn't -- he wasn't paying attention. ",呢裏有一個嚟自香港嘅例子 呢啲小朋友做咗一個遊戲 佢哋整咗一個實體介面裝置 個裝置有一個光感應器 呢個感應器會感應塊板上面嘅窿 當佢哋郁把鋸時 個感應器可以探測到個窿 從而控制螢幕上嘅一把虛擬嘅鋸去鋸樹 
Now he had a reason for learning variables. ,至於我哋，我哋會繼續搵新嘅方式 將現實世界同虛擬世界帶到黎 去連接我哋嘅世界 
"So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn, you're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things. ",呢個係 Scratch 嘅新版本 將會喺幾個月之內發佈 我哋希望再次帶俾你新方向 
"So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this, they're learning important concepts like variables, but that's just the start. ",舉個例 
"As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts, he was also learning about the process of design, how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project like you see here. ",有個程式需要用到網絡攝影機 
"So he was learning many different core principles of design, about how to experiment with new ideas, how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts, how to collaborate with other people on your projects, about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong, how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well. ",當我移動我隻手 我可以戳穿氣球或者郁一條蟲 
Now those are important skills that aren't just relevant for coding. ,呢樣有啲似微軟嘅 Kinect 裝置 你可以用唔同姿勢同裏面嘅世界互動 
They're relevant for all sorts of different activities. ,但除咗玩其他人嘅遊戲 你可以自己寫遊戲 如果你見到人哋嘅遊戲 你只需要講「查看裏邊」 你就可以睇到嗰堆控制遊戲嘅積木 
"Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist? ",呢舊新積木顯示影像動作嘅幅度 如果有大動作 佢就會指示個氣球爆開 
"It's probably not so likely, but regardless of what he does, he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned. ",呢樣嘢用同一方式 利用相機收集資料輸入到 Scratch 你亦可以用咪 
"Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer, that these ideas are useful for everybody. ",呢個係一個利用咪創作嘅例子 
"Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language. ",你哋都可以用你哋嘅聲音控制呢個遊戲 
"When you become fluent with reading and writing, it's not something that you're doing just to become a professional writer. ",(蟋蟀叫聲) (大嗌) (咀嚼聲) (笑聲) (呼叫) (蝙蝠跌落聲) （掌聲） 當小朋友哋喺度創作呢啲項目嘅時候 佢哋係學梗寫編碼 但更重要嘅係 佢哋係從寫編碼中學習 
Very few people become professional writers. ,因為喺學習寫編碼嘅過程中 佢哋學到其他好多嘢 得到好多學習嘅新機會 
But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write. ,同樣地 閱讀同寫作嘅比喻喺呢度可以用到 
"Again, the same thing with coding. ",當你學習閱讀同寫作嘅時候 佢提供你學習其他更多事物嘅機會 
"Most people won't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers, but those skills of thinking creatively, reasoning systematically, working collaboratively -- skills you develop when you code in Scratch -- are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives. ",當你學習閱讀嘅時候 你同時係透過閱讀去學習 
And it's not just about your work life. ,寫編碼都係一樣 
Coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life. ,當你學寫編碼嘅時候 你會學到其他嘢 
Let me end with just one more example. ,有啲你可以學嘅嘢係睇得到嘅 
"So this is an example that came from after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom, she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch. ",譬如你會知道電腦點樣運作 
So she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card. ,但呢樣只係第一樣 
"Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design, and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist. ",當你學寫編碼 佢為你打開學習其他好多嘢嘅大門 
But working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself. ,等我舉個例 
"So as we take a look and we see that Michael Bloomberg is learning to code, all of the children of Estonia learn to code, even my mom has learned to code, don't you think it's about time that you might be thinking about learning to code? ",呢度有另一個項目 我第一次見到佢 係當我參觀一間電腦俱樂部嘅時候 
"If you're interested in giving it a try, I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website. ",呢啲係我哋協助成立嘅課後學習中心 幫助嚟自低收入社群嘅青年 學習點樣利用新科技創意噉表達自己 
"It's scratch.mit.edu, and give a try at coding. ",幾年前當我去其中一個俱樂部時 我見到一個十三歲嘅男仔 用梗我哋嘅 Scratch 軟件 去寫一個類似呢個嘅遊戲 對於自己嘅遊戲 佢非常開心同自豪 但佢想做更加多 
Thanks very much. (Applause) ,佢想個遊戲可以計到分 
,佢個遊戲係玩大魚食細魚 佢希望可以做到計分 令每一次大魚食小魚嘅時候 分數會增加同埋記低落嚟 但佢唔識得整 
Salaam alaikum. ,所以我就話俾佢知點整 
Welcome to Doha. ,喺 Scratch 裏面 你可以建立一樣嘢叫「變量」 
I am in charge of making this country's food secure. ,我會叫佢做「分數」 
"That is my job for the next two years, to design an entire master plan, and then for the next 10 years to implement it -- of course, with so many other people. ",跟著個軟件會幫你建立幾個新積木 並且會建立一個細嘅計分板 記錄分數 當我每次點擊「更新分數」嘅時候 
"But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story, about the story of this country that you're all here in today. ",分數就會增加 於是我話咗呢樣嘢俾呢名俱樂部會員知 就叫佢做域他 當域他見到 呢個積木可以幫佢增加分數時 佢即刻知道點做 
"And of course, most of you have had three meals today, and probably will continue to have after this event. ",佢將個積木擺喺佢嘅程式入面 就擺喺大魚食小魚嗰部分 
"So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s? ",於是，每次當大魚食小魚 佢都可以令到個分數增加 每次增加一分 
"We were about 11,000 people living here. ",個計分仲係正常運作 
"There was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that. ",佢見到噉樣，佢非常之興奮 佢伸隻手過嚟 同我講: 「唔該，唔該，唔該」 
"Most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages, fishing, or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water. ",呢個時候我諗 學校裡面嘅老師有幾多時會 因為教咗學生「變量」呢樣嘢 而有學生唔該佢哋呢? (笑聲) 呢樣好少喺喺課室發生 噉係因為喺大部分嘅課室 當小朋友學習變量嗰陣 佢哋唔知道佢哋學呢樣嘢嘅原因 
None of the glamour that you see today existed. ,佢哋冇應用嘅機會 
No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh. ,當你喺 Scratch 學習類似概念時 你可以透過一種 有意義、可以推動到你嘅方式學習 令你明白學習變量嘅原因 我哋見到小朋友更深入 更好地學習呢樣嘢 
It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities. ,我肯定域他佢喺學校有學過變量 只係因為佢冇上堂冇留心啫 
Resources weren't there to develop them. ,宜家，佢終於有一個學習變量嘅原因 
And you can see that life expectancy was also short. ,所以當你學編碼 並透過編碼去學習 你就係有意義噉去學習 而呢個就係最好嘅學習方法 
Most people died around the age of 50. ,所以當好似域他噉嘅小朋友 整梗佢哋嘅項目嗰陣 佢哋係學梗好似變量呢啲重要嘅概念 但呢個只係第一樣嘢 
So let's move to chapter two: the oil era. ,當域他做梗呢個項目 寫梗啲程式碼嘅時候 佢係學梗設計嘅過程 點樣將一個諗法 變成一個完整、可以運作嘅軟件 就好似你睇到佢噉 
"1939, that's when they discovered oil. ",所以佢喺度學梗好多 唔同嘅、核心嘅設計原理 學點樣測試新諗法 學點樣將複雜諗法拆做細小嘅嘢 點樣同其他人做項目 點樣喺出錯嗰陣，搵出同糾正錯誤 就算當事情唔係咁如意 面對挫折嘅時候 點樣堅持不懈 
"But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War. ",呢啲都係重要嘅技能 唔係剩係同編碼有關 
What did it do? ,佢哋都同所有唔同嘅活動有關 
"It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness. ",冇人知道域他長大之會唔會 成為一個程式員 或者專業計算機科學家? 
"It also made all those people who roamed around the desert -- looking for water, looking for food, trying to take care of their livestock -- urbanize. ",可能唔太可能啦 唔理佢將來會做乜 佢呢啲學返嚟嘅設計技能 仍然都會用得著 
"You might find this strange, but in my family we have different accents. ",不管佢將來係唔係 會成為一個市場推廣經理 工程師，或者社區組織者 呢啲概念對於每一個人嚟講都好有用 
"My mother has an accent that is so different to my father, and we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country. ",再一次 用語言呢個比喻去諗呢件事係有用嘅 
There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak. ,當你可以流暢噉閱讀同寫作時 唔代表你會做一個專業嘅作家 
"Someone says, ""How so? How could this happen?"" ",好少人會成為專業作家 
Because we lived scattered. ,但對所有人嚟講 學習閱讀同寫作係有用嘅 
We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources. ,呢個同寫編碼係同一道理 
"And when the resources came, be it oil, we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration. ",大部分人喺長大之後唔會成為 專業計算機科學家或者程式員 但創意思維、有系統嘅推論、同人合作 呢啲喺 Scratch 寫編碼嗰陣 發展出嚟嘅技能 喺任何職業都可以用到 
People started to get to know each other. ,唔剩止你份工 
And we realized that there are some differences in accents. ,寫編碼可以 令你喺平日生活裏邊 表達你嘅諗法同情感 
So that is the chapter two: the oil era. ,就俾我再講多一個例子嚟到結束 
Let's look at today. ,呢個例子係關於 我將母親節卡發比媽咪之後 佢決定要學習用 Scratch 
This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha. ,於是佢喺我嘅生日嗰時整咗呢個項目 發咗張 Scratch 生日卡俾我 
So what's the population today? ,雖然宜家呢個作品唔會贏到設計獎 而且你可以坐係度好肯定 我 83 歲嘅媽媽 唔係為咗受訓成為專業程式員 
It's 1.7 million people. ,或者計算機科學家 但做呢個項目令到佢 可以連繫著佢關心嘅人 同埋令佢繼續學習新嘢 令佢繼續用佢嘅創意 令佢發展新嘅方式去表達自己 
That is in less than 60 years. ,所以，當我哋留意 我哋可以見到 彭博喺度學梗寫編碼電腦程式 所有愛沙尼亞嘅小朋友都喺度學梗編碼 甚至連我阿媽都喺度學編碼 你唔覺得你係時候學寫編碼嗎? 
The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years. ,如果你有興趣試下 我會鼓勵你上 Scratch 網站 
Lifespan has increased to 78. ,scratch.mit.edu 跟著試下寫編碼 
Water consumption has increased to 430 liters. ,多謝哂 (掌聲) 
And this is amongst the highest worldwide. ,
"From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation. ",願平安與各位同在！ 
I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water. ,歡迎大家蒞臨多哈 
But what is interesting about the story that I've just said? ,我宜家嘅工作係負責卡塔爾嘅食品安全 
The interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water. ,但喺未來兩年 我要幫手規劃一個大項目 同埋喺之後嗰十年執行項目 當然有好多同事兼埋一齊做啦 
Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history. ,但首先，我想同大家 分享一個我自己嘅故仔 呢個故仔發生喺大家身處嘅呢個國家 
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water. ,在座嘅大多數今日都應該食過三餐 或者喺活動之後仲會食 
This is history being made in this region. ,但係，二十世紀四十年代嘅 卡塔爾是乜嘢樣嘅呢？ 
"Not only cities that we're building, but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors. ","大概有 11,000 人口 "
"Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house. ",冇水、冇能源 冇石油、冇汽車…乜都冇 
These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't. ,喺度生活嘅大多數人 一係喺海邊村莊打魚為生 一係周圍遊牧揾水源 
"But of course, with the use of technology. ",宜家大家所見嘅迷人景緻喺當時仲未有 
"So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain. ",多哈、迪拜、阿布扎比、科威特 或者利雅得以前都係好落後 
"Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate. ",之所以落後唔係因為人哋發展唔到城市 
The question is how. ,而係事關資源貧乏 
We have no water whatsoever. ,眾所週知，當時嘅人均壽命短 
"Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination. ",大多數人嘅壽命都係得 50 歲 
Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything. ,隨著時間發展，石油時代蒞臨嘞 
"It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of, probably most of you used it coming to Doha. ",1939 年，當時嘅人首次喺中東發現石油 
"So that is our lake, if you can see it. ",但遺憾嘅係，直到二戰之前 石油仲未得到全面嘅商業開採 
That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water. ,咁，石油到底起到幾大作用？ 
This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination. ,正如各位所見 佢改變咗呢個國家嘅面貌 
So what are the risks? ,佢亦令喺沙漠揾水源同食物嘅 遊牧民族移居到城市 
Do you worry much? ,大家可能會覺得奇︰ 我屋企人嘅口音不盡相同 
"I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts, you will realize, of course I have to worry. ",我嘅母親同我嘅父親嘅口音有好大分別 那怕喺呢個人口 30 萬嘅國家 
"There is growing demand, growing population. ",就已經有五六種唔同口音 
We've turned seven billion only a few months ago. ,有人會問點解？ 
And so that number also demands food. ,査實係事關我哋住得好零散 
And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050. ,畢竟資源唔集中 我哋冇可能咁集中居住 
So a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders. ,但當資源，即係石油，豐富嘅時候 我哋就開始發展先進技術 並因應發展所需，將人集中起嚟 
There's also changing diets. ,住喺唔同地方嘅人開始瞭解對方 
"By elevating to a higher socio-economic level, they also change their diet. ",於是乎發現大家嘅口音好唔相同 
They start eating more meat and so on and so forth. ,以上就係石油時代嘅情況 
"On the other hand, there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors. ",宜家我哋嚟關注今日 
And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen. ,呢個就係今時今日嘅多哈 
"This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know. ",今日嘅人口有幾多？ 
We only have two days of water reserve. ,經已係 170 萬人嘅大城市 
"We import 90 percent of our food, and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land. ",但發展所花嘅時間卻少過 60 年 
"The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc. ",過去五年經濟平均增長 15% 
So we also face risks. ,壽命預期提升至 78 歲 
These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity. ,人均用水量上到去 430 升 
"The question is, is there a solution? ",人均用水量達到世界高水平 
Is there a sustainable solution? ,由水資源極其匱乏 到用水量達到世最高水平 
Indeed there is. ,我唔知係咪因為過往啲人太缺水所致 
This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we've been working on over the past two years. ,之不過呢個故仔最盞鬼係乜嘢呢？ 
Let's start with the water. ,最盞鬼係過去五年係冇水嘅情況下 我哋仍然能夠保持 15% 經濟增長 
So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy. ,呢個簡直係傳奇 係從未喺歷史出現過嘅 
"So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy? ",歷史上，冇水源嘅城市都會被廢棄 
A depletable energy? Fossil fuel? ,但係喺多哈，啲人卻改寫歷史 
Or should we use something else? ,城市唔止係講緊興建咁簡單 更加載住好多人嘅夢想 想成為科學家、醫生 
Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy? ,佢哋都想起靚嘅家園 請建築師設計屋企 
I guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun. ,正因為人嘅堅定同努力 令呢笪不毛之地變成宜居繁榮 
And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need. ,但一切都必須歸功於先進科技 
"And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water. ","巴西嘅年降雨量有 1,782 毫米 "
And that is a lot of water. ,卡塔爾淨係得 74 但同巴西經濟發展率一樣 
"That water will go then to the farmers, and the farmers will be able to water their plants, and they will be able then to supply society with food. ",咁點解我哋可以齋靠 74 毫米嘅 雨量成就今日呢？ 
"But in order to sustain the horizontal line -- because these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver -- we need to also develop the vertical line: system sustenance, high-level education, research and development, industries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets. ",雖然我哋冇水資源 
"But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations. ",但我哋有好龐大嘅海水淨化裝置 
Without it we can't do anything. ,呢個時候能源就係關鍵︰能源改變一切 
So that's what we are planning to do. ,能源就係我哋從地底抽取同消耗嘅石油 査實在大多數人嚟到多哈都係靠佢 
Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation. ,所以，石油就似係我哋嘅湖泊同河流 
"Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around: Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo. ",事關有佢，大家先至有淡水可用 
"We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever as a city, to live in peace. ",講到呢度，海水淡化技術 係對呢個地方最大嘅恩物 
Thank you very much. ,但呢個地方咁樣發展，有咩風險？ 
(Applause) ,你哋有冇擔心過？ 
,我想講嘅係，當我哋放眼全球 你就會發現，擔心並非多餘 
"Organic chemists make molecules, very complicated molecules, by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering. ",人口不斷增長 對資源嘅需求亦都不斷增長 
"And as a chemist, one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is, could we make a really cool universal chemistry set? ",幾個月前，全球人口總數 經已經超過 70 億 
"In essence, could we ""app"" chemistry? ",隨之而嚟嘅就係對食物需求嘅增長 
"Now what would this mean, and how would we do it? ",據預測，到 2050 年 全球人口會突破 90 億 
"Well to start to do this, we took a 3D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware. ",對於一個缺乏水資源嘅國家嚟講 必須要考慮未來人口增長帶嚟嘅負擔 
"And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time, we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry. ",呢一事實甚至改變咗人嘅飲食方式 
Now what could this mean? ,隨著社會經濟水平提高 人嘅飲食習慣亦都隨之改變 
"Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way. ",例如會食更加多肉 
So how are we doing this in the lab? ,另一方面，因為氣候變化同其他原因 農作物產量減少 
"Well it requires software, it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks. ",所以，人不得不面對危機會發生嘅事實 
"And so the really cool bit is, the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer, and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device. ",呢個就係卡塔爾嘅現況 
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software. ,我哋嘅淡水儲備只夠用到兩日 
So what could this mean? ,我哋 90% 嘅食物都依賴進口 我哋亦衹開發咗 1% 嘅國土 
"Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine. ",我哋為數唔多嘅農民 亦都因為市場開放政筞 同引進激烈競爭等原因 而唔再從事農業生產 
And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. ,所以話，危機的確存在 
"But to take baby steps to get there, first of all we want to look at drug design and production, or drug discovery and manufacturing. ",呢啲危機直接影響著呢個國家嘅 可持續發展同延續性 
"Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere. ",咁，有乜解決方案呢？ 
You don't need to go to the chemist anymore. ,有冇解決方案？ 
We can print drugs at point of need. ,答案係有嘅 
We can download new diagnostics. ,呢份投影片總結咗數千頁嘅 技術文件內容 亦都係我哋過去兩年嘅工作成果 
Say a new super bug has emerged. ,我先講水資源 
"You put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat. ",之前我哋經已知道，我哋確實需要能源 
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly. ,如果我哋需要能源，要係咩能源？ 
"But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells, with your genes and your environment, and you print your own personal medicine. ",不可再生資源？化石燃料？ 
"And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough, where do you think we're going to go? ",定係我哋可以用其他能源？ 
"Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator. ",假設我哋使用其他能源 係咪會有更多著數？ 
"Beam me up, Scotty. ",我斷估大多數人都諗到太陽能 
(Applause) ,冇錯，呢度全年晴天日數 高達 300 日，陽光充沛 所以，我哋要利用太陽能製造水 
,於是我哋興建 180 萬千瓦功率嘅 太陽能發電設施 嚟製造 350 萬立方米嘅淡水 
"(Breathes in) (Breathes out) So, I didn't always make my living from music. ",350 萬一啲都唔細數 
"For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university, this was my day job. ",呢啲淡水將會分配畀農民 用嚟灌溉農作物 進而為社會供應糧食 
"(Laughter) I was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride, and I love telling people I did this for a job, because everybody always wants to know, who are these freaks in real life. ",但係，我哋唔單止要做到可持續 我哋仲需要追求發展同進步 包括系統可靠性、高等教育 研究開發、工業、科技 令製造出嚟嘅科技可以 用於應用同市場裏面 
(Laughter) Hello. ,但係要將所有嘢到位 需要有法律、政策同規範 
"I painted myself white one day, stood on a box, put a hat or a can at my feet, and when someone came by and dropped in money, I handed them a flower -- and some intense eye contact. ",冇咗法律、政策同規範 一切都衹係空談 
"And if they didn't take the flower, I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing -- as they walked away. ",呢個亦正係我哋計劃之中嘅工作 
"(Laughter) So I had the most profound encounters with people, especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks, and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street, and we would sort of fall in love a little bit. ",順利嘅話，成個規劃方案 將喺兩年內完成 然之後實施方案 
"And my eyes would say -- ""Thank you. ",我哋嘅目標係建成 一個千年難得一見嘅城市 就好似伊斯坦堡、羅馬、倫敦 巴黎、大馬士革，以及開羅一樣 
"And their eyes would say -- ""Nobody ever sees me. ",我哋城市雖然淨係得 60 年歷史 但我哋希朢佢能夠和平地永遠存在 
I would get harassed sometimes. ,多謝 
People would yell at me from their cars. ,（掌聲） 
"(Laughing) And I'd be, like, ""This is my job."" ",
"But it hurt, because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair, shameful. ",有機化學家 透過將大分子剪成好多細分子 加上逆向工程 製造化學分子，非常複雜嘅分子 
I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box. ,身為一個化學家 其中一件我幾年前 想問我嘅研究團隊嘅問題就係 我哋可唔可以整 一個好型嘅「通用化學機」？ 
"And for the economists out there, you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income, which was shocking to me, given I had no regular customers, but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday. ",簡單嚟講，我哋可唔可以 將化學程式化？ 
It was consistent. ,咁係咩意思呢？我哋可以點做呢？ 
"And meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band, the Dresden Dolls. ",要做呢樣嘢 我哋需要一部三維打印機 跟住開始一邊印我哋嘅燒杯同試管 同時喺另一邊印出分子 然後喺我哋叫反應儀嘅機裡面 將分子擺落去燒杯同試管度 
"This was me on piano, a genius drummer. ",所以藉住同時印出容器同埋做化學合成 我哋人人或者可以接觸得到 化學品同化學用具 
"I wrote the songs, and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue, and as we started touring, I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people, because I loved it. ",咁又代表啲咩呢？ 
"So after all of our shows, we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people, and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us, and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows, and they would pass the hat, and then they would come in and join us onstage, so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests. ",如果我哋可以將生物同化學知識 放上搜尋引擎 如果你想治療一個細胞 或者你希望殺死細菌 你將部機連去呢個搜尋引擎 獲取相關嘅做法，進行化學反應時 你或者已經製造出藥物 
"And then Twitter came along, and made things even more magic, because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere. ",咁我哋點先可以喺實驗室做呢件事？ 
"So I would need a piano to practice on, and an hour later I would be at a fan's house. ",部機需要軟件，亦需要硬件 而且需要一啲化學墨水 
This is in London. ,所以非常酷嘅構想係 我哋想有一個通用嘅墨水匣 可以將佢放落打印機 而你下載製造某個分子嘅有機化學藍圖 然後你按著個藍圖喺部機度製造個分子 
People would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. ,亦即係你可以用呢個軟體 喺打印機度製造你嘅分子 
This is in Seattle. ,咁代表啲咩呢？ 
"Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig. ",最終，部機可以令你 印出專屬你自己嘅藥物 
This is a library in Auckland. ,而呢個亦係我哋喺實驗室做緊嘅嘢 
"On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat, because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast, and they showed up care of this dude, Chris, from Newport Beach, who says hello. ",不過仲有啲基本步要做 首先我哋希望檢視藥物嘅設計同製造 或者藥物嘅發現同生產 
"I once tweeted, ""Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?"" ",因為如果我哋發現某種藥之後可以生產 我哋就可以喺任何地方調配佢 
"And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in, and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death. ",你哋再唔需要因為嗰種藥去搵藥劑師 
"And I love this kind of random closeness, which is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing. ",我哋可以喺需要嘅時候印出藥物 
"In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless, and in punk squats, everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless, clearly making it the better option. ",我哋亦可以下載新嘅診斷資訊 
"(Laughter) My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18-year-old girl, still living at home, and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras. ",例如話有一種新嘅超級細菌出現 
"And that night, her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds. ",你就喺資料庫度搵 然後你就會有咗應對呢隻細菌嘅藥 
"And I lay there thinking, these people have so little. ",因此部機畀你隨時隨地做分子組合 
"And in the morning, her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible, and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English, ""Your music has helped my daughter so much. ",但係可能對我嚟講 未來最核心嘅構想係 用你自己嘅幹細胞、你嘅基因 以及你嘅環境 用佢哋嚟印出屬於你嘅藥物 
"Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful."" ",如果咁樣睇落都唔夠吸引 你想我哋仲能夠做啲咩呢？ 
"And I thought, this is fair. ",或者，你哋會有個人嘅物質轉換器 
This is this. ,就好似 Scotty 角色話「送我上去！」 
"A couple of months later, I was in Manhattan, and I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight, I'm on the Lower East Side, and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone. ",（掌聲） 
I've always been with my band or my crew. ,
Is this what stupid people do? ,（吸氣、吐氣） 我唔係一直都靠音樂維生 
(Laughter) Is this how stupid people die? ,我喺一間傑出文科大學畢業之後 大約有五年時間 我日頭嘅工作係咁（笑聲） 
"And before I can change my mind, the door busts open. ",我曾經係一個扮「八呎新娘」 活雕像嘅自僱人士 我鍾意同人講我做呢份工 因為每個人都想知道 演員現實生活到底係咩 
She's an artist. ,（笑聲）哈囉！ 
"He's a financial blogger for Reuters, and they're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath, and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that. ",我有一日將自己塗白，企喺一個箱度 喺腳邊放一頂帽定一個罐 當有人走近，抌錢落去 我就會遞上一朵花 然後同佢哋有熱切嘅眼神交流 
So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot. ,如果佢哋唔收咗朵花 我就會喺佢哋慢慢走遠嘅時候 露出悲傷同埋渴望嘅表情 
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing. ,（笑聲） 可以話，我同人有著最深層嘅接觸 尤其同嗰啲睇起嚟 好似幾個星期都冇同過人傾偈嘅人 我同人喺城市街道上面 有著漫長而美妙嘅眼神交流 我哋感覺好似有啲鍾意對方 
You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other. ,我嘅眼睛會話︰ 「多謝，我睇到你嘞。」 
"I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get some extra money, something that I did a lot. ",而佢哋嘅眼睛就會話︰ 「從來冇人睇到我，多謝你。」 
"And as usual, the band was psyched, but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there. ",有時候我會被騷擾 
It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat. ,有啲司機會對我大喊話「搵工啦！」 
"And I recognized his fear of ""Is this fair?"" ",（笑聲） 我嘅反應係︰「呢份就係我嘅工。」 
"And meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger. ",但係呢件事令我好傷心 我反問自己我做嘅嘢 係咪唔似職業 唔正當、唔光采 
We sign with a major label. ,我之前唔知道 企喺呢個盒上面用音樂搵食 可以有咁深刻嘅教育意義 
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret. ,經濟學家，你哋可能有興趣知道 點解我嘅收入係可以預計 我知道嗰陣，我自己都嚇咗一跳 因為我冇固定嘅客人 但我通常星期二賺 60 美金 星期五賺 90 美金 
It's not for everybody. ,每個禮拜都係咁 
"Well, maybe it's for you. ",而且，我同我嘅樂團 Dresden Dolls 會喺本地巡迴演出 同埋喺夜總會表演 
"(Laughter) We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record. ",呢張相影我喺度彈鋼琴，我係天才鼓手 
"And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks, and the label considers this a failure. ",我寫歌 最後我哋嘅收入 足夠我唔再需要做活雕像 而當我哋開始巡迴演出 我唔想失去呢種 同人直接眼神交流嘅感覺 因為我愛上呢種感覺 
"I was like, ""25,000, isn't that a lot?"" ",所以喺每一場表演結束之後 我哋都會幫歌迷簽名 同佢哋擁抱，同佢哋交流 我哋求人加入我哋、幫我哋手 我仲會搵嚟本地音樂家同藝術家 喺我哋表演場地出面表演 同埋幫手籌錢 亦都會請佢哋 同我哋同臺演出 所以我哋有唔同嘉賓上臺 
"They said, ""No, the sales are going down. ",後嚟，Twitter 嘅出現 令事情變得更加神奇 我可以喺任何地方提出任何要求 
And they walk off. ,譬如話，我需要一部鋼琴練習 一個小時後 我就喺歌迷屋企彈琴 
"Right at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig, and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $10 bill, and he says, ""I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend."" ",呢度係倫敦 
"(Laughter) ""But I read your blog, I know you hate your label. ",世界各地都有人將自己做嘅食物 送到我哋後臺 同我哋一齊食 
"I just want you to have this money."" ",呢度係西雅圖 
And this starts happening all the time. ,如果我臨時決定搞 一場即興嘅免費演唱會 咁喺博物館、商店 或者公共場所返工嘅歌迷 都會向我哋揮手 
"I become the hat after my own gigs, but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people, and unlike the guy in the opening band, I've actually had a lot of practice standing there. ",呢度係奧克蘭一個圖書館 
Thank you. ,星期六我推文 希望有人能夠提供木板箱同帽 因為我唔想將物品 由東岸帶到嚟呢度 最終嚟自 Newport Beach 嘅 Chris 回覆咗我 為我提供咗呢兩樣道具 
"And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible, so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad; Amanda Palmer over here, and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing, but I'm going to ask for help, because I saw it work on the street. ",我曾經推文問墨爾本邊度有得買洗鼻壺 
"So I fought my way off my label, and for my next project with my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra, I turned to crowdfunding. ",一位喺醫院工作嘅護士揸車 直接將佢送到我坐緊嘅咖啡店 於是我請佢飲冰沙 我哋傾到護士同埋死亡 
"And I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made, and I asked my crowd to catch me. ",我就係鍾意呢種親近人嘅感覺 而且好好彩 因為我成日有得喺人哋屋企過夜 我先至可以親近人 
"And the goal was 100,000 dollars. ",喺大屋裡面，我哋每一位成員 都有自己房間，但係冇無線網絡 喺龐克迷佔據嘅廢棄房屋裡面 所有人瞓喺一間房嘅地板上 冇廁所，但係有無線網絡 明顯後者係更好選擇 
"My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million, which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date. ",（笑聲） 我嘅工作人員曾經揸我哋嘅廂型車 去邁阿密一個非常窮嘅社區 然後我哋發現 嗰個借我哋瞓一晚嘅主人 係一個18歲、仲住喺屋企嘅女仔 佢哋成家都係洪都拉斯嘅非法移民 
(Applause) And you can see how many people it is. ,嗰晚，佢全家都瞓梳化 佢同佢媽媽一齊瞓，好讓我哋可以瞓床 
"It's about 25,000 people. ",我瞓喺嗰度諗 呢啲人擁有嘅嘢咁少，公平嗎？ 
"And the media asked, ""Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy. ",第二朝，佢媽媽教我哋整墨西哥薄餅 佢仲想送本聖經畀我 然後佢將我帶到一邊 用唔咸唔淡嘅英文同我講： 「你嘅音樂幫咗我個女好多， 
"How did you make all these people pay for music?"" ",多謝你留宿呢度，我哋好感激。」 
"And the real answer is, I didn't make them. ",然後我諗，咁樣就公平啦 
"And through the very act of asking people, I'd connected with them, and when you connect with them, people want to help you. ",就係咁 
It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists. ,幾個月之後，我去咗曼哈頓 我推文希望搵一個過夜嘅地方 午夜時，我嚟到下東城區 然後我突然意識到 我從未試過一個人借宿過 
They don't want to ask for things. ,我一直都係同我嘅樂隊一齊 
But it's not easy. ,係唔係傻瓜至自己一個留宿？（笑聲） 
And a lot of artists have a problem with this. ,傻瓜係唔係咁樣死？ 
Asking makes you vulnerable. ,等我仲未嚟得切改變主意，門就打開咗 
"And I got a lot of criticism online, after my Kickstarter went big, for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices, specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer, and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website. ",個女人係一位藝術家 
"And people saying, ""You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help,"" really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, ""Get a job."" ",個男人係路透社財經博客嘅作家 佢哋幫我倒紅酒，畀我沖涼 我有過成千上萬個類似經歷嘅夜晚 
"Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk, and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd, an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them. ",我成日喺人哋屋企梳化過夜 亦都成日人群衝浪 
So this is slightly not safe for work. ,我認為喺人哋屋企過夜同人群衝浪 其實係同一件事 
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin. ,因為你都係將你成個人 交託畀觀眾，信任佢哋 
"At the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me. ",我曾經問一個為我哋開場嘅樂隊 願唔願意走到群眾當中 傳頂帽畀人去籌錢 畢竟我自己經常咁樣做 
"Now let me tell you, if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers -- (Laughter) I recommend this, especially if those strangers are drunk German people. ",同往常一樣，樂團已經準備好 但係其中一位成員話畀我聽 佢冇辦法說服自己咁做 
"(Laughter) This was a ninja master-level fan connection, because what I was really saying here was, I trust you this much. ",佢覺得攞著頂帽企喺嗰度 感覺實在太似行乞嘞 
Should I? ,我意識到佢有「公平嗎？」 同「快去搵工作！」嗰類嘅恐懼 
"For most of human history, musicians, artists, they've been part of the community. ",與此同時，我嘅樂隊越嚟越受歡迎 
"Connectors and openers, not untouchable stars. ",我哋同一間大型唱片公司簽約 
"Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance, but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back. ",我哋嘅風格兼具龐克同卡巴萊 
It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough. ,但唔係所有人都會鍾意 
So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price. ,唔係，或者你哋會鍾意（笑聲） 
"They see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done, the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell, I don't see these things as risk. ",我哋簽咗約 然後有一大堆新唱片宣傳活動 
I see them as trust. ,開賣後嘅幾個星期，賣咗二萬五千張 但唱片公司認為係失敗 
"Now, the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street, they're getting there. ",我嘅反應係︰二萬五千張唔係好多咩？ 
"But the perfect tools aren't going to help us if we can't face each other and give and receive fearlessly, but, more important -- to ask without shame. ",佢哋嘅反應係︰唔係 銷售量下跌，所以係失敗 
My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box. ,之後佢哋走咗 
"So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes, and we see each other. ",但當時即興表演至係完咗 我同歌迷簽名、擁抱 一個男仔走埋嚟 遞張十蚊美金嘅鈔票畀我 佢話：「好對唔住， 我由朋友嗰度複製咗你張碟。」 
"And I think when we really see each other, we want to help each other. ",（笑聲） 「但係我睇過你嘅部落格， 我知道你憎你嘅唱片公司， 
"I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question, which is, ""How do we make people pay for music?"" ",我只係希望你攞返呢啲錢。」 
"What if we started asking, ""How do we let people pay for music?"" ",呢類事情開始不斷發生 
Thank you. ,每場表演之後，我變成嗰頂籌款嘅帽 只係我必須企喺嗰度，接受人哋嘅幫助 相反唔似開場樂隊咁 我練喺度收錢過好多次 
(Applause) ,講「多謝、多謝」 
,喺嗰個時候，我決定 將我網上嘅音樂轉做免費 就好似，Metallica 喺呢邊 Napster 呢邊 Amanda Palmer 喺呢邊 我雖然鼓勵 點對點檔案分享、下載、分享 但我都想人幫我 因為我喺街上見到求人呢種方法行得通 
The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us. ,所以我用自己嘅方法擊退咗唱片公司 同埋為咗我同我嘅新樂團 Grand Theft Orchestra 嘅下個計劃 我至走去群眾募資 
"This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality, and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology, and that's very understandable. ",所以我嗰陣只能夠 靠我聯絡過嘅幾千個支持者 我當時希望支持者可以支持我 
"Now, this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population, rising towards 10 billion people, land that is turning to desert, and, of course, climate change. ",開頭我個目標係十萬美金 
Now there's no question about it at all: we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology. ,但我嘅歌迷最終以 接近一百二十萬嘅金額支持我 呢個係目前為止 最大嘅音樂群眾募資計劃 
"But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas -- are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change. ",（掌聲） 你可以睇到有幾多人支持 
"Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert, and this happens only when we create too much bare ground. ",即係大約兩萬五千人 
There's no other cause. ,然後傳媒問我：「Amanda， 音樂產業落入谷底 ，而你鼓勵盜版， 
And I intend to focus on most of the world's land that is turning to desert. ,咁你點令到啲人畀錢買音樂？」 
But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine. ,答案係，我冇做乜嘢，我只係求佢哋 
We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year. ,透過求人哋呢個動作 我同佢哋建立關係 當你同佢哋有關係時，人哋就會想幫你 
"On those, it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground. ",呢樣對於好多藝術家嚟講係違反常理嘅 
"No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly. ",佢哋唔想求人 
"And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness, and that is where desertification is occurring. ",不過，提出要求都唔容易 
"Fortunately, with space technology now, we can look at it from space, and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well. ",好多藝術家都面對呢個問題 
"Generally, what you see in green is not desertifying, and what you see in brown is, and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth. ",「求人」令你變得脆弱 
"About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying. ",當我嘅眾籌計劃好受歡迎嘅時候 我喺網上收到好多批評 話我唔應該繼續搞眾籌 尤其唔應該問音樂人 上唔上台同我哋一齊唱歌 用幾首歌嚟換取樂迷嘅愛心 演唱會嘅門票同酒精飲品 呢張網上圖片抵毀我，亦都傷害咗我 
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling. ,人哋話：「你唔可以再求咁樣嘅幫忙」 而呢句嘢令我諗返 司機對著我大叫「去搵工啦！」 
"Think of it in terms of drums of water, each containing 200 liters. ",因為佢哋冇同我哋坐埋同一條船 佢哋睇唔到我同群眾點樣互惠互利 呢種互惠互利 對我哋嚟講好公平 但對佢哋嚟講就好奇怪 
"Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day. ",所以眾籌唔係一帆風順 
"The next day, the land looked like this. ",呢個係我一班眾籌贊助者 喺柏林開嘅派對 
Where had that water gone? ,派對結束嗰陣 我除衫畀人哋喺我身上畫畫 
"Some of it ran off as flooding, but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again, exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered. ",我話你知，如果你想領會 信陌生人係點嘅感覺 我推薦呢個活動 尤其當陌生人都係飲醉咗嘅德國人 
"Now, because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter, when we damage soils, you give off carbon. ",（笑聲） 呢個係忍者大師級嘅歌迷交流 因為我真正想講嘅係 我好信任你哋 
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. ,我應該咁樣做？話畀我聽呀 
"Now you're told over and over, repeatedly, that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi-arid areas of the world, and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence. ",人類歷史上嘅大部分時間 音樂人、藝術家都係社群嘅一部分 
"But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them, you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae, leading to increased runoff and evaporation. ",佢哋扮演著連繫同開拓者角色 而唔係無法觸及嘅明星 
That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form. ,以前，成為名人意味著 有啲人隔著好遠鍾意你 但宜家，網絡同網路上面嘅內容 拉返近明星同樂迷嘅距離 
"Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock, mostly cattle, sheep and goats, overgrazing the plants, leaving the soil bare and giving off methane. ",宜家係講緊細細班人 可以近距離見到心愛嘅明星 細細班人已經可以養活到你 
"Almost everybody knows this, from nobel laureates to golf caddies, or was taught it, as I was. ",所以好多人唔理解冇標準定價係咩回事 
"Now, the environments like you see here, dusty environments in Africa where I grew up, and I loved wildlife, and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing. ",佢哋認為冇標準定價 會帶嚟無法預料嘅風險 但我做嘅嘢 包括眾籌、街頭募款、㩒陌生人門鐘 都唔係風險 
And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs. ,我視呢啲嘢為一種對人嘅信任 
"Well, I have news for you. ",宜家，網路工具 令呢種歌手同樂迷之間嘅交易 同喺街頭求助一樣直接、簡單 而且呢種轉變就快成為潮流 
We were once just as certain that the world was flat. ,但如果我哋無辦法見到人 而係怕付出、接收、同求人 咁呢個完美嘅工具就幫唔到我哋 
"We were wrong then, and we are wrong again. ",喺我嘅音樂生涯裏邊 我一直嘗試用我企喺箱 同人交流嘅方法同人喺網上交流 
And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery. ,所以部落格同推文 唔單止講到我嘅巡迴演出日期 同我新嘅音樂錄影 仲有講到我哋嘅作品、我哋嘅藝術 我哋嘅恐懼、醉酒同過失 咁樣我哋就能夠明白對方 
"When I was a young man, a young biologist in Africa, I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks. ",當我哋真正了解大家 我哋就會想幫人 
"Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s — and no sooner did we remove the hunting, drum-beating people to protect the animals, than the land began to deteriorate, as you see in this park that we formed. ",我認為人哋一直問咗一個錯嘅問題︰ 「我哋點樣令人哋畀錢買音樂？」 
"Now, no livestock were involved, but suspecting that we had too many elephants now, I did the research and I proved we had too many, and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain. ",點解唔一開始問： 「我哋點樣令人自發買音樂？」 
"Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make, and it was political dynamite, frankly. ",多謝 
So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research. ,（掌聲） 
"They did. They agreed with me, and over the following years, we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage. ",
"And it got worse, not better. ",最大、最勁抽嘅海嘯風暴 就快將我哋打低 
"Loving elephants as I do, that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life, and I will carry that to my grave. ",依場咁堅嘅完美風暴 將現實變得越嚟越難搞 我哋面對依個現實嘅時候 我哋要相信我哋可以 用技術去解決依啲問題 依樣嘢大家都可以明白嘅 
One good thing did come out of it. ,我哋依家面對緊嘅完美風暴 就係由人口增長引致嘅 人口向 100 億增長嘅同時 土地變成荒漠 氣候變化更不在話下 
It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions. ,而我哋可以解決嘅問題就只有 點樣用科技去取代石化燃料 
"When I came to the United States, I got a shock, to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa. ",石化燃料、碳、煤同埋天然氣 並唔係唯一導致氣候變化嘅嘢 
And there'd been no livestock on this land for over 70 years. ,荒漠化表面上係一嗰好鬼靚嘅詞語 用嚟形容土地逐漸變成荒漠 佢嘅發生係因為我哋製造太多荒地 
And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural. ,無其他原因 
"So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification, but I found the opposite, as we see on this research station, where this grassland that was green in 1961, by 2002 had changed to that situation. ",我將重點放喺世界上 大部份變緊做沙漠嘅土地 
"And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to ""unknown processes."" ",但係我要畀你哋一個好簡單嘅信息 當中畀到你嘅希望比你哋所想像嘅仲多 
"Clearly, we have never understood what is causing desertification, which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally. ",有啲環境全年嘅濕度都有保證 
We have never understood it. ,依啲地方幾乎無可能 有大面積嘅荒地形成 
"Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here, and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter, plant litter. ",因為無論你點做，植物又會好快生長返 
You have changed the microclimate. ,又有啲環境幾個月會有雨水 然之後會有幾個月乾旱 荒漠化就響依度發生 
"Now, by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world's land, you are changing macroclimate. ",好彩，依家通過太空技術 我哋可以從太空睇到依啲地方 仲可以睇到佢哋嘅比例 
"But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago? ",總之呢，綠色嘅地方係唔會荒漠化嘅 而啡色嘅地方就會荒漠化 而啡色依啲係目前地球地表最大嘅部分 
Why has it accelerated lately? ,我估計地球上 有三分二嘅地方正荒漠化緊 
We had no understanding of that. ,依幅相係我響提哈馬沙漠拍嘅 落緊 25 毫米、一吋嘅雨 
"What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world, the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals, and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators. ",你哋可以將佢諗成係裝響桶裡面嘅水 每桶有 200 升 
"Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds, and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals. ",每日會有一千桶水落響每公頃嘅土地 
"Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food, and they have to keep moving, and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants, while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil, as we see where a herd has passed. ",到咗第二日，土地就會好似咁樣 
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland. ,咁啲水去咗邊度呢？ 
"It has just come through four months of rain, and it's now going into eight months of dry season. ",有一啲流失咗 不過大多數會滲入泥土，跟住又蒸發咗 同花園土壤無遮掩嘅下場一樣 
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season. ,因為水同碳嘅命運 同土壤裏面嘅有機物質有關 如果我哋破壞土壤，碳元素就會釋出 
"Now, all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season, and if it doesn't, the grassland and the soil begin to die. ",碳元素就會返到大氣層 
"Now, if it does not decay biologically, it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process, and this smothers and kills grasses, leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil, releasing carbon. ",我已經講咗好多次 荒漠化只會出現響 地球上乾旱同半乾旱嘅地方 所以好似依個咁嘅高原唔會有事 
"To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire. ",不過當你唔只睇個草原 睇下土壤嘅表面 你會發現草原裡面大部份嘅土壤 除咗光禿禿之外，就只有一層藻類遮住 亦都係咁加快咗水份流失同蒸發 
"But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon, and worse than that, burning one hectare of grassland gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants than 6,000 cars. ",而依樣就係荒漠化嘅致命成因 但我哋成日到咗荒漠化後期 先會發現得到 
"And we are burning in Africa, every single year, more than one billion hectares of grasslands, and almost nobody is talking about it. ",依家我哋知道荒漠化係由家畜導致嘅 大多數係由於牛、綿羊同山羊 過度放牧而食晒啲植物 令土壤外露同釋放甲烷而導致 
"We justify the burning, as scientists, because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow. ",呢樣嘢幾乎係人都知道 由諾貝爾獎得主到高爾夫球球僮 都同我一樣知道呢個常識 
"Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry, what could we do to keep that healthy? ",你哋響度睇到嘅環境 塵土飛揚嘅非洲，就係我成長嘅地方 我鐘意野生動物 我細個已經討厭畜牧 因為畜牧破壞生態 
"And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now. ",我喺大學修讀生態學加強咗我嘅信念 
Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change. ,依家，我有好消息畀你哋 
We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change. ,我哋曾經相信世界係平坦嘅 
What are we going to do? ,以前我哋錯咗，依家又錯多次 
"There is only one option, I'll repeat to you, only one option left to climatologists and scientists, and that is to do the unthinkable, and to use livestock, bunched and moving, as a proxy for former herds and predators, and mimic nature. ",我想請你哋加入我再教育同探索之旅 
There is no other alternative left to mankind. ,我後生嗰陣時係非洲年輕嘅生物學家 我曾經參與將一啲壯麗嘅地方 規劃成未來嘅國家公園 
"So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground. ",冇幾耐之後，大概響 1950 年代 我哋禁止咗打獵 反而鼓動大家保護動物 跟住土地開始惡化 就好似依個我哋建立嘅公園咁 
"We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature, and we've done so, and look at that. ",依家嗰度搵唔到牲畜 於是我哋懷疑嗰度大象嘅數目太多 經我調查，佢哋數量確實太多 我建議將佢哋嘅數量減少 下降到土地能承受嘅水平 
"All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung, urine and litter or mulch, as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand, and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain, to store carbon, and to break down methane. ",對我嚟講依個係好可怕嘅決定 老實講仲係一個政治炸彈 
"And we did that, without using fire to damage the soil, and the plants are free to grow. ",所以我哋嘅政府組織咗 一個專家團隊嚟評估我嘅研究 
"When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification, I was faced with a real dilemma. ",佢哋評估之後都同意我嘅觀點 之後嘅幾年 我哋射殺四萬隻大象嚟停止土地惡化 
How were we to do it? ,只不過情況冇好到，反而轉差 
"We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals, but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world. ",我好鐘意大象 但射殺大象係我人生中 最悲傷同做得最錯嘅事 我會一生悔恨至死 
"Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science, and that had accelerated desertification, as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States, and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government. ",但咁樣帶出咗一件事 
"Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals, and humans, over thousands of years, had never been able to deal with nature's complexity. ",呢件事令我下定決心 全情投入去搵出解決方案 
But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this. ,當我去到美國時，我好震驚 我見到國家公園荒漠化嘅程度 同非洲一樣咁大 
"So rather than reinvent the wheel, I began studying other professions to see if anybody had. ",依塊土地已經超過 70 年無家畜存在 
"And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need, and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing, a planning process, and that does address all of nature's complexity and our social, environmental, economic complexity. ",而且我發現美國嘅科學家 除咗話依個係自然現象之外 就無其他解釋 
"Today, we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds, plan their grazing to mimic nature, and where we have them hold their animals overnight -- we run them in a predator-friendly manner, because we have a lot of lands, and so on -- and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields, we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well. ",所以我用盡心機去搵針對美國西部 因牛隻遷移而令荒漠化停止嘅證明 但係我卻搵到完全相反嘅證明 就好似我哋響依個研究站見到嘅咁 當年 1961 年仲係一大片青草地 但係到 2002 年已經變成咁樣 
Let's look at some results. ,我從一份關於氣候改變嘅報告 揾到依啲相 個作者話依個係解釋唔到嘅現象 
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe. ,但好明顯係我哋唔知道乜嘢導致荒漠化 但就係依樣嘢毀滅咗好多文明 而且威脅緊全球 
"It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season. ",我哋根本對依樣嘢唔了解 
"But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it, has evaporated from the soil surface. ",將一平方米嘅土壤就咁光禿禿咁擺響度 相比起用枯枝落葉去覆蓋佢 我保證你會發現光禿禿咁嘅泥土 日出時份會更加凍 到中午時份就會更加熱 
"Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended, and we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid. ",因為你哋改變咗微觀氣候 
"Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day, with the same rainfall, and look at that. ",而家，當你哋繼續增加荒地比率 去到超過世界一半嘅土地 咁你哋就係改變緊全球大氣候 
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean. ,但係我哋仍然唔明白 點解依個現象會響一萬年前發生 
"The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife, everything is now more productive, and we have virtually no fear of dry years. ",同埋點解依家會加劇惡化呢 
"And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats 400 percent, planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo, giraffe and other animals that we have. ",我哋真係乜都唔知企咗響度 
"But before we began, our land looked like that. ",我哋完全無了解到 依啲隨季節改變濕度嘅環境 佢哋嘅土壤同植物發展 同過度放牧有關 而依啲被放牧嘅牲畜 同群體狩獵嘅掠食動物有關 
This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years regardless of what rain we got. ,要對抗群體狩獵掠食動物嘅主要方法 就係集合成群 群體愈大，個體就愈安全 
Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature. ,依家大群動物因為 響佢哋嘅食物上面排便排尿 於是佢哋需要遷徙 就係咁樣遷徙 避免咗因過度放牧、動物食曬啲植物 有秩序嘅週期遷徙 可以確保土壤有足夠植被 就好似見到依群動物走過嘅地方一樣 
"This was another site where it had been bare and eroding, and at the base of the marked small tree, we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay? ",依幅係典型嘅季節性草原嘅相 
"And again, watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature. ",嗰度啱啱落咗四個月雨 亦都開始為期八個月嘅旱季 
"And there are fallen trees in there now, because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc. ",留意下佢經歷長期旱季嘅轉變 
"This land in Mexico was in terrible condition, and I've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound. ",依家你見到所有地上曝露喺空氣嘅草 都需要響下個生長周期前自然腐爛 如果唔係，成塊草地同土壤都會死 
"(Applause) I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland, and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future. ",如果佢哋無腐爛，佢哋就會慢慢氧化 最終啲草會窒息同死亡 亦剩返木本植物先生存到 土地就會無遮掩，釋出碳元素 
"And look at the amazing change in this one, where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature, and once more, we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying. ",為咗阻止發生依個情況 我哋傳統上會用火燒 
The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here. ,不過火都會令到土地無遮掩 亦會釋放出碳元素 更差嘅係 只要燒走一公頃嘅草地 就會釋放出比六千架車更加多嘅污染物 
"The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher, and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers. ",我哋每年都響非洲燒走 超過十億公頃嘅草地 但幾乎無人關心依件事 
"They put 25,000 sheep in one flock, really mimicking nature now with planned grazing, and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year. ",作為科學家，我哋認為用火燒係啱 因為咁樣可以消除啲廢物 畀啲植物生長 
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture. ,睇下我哋依片枯乾嘅草地 我哋點樣做先可以令佢健康呢？ 
Ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals. ,提一提，我係講緊世上大部份嘅土地 
"I remind you that I am talking about most of the world's land here that controls our fate, including the most violent region of the world, where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent of the land. ",我哋唔可以一邊減低動物嘅數量 去畀啲植物復原 一邊唔造成沙漠化同氣候變遷 
"What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as, I believe, fossil fuels, and maybe more than fossil fuels. ",我哋無辦法燒走啲植物 而又確保唔會發生荒漠化同氣候變化 
"But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty, violence, social breakdown and war, and as I am talking to you, millions of men, women and children are suffering and dying. ",咁點算？ 
"And if this continues, we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing, even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels. ",只有一個選擇 我再講多一次，只有一個選擇 氣象學家同科學家只可以做一樣嘢 就係做你估唔到嘅嘢 就係養一大群牲畜兼且要四圍走 當佢哋係以前啲遊牧同捕食動物 做到好似大自然咁 
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this. ,講多無謂，行動最實際 
"We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents, and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that, for illustrative purposes, if we do what I am showing you here, we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years, and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands that I've shown you, we can take us back to pre-industrial levels, while feeding people. ",所以我哋先用一小塊草地嚟做試驗 
"I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet, for your children, and their children, and all of humanity. ",我哋模仿大自然運作 養咗小牛去測試土地負荷 我哋依家做到啦，你睇下 
Thank you. ,全部土地都生曬草 因為泥土上有糞、尿 枯枝落葉同埋護根 在座各位有種開嘢嘅都明白 咁樣嘅泥土已經可以吸收同保留雨水 可以儲存碳又可以分解甲烷 
"(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you, Chris. ",我哋就咁樣做咗 唔駛用火去破壞土壤 啲植物都可以自由生長 
"Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have, and I'm sure everyone here has, A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you. ",到我第一次認識到 身為科學家嘅我哋無得揀 剩係可以用啲臭牲畜 嚟應對氣候變化同荒漠化時 我真係進退兩難 
I'm just going to ask you one quick question. ,我諗︰人類究竟搞緊乜嘢呢？ 
"When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals, it's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work? ",我哋累積咗一萬年放牧嘅經驗 知道點去放牧 但亦都係呢個原因造成 世界上最大嘅人造沙漠出現 
How do you start? ,現代降雨科學已經有一百年 但係之後我哋首先響非洲發現 然後再響美國證實沙漠化反而加快咗 就好似依幅相咁樣 塊地係由聯邦政府管理嘅 
"Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time, and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation, where it's 100 percent bare. ",好明顯咁我們需要 比集結同埋放牧做得更多 我哋人類，幾千年以來 從來都無能力解決大自然嘅複雜問題 
"But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe, where I offered a £5 note in a hundred-mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred-mile drive, and on that, we trebled the stocking rate, the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding, just by the movement, mimicking nature, and using a sigmoid curve, that principle. ",但係我哋生物學家同生態學家 都無遇到咁複雜嘅問題 
"It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that. ",所以與其閉門造車 我開始睇下其他領域有無人已經有答案 
"CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea. ",我發現咗的一啲規劃方法 可以滿足到我哋響生物學上嘅需求 由嗰度開始，我發展咗一套叫做 「整體管理同規劃放牧法」嘅規劃流程 咁樣就解決到大自然、社會、環境 同埋經濟嘅複雜難題 
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful. ,依家好似依位後生女響非洲教人 點樣將啲動物集合 然後模仿大自然環境咁放牧 同埋喺邊度安排地方畀動物過夜 亦都因為我哋有好多地 我哋可以任由佢哋俾猛獸弱肉強食 至於佢哋響邊度放牧同過夜 係同安排地方種嘢有關 我哋嘅收成因為放牧同過夜 而大幅增加 
"CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk, and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way. ",我哋嚟睇下個結果 
"Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. ",依塊係近住我哋喺聿巴布韋嘅土地 
(Applause) ,嗰度啱啱勁落咗四個月雨 就快要到漫長嘅旱季 
,不過你哋見到，幾乎全部雨水 都響土壤表面蒸發咗 
I live in South Central. ,雨停咗，河又乾 而我哋有十五萬人要長期依賴糧食援助 
"This is South Central: liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. ",依家嚟睇一睇同一日隔籬嗰塊地 同樣嘅降雨量，睇下 
"So the city planners, they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else, so they change it to South Los Angeles, like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. ",我哋啲河水又多又乾淨 
"This is South Los Angeles. (Laughter) Liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. ",草、灌木、樹、野生動植物嘅產量 每樣嘅產量都比以前更加好 我哋唔需要怕旱年 
"Just like 26.5 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, South Central Los Angeles, home of the drive-thru and the drive-by. ",我哋點做到？ 我哋增加咗三倍牛羊嘅數目 有計劃咁去放牧去模仿大自然嘅運作 仲令佢哋同大象、水牛、長頸鹿 同其他動物一齊生活 
"Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. ",不過響計畫之前，依塊地係咁樣嘅 
People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. ,就算落幾多雨，依塊光禿禿嘅地 始終被侵蝕超過 30 年 
"For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills, which is probably eight, 10 miles away. ",睇下喺我哋用家畜模仿大自然環境之後 依棵被標記嘅樹有乜變化 
I got tired of seeing this happening. ,依度係另外一個 土地被侵蝕、貧瘠嘅地方 喺依棵做咗標記嘅細樹底下 流走咗 30 厘米嘅土壤，見到嗎？ 
"And I was wondering, how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food, if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood? ",我哋再睇多次個轉變 只係用家畜去模仿大自然 
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars. ,依家已經有啲樹冧咗落嚟 咁係因為改善咗嘅土地 吸引大象等等嘅動物走過去 
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. ,依塊響墨西哥嘅地以前係太爛 我要標記座山，因為變化實在太大喇 
"And I figured, this has to stop. ",（掌聲） 我響 1970 年代開始 幫助南非卡魯沙漠一個家庭 你哋見到右手邊嘅沙漠變返做草原 好慶幸，佢哋啲孫仍然住響塊地 仲睇好前景 
So I figured that the problem is the solution. ,嚟睇下依個驚人嘅改變︰ 成個峽谷都搞返好啦 無用其他方法，只係用家畜扮野生動物 再一次，我哋見到 一個家庭嘅第三代仲住響嗰度 
Food is the problem and food is the solution. ,巴塔哥尼亞上廣闊嘅草原 就係你見到咁變緊沙漠 
Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. ,響中間嗰位係阿根廷研究員 佢記錄咗依塊地 點樣因為人減少羊嘅數目而變差 
"So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house. ",依家佢哋將二萬五千隻羊集埋一群 好認真咁模仿大自然咁有計劃地放牧 塊地第一年嘅產量增加咗 50% 
It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. ,依家響有好多暴力發生嘅「非洲之角」 有牧民計劃模仿自然咁放牧 仲話依樣嘢係佢哋嘅唯一能夠 拯救佢哋嘅家庭同文化嘅希望 
It's 150 feet by 10 feet. ,人要響嗰塊地嘅 95％ 地方靠動物為生 
"Thing is, it's owned by the city. ",我要提醒各位 世上大部份嘅土地都控制緊我哋嘅命運 包括世界上最暴力嘅地區 嗰度動物只能夠靠 95％ 嘅土地餵飽人 
But you have to maintain it. ,人類令到氣候變遷嘅程度 我相信同石化燃料造成嘅一樣大 甚至比石化燃料仲大 
"So I'm like, ""Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want, since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."" ",但更差嘅係 氣候變化會引起饑荒、貧窮 暴力、社會崩潰同戰爭 正如我依家同你哋講嘢嘅時候 就已經有數百萬嘅男人、女人同細路 正喺度受苦、瀕臨死亡 
And this is how I decided to maintain it. ,而如果咁樣持續落去 即使我哋停止使用石化燃料 我哋都好有可能無辦法阻止氣候變遷 
"So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees, you know, the whole nine, vegetables. ",大家而家睇到我哋點樣 以非常低嘅成本同大自然共存 同扭轉一切 
"What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group, where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life, from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer, and everything we do is free. ",我哋已經響全球五大洲 共一千五百萬公頃嘅土地上 實行依個計劃 嗰一啲比我更了解碳嘅人 可以清楚咁話畀你聽 如果我哋照住做 我哋就可以將大氣層裡面足夠數目嘅碳 好安全咁鎖響草原土壤裡面幾千年 如果全球半數嘅草原都做依樣嘢 我哋就可以將大氣中碳嘅數量 到去工業革命前嘅水平 兼可以養活人口 
"And the garden, it was beautiful. ",我真係諗唔到仲有乜嘢 可以畀到地球、細路、佢哋嘅下一代 同所有人類更多嘅希望 
And then somebody complained. ,多謝 （掌聲） 
"The city came down on me, and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden, which this citation was turning into a warrant. ",多謝 （掌聲） 多謝，Chris 
"And I'm like, ""Come on, really? ",主持︰多謝 我相信依度好多人包括我 都想問你問題，或者同你擁抱 
"A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about?"" (Laughter) And I was like, ""Cool. Bring it."" ",我想問你一個好短嘅問題 
Because this time it wasn't coming up. ,你好多年前引入一批動物嘅時候 嗰陣時仲係沙漠，咁佢哋食啲乜？ 
"So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman, and one of the Green Grounds members, they put up a petition on Change.org, and with 900 signatures, we were a success. ",係點樣運作呢？你係點樣開始呢？ 
We had a victory on our hands. ,講者︰我哋已經做咗好長時間 只有復墾礦山嘅時候 我哋需要提供食物畀啲牲畜 因為只有嗰度係完全無植物 
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. ,不過我哋遇過最差嘅地方 響好多年之前嘅津巴布韋 我當時用五英鎊打賭 響一百里範圍內無人可以搵到一條草 之後頭一年我哋將動物嘅數量加多兩倍 而且無提供食物畀啲家畜 我哋只係靠遷徙、模仿大自然 同利用 S 形曲線依個原則 
"I mean, come on, why wouldn't they? ",要花啲時間去解釋，不過就係咁嘞 
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. ,主持︰依個嘢真係好有趣同好重要 
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots. ,我哋博客上面嘅人之後會再問你 等我哋對於依個演講 有更加多題材可以寫 講者︰好 
That's 20 Central Parks. ,主持︰依場係震撼人心嘅演講 真係好震撼人心 我諗你都聽到我哋為你做嘅嘢喝采 
That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants. ,非常多謝你 講者︰多謝 Chris 
Why in the hell would they not okay this? ,（掌聲） 
"Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds. ",
When one dollar's worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce. ,我住喺中南部 
"It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food. ",中南部係咁樣嘅： 好多酒舖 好多快餐店 好多空地 
Growing your own food is like printing your own money. ,之後有啲城市規劃師走到埋嚟一齊討論 佢哋決定將中南部呢個名 改成一個更加有意義嘅名 改成南洛杉磯 佢哋覺得改咗個名 就可以解決呢個城市所有問題 
"(Applause) See, I have a legacy in South Central. ",所以呢度係南洛杉磯（笑聲） 好多酒舖 好多快餐 好多空地 
I grew up there. I raised my sons there. ,"同其他 2,650 萬美國人一樣 我住喺一個食物荒蕪之地 就係洛杉磯中南部 亦係外賣車道普遍 同馬路槍擊頻繁嘅地方 "
"And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people, and I'm manufacturing my own reality. ",有趣嘅係 外賣車道比馬路槍擊所奪去嘅生命仲多 
"See, I'm an artist. ",喺洛杉磯中南部 好多人都死於有得醫嘅病 
Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. ,譬如話，我住嘅嗰區嘅癡肥率 比我哋八、十里距離外嘅比佛利山 高出五倍 
"Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls, me, I beautify lawns, parkways. ",我對呢種情況好厭倦 
"I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth. ",所以我就開始諗 如果你冇辦法得到健康嘅食品 如果你每次出門口都睇到呢啲食物 對你嘅隔籬鄰舍產生壞影響 你會有咩感受？ 
You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. ,我見到輪椅好似二手車咁普通咁買賣 
You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people. ,我睇住嗰啲洗腎中心 好似星巴克咁起完一間又一間 
So what happened? ,我就諗：呢啲嘢要停喇 
"I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education, a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. ",我後來發現問題嘅癥結係解決嘅關鍵 
"To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil. ",敗也食物，成也食物 
We are the soil. ,再加上，我唔想再來回 45 分鐘車程 先至買到冇農藥嘅蘋果 
You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. ,於是，我就喺屋企門前整咗一塊田 
"Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do, especially in the inner city. ",位置就係嗰條又長又窄嘅馬路邊草地 
Plus you get strawberries. ,大概係 150 呎長、十呎闊 
"(Laughter) I remember this time, there was this mother and a daughter came, it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard, and I came out and they looked so ashamed. ",問題係，它係屬於市政府嘅 
"So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this. ",但係必須由你自己去打理 
This is on the street for a reason. ,我就諗：「咁就得啦，既然由我打理， 咁我想點搞都得啦。」 
"It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry, and this only reinforced why I do this, and people asked me, ""Fin, aren't you afraid people are going to steal your food?"" ",咁我就決定咗咁樣搞 
"And I'm like, ""Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it. ",我同洛杉磯綠地組織嘅會員 一齊合力種植農作物、果樹 你知啦，就係各式各類嘅蔬菜 
That's why it's on the street. ,我哋係人哋好心幫我 我哋好心幫其他人嘅一類組織 我哋嘅園丁嚟自各行各業 嚟自城市各個角落，百分百義務性質 而且我哋做嘅都係免費 
That's the whole idea. ,果園好靚 
"I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health."" ",但跟住就有人去投訴 
There's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles. ,市政府搵我，同我講咗一條法律 大致上就係叫我拆咗個果園 如果唔係，我就會收到法庭傳票 
"These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck. ",我當時嘅反應係：「唔係啩？ 
"It was cool, and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother, and it was just cool to see how this changed them, if it was only for that one moment. ",你竟然因為我哋 喺呢笪無關痛癢嘅地方種植 而發傳票？」（笑聲） 我心諗：「話知你。」 
So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens. ,好彩件事冇搞到好大 
"We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins and participate, and it's all volunteers. ",洛杉磯時報有報導過 Steve Lopez 記者又整咗篇報道 Steve Lopez 仲同議員 同埋綠地組織其中一名成員傾過 佢哋喺 Change.org 幫我哋 發起咗簽名運動 我哋最後爭取到九百個簽名 
"If kids grow kale, kids eat kale. ",我哋係相當成功 我哋贏咗啦！ 
"(Laughter) If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. (Applause) But when none of this is presented to them, if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body, they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. ",議員仲打電話畀我 同我講佢哋點支持 同點解鐘意我哋依家做緊嘅嘢 
"I see young people and they want to work, but they're in this thing where they're caught up -- I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them, that leads them to nowhere. ",我覺得：梗係啦 點解佢哋會唔鐘意吖 
"So with gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities, to have a sustainable life. ",洛杉磯嘅空地面積係全美之冠 
"And when we do this, who knows? ",有成 26 平方里嘅空地 
We might produce the next George Washington Carver. ,相當於 20 個中央公園 
"but if we don't change the composition of the soil, we will never do this. ",呢個空間足夠種 7.25 億棵番茄樹 
Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. ,佢哋有乜鬼理由會唔鐘意？ 
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block. ,一棵植物可以提供一千、一萬粒種子 
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. ,價值一蚊嘅青豆 可以產生到價值 75 蚊嘅產品 
Now don't get me wrong. ,我成日都同啲人講自己種食物啦 
"I'm not talking about no free shit, because free is not sustainable. ",自己種嘢食就好似自己印銀紙咁 
"The funny thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it. ",（掌聲） 你睇下，我同中南部有好有緣 
"(Laughter) (Applause) What I'm talking about is putting people to work, and getting kids off the street, and letting them know the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food, opening farmer's markets. ",我喺嗰邊大，我啲仔又係喺嗰邊大 
"So what I want to do here, we gotta make this sexy. ",但係依家呢個現實社會 係人為製造出嚟嘅 所以我好拒絕呢個現實社會 我要製造我自己嘅現實生活 
"So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades, gangstas, gangsta gardeners. ",而且，我係一名藝術家 
We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is. ,花草樹木有如我嘅塗鴉 我栽種我自己嘅藝術 
"If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta. ",就好似一名塗鴉家咁，佢哋美化碰牆 我就美化草地、公園道路 
"Get gangsta with your shovel, okay? ",花圃、泥土就好似我塊畫布咁 花草樹木就係呢塊布嘅點綴飾物 
And let that be your weapon of choice. ,如果你將塊地當成你嘅畫布 佢嘅鬼斧神工係你所預料唔到嘅 
"(Applause) So basically, if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to meet, don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit. ",你係冇辦法想像到一朵向日葵有幾靚 亦都估唔到佢點對人有影響 
"If you want to meet with me, come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit. ",咁，究竟發生咗咩事呢？ 
Peace. Thank you. ,我見證住自己嘅花圃 變成有教育意義嘅事 同埋改造到我個社區 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ,但我想講，要改變社區 就要先改變泥土嘅成份 
,而我哋就係泥土 
I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at. ,你會好驚訝花圃點樣可以影響到細路仔 
"You're about to experience a new, available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives. ",園藝尤其是喺城市入邊 係最有治療功效嘅 兼最可以放膽做嘅行為 
What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material. ,再加上，你可以攞到士多啤梨 
"It's called Ultra-Ever Dry, and when you apply it to any material, it turns into a superhydrophobic shield. ",（笑聲） 我記得有次有對母女過嚟 嗰次大概係夜晚十點半左右 佢哋嚟到我個園圃 然之後我行咗出去，佢哋睇起嚟好冇面 
"So this is a cinder block, uncoated, and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water. ",但見到咁，我覺得好難受 我就同佢哋講話︰ 「其實你哋唔使咁樣， 
Not anymore. ,之所以種喺條街度係有原因嘅。」 
"Porous, nonporous. ",睇住住喺我附近嘅人肚餓咁生活 令到我好唔好意思 呢件事亦都令我堅定我所做嘅嘢 有啲人會問我：「乜你唔驚 啲人嚟偷你啲食物咩？」 
So what's superhydrophobic? ,我就話喇︰「梗係唔會啦， 我唔驚佢哋會嚟偷嘢食。 
Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface. ,我擺得喺度就預咗佢哋攞。 
"The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is, and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic. ",呢個就係我設立園圃嘅目的。 
"A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees. ",我希望佢哋去攞，但係喺同一時間， 我希望佢哋飲食會更加健康。」 
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees. ,仲有一次 我喺洛杉磯市中心嘅 一間流浪漢之家整咗個園圃 
"But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees, and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic. ",嗰啲流浪漢好好心 幫我將啲嘢由個貨車搬落嚟 
"So as part of the demonstration, what I have is a pair of gloves, and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating, and let's see if you can tell which one, and I'll give you a hint. ",成個園圃計劃都好正 之後佢哋都分享返呢件事 講呢件事對佢哋嘅影響 同埋講返佢哋點同佢哋媽咪 阿嫲阿婆一齊種嘢 即使個影響只不過係一時三刻都好 睇見園圃對佢哋嘅影響，我好開心 
Did you guess the one that was dry? ,咁，到依家綠地組織 已經設立咗可能廿個園圃 
"When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience, what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits. ",我們已經有五十個人幫手耕種 佢哋全部都係義工 
And we're talking really small here. ,如果啲細路種甘藍菜 咁佢哋就食甘藍菜 
"The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers, and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and to put some scale to that, if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick, and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them, you'd be the width of a human hair. ",（笑聲） 如果佢哋種番茄 咁佢哋就食番茄（掌聲） 但係如果佢哋未曾見過呢啲食物 如果冇人畀佢哋睇清楚 食物係點樣影響身體 佢哋就會好盲目食你擺喺佢哋面前嘅嘢 
"So very small, but very useful. ",我見過後生仔想搵份工做 但係佢哋被呢個現實社會限制咗 我識得好多非白種人嘅年輕人 身處呢個困局 無前途可言 
And it's not just water that this works with. ,所以，我就諗 我哋可以用呢個園藝計劃 去訓練呢啲細路 畀佢哋去接掌佢哋嘅社區 畀佢哋可以自力更生 
"It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete, water-based paint, mud, and also some refined oils as well. ",我哋咁樣做嘅時候 
You can see the difference. ,無人知道日後佢哋會有咩創舉 我哋可能培養出 喬治．華盛頓．卡弗二世嘅人 
"Moving onto the next demonstration, we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it, we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating, and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle, and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would, except when it hits the coating, it stops, and I can't even coax it to leave. ",但如果一日我們唔改變泥土嘅成份 我哋永遠就唔會有可能 
It's that afraid of the water. ,依家，呢個就係我其中一個計劃 呢個就係我想做嘅嘢 
(Applause) So what's going on here? What's happening? ,我想種一大片田 畀啲街坊可以分享食物 
"Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface. ",我想將貨櫃變成有益嘅咖啡廳 
"You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not. ",嗱，唔好誤會 
"And it has billions of interstitial spaces, and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air. ",我唔係話乜鬼都唔使錢 因為免費係冇辦法可以經營落去嘅 
"It's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off. ",經營係一件好得意嘅嘢 就係你必須經營落去 
"So if I put this inside this water here, you can see a silver reflective coating around it, and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle, and it's dry. ",（笑聲、掌聲） 我所講嘅係畀人有工作 畀細路仔有地方可以去，唔使喺條街度 同時畀佢哋體會下 自己種嘢食、自己開農產品市場 嘅樂趣、喜悅，同埋光榮 
So what are the applications? ,我而家喺度想做嘅係 首先我哋必須要令 農圃耕作搞到好有噱頭 
"I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head. ",我想大家都變成環保革命分子 環保派系、環保幫派園丁 
"Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says, ""Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."" ",從今我哋要改寫幫派嘅描述 
The applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti-wetting. ,如果你唔係園丁，咁你就唔係幫派份子 
We've certainly seen that today. ,要做幫派份子 就要攞起你個鏟，明冇？ 
"It could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice. ",等個鏟成為你嘅武器 
It could be anti-corrosion. ,（掌聲） 基本上，如果你想見我 就係如果你想見面嘅話 你一定唔可以淨係想坐喺度開會 講埋晒你想咩嘢嘅廢話 
"No water, no corrosion. ",如果你係想同我見面嘅 咁就嚟農圃呢度 帶埋你個鏟，我哋一起種嘢 
It could be anti-bacterial. ,係咁多，多謝 
"Without water, the bacteria won't survive. ",（掌聲） 多謝（掌聲） 
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well. ,
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. ,我嚟哩度係想畀大家睇下 嗰啲你平時睇唔到嘅嘢 點樣可以好有趣 
"And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration, but before I do that, I would like to say thank you, and think small. ",你們將會見證一種嶄新、可應用 又相當過癮嘅防水技術 
(Applause) It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it. ,哩度我有塊煤渣磚 哩塊磚半邊搽咗納米噴霧 哩種噴霧可以用喺任何物料上 
Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter) [Two minutes later...] He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part. ,叫做「超乾燥保護漆」 當你噴佢喺任何物料上面 就會形成一層超跣水保護膜 
It's happening! ,煤磚嘅另一邊無噴過噴霧 你可以睇到 磚一邊有窿、可以滲透、吸水 
(Applause) ,另一邊就唔同啦 
,哩邊可滲透，哩邊不可滲透 
"So just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home? ",咁超跣水係咩嘢呢？ 
Not very many of you. ,一件物件跣唔跣水，要睇佢上面嘅水滴 
"Okay. And actually of those hands, if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home? ",滴水越圓，物件就越跣水 如果滴水真係圓形嘅話，咁就係超跣水 
So a couple. ,一架車啱啱打完蠟，上面嘅水分子 跌落嚟就大約 90 度 
That's okay. ,喺擋風玻璃上面就大約 110 度 
That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive -- that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving. ,但係你喺哩度見到嘅 就有 160 度至 175 度 而任何超過 150 度嘅，就係超跣水 
"So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use, whether you're eight or 80. ",為咗展示一樣嘢 我哩度有一對手套 其中一隻搽咗納米噴霧 大家可唔可以分得出 邊隻搽咗納米噴霧？ 我畀啲提示你哋 
"And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem, because you have to build a small, portable robot that's not only really affordable, but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids. ",估唔估到邊隻係乾嘅？ 
This robot can't be creepy or uncanny. ,當我哋有納米技術同納米科學嘅時候 我哋就能夠睇見同真正控制原子同分子 令生活更加便利 
He should be friendly and cute. ,我哋講緊嘅層面真係好細 
So meet Romo. ,"納米技術講緊嘅單位係納米 一納米即係十億分之一米 用比例表示嘅話 當你有好多個一納米厚嘅納米粒子 你將佢一個個咁排起 總共有 50,000 個 咁就有一條人類頭髮咁粗 "
Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love -- your iPhone -- as his brain. ,所以係非常細小，但係非常有用 
"And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor, we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks, which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past. ",唔單止用嚟防水 
"When Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode. ",仲可以防其他水性物料 例如混凝土、水性塗料、泥漿 同埋成品油 
So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face. ,你可以睇到兩隻手套嘅分別 
"If I duck down, he'll follow me. ",而家示範下一個 我哋搵咗一塊玻璃 喺玻璃四邊搽納米塗層 好似保護玻璃嘅四邊咁樣 我哋倒淺綠色嘅水落去中間 你會見到液體喺玻璃上面散開 就好似你平時嘅認知咁 只係當水接觸到塗層時，水會停止擴散 甚至用手都唔能夠潑走 
"He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me. ",塗料排斥水份成咁 
"If I come over here, he'll turn to follow me. ",（掌聲） 究竟點解會咁呢？發生咩事呢？ 
If I come over here -- (Laughs) He's smart. ,其實，哩個噴霧塗層嘅表面 鋪滿咗納米粒子 哩啲粒子形成一層非常粗糙嘅凹凸表面 
"And if I get too close to him, he gets scared just like any other creature. ",你覺得佢好光滑，但實際上唔係 
"So in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own. ",佢有幾十億個罅隙 而哩啲罅隙同納米粒子鎖住空氣分子 令到表面覆蓋著空氣 
"Thanks, little guy. ",好似有把空氣保護傘咁 水、泥、水泥碰到哩層空氣之後 即刻滑落嚟 
(Sneezing sound) Bless you. ,所以如果我將哩個放入水裡面 你會見到表面有一層銀色反光塗層 哩層銀色反光塗層就係防水嘅空氣層 令到水接觸唔到槳，槳就可以保持乾爽 
"And if I want to explore the world -- uh-oh, Romo's tired -- if I want to explore the world with Romo, I can actually connect him from any other iOS device. ",咁有咩嘢應用呢？ 
So here's the iPad. ,我估大家依家都諗繄哩個問題 
And Romo will actually stream video to this device. ,每個人睇見哩項技術都會好興奮 然後講︰「噢，我可以用佢嚟做 哩樣、哩樣、哩樣」 
"So I can see everything that Romo sees, and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world. ",一般嚟講 塗料可以應用喺任何唔濕得嘅嘢 
"Now this is a free app on the App Store, so if any of you guys had this app on your phones, we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. ",塗料除咗做到防水之外 
"So I'll show you really quickly, Romo actually -- he's streaming video, so you can see me and the entire TED audience. ",可以防結冰 因為你無水，你就無冰 
If I get in front of Romo here. ,佢亦可以防腐蝕 
"And if I want to control him, I can just drive. ",因為無水，無腐蝕 
"So I can drive him around, and I can take pictures of you. ",仲可以防菌 
"I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience. ",細菌唔可以喺無水嘅情況下生存 
So I'll snap a picture. ,亦可以用喺需要自動清洗嘅物件上 
"And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad, I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device. ",所以，想像一下類似嘅發明 點樣可以革新你嘅行業 
So there are all of you through Romo's eyes. ,最後，我做一個示範 但喺我示範之前，我希望講聲多謝 同埋想你哋思考細微嘅事物 
"And finally, because Romo is an extension of me, I can express myself through his emotions. ",（掌聲） 個 D 字就快出嚟啦。等陣，等陣 
So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited. ,Chris Anderson：你哋無聽講過 TED 唔再講求 Design 設計咩？（笑聲） [ 兩分鐘後… ] 佢做醫學研究嗰陣遇到各種問題 
But the most important thing about Romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive. ,D 字出嚟啦！ 
You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo. ,（掌聲） 
"In fact, who would like to drive a robot? ",
Okay. Awesome. ,如果你屋企有機械人嘅，就請舉高手 
Here you go. ,唔係好多人 
"Thank you, Scott. ",好。咁嗰啲舉咗手嘅 如果唔計 Roomba 有幾多人屋企係有機械人嘅？ 
"And even cooler, you actually don't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him. ",都有幾個 
So he actually streams two-way audio and video between any two smart devices. ,冇問題 
"So you can log in through the browser, and it's kind of like Skype on wheels. ",呢個就係我哋 Romotive 要解決嘅問題 亦係我同廿位喺 Romotive 嘅發燒友 成日想解決嘅 
"So we were talking before about telepresence, and this is a really cool example. ",我哋好想整到一個人人都用得嘅機械人 無論你係八歲或者八十歲都用得 
"You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone, and her mom buys her a robot. ",結果就係，原來呢個係非常困難嘅問題 因為你必須要建造出 一個細到可以隨身攜帶 價錢又實惠嘅機械人 但佢必須要令家長 想將佢帶返屋企同埋畀小朋友用 
"That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot, send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country. ",呢個機械人嘅樣唔可以好得人驚 同埋唔可以唔自然 
"Grandma can log into that robot and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night, when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year. ",佢應該要有親切感同埋好得意嘅 
"Thanks, Scott. ",所以有請 Romo 
(Applause) So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today. ,Romo 淨係需要 一個大家都識嘅裝置 即係你嘅 iPhone——控制 
But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future. ,利用 iPhone 處理器嘅能力 我哋就可以用 150 蚊美金 嚟做出一個可以用無線 同埋識得分析圖像嘅機械人 呢個價錢大概係 呢種機械人以前成本嘅 1% 
"This is actually something that one of our engineers, Dom, built in a weekend. ",當 Romo 醒咗之後，佢會進入生物狀態 
It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly. ,亦即係話佢係用攝影機嚟捕捉我塊臉 
This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want. ,如果我踎低，佢會跟住我 
You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo. ,佢好著緊，所以佢會望實我 
"And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser, which is what you see Romo doing on the left. ",如果我過嚟呢度，佢會轉過嚟跟住我 
"And then if you have something you like, you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life, run the program in real life. ",如果我嚟呢度（笑聲） 佢好精靈 
"And then if you have something you're proud of, you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world. ",跟住，如果我太近佢 佢就會好似其他動物咁嚇襯 
So all of these wi-fi–enabled robots actually learn from each other. ,喺好多方面，Romo 好似寵物咁 有自己嘅思想 
The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal. ,唔該你，機械人 
They change from person to person. ,（打咳嚏） 冇事嗎？ 
"So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home, that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination. ",然後如果我想去探索世界 ——噢，Romo 攰啦 咁如果我想同 Romo 一齊探索世界嘅話 我可以直接將佢同任何 iOS 裝置連接 
So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like. ,呢度有個 iPad 
"To be honest, I have no idea. ",Romo 會將現場畫面傳送到呢部機度 
But what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away. ,所以我可以睇到 Romo 睇到嘅嘢 同埋擁有機械人嘅視界 
"The future of personal robotics is happening today, and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves. ",而家呢個程式喺 App Store 係免費嘅 所以如果你哋手機入邊有呢個程式嘅話 我們可以一齊現場控制機械人同玩遊戲 
"So we can't wait to get you all robots, and we can't wait to see what you build. ",咁我而家就好快趣畀大家睇下… Romo 事實上——佢喺度直播緊 你可以睇到我同埋成班 TED 觀眾 
Thank you. ,如果我跑到 Romo 嘅前面 
(Applause) ,如果我想要控制佢，我可以直接駕駛佢 
,我可以揸佢去唔同嘅地方 我又可以用佢幫你哋影相 
"So let's start with some good news, and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases? ","我一直都想要一幅 有 1,500 位 TED 觀眾嘅相 "
"Let's start with leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL, the most common cancer of children. ",咁等我影返幅先 
"When I was a student, the mortality rate was about 95 percent. ",好似你碌 iPad 一樣 我可以碌螢幕嚟控制 機械人上面攝影機嘅角度 
"Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent. ",呢個就係 Romo 眼中嘅你哋啦 
Six thousand children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured. ,仲有，因為 Romo 係我嘅工具 所以我可以利用佢嚟表達我嘅心情 
"If you want the really big numbers, look at these numbers for heart disease. ",包括用 iPad 將 Romo 變得興奮 
"Heart disease used to be the biggest killer, particularly for men in their 40s. ",但係 Romo 最重要嘅一件事就係 我哋想整一啲淨係需要直覺就可以嘅嘢 
"Today, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality from heart disease -- remarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year. ",你唔需要教人點樣去控制 Romo 
"AIDS, incredibly, has just been named, in the past month, a chronic disease, meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years, as we said only a decade ago, but is thought to live decades, probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether. ",其實而家有冇人想控制個機械人？ 
"These are just remarkable, remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers. ",太好啦 
"And one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about, stroke, which has been, along with heart disease, one of the biggest killers in this country, is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within three hours of the onset, some 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever. ",畀你 
"Remarkable stories, good-news stories, all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early. ",唔該晒 Scott 
"Early detection, early intervention, that's the story for these successes. ",更加正嘅係 你唔需要喺機械人所在嘅位置 控制機械人 
"Unfortunately, the news is not all good. ",你見到啦 機械人可以令任何兩部智能裝置 做到雙向視音通訊 
Let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide. ,即係話你可以利用瀏覽器 登入做視音通訊 所以佢好似流動嘅 Skype 咁 
"Now this is, of course, not a disease, per se. ",咁我哋之前喺度講緊網真會議 呢個就係一個好正嘅例子啦 
"It's a condition, or it's a situation that leads to mortality. ",舉個例子，你可以想像 一個擁有 iPhone 嘅八歲細路女 而佢媽媽買咗一個機械人畀佢 
What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is. ,呢個女仔可以將佢嘅 iPhone 放喺個機械人上 然後寄一封電郵 畀住喺另一笪地方嘅阿嫲 
"There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States. ",阿嫲可以登入機械人 然後同佢個孫女 每晚玩 15 分鐘伏匿匿 如果唔係咁，佢有可能一年 先至有一、兩次可以睇佢個孫女 
That means one about every 15 minutes. ,唔該晒，Scott 
Third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and 25. ,（鼓掌） 咁啱啱所講嘅就係一啲 Romo 今日可以做到嘅得意嘢 
It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country. ,最後我想講埋我哋末來打算要做啲乜嘢 
"Now, when we talk about suicide, there is also a medical contribution here, because 90 percent of suicides are related to a mental illness: depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anorexia, borderline personality. There's a long list of disorders that contribute, and as I mentioned before, often early in life. ",呢個其實係我哋其中一位工程師 Dom 喺週末做出來嘅 
But it's not just the mortality from these disorders. ,佢用一個叫做 Blockly 嘅 Google 公開系統開發 
It's also morbidity. ,呢個你可以拖放呢啲語義代碼塊 並為機械人創造出 任何一種你想要嘅行為 
"If you look at disability, as measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years, it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist, except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes, and as you can see, virtually 30 percent of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders, neuropsychiatric syndromes. ",你毋需要知道點樣編碼 都可以為 Romo 創造一個行為 
You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense. ,你更加可以喺瀏覽器度模擬呢個行為 即係你而家喺左手邊 睇到 Romo 做嘅嘢 
"I mean, cancer seems far more serious. ",如果你有鍾意嘅嘢 你可以下載到你嘅機械人，然後執行 
Heart disease seems far more serious. ,如果你有啲你自豪嘅嘢 你可以將佢同全球嘅機械人主人分享 
"But you can see actually they are further down this list, and that's because we're talking here about disability. ",所以呢，呢啲有無線功能嘅機械人 其實會互相學習 
What drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression? ,我哋之所以要全心全意製造出 任何人都可以訓練嘅機械人 係因為我哋認為私人機械人 最重要嘅嘢在於個人化 
Why are they number one here? ,人人對機械人嘅需要都唔同 
"Well, there are probably three reasons. ",所以我哋覺得如果你想喺屋企 整返個機械人嘅話 咁你需要用你嘅想像力 去設計呢個機械人 
One is that they're highly prevalent. ,我希望我可以同你講到 末來個人機械人係點樣 
About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime. ,但老實講，我自己都唔知 
"A second, of course, is that, for some people, these become truly disabling, and it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20. ",但係我哋可以好肯定佢唔使一百億 唔使等十年或者等人形機械人出現之後 
"But what really drives these numbers, this high morbidity, and to some extent the high mortality, is the fact that these start very early in life. ",個人機械人嘅未來就係喺今日 機械人會好似 Romo 一樣小型、敏捷 同埋按大家嘅創意去設計 
"Fifty percent will have onset by age 14, 75 percent by age 24, a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease, diabetes, hypertension -- most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality. ",我哋唔單止等唔切 畀你哋全部人擁有機械人 我哋亦都好想睇下 你哋切出嚟嘅機械人 
"These are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people. ",多謝大家 
"Now, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories. ",（鼓掌） 
This is obviously not one of them. ,
"This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult, and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me. ",我哋先嚟啲好消息 呢個好消息 同生物醫學研究改善咗好多個嚴重疾病 而我哋知道當中有幾多嘢有關 
My job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders. ,我哋就由白血病開始講 急性淋巴細胞性白血病，俗稱 ALL 係細路仔最常見嘅癌症 
I work for the federal government. ,當我仲係學生嘅時候 死亡率係大概 95% 
"Actually, I work for you. You pay my salary. ",25、30 年之後嘅今日，我哋講梗嘅係 呢種病嘅死亡率下降咗 85% 
"And maybe at this point, when you know what I do, or maybe what I've failed to do, you'll think that I probably ought to be fired, and I could certainly understand that. ",以致到每年六千名兒童都救得返 
"But what I want to suggest, and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these illnesses. ",如果你想要真係大嘅數字 我哋不妨嚟睇下心臟病嘅數字 
"What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders, diseases of the mind. ",以前，尤其是對四字頭的男性嚟講 心臟病係最犀利嘅殺手 
"That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days, and people feel that, for whatever reason, it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior. ",依家，我哋睇到個數字跌咗 63% 亦令到每年 110 萬個心臟病人 可以救得返 
"Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior, and they are disorders of the mind. ",好開心，愛滋病喺上個月 終於被定義為慢性病 意思即係話，一個人喺 20 歲時 感染到 HIV 嘅話 佢預期嘅壽命 唔再只係好似我哋十年前所講嘅 幾個禮拜、幾個月，或者幾年 而依家預期嘅壽命已經延長到幾十年 有可能要到佢六、七十歲 佢至因為其他病因而去世 
"But what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms, which have been in play for a century or more, are actually now impediments to progress, that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders. ",現時最致命嘅幾種病未來都會有發展 
"Now, for some of you, you're going to say, ""Oh my goodness, here we go again. ",其中一個特別嘅 你可能唔知道嘅，就係中風 呢個病同心臟病 都係呢個國家嘅頭號殺手 我哋而家知道 只要呢個病嘅病人喺病發之內三粒鐘 可以送入急症室嘅話 大概有三成嘅人 可以喺冇殘疾嘅情況下出院 
"We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of very flat, unidimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia. ",呢啲非常唔簡單嘅事、或者呢啲好消息 令我哋對疾病嘅認知提高咗 從而可以提早發現、介入 
"When we talk about the brain, it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic. ",提早發現、介入就係 依啲個案可以醫得好嘅原因 
"It depends, of course, on what scale or what scope you want to think about, but this is an organ of surreal complexity, and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it, whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections. ",但係好不幸，唔係全部都係好消息 
We have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports our own minds. ,我哋嚟講講另一個同自殺有關嘅故仔 
It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself. ,咁當然啦，自殺本身唔係一種病 
"In a sense, it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition, something you can observe, that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand. ",但佢會導致死亡 
"Now, already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, while we don't have an in-depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses, we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences, or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders. ",你可能冇發覺到佢有幾咁普遍 
"We call this the human connectome, and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain. ","喺美國，每一年都有 38,000 宗自殺案件 "
You'll hear more about this in a few minutes. ,亦即係話每 15 分鐘就有一單 
"The important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders, the one in five of us who struggle in some way, you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired, but there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders. ",呢個亦係 15 歲到 25 歲 年齡層嘅第三大死因 
It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex. ,如果你知道國家嘅自殺率 比謀殺率多出一倍 同時自殺比交通事故死亡嘅人數 仲要多嘅時候 你就會知道呢件事係幾咁唔尋常 
"Here we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours, or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions. ",而家講到自殺 我哋就嚟講下疾病對自殺有咩影響 因為 90% 嘅自殺案件 都係同精神病有關 例如：抑鬱症、躁鬱症、精神分裂症 厭食、邊緣人格 有好多精神病都會導致自殺 而且呢啲精神病喺好早期就會出現 
"You could, if you want, compare this to, on the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack, where you have dead tissue in the heart, versus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it. ",但係，呢啲病唔單止增加死亡風險 
Either one would kill you; in only one of them will you find a major lesion. ,佢仲會增加病發風險 
"As we think about this, probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia, because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters. ",至於殘疾方面，你會睇到世界衛生組織 利用所謂「失能調整生命年」量度殘疾 但呢個其實只不過係 一種除咗經濟學家之外 冇人諗到嘅公式 呢條公式評估因為殘疾而損失嘅嘢 正如你所見到 有 30% 嘅殘疾可以歸因於精神病 同中樞神經精神症候群 
"These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia, and you can see already in the top there's areas that are red or orange, yellow, are places where there's less gray matter, and as they followed them over five years, comparing them to age match controls, you can see that, particularly in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter. ",你可能覺得頭先講嘅嘢無理 
"And it's important, if you try to model this, you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical mass, loss of cortical gray matter, and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark, and at some point, when you overshoot, you cross a threshold, and it's that threshold where we say, this is a person who has this disease, because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions. ",我意思係話，癌症點睇 都比精神病嚴重得多 
That's something we can observe. ,心臟病點睇都比精神病嚴重好多 
But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold. ,但係，你可以睇到心臟病同埋癌症 喺名單度仲要排後啲 咁係因為我哋依家講梗嘅係殘疾 
"They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier, that perhaps not at age 22 or 20, but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain, not at the level of behavior. ",究竟係乜嘢令到精神病 譬如話精神分裂、躁鬱症，同埋抑鬱症 
"Why does this matter? Well first because, for brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change. ",最終演變成殘疾呢？ 點解佢哋喺個名單度係排第一？ 
"We know that for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for Huntington's. ",咁，其實係有三個原因嘅 
There are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change. ,第一，就係佢哋非常之流行 
"The tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge. ",五個人當中就有一個人 喺一生之中罹患其中一種精神病 
"But most important, go back to where we started. ",第二，當然就係因為 當中有啲人因為個病而變咗殘疾 普遍率大概係 4% 到 5% 即二十個人當中就有一個 
"The good-news stories in medicine are early detection, early intervention. ",但係真正令到呢啲數字咁高 令到發病率咁高、令到死亡率咁高 係因為呢啲精神病喺生命好早期就出現 
"If we waited until the heart attack, we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease. ",50% 嘅人喺 14 歲嘅時候有精神病 75% 喺 24 歲有 呢個同我哋認為導致發病同死亡嘅 癌症、心臟病、糖尿病、高血壓 ——呢啲重大疾病，係好唔同 
"That is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders, brain circuit disorders, has a behavioral disorder. ",呢啲精神病確實係年輕人嘅慢性病 
We wait until the behavior becomes manifest. ,咁，我開頭同你哋講咗會有好消息 
That's not early detection. That's not early intervention. ,好明顯，呢個唔算好消息 
"Now to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this. ",呢個可以講係我工作裏邊 最困難嘅一部份 亦令我要好認真面對 
"We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know what the tools will be, nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different. ",因為我嘅工作要確保 我哋喺呢啲疾病上高有所進展 
"But this tells us how we need to think about it, and where we need to go. ",我為聯邦政府做嘢 
Are we going to be there soon? ,亦即係為你哋做嘢，係你哋俾我人工 
"I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years, but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in concepts and changes in technology. ",可能喺呢個時候 當你知道咗我係做咩嘅 又或者係我冇做咩嘅 你覺得你要炒我魷魚 而我係非常之明白嘅 
We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10. -- Bill Gates. ,但係，我想講，我之所以會喺呢度 就係想同你哋講 我哋對呢啲疾病嘅認知將會好唔同 
Thanks very much. ,到目前為止，我同你講嘅都係精神病 
(Applause) ,其實，「精神病」呢個詞依家已經過時 而且啲人認為無論係咩理由 用「行為疾病」嚟稱呼會比較政治正確 
,因為佢哋講到尾都係行為失常病 亦係精神上嘅疾病 
"When I was 14 years old, I had low self-esteem. ",但係我想提醒嘅係 呢兩個已經沿用咗一個世紀有多嘅詞 其實限制咗我哋嘅發展 若然要有所發展 我哋就要將呢啲疾病諗成係腦部嘅疾病 
I felt I was not talented at anything. ,嗱，而家你哋有啲人會諗： 「噢，天啊，又嚟啦。 
"One day, I bought a yo-yo. ",我哋又要聽咩生化失調， 聽咩藥物嘅嘢， 或者聽咩簡化咗嘅概念， 按自己過去嘅經歷製作化學分子， 亦都可能借自己經驗去了解 抑鬱症或精神分裂症。」 
"When I tried my first trick, it looked like this: (Laughter) I couldn't even do the simplest trick, but it was very natural for me, because I was not dextrous, and hated all sports. ",當我哋講到大腦嘅時候 佢絕對唔係乜嘢單維度 簡單嘅嘢或者還原論 
"But after one week of practicing, my throws became more like this: A bit better. ",當然，呢個都係要睇下 你用咩規模、用咩範圍諗 但係呢個器官係超現實嘅複雜 而且無論你係想像緊 大腦皮質嘅一百億個神經元 又或者連接所有嘢嘅一百萬億個突觸 我哋依家先至啱啱開始知道點樣研究佢 
"I thought, the yo-yo is something for me to be good at. ",我哋依家啱啱先開始嘗試搞清楚 我哋應該點樣理解 呢個咁複雜、負責信息處理嘅機器 同埋點樣用我哋嘅思想 去了解支持我哋有思想嘅大腦 
"For the first time in my life, I found my passion. ",其實進化真係同我哋開咗個大玩嘅玩笑 我哋始終冇辦法自己研究返自己嘅大腦 
I was spending all my time practicing. ,你或者會覺得研究行為 或者認知能力好保險 因為你有實質嘅嘢可以觀察 而且行為同認知能力 相比起嘗試研究 呢個咁複雜、神祕嘅器官簡單得多 
It took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level. ,咁而家繼續我之前 同你哋講過嘅大腦疾病： 抑鬱症、強迫症、創傷後壓力症候群 雖然我哋未有辦法 可以深入了解呢啲病嘅病理 或者個腦點受呢啲病影響 但係我哋已經搵到一啲異常嘅神經連接 或者係患有呢啲病嘅病人 個腦嘅信息傳遞有咩差別 
"And then, four years later, when I was 18 years old, I was standing onstage at the World YoYo Contest. ",我哋叫呢個情況做「腦功能聯結圖譜」 你可以將「腦功能聯結圖譜」 當成係大腦嘅線路圖 
And I won. ,我之後會再講多啲呢樣嘢 
I was so excited. ,最重要嘅一點就係 當你開始研究心理病 即係五個人就有一個患上嘅病 你會發覺大腦嘅神經連接方式 可以好唔同 但係連接方式卻係有跡可尋 而且某啲連接方式就係 造成心理病嘅元兇 
"Yes, I did it! I became a hero. 
I may get many sponsors, a lot of money, tons of interviews, and be on TV! I thought. ",呢個同我哋平時認識嘅大腦疾病 例如亨丁頓舞蹈症、柏金遜症 或者阿茲海默症，有啲唔同 呢啲病之不過損壞你部份大腦皮質 
"(Laughter) But after coming back to Japan, totally nothing changed in my life. ",但我哋而家講梗嘅問題係塞車 有時候係繞道 又或者係大腦線路本身就係咁樣連接 以至大腦本身點樣運作 
(Laughter) I realized society didn't value my passion. ,如果你想嘅話，你可以攞心肌梗塞 即係心臟病 同心律不整嚟比較 心臟病表示有啲心臟組織死咗 而心律不整就係因為 心臟內部溝通有問題 令到成個器官冇辦法運作正常 
So I went back to my college and became a typical Japanese worker as a systems engineer. ,兩個病都可以致命 但係，淨係得一個有著重大毛病 
"I felt my passion, heart and soul, had left my body. ",當我哋諗到呢啲病嘅時候 我哋不妨深入啲睇下 其中一個病，精神分裂症 因為我認為呢種病有助明白 點解要將精神病諗成係大腦疾病 
I felt I was not alive anymore. ,呢幾張係國家心理衛生研究院嘅 Judy Rapoport 同佢啲同事 喺研究早發性精神分裂症細路仔嘅時候 掃描出嚟嘅 你可以睇到上高，紅、橙、黃嘅地方 灰色神經組織比較少 佢哋追查呢啲細路仔五年 將佢哋同同年紀嘅細路比較 你可以發現 特別喺好似背外側前額葉皮層 或者顳上回 都有大量嘅灰色神經組織損失 
"So I started to consider what I should do, and I thought, I wanted to make my performance better, and to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could be to change the public's image of the yo-yo. ",如果你想將佢諗得實質啲 你可以將正常發育諗成係皮質質量減少 或者皮質灰色神經組織流失 而精神分裂就係 呢啲灰色神經組織損失得太多 當你損失到一定數量嘅時候 過咗一個點嘅時候 我哋就界定咗呢個人有呢個病 因為佢哋有幻覺同埋妄想嘅症狀 
So I quit my company and started a career as a professional performer. ,呢個係我哋可以觀察到嘅 
"I started to learn classic ballet, jazz dance, acrobatics and other things to make my performance better. ",但係，睇真啲 你會發覺佢哋已經過咗另一個臨界點 
"As a result of these efforts, and the help of many others, it happened. ",佢哋係好早期嘅時候 就過咗個大腦嘅臨界點 應該唔使等 22 或者 20 歲 而係 15 或者 16 歲嘅時候 你就可以開始睇到 大腦嘅發育軌跡已經好唔同 但行為方面就冇 
I won the World YoYo Contest again in the artistic performance division. ,點解呢個好重要呢？ 第一，因為喺腦疾病病人當中 行為會係最遲受到影響嘅一樣嘢 
I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil. ,我哋從阿茲海默症、柏金遜症 亨丁頓舞蹈症知道 
"Today, I am standing on the TED stage with the yo-yo in front of you. ",大腦疾病要起碼有十年長 行為先至會有變化 
"(Applause) What I learned from the yo-yo is, if I make enough effort with huge passion, there is no impossible. ",我哋而家所用嘅工具 可以畀我哋提早好多偵測到腦嘅變化 早到喺症狀出現之前就偵測得到 
Could you let me share my passion with you through my performance? ,但係最重要嘅 我哋返返去我哋一開始嗰度 
(Applause) (Water sound) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) (Applause ends) (Music) (Applause) ,醫學界嘅好消息就係提早發現、介入 
,如果我哋等到心臟病發個陣時先救 我哋呢個國家就會有 110 萬條生命白白冇咗 
"What you're doing, right now, at this very moment, is killing you. ",呢個就正正係我哋而家所做嘅嘢 因為我哋認為一個人 只要有是旦一種呢啲腦疾病 就會有行為障礙症 
"More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about, the technology you're using the most almost every day is this, your tush. ",我哋只能夠等到行為徵狀 出咗嚟先做到嘢 
"Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day, which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours. ",所以呢樣唔係提早偵測或者介入 
"Sitting is so incredibly prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it, and because everyone else is doing it, it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay. ",我想講嘅係 我哋仲未完全準備好咁樣做 
"In that way, sitting has become the smoking of our generation. ",我哋冇全部嘅知識 我哋甚至乎唔知道個工具會係咩 亦都唔知道喺每一個案件中 我哋應該準確搵咩嘢 先至可以喺行為症狀浮現之前 就可以知道一個人有心理病 
"Of course there's health consequences to this, scary ones, besides the waist. ",但係，頭先講到嘅嘢 提示咗我哋應該點樣去諗 同埋應該點樣走 
"Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical [activity], Ten percent in fact, on both of those. ",我哋會不會好快就會到嗰度？ 
"Six percent for heart disease, seven percent for type 2 diabetes, which is what my father died of. ",我認為呢樣嘢 喺未來幾年係會發生嘅 但係，喺我結束之前，我想引用 一個就著觀念轉變同埋科技進步 諗咗好多嘢嘅人 講到呢樣嘢會點發生，佢就係蓋茨︰ 
"Now, any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more, but if you're anything like me, it won't. ",「我哋永遠都高估咗 未來兩年會發生嘅變化 並且低估咗未來十年會發生嘅變化。」 
What did get me moving was a social interaction. ,多謝大家 
"Someone invited me to a meeting, but couldn't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said, ""I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"" ",（掌聲） 
"It seemed kind of odd to do, and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking, ""I have to be the one to ask the next question,"" because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation. ",
"And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own. ",我十四歲嘅時候，我好自卑 
"So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings, I ask people to go on a walking meeting, to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week. ",我覺得我冇任何天份 
It's changed my life. ,有一日，我買咗個搖搖 
"But before that, what actually happened was, I used to think about it as, you could take care of your health, or you could take care of obligations, and one always came at the cost of the other. ",當我嘗試第一個招式嘅時候 佢睇起嚟好似咁 （笑聲） 我連最簡單嘅招式都唔識 不過呢個對我嚟講係好自然嘅事 因為我手腳唔靈活，而且好憎運動 
"So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later, I've learned a few things. ",但係，經過一個禮拜練習之後 我出嚟嘅技巧比較似咁 好咗啲 
"First, there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking. ",我覺得，遙遙係我人生裏邊一樣 
"Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works. ",我會有做得叻嘅嘢 我搵到我嘅嗜好 
"And second, and probably the more reflective one, is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they're really not that way. ",我用唒我所有時間練習 
"And if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently, whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues, job creation, maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true. ",我每日要花好幾粒鐘先至可以 將我嘅技術提升上另一級 
Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable. ,跟住，四年之後，我十八歲 我企喺世界遙遙比賽嘅台上 
"So I started this talk talking about the tush, so I'll end with the bottom line, which is, walk and talk. ",最後贏咗 
Walk the talk. ,我嗰陣時好興奮 
"You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking, and in the way that you do, you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas. ",「耶！我得咗！我係英雄， 
Thank you. ,我會有好多贊助商、 好多錢、好多訪問， 甚至乎上電視！」 我當時係咁諗（笑聲） 
(Applause) ,但係返到日本之後 我嘅人生完全冇改變到（笑聲） 
,我發現個社會並唔重視我熱愛嘅嘢 
"I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse, or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse. ",所以，我返去學校 成為咗日本典型嘅勞工 做咗系統工程師 
"(Laughter) Both my parents were educators, my maternal grandparents were educators, and for the past 40 years, I've done the same thing. ",我發覺我嘅熱情、心同埋靈魂 都離開咗我嘅肉體 
"And so, needless to say, over those years I've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives. ",我覺得我死咗 
Some of those reforms have been good. ,跟住我就開始諗我究竟應該點做 我想表演得再好啲 同埋想上台表演畀大家睇下 遙遙可以有幾咁精彩 從而改變大家對遙遙嘅印象 
Some of them have been not so good. ,所以，我辭職，轉去做專業嘅表演家 
And we know why kids drop out. ,我開始學古典芭蕾舞、爵士舞、雜技 同埋其他可以令到我表演更加出眾嘅嘢 
We know why kids don't learn. ,因為我努力 加埋喺好多其他嘢幫助之下 皇天不負有心人 
"It's either poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences... ",我再一次喺世界遙遙大賽嘅 藝術表演項目贏咗 
But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection. ,我過咗太陽馬戲團嘅面試 
James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship. ,今日，我企喺 TED 嘅台上 帶住遙遙出現喺你哋面前 
George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships. ,（掌聲） 我從遙遙上高學到嘅係 如果我盡自己所能 並且熱愛我所做嘅嘢 冇嘢係冇可能 
Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult. ,大家唔知想唔想我表演 同我一齊愛上遙遙？ 
"For years, I have watched people teach. ",（掌聲） （水聲） （音樂） （掌聲） （音樂） （音樂、掌聲） （掌聲） （音樂、掌聲） （掌聲） （音樂） （掌聲） 
I have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst. ,
"A colleague said to me one time, ""They don't pay me to like the kids. ",你哋宜家做緊嘅嘢係害緊你哋 
They pay me to teach a lesson. ,就算車，或者網路 又或者我哋一直講緊嘅智能電話都好 你每日用佢哋嘅次數都唔夠呢樣咁高 就係你哋嘅臀部 
The kids should learn it. ,今日，人平均每天坐 9.3 個鐘 呢個比我哋嘅瞓覺時間 7.7 個鐘，仲要多 
"I should teach it, they should learn it, Case closed."" ",「坐」係難以置信嘅普遍 因為所有人都做緊同樣嘅嘢 而且平時我哋冇諗過我哋坐咗幾耐 我哋甚至冇發覺呢樣嘢係唔好 
"Well, I said to her, ""You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like."" ",可以話，我哋呢一代坐嘅問題 等如上一代人吸煙嘅問題 
"(Laughter) (Applause) She said, ""That's just a bunch of hooey."" ",坐當然仲有不良嘅健康後果 當中嚇人嘅，除咗腰部問題之外 
"And I said to her, ""Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear."" ",仲包括乳癌同結腸癌 呢兩樣都同缺少運動直接相關 缺少運動嘅人當中分別有一成人 患上咗乳癌同結腸癌 
"Needless to say, it was. ",亦都有 6% 缺少運動嘅人患上心臟病 7% 嘅人患上 2 型糖尿病 2 型糖尿病亦都我爸爸過身嘅原因 
"Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship, or you don't. ",到呢一刻，呢啲統計應該都說服到我哋 唔好由朝坐到晚 但如果你好似我咁 仍然都係無動於衷嘅話 
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. ,咁社交就係令你同我活動嘅原因 
"He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand, as opposed to being understood. ",人哋叫我參加一個會議 但係安排唔到畀我入去 於是就話 「我聽日會同狗仔一齊散步， 你會嚟嗎？」 
"Simple things, like apologizing. ",咁樣聽起嚟可能好奇怪 但係，我記得第一次開會嘅時候 我同自己講「我要問下個問題」 查實係因為開會期間 我會不停咁氣咳同普通咳 
"Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock. ",而我又唔想影響大家 想早啲問完問題走 
(Laughter) I taught a lesson once on ratios. ,所以，我決定與其飲咖啡開會 或者喺會議室開會 我倒不如叫人哋同我一邊行路一邊開會 一個星期大概 20 到 30 英里 
"I'm not real good with math, but I was working on it. ",咁樣嘅開會方式改變咗我 
(Laughter) And I got back and looked at that teacher edition. ,其實做行路開會之前 我曾經覺得健康同工作不可兼得 無可能兩全其美 
I'd taught the whole lesson wrong. ,但係宜家，經過幾百次行路開會之後 我學到一啲嘢 
"(Laughter) So I came back to class the next day and I said, ""Look, guys, I need to apologize. ",首先，我哋其實可以跳出傳統思維框框 做未做過嘅嘢 
"I taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry."" ",就算係同大自然或者運動有關嘅事也好 
"They said, ""That's okay, Ms. Pierson. ",呢種思維模式確係有用 第二點，或者係我最反思深刻嘅一點 講緊我哋好多時會將問題放大到無限大 而啲問題其實唔係我哋睇到嘅咁大 
"You were so excited, we just let you go."" ",如果我哋解決問題 以及用第二個角度去看待呢個世界 包括政治、商業、環境、就業方面 同重新詮釋面對嘅問題 令佢哋正反兩面睇起嚟都正確 
"I have had classes that were so low, so academically deficient, that I cried. ",當你重新了解問題 然後又同人哋一路行路一路開會 好多嘢就會變成做得到、可持續 同埋切實可行 
"I wondered, ""How am I going to take this group, in nine months, from where they are to where they need to be? ",我開頭講到臀部 我最尾想講︰ 大家要行路同開會 
"And it was difficult, it was awfully hard. ",畀行路帶領談話 
How do I raise the self-esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time? ,當你做到時 你會發現新鮮空氣可以畀到你新嘅思維 亦都因為你做事方式唔同咗 你會有全新嘅想法 
One year I came up with a bright idea. ,多謝大家 
"I told all my students, ""You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students, they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it."" ",（掌聲） 
"One of the students said, ""Really?"" ",
"(Laughter) I said, ""Really. We have to show the other classes how to do it, so when we walk down the hall, people will notice us, so you can't make noise. ",我哩一生人嘅時間 唔係用喺學校度，就係用係返學途中 再唔係就係用喺傾學校嘅事上 
"You just have to strut."" ",（笑聲） 我父母都係從事教育 我公公婆婆都係從事教育 我喺過去四十年嘅工作亦同佢哋一樣 
"(Laughter) And I gave them a saying to say: ""I am somebody. ",所以，我咁多年嚟 從唔同角度睇教育改革 
I was somebody when I came. ,有啲教育改革係好嘅 
I'll be a better somebody when I leave. ,有啲就唔係咁好 
"I am powerful, and I am strong. ",我哋知道點解有啲學生輟學 
I deserve the education that I get here. ,我哋知道點解有啲學生學唔到嘢 
"I have things to do, people to impress, and places to go."" ",原因不外乎係貧窮、低出席率 朋輩嘅壞影響 
"And they said, ""Yeah!"" ",但有件事我哋從來都無討論過 或者咁講，有件事我哋好少提起嘅 就係人與人之間關係嘅價值同重要 
"(Laughter) You say it long enough, it starts to be a part of you. ",James Comer 講過 學習要有效，就要有良好嘅師生關係 
"(Applause) I gave a quiz, 20 questions. ",George Washington Carver 話 所有嘅學習都係同理清關係有關 
A student missed 18. ,在座嘅每一位 總會受過一位老師或者大人影響 
"I put a ""+2"" on his paper and a big smiley face. ",咁多年嚟，我一直觀察老師點教學生 
"(Laughter) He said, ""Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"" ",我見過最好嘅教學，亦都見識過最差嘅 
"I said, ""Yes."" ",有位同事同我講過︰ 「學校出糧冇叫我鍾意細路仔， 
"(Laughter) He said, ""Then why'd you put a smiley face?"" ",學校叫我教書㗎咋。 
"I said, ""Because you're on a roll. ",我嘅本份就係教書， 
"You got two right. You didn't miss them all."" ",班細路嘅本份就係吸收。 成件事就係咁簡單。」 
"(Laughter) I said, ""And when we review this, won't you do better?"" ",我同佢講︰ 「你知唔知呢，細路係唔會 喺佢哋唔鐘意嘅人身上學嘢㗎。」 
"He said, ""Yes, ma'am, I can do better."" ",（笑聲、掌聲） 佢話：「你唔好亂嗡。」 
"You see, ""-18"" sucks all the life out of you. ",我同佢講：「你唔改嘅話， 你哩一年會過得好漫長同好艱難。」 
"+2 said, ""I ain't all bad."" ",唔使我多講，佢嗰年嘅確好艱難 
"For years, I watched my mother take the time at recess to review, go on home visits in the afternoon, buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat, and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good. ",有啲人覺得人際關係叻唔叻係天生嘅 
"See, it's hard to teach kids who stink. ",但我會認同話史提芬 ‧ 哥威嘅講法 
(Laughter) And kids can be cruel. ,佢話，你只係需要做幾件事 例如，嘗試主動了解他人 而唔係要求人哋去了解你 
"And so she kept those things in her desk, and years later, after she retired, I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her, ""You know, Ms. Walker, you made a difference in my life. ",你有冇諗過其實你可以做 好似道歉咁嘅簡單嘅事？ 
You made it work for me. ,同細路講對唔住，佢哋會好驚 
"You made me feel like I was somebody, when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't. ",（笑聲） 我有一堂數學堂教比例 
"And I want you to just see what I've become."" ",但我數學唔係咁好，而且嗰陣仲努力緊 
"And when my mama died two years ago at 92, there were so many former students at her funeral, it brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone, but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear. ",（笑聲） 於是我返去睇返我本教師版教科書 
Can we stand to have more relationships? ,我先發現成堂教嘅嘢都係錯嘅 
Will you like all your children? Of course not. ,（笑聲） 所以我第二日返去上堂嘅時候，我話︰ 「各位，我要同大家道歉。 
(Laughter) And you know your toughest kids are never absent. ,我上一堂教嘅嘢係錯嘅，真係對唔住。」 
(Laughter) Never. ,佢哋話：「唔緊要，老師。 
"You won't like them all, and the tough ones show up for a reason. ",你教得好投入，我哋會原諒你。」 （笑聲、掌聲） 
It's the connection. It's the relationships. ,我教過好差嘅班 佢哋嘅成續好差，我當時仲喊咗 
"So teachers become great actors and great actresses, and we come to work when we don't feel like it, and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense, and we teach anyway. ",我諗，我點可以喺九個月之內 將哩一班學生提升到需要達到嘅水平？ 
"We teach anyway, because that's what we do. ",真係一件好難嘅事，真係好難 
Teaching and learning should bring joy. ,我點樣可以提高 一個小朋友嘅自信嘅同時 又提高佢嘅成績呢？ 
"How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion? ",有一年我諗咗個好計仔 
"Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be. ",我同所有學生講︰ 「你之所以被選中嚟到我哩班 係因為我係最好嘅老師， 你係最好嘅學生。 學校將我哋擺埋一齊， 叫我哋做其他人嘅榜樣。」 
Is this job tough? You betcha. ,有個學生問：「真係？」 
But it is not impossible. ,（笑聲） 我話：「係，我哋要證明畀其他班睇。 為咗唔好畀人哋留意我哋， 我哋行出門口時， 
We can do this. We're educators. ,唔可以發出噪音，要唔望周圍行路。」 
We're born to make a difference. ,（笑聲） 我要佢哋講：「我得嘅， 
Thank you so much. ,我嚟哩度嘅時候已經好叻， 
(Applause) ,我離開嘅時候要比之前叻， 
,我又叻又堅強。 
"I'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me, she said, ""Geoff, you watch the TED Talks."" ",我值得喺度接受教育， 
"I said, ""Yes, honey, I love TED Talks."" ",我要做到成績出嚟， 我要令人刮目相看， 要天高任我行。」 
"She said, ""You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- "" I said, ""I know, I know."" (Laughter) She said, ""They don't want, like, the angry black man."" ",佢哋全部大嗌「好耶！」 
"(Laughter) So I said, ""No, I'm gonna be good, Honey, I'm gonna be good. I am."" ",（笑聲） 如果你講得多上面嘅嘢 你自自然然就會做到當中嘅嘢 
"But I am angry. (Laughter) And the last time I looked, I'm -- (Applause) So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry. ",（掌聲） 有一次我出小測，一共有廿題 
"This year, there are going to be millions of our children that we're going to needlessly lose, that we could -- right now, we could save them all. ",有個學生答錯十八題 
You saw the quality of the educators who were here. ,我寫咗「+2」喺佢份卷上面 仲畫咗個笑面公仔 
Do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them. I know they could. ,（笑聲） 佢問：「老師， 咁我係咪即係攞 F？」 
It is absolutely possible. ,我話：「係。」（笑聲） 
Why haven't we fixed this? ,佢又問：「咁點解 你要畫個笑嘅公仔？」 
"Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don't care how many millions of young people fail, we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work, and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? -- enough to say, ""Enough is enough."" ",我話：「因為你有進步， 
So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense. ,你答啱咗兩題，你無全部錯曬。」 
"You know, I grew up in the inner city, and there were kids who were failing in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school, and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later. ",（笑聲） 我話：「如果我哋再溫返哩一部分， 你會唔會做得再好啲？」 
And you know something about a lousy school? ,佢話：「會，老師， 我可以做得好啲。」 
It's not like a bottle of wine. ,你睇，如果我寫「-18」 會令人失去衝勁 
"Right? (Laughter) Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right? ",但係「+2」會令人感覺唔係最差 （笑聲、掌聲） 
"That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year, it's still the same approach, right? ",咁多年嚟我睇見我媽媽 小息時間都同學生溫習 下晝就去做家訪 佢亦會買梳、刷、花生醬同餅乾 放喺櫃桶畀細路食同用 亦會準備面巾同番梘畀有體臭嘅學生 
"One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't, tough luck. Just tough luck. ",你知啦，有陣味好難教㗎嘛 
Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen? ,（笑聲） 而且細路可以好曳 
Do not tell me we can't do better than this. ,所以佢將哩啲嘢收埋喺櫃桶度 好多年之後，當佢退咗休之後 我見到哩啲細路過嚟 同佢講：「你知唔知呀老師， 你改變咗我嘅人生， 
"Look, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years, and you say, ""So what's the plan?"" ",你令啲嘢變成啱我嘅。 
"And they say, ""We'll, we're going to do what we did last year this year."" ",就算我喺人生低谷 覺得自己唔得嘅時候， 你都令我覺得我係得嘅。 
What kind of business model is that? ,我希望你可以睇到今日我嘅成就。」 
Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3. ,當我媽媽兩年前以 92 歲高齡 過身嘅時候 好多學生嚟參加佢嘅喪體 我喊，唔係因為佢離開咗 而係因為佢留低嘅無形資產 佢同其他人建立嘅關係永遠唔會消失 
They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour. ,咁師生之間嘅關係 可唔可以強化？絕對可以 
"Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed. ",你會唔會鍾意你所有細路？梗係唔會 
They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks. ,（笑聲） 而且你知道你必定會生咗 個最難教嘅細教出嚟 
Who created that business model? Right? ,（笑聲） 所以唔會，你唔會個個都鐘意 
And it went on for decades. ,但係佢哋出生於哩個世界總有理由 
You know why? Because they didn't care. ,就係你哋之間嘅聯繫、關係 咁所以，一方面，小朋友唔知道 你唔鍾意佢哋全部 
It wasn't about the customers. ,另一方面，老師好似演技優秀演員咁樣 我哋返工，即使唔想做都好 即使教育政策幾咁荒謬都好 我哋都會繼續教 
It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them. ,我哋繼續教，因為哩件係我哋該做嘅事 
How could you go to the bank when you were at work? It didn't matter. ,教學應該係開心嘅事 
And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank. ,只要我哋教出嚟嘅學生 唔怕冒險、大膽思考 同埋老師默默鼓勵 哩個世界就會充滿力量 
They all operate the same way. Right? ,每個細路都應該受到鼓勵、讚賞 同埋有一個永遠唔會放棄佢 明白關係重要 同埋堅持佢哋要盡力做到最好嘅大人 
"Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea. ",哩件工作係咪好難？你話呢？ 
Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work. ,哩樣嘢唔係無可能 
They might like that. What about a Saturday? ,我哋可以做到，因為我哋係教育家 
What about introducing technology? ,我哋嘅職責就係要改變世界 
"Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit to you all I'm a little old. ",多謝 
"So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology, and when they first came out with those new contraptions, these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money, I was like, ""There's no way that machine is going to count that money right. ",（掌聲） 
"I am never using that, right?"" ",
So technology has changed. Things have changed. ,我有啲緊張 因為我老婆 Yvonne 同我講 「Geoff，你有睇 TED 嘅演講嘎。」 
Yet not in education. Why? ,我話︰「係啊，老婆， 我最鐘意 TED 演講嘅嘞。」 
"Why is it that when we had rotary phones, when we were having folks being crippled by polio, that we were teaching the same way then that we're doing right now? ",佢話︰「你知啦， 嗰啲人都係好叻好犀利嘎喔。」 我話︰「我知我知。」（現場爆笑） 佢話︰「噉佢哋唔會鐘意好似你噉嘅 嫐爆爆、發曬火嘅黑人嘅喔。」 
"And if you come up with a plan to change things, people consider you radical. ",（現場爆笑） 跟住我話︰「放心啦老婆， 我會喺台上表現得好好㗎啦。 信我，會好好㗎啦。」 
They will say the worst things about you. ,不過，我宜家的確好火。（現場爆笑） 對上一次我望自己，我都係… （鼓掌） 點解我又興奮又嬲呢？ 
"I said one day, well, look, if the science says -- this is science, not me -- that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime -- You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there. ",因為今年 我哋將會毫無必要噉 嘥咗幾百萬嘅學生 但係宜家，我哋可以救佢哋 
"You look at them in September, they've gone down. ",我哋嘅師資質素係點，你都有眼見㗎啦 
"You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75 when I was at the Ed School at Harvard. ",唔好同我講，佢哋無辦法幫到哩啲細路 我知佢哋可以嘅 
"I said, ""Oh, wow, this is an important study."" ",絕對可以 
Because it suggests we should do something. ,噉點解我哋仲未去解決哩個問題呢？ 
(Laughter) Every 10 years they reproduce the same study. ,嗰啲教育工作者一直以黎都墨守成規 佢哋根本唔在乎有幾多百萬嘅 青少年無得到良好教育 佢哋仲係一如既往噉做無用嘅嘢 但係從來都無人對佢哋發過火，係嘛？ 同佢哋講︰「夠嘞！ 噉樣嘅教育夠嘞！」 
It says exactly the same thing: Poor kids lose ground in the summertime. ,所以哩一種噉嘅教育模式係唔合理嘅 
The system decides you can't run schools in the summer. ,我喺城市內圍長大 56 年前，響我開始讀書嗰陣 就已經有好多細路讀唔成書 嗰陣啲學校教育好差 但係 56 年後嘅今日 哩啲學校一樣噉差 
"You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules? ",你知道差嘅學校係點樣嘅呢？ 
"For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School. ",佢唔同一支紅酒，紅酒越耐越好 
"They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had — but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense. ",（笑聲） 紅酒黎講，你會話 1987 年嗰年紅酒特別好，係嘛？ 
"I never got that. I never got that, because anyone knows if you farm, you don't plant crops in July and August. ",哩啲學校就係噉，噉多年黎 仲係用緊同樣嘅教學方法 
You plant them in the spring. ,就係千人一面 成綪好嘅恭喜你，否則，係你唔好彩 
So who came up with this idea? Who owns it? ,點解我哋無改革？ 
Why did we ever do it? ,唔好講我哋唔可以做得更好 
"Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have, schools were open all year. They were open all year, because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day. ",你去到哩啲 50 年黎 都教唔好學生嘅學校 然後問間學校︰ 「你哋嘅教學計劃係點嘎？」 
They didn't have any place for their kids to go. ,佢哋會答你︰ 「我哋嘅教學計劃同舊年一樣。」 
It was a perfect place to have schools. ,哩啲算係咩運作模式啊？ 
So this is not something that is ordained from the education gods. ,舊時，銀行朝早 10 點到晏晝 3 點營業 
So why don't we? Why don't we? ,朝早 10 點到晏晝 3 點 食晏時間仲關門添 
Because our business has refused to use science. ,噉邊個喺朝早 10 點 到晏晝 3 點哩段時間去銀行？ 
"Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying, ""Look, this works, right? We can do this."" ",咪無業遊民咯 但係佢哋都唔需要去銀行 因為佢哋都無錢 
How many places in America are going to change? None. ,究竟係邊個創造噉嘅運作模式嘎？ 
"None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right? ",但係佢都運作咗幾十年喎 
"Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing. ",你知點解嘛？因為佢哋唔在乎 
"As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear. ",佢哋眼中冇顧客 
Here's what we know. ,眼中只有銀行家 佢哋淨係為自己著想就得嘞 
"Right? This idea, zero to three. ",你要開工點去銀行？ 佢哋無所謂 
"My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids, three grown ones and a 15-year-old. ",佢哋都唔在乎我 係咪因為去唔到銀行而發火 你可以去第二間銀行嘎 
That's a longer story. ,眼見所有銀行嘅上班時間都係一樣 
"(Laughter) With our first kids, we did not know the science about brain development. ",有一日，有個銀行家忽發奇想 
We didn't know how critical those first three years were. ,可能我哋應該喺啲人 唔使返工嗰日都營業 
We didn't know what was happening in those young brains. ,啲人可能鐘意呢。就例如，星期六噉？ 
"We didn't know the role that language, a stimulus and response, call and response, how important that was in developing those children. ",又例如引進新科技？ 
We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing. ,你知啦，我係技術迷 雖然我承認我係老咗啲 
Wealthy people know. Educated people know. ,以前我係有啲落後，同埋唔多信科技 所以當佢哋推出嗰啲新嘢嘅時候 嗰啲叫你放張銀行卡入去 就會有錢出黎嘅櫃員機 我就諗︰「部機邊識數錢啊？ 
And their kids have an advantage. ,我絕對唔會用嘅。」 
"Poor people don't know, and we're not doing anything to help them at all. ",睇返轉頭，科技喺度變，人事都喺度變 
But we know this is critical. ,但係教育無變過。點解？ 
"Now, you take pre-kindergarten. ",點解當我哋已經唔再用 撥動式電話嘅時候 當我哋唔再有人因為 脊髓灰質炎而殘廢嘅時候 嗰陣嘅教育方法 卻係咁多年黎冇變過嘅呢？ 
Poor kids need that experience. ,如果你宜家提出一個改革計劃 人哋會話你激進 
"Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist. ",佢哋會講你好多壞話 
We know health services matter. ,但係我話如果科學指出 我哋最差嘅細路 會喺暑假期間已經跟唔上 你六月見到佢哋 或者會覺得佢哋成績仲可以 
"You know, we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about, you know, because I'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff, but we do health services, and I have to raise a lot of money. ",但係你九月份再睇 佢哋嘅成績就會一落千丈 
"People used to say when they'd come fund us, ""Geoff, why do you provide these health services?"" ",你會話，吓！ 但哩樣嘢我 1975 年已經知道 當時我仲喺哈佛教育學院讀緊書 
I used to make stuff up. Right? ,當時我話︰ 「哇，哩個係一個 好重要嘅研究發現。」 
"I'd say, ""Well, you know a child who has cavities is not going to, uh, be able to study as well."" ",因為佢提示咗我哋需要做啲嘢 
And I had to because I had to raise the money. ,（笑聲） 每過十年佢哋都得出同樣嘅研究發現 
"But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them? ",就係︰成績差嘅學生喺暑假已經跟唔上 
You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts? ,哩種制度限制咗你 唔可以叫學生喺暑假返學 
Because I actually like kids. ,我一直都響度諗 究竟係邊個制定哩啲規矩嘅呢？ 
"I actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause) But when they really get pushy, people really get pushy, I say, ""I do it because you do it for your kid."" ",我響哈佛畢業 噉多年黎，我以為我知道好多嘢 
"And you've never read a study from MIT that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better, but you will give that kid dance instruction, and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction, and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids have the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children. ",佢哋話，係因為跟農業耕作嘅日子 但係等我話你知點解噉樣講唔過去 
(Applause) So here's the other thing. ,我從來都唔信係噉 因為眾所皆知，如果你從事耕作業 你唔會起七月同八月插秧 
"I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information, because you work at something, you think it's working, and you find out it's not working. ",而係起春天插秧 
"I mean, you're educators. You work, you say, you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it. ",所以，係邊個嘅主意呢？ 
But here's the problem with testing. ,邊個提出嘅呢？ 點解我哋會噉做呢？ 
The testing that we do -- we're going to have our test in New York next week — is in April. ,其實起十九世紀四十年代 當時嘅學校係全年開放嘅，係全年 因為嗰陣好多人每日要工作好多個小時 
You know when we're going to get the results back? ,令到佢哋嘅細路無地方安置 
"Maybe July, maybe June. ",學校於是成為咗一個好好嘅選擇嘞 
And the results have great data. ,所以哩個唔係由個天決定嘅 
"They'll tell you Raheem really struggled, couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data, but you're getting it back after school is over. ",噉點解我哋唔掌握自主權呢？ 
"And so, what do you do? ",因為我哋教育界拒絕科學 
You go on vacation. (Laughter) You come back from vacation. ,雖然比爾蓋茨企出黎講︰ 「噉做係得嘅，所以我哋可以做。」 
Now you've got all of this test data from last year. ,但美國有幾多個地方會做？一個都無 
You don't look at it. ,一個都無。噢係喔，仲有兩個 
Why would you look at it? ,總會有一啲地方，有啲人會做正確嘅事 
You're going to go and teach this year. ,但整體嚟講，作為專業人士 我哋要阻止哩種一成不變 
So how much money did we just spend on all of that? ,科學已經講得好透 而我哋所知嘅就係，問題經已發生 
Billions and billions of dollars for data that it's too late to use. ,係嘛？哩個諗法喺我哋屋企三比零通過 
I need that data in September. ,我老婆同我有四個細路 三個已經長大成人，一個 15 歲 
I need that data in November. ,關於我哋嘅事，講就有排講嘞 
"I need to know you're struggling, and I need to know whether or not what I did corrected that. ",（笑聲） 開始有第一個細路嘅時候 我哋仲未知大腦發育嘅科學 
I need to know that this week. ,我哋當時仲未知嬰兒頭三年有幾緊要 
I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late. ,亦唔知佢哋嘅大腦係點樣一步步發育 
"Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant. ",亦唔知語言、刺激、反應、對答 對於兒童嘅發育係有幾重要 
I can predict school scores. ,當然宜家我哋人人都知道嘞 但我哋點做呢？我哋乜都無做 
You take me to any school. ,有錢人知道，受過教育嘅人都知道 
I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling. ,所以佢哋嘅細路會贏在起跑線 
And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids were on grade level. ,而窮人唔知 我哋亦無做任何嘢去幫佢哋 
"And I say, ""Okay, what's the plan, what did we do from last year to this year?"" ",但係我哋都知哩樣係好重要 
"You say, ""We're doing the same thing."" ",就好似宜家有學前班 我哋知道對細路有益 
"I'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter) This year, somewhere between 44 and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level. ",同樣窮人嘅細路亦需要學前班 
And I will be right every single time. ,但係好多地方偏係冇學前班 
"So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what? ",我哋知道公共醫療服務不可忽視 
Teachers need real information right now about what's happening to their kids. ,你知啦，我哋提供公共醫療服務㗎嘛 好多人會向我抱怨 因為啲人會向我負責 同埋因為我會處理資料 但係做醫療行業嘅 我哋需要籌集好多資金 
"The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it. ",好多人黎資助我哋嘅時候，會同我講︰ 「Geoff，點解你要提供哩啲服務啊？」 
So here's the other issue that I just think we've got to be concerned about. ,我成日都亂作一通 
We can't stifle innovation in our business. ,所以我話︰「你知啦， 一個細路有蛀牙嘅話， 讀書就讀唔好啦嘛。」 
We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation. ,嗰陣時我亂作係因為我要籌款 
They get angry if you do something different. ,但係宜家我老啦，你知我點答佢哋嘛？ 
"If you try something new, people are always like, ""Ooh, charter schools."" Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see. ",點解我要提供醫療服務 體育、娛樂同藝術畀嗰啲細路？ 
This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years. ,因為我鐘意細路仔（笑聲） 
Let's try something different. And here's the rub. ,我真係好鐘意細路嘎 （笑聲） （掌聲） 但係當啲人係都要我畀一個原因嘅時候 我就會話︰「我噉做係因為你 都會為你嘅細路噉做。」 
Some of it's not going to work. ,你從來唔會起麻省理工嘅研究報告睇到 畀你嘅細路學跳舞會幫到佢哋學代數 不過你都會畀佢哋學跳舞 同埋你睇到佢哋想學，你會好興奮 噉點解窮人嘅細路 唔可以有同樣嘅機會呢？ 噉樣係好基本嘅要求黎啫 
"You know, people tell me, ""Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."" ",（掌聲） 另外一樣嘢就係 
A lot of them don't. They should be closed. ,我係一個鍾意測驗嘅人 而學生需要成績報告 老師做一件事嘅時候，認為可行 但最後發現行唔通… 
"I mean, I really believe they should be closed. ",我嘅意思係，你係一個教師 你工作，你教書 你認為你識得曬所有嘢 
But we can't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything. ,但係你發現學生唔明白 但測驗有個問題 
Right? Because that's not the way the world works. ,我哋做嘅考試… 下星期，即係四月份嗰陣 我哋會起紐約舉行考試 
"If you think about technology, imagine if that's how we thought about technology. ",但你知我哋會起幾時知道考試結果？ 
"Every time something didn't work, we just threw in the towel and said, ""Let's forget it."" Right? ",可能七月份，亦都可能係六月份 
"You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot. ",考試嘅結果將會包含好多資料 
"They told me, ""Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot you'll never need another thing."" ",啲資料可能會表明學生 阿 Raheem 嘅成績唔多理想 唔識做兩位數嘅乘法，總之好多資料 但係你得到資料嘅時候學校已經放假嘞 
That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over. ,噉你點做呢？ 
I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing. ,你放假囉。（笑聲） 好嘞，到你放假返黎嘅時候 
Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul. ,舊年嘅測驗資料你都有齊嘞 
The folks went out there. They kept inventing. ,但係你唔會去睇佢 
"The fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you from pushing the science forward. ",點解呢？ 
"Our job as educators, there's some stuff we know that we can do. ",因為你今年你有新嘅課程要上 
"And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier, we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people. ",噉樣我哋咪浪費咗好多錢 起哩啲測驗上邊！ 
We've got to give them all of these opportunities. ,幾十億美金就為咗 哩啲太遲出而無用嘅資料 
"So that we have to do. But this innovation issue, this idea that we've got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical. ",我九月份需要哩啲學習進度報告 
"And this is something, by the way, that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field. ",我十一月份需要哩啲學習進度報告 
America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right. ,我需要知道你跟唔跟得上 我而且需要知道 我做嘅嘢幫唔幫到你學習 
We have run out of time. ,我就係需要起某個禮拜就知道 
"I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second, and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can't afford this — So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars. ",因為到年尾已經太遲啦 
What is five billion dollars to the United States? ,噉因為我宜家做得耐咗 洞察力都比以前好 
What did we spend in Afghanistan this year? ,我可以預測學校嘅成績 
"How many trillions? (Applause) When the country cares about something, we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye. ",你帶我去任何一間學校 
"When the safety of America is threatened, we will spend any amount of money. ",我對嗰啲內城資質比較差 但努力緊嘅學校特別在行 
The real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about. ,你同我講舊年 48% 嘅學生 會達到年級水準 
"I dare say it's a pittance, what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems. ",噉我就問︰「好， 噉你哋嘅計劃係點呢？ 舊年到宜家你哋做咗啲乜嘢呢？」 
"So once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter) So, you guys, help me get there. ",你話，「我哋都係做緊同樣嘅嘢。」 
Thank you all very much. Thank you. ,噉我都可以預測嘞。（笑聲） 今年，44% 到 52% 嘅學生 會達到年級水準 
(Applause) John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone? ,而每一次我嘅預測都係準 
"Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John, 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school. ",我哋用咗咁多錢起教育上 我哋得到咗乜嘢呢？ 
A hundred percent of them went to college. ,宜家老師需要切切實實嘅資訊 去知道佢哋學生嘅情況 
This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school. ,關鍵就起今日，因為你可以做返啲嘢 
Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college. ,另外一個我覺得我哋 應該關心嘅問題就係︰ 
We'd better get that other seven percent. ,我哋唔可以扼殺創新 
So that's just how this goes. (Applause) JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school? ,我哋必須創新 但係當你噉做嘅時候好多人會唔鍾意 
"GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids, the same kids, these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school, they drop out in record numbers. ",你唔跟大隊，佢哋就嬲 
And so we've figured out that you've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does. ,當你想嘗試新嘢嘅時候 啲人就會話︰「哇。特許學校喔！」 我話，喂，我哋試下啦，睇下會點 
"They harass you, right? They call you, they say, ""I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test? ",但宜家哩種教育模式 已經錯咗 55 年嘞 
What are you talking about that you want to leave school? ,我哋試下第二種啦 
"And you're not coming back here."" ",但難就難在當中有啲新措施又唔得喎 
So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem because Geoff is looking for you. ,有人同我講︰「嗰啲特許學校 好多都唔掂。」 
"They're like, ""I really can't come back."" No. You'd better stay in school. ",的確係，而且唔應該再繼續落去 
"But I'm not kidding about some of this, and it gets a little bit to the grit issue. ",我真係覺得哩啲學校應該執咗去 
"When kids know that you refuse to let them fail, it puts a different pressure on them, and they don't give up as easy. ",但係我哋唔應該因為一啲失敗例子 而唔採取改革行動 
"So sometimes they don't have it inside, and they're, like, ""You know, I don't want to do this, but I know my mother's going to be mad."" ",係嘛？因為噉係唔符合做事手法 
"Well, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through. ",就好似技術噉 想像下如果我哋噉樣對待新技術 
"We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support, but also a set of encouragements that say to them, ""You can do it. It is going to be hard, but we refuse to let you fail."" ",每一次新科技失敗 我哋就認輸，「算啦。」噉啱唔啱呢？ 
"JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada. ",你知嘛，有人說服咗我—— 相信你哋好多人都有同樣嘅經歷 就係最新最勁嘅掌上型電腦 
Please give it up for him one more time. ,佢哋同我講︰ 「Geoff，你有咗呢部嘢， 你就唔再需要其他嘢嘞。」 
(Applause) ,但係三個禮拜之後哩部嘢就彎咗嘞 
,我好後悔浪費咗噉多錢買哩部嘢 
"When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching. ",但係啲人就會停止發明咩？ 唔會。無一個人會 
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. ,佢哋仲係繼續發明新嘅嘢 
"And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests. ",每個人都有失敗 但失敗唔應該阻止你向前嘅 
I gave out homework assignments. ,我哋作為教育工作者 有啲嘢我哋知道我哋係可以做到嘅 
"When the work came back, I calculated grades. ",同埋我哋應該做得更好 細路嘅評估我哋要早啲去做 我哋要確保提供足夠嘅支援畀年輕人 
What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. ,我哋要盡可能畀佢哋機會 
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. ,我哋必須噉樣做。但係哩個關乎創新 我哋必須一直創新 直到我哋搵到最好嘅教育方法 哩個係至關重要嘅 
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. ,亦都會係我哋教育領域嘅一個重大挑戰 
And that got me thinking. ,我哋美國唔可以再等上 50 年再黎改革嘞 
"The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram. ",我哋已經無時間嘞 
"But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. ",我唔知有無財政危機 不過我知道有教育危機 而且哩一刻我哋正面對緊教育危機 但如果我哋繼續任由啲政客胡說八道 話我哋負擔唔起噉嘅改革 比爾蓋茨話教育改革要用五十億美元 
"After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. ",五十億對於美國黎講係咩概念？ 
"In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. ",今年起阿富汗我哋用咗幾多錢嘞？ 
But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? ,幾多萬億？（掌聲） 當一個國家重視一樣嘢嘅時候 即使用一萬億都唔會眨眼 
"So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. ",當美國嘅安全受到威脅嘅時候 我哋使幾多錢都冇所謂 
"I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? ",但要令到國家真正有保障 我哋必須盡力培育下一代 令佢哋將來有能力有魄力 去接掌我哋嘅位置 響思考力，科技同民主等 哩啲我哋重視嘅領域裏面引領世界 
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. ,我敢講解決哩啲問題 所需要去做嘅並唔多 
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. ,當我哋解決種種情況 我就唔會再嬲（笑聲） 所以，請你哋一齊幫下手 
We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. ,多謝。好多謝你哋 
"We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students? ",（掌聲） 主持︰喺 Harlem 兒童區入面 中學生嘅輟學率係幾多呢？ 
"We partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs? ",講者︰你知啦，主持 舊年喺我學校嘅高中畢業嘅學生 係百分百嘅 
And who's going to earn the most money? ,佢哋亦都全部人升咗上大學 
"In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. ",今年嘅高中學生亦都係百分百畢業 
And it wasn't social intelligence. ,聽講當中有 93% 俾大學錄取 
"It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. ",另外 7% 我哋仲要努力 
It was grit. ,目前情況就係噉嘞（掌聲） 主持︰噉佢哋離開咗學校之後 你點樣繼續跟進呢？ 
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. ,講者︰你知啦 我哋國家一個好嚴重嘅問題 就係哩啲細路啦嘛。哩啲細路 哩啲脆弱嘅細路，即使你逼佢哋返學 好多都會輟學嘅 
Grit is having stamina. ,所以我哋明白到必須提供 一系列嘅支援畀佢哋 就好似一個負責任嘅家長噉 
"Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. ",你要去煩住佢哋，同佢哋講 「我想睇下你啲成績喔。 上次個測驗你做成點啊？ 
"Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. ",你話咩話？你想輟學？ 
"A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. ",你唔想返去讀書嗱？」 
"I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. ",所以好多我嘅學生都知道你輟學 你就唔可以返去 Harlem 因為 Geoff 會搵你 
"Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school. ",佢哋會話︰「我真係唔想再返學。」 
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. ,唔得，你要留返喺學校 我唔係講笑嘎 哩樣嘢同毅力有些少關係 
"It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. ",當一個細路知道你唔畀佢哋失敗嘅時候 無形中畀咗佢哋一啲壓力 噉佢哋就唔會咁輕易放棄 
"To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it. ",有時候雖然佢哋無噉嘅勇氣同毅力 但佢哋會話︰ 「我知我啊媽知道我 唔繼續讀書會好嬲。」 
"Every day, parents and teachers ask me, ""How do I build grit in kids? ",哩樣對細路黎講係好重要嘅 同埋會幫到佢哋堅持落去 
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic? ,我哋努力創造一系列方法幫佢哋補習 畀佢哋支援，同埋我哋會一直鼓勵佢哋 我哋會話畀佢哋聽︰ 「你可以做到嘅。雖然係好困難， 但係我哋唔會畀你唔合格。」 
"How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"" ",主持︰好嘅，多謝你 Canada 博士 
"The honest answer is, I don't know. ",請大家再次畀啲掌聲！ 
(Laughter) What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. ,（鼓掌） 
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. ,
"In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. ",當我 27 歲嘅時候 我離開咗要求好高嘅管理顧問工作崗位 轉去做一份要求更高嘅工作：教書 
"So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called ""growth mindset."" ",我去咗紐約市嘅公立學校 教七年級學生數學 
"This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. ",同任何老師一樣，我會出測驗同考試卷 
"Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. ",我會畀功課同作業 
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. ,當作業返嚟嘅時候，我就會計分 
But we need more. ,我發現智商並非唯一一個能分辨出 我最好同最差嘅學生 
"And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are. ",我其中一啲成績最好嘅學生 並唔係智商爆膨 
That's the work that stands before us. ,同樣，我一啲最聰明嘅學生 反而唔係做得咁好 
"We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. ",呢樣令我反思七年級數學科的確係難嘅 
"We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. ",好似要學︰比例、小數點 平行四邊形嘅面積等 
"In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. ",但係要學識呢啲概念唔係冇可能 我相信我每個學生只要付出時間同努力 就能夠學識科目嘅內容 
Thank you. ,教多幾年書之後 我得出嘅結論係我哋嘅教育 需要更加了解學生 同埋從學習動機同心理角度考慮事情 
(Applause) ,喺教育系統之中 我哋最識得量度嘅就係智商 
,但係如果學習能力並唔係最能夠決定 一個人喺學校同人生中嘅成就？ 
"So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s. ",所以我離開咗課室 我去咗研究生院讀書，出嚟做心理學家 
"When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. ",我開始觀察喺唔同困難情況下 嘅孩子同成年人 而喺每次嘅觀察過程中我問嘅問題係 呢度邊個係成功，同點解？ 
"But my tiger mother said, ""No."" ",我同我嘅研究隊伍去咗西點軍校 
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. ,我哋嘗試預測邊位受訓者 會留得喺軍隊裏面 同埋邊位會退出 
"After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job. ",我哋去咗全國串字比賽 喺嗰度嘗試推測邊個小朋友會晉級 
It is not important if I like the job or not. ,我觀察咗喺比較多問題嘅社區 任教嘅新老師 問下嗰啲老師學期尾 會唔會仍然喺度工作 而留得低嘅教師裡邊 邊個能夠最有效提高學生嘅學習成果？ 
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer. ,我哋同私人公司合作 問下公司入面邊個推銷人員仲做緊？ 
That is me playing my imaginary piano. ,邊個會賺最多佣？ 
"An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school. ",睇返唔同人嘅情況下 我哋搵到一樣嘢嚟預測一個人嘅成功 
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. ,佢唔係人際關係 
But no adults liked the idea. ,唔係外貌、健康、智商 
No adults believed I was serious. ,而係意志 
"Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as powerless as I was. ",意志係熱情加恆心 
"So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained. ",意志等如耐力 
My dream would never come true. ,意志就係日日跟隨自己嘅未來路向發展 唔係講緊一個禮拜或者一個月 而係經過好多年嘅無數努力 去將心中嘅未來變成現實 
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for. ,意志好似跑馬拉松一樣，長時間陪住你 
But that's so unfair. ,幾年前，我開始 喺芝加哥公立學校研究意志 
So I was determined to find another calling. ,我請咗幾千個初中生做問卷調查 然後等咗多過一年，睇下邊個會畢到業 
Nobody around to teach me? Fine. ,結果顯示有多啲意志嘅學生 畢業可能都高好多 重要係講緊我攞差唔多背景嘅學生比較 例如家庭收入、標準化成就測驗嘅分數 同埋學生喺學校覺得係咪安全 
I turned to books. ,所以，意志唔單只喺西點 或者全國串字比賽之中重要 
"I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.[""Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei""] I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.[""Jane Eyre""] And I learned to be efficient from this book.[""Cheaper by the Dozen""] And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these. ",佢亦喺學校裡邊都好重要 尤其對於有輟學可能嘅學生更加重要 
"[""Complete Works of Sanmao"" (aka Echo Chan)] [""Lessons From History"" by Nan Huaijin] I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first? ",對我嚟講，最震驚嘅係 原來我哋對意志嘅認知係咁細 科學亦唔係好了解佢 無人知道點樣培養佢 
"Books banned in China, of course. ",每日，家長同老師會問我 「我點樣可以 喺小朋友身上培養意志呢？ 
The Good Earth is about Chinese peasant life. ,我點樣做至能夠教識孩子做事嘅恆心？ 
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. ,我點樣做可以令佢哋 毅力地堅持到底？」 
"The Bible is interesting, but strange. ",講真，我唔知道。（笑聲） 
(Laughter) That's a topic for a different day. ,我剩係知道才幹唔會令你有意志 
"But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: ""You shall honor your father and mother."" ",我嘅數據顯示得好清楚 有好多才能十足嘅人 根本就冇做到訂落嘅目標 
"Honor, I said. ""That's so different, and better, than obey."" ",其實，喺我哋嘅數據裡面 意志通常係同才能 完全冇關甚至負相關 
So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. ,到目前為止 我聽過喺小朋友當中 培養意志嘅最好提議 就係一樣叫做「成長心態」嘅理念 
Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. ,呢個理念係由史丹福大學嘅 Carol Dweck 提出 就係話，學習能力並非固定嘅 係可以隨著你嘅努力而改變 
It offers many insights. ,佢又指，當小朋友讀到 腦部點樣因應挑戰而變化同成熟嘅時候 佢哋會更加喺失敗嘅時候堅持 因為佢哋唔相信失敗係永久嘅 
"For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. ",所以成長心態係一個培養意志嘅好方法 
"It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. ",但我哋需要更多 
A map actually carries somebody's view. ,我亦都喺呢度總結我嘅說話 因為我哋而家就係停留喺呢一步 
Comparative reading actually is nothing new. ,我哋要做嘅工作就喺我哋眼前 
It's a standard practice in the academic world. ,我哋需要將我哋最好嘅諗法 最強烈嘅直覺攞去測試 
There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. ,我哋大家都要評估我哋自己有冇成功過 我哋都要唔避忌失敗、犯錯 而且要從錯誤中學習 
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. ,換句話講，我哋需要意志 令我哋嘅孩子更加有意志 
"So I thought, well, if comparative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life too? ",多謝 
So I started reading books in pairs. ,（鼓掌） 
"So they can be about people -- [""Benjamin Franklin"" by Walter Isaacson][""John Adams"" by David McCullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences. ",
"[""Personal History"" by Katharine Graham][""The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,"" by Alice Schroeder] I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter) [Holy Bible: King James Version][""Lamb"" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.[""The Power of Myth"" by Joseph Campbell] For example, both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. ",七十年代，我曾經喺中國湖南省 接受咗兩年嘅體操運動員訓練 
"For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual. ",到小學一年級嘅時候 當地政府想將我轉去一間體育學校就讀 全部公數 
"For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. ",但係我嘅虎媽唔肯 
"So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages. ",我爸爸媽媽都希望我 可以好似佢哋咁做工程師 
"[""The Way of Chuang Tzu"" Thomas Merton][""Tao: The Watercourse Way"" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain. ",佢哋經歷過文化大革命 於是堅定認為 要得到幸福只有一個途徑 就係搵到一份又穩定又高收入嘅工作 
"For example, it's through translation that I realized ""happiness"" in Chinese literally means ""fast joy."" Huh! ",佢哋覺得我鍾唔鍾意份工根本唔重要 
"Bride in Chinese literally means ""new mother."" Uh-oh. ",但係我當時嘅夢想係成為中國歌劇家 
(Laughter) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. ,哩幅相係我想像緊彈緊鋼琴 
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. ,一個歌劇家要從細細個開始訓練 學體操技巧 我千方百計令自己入到歌劇學校 
Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. ,甚至乎我寫信畀校長 同埋一個電台節目主持人 
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. ,但係，無一個大人接受我嘅諗法 
"Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from. ",無人相信我係認真嘅 
Even a shattered dream can do that for you. ,只有我嘅朋友支持我 但係佢哋始終都係細路 都係無話事權嘅 
"So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time. ",等到我 15 歲 我知道我年紀太大，唔再適合訓練 
So may books be always with you. ,而我嘅夢想永遠都唔會成真 
Thank you. ,當時我驚喺我嘅餘生裡面 我只能夠爭取唔係我最想要嘅幸福 
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ,一切一切，實在太唔公平喇！ 
,於是乎，我決定再為自己確立一個夢想 
Everything is interconnected. ,身邊無人可以教我？ 
"As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this. ",無問題，我自己喺書本度學 
We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. ,我喺《傅雷家書》搵到 我想要嘅父母意見 哩本書收錄身為作家嘅父母 同身為音樂家嘅兒子之間來往嘅信件 喺《簡愛》裏面 我搵到獨立自強嘅女性模範 而唔係孔子儒家所要求嘅三從四德 由《兒女一籮筐》哩本書 我學識點樣提高工作效率 讀咗哩兩本書之後，我立志出國讀書 ︰ 
"When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day. ",[ 三毛《三毛流浪記》、 南懷瑾《歷史的經驗》] 1995 年，我嚟到美國 我諗喺度我應該讀咩書先？ 
There were no clouds in the sky. ,答案肯定係中國嘅禁書啦 
And after a while I began to perspire. ,《大地》講嘅係中國農民嘅故事 
"And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, ""Look, do you see that? ",所以不利於中國政府嘅思想教育 
That's part of you up there. ,聖經幾有趣，但係始終有啲奇怪 
"That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals."" ",（笑聲） 我哋可以擇日再講聖經 
"In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, ""Mom, you should do that."" ",但係十誡嘅第五誡令我明白到一點： 「 你應該以你嘅父母為榮。 」 
"And so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do. ",我當時諗「為榮」同「順從」好唔同 「為榮」要比「順從」仲好 
"These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere. ",哩本書幫我走出儒家道德嘅規條 亦都幫我同父母之間建立新關係 
"They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them. ",美國嘅新文化亦都令我養成 比較閱讀嘅習慣 
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience. ,比較閱讀令我睇到好多 
"There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles. ",例如，當我第一次見到哩幅地圖 就覺得唔順眼 因為哩幅係中國學生 由細睇到大嘅世界地圖 
"And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues. ",我從來都無睇過呢幅地圖 中國唔一定要喺世界嘅中心 
I've learned to respect the lightning. ,地圖往往反映主觀嘅睇法 
My hair used to be straight. ,事實上，比較閱讀並唔係乜嘢新鮮 
(Laughter) I'm just kidding. ,學術世界裡面，比較閱讀係家常便飯 
"(Laughter) What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds. ",甚至已經自成一個研究領域 例如比較宗教、比較文學 
They become lovely monsters. ,比較同對比可以令學者 對某個話題有更全面嘅理解 
"When I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson. ",所以我諗，既然比較閱讀對研究有用 點解唔可以用喺日常生活度？ 
"As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet. ",所以我每次睇書 都會擺第二本書做比較 
All my relations. Thank you. ,哩啲書可以係有關人物 [ 沃爾特 · 以撒森《本傑明 · 佛蘭克林》、 大衛 · 麥考夫《約翰 · 亞當》] 而哩啲人物都經歷過同樣嘅事件 或者做過朋友，共過患難 
(Applause) ,[ 凱薩琳 · 格雷厄姆《個人歷史》、 愛麗絲 · 施羅德《滾雪球：巴菲特自傳》] 我亦都會比較相同情節 但唔同敍事手法嘅文學作品（笑聲） [ 金 · 詹姆斯版本《聖經》、 克里斯多夫 · 摩爾《羔羊》] 又或者嚟自唔同文化但相似內容嘅故事 就好似約瑟夫 · 坎貝爾 喺佢嗰本書《神話嘅力量》中提到 例如，耶穌同佛陀 兩個人都曾經遇到過三種誘惑 
,對耶穌嚟講，誘惑都係 經濟、政治、精神上嘅 
So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic? ,對於佛陀嚟講，誘惑都係心理嘅： 情慾、恐懼、社會責任 ——都幾有趣 
"We will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters, or quads, for short. ",所以如果你識得一門外語 咁將原文同譯文一齊讀都極有意思 
Quads have been around for a long time. ,[ 湯瑪斯 · 梅頓翻譯嘅《莊子》、 艾倫 · 華特斯譯嘅《道德經》] 有人覺得翻譯會令文字嘅意藴損失 但我反而覺得有收穫 
They're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple. ,例如，通過翻譯 我意識到中文嘅 「 快樂 」 字面上可以理解成 「短暫嘅愉悅」。嗯！ 
"By controlling the speeds of these four propellers, these machines can roll, pitch, yaw, and accelerate along their common orientation. ",中文「新娘」字面上解 「新嘅媽媽」。哦！ 
"On board are also a battery, a computer, various sensors and wireless radios. ",（笑聲） 書本係我哋同古人、現代人 溝通聯繫嘅一個神奇通道 
"Quads are extremely agile, but this agility comes at a cost. ",我知道我唔應該再覺得寂寞或者弱小 
"They are inherently unstable, and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly. ",相較於其他人經歷過嘅嘢 一個夢想破碎其實都唔係啲乜 
"So, how did it just do that? ",我開始相信夢想並唔剩係用嚟實現 
Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system. ,佢最重要嘅一個意義就係 可以畀我哋嚟到夢想來源嘅地方 熱情嘅源頭、同快樂嘅根源 
It's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them. ,就算一個已經破碎嘅夢想 都可以有咁嘅意義 
"This data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms, which in turn sends commands to the quad, which is also running estimation and control algorithms. ",因為書本 我今日大部分時間先可以開心咁生活 我嘅生命先可以有返目標同埋變得清晰 
The bulk of our research is algorithms. ,但願書籍永遠陪伴著你 
It's the magic that brings these machines to life. ,多謝 
So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete? ,（掌聲） 多謝 （掌聲） 多謝 （掌聲） 
We use something broadly called model-based design. ,
We first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave. ,所有嘢都係有關係嘅 
We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them. ,作為一個辛納科克印度人 我從小就知道呢一點 
"For example, that's how we can make the quad hover. ",我哋喺一個細嘅釣魚部落 就近紐約南安普敦、長島嘅東南部 
We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations. ,我細嘅時候 我爺爺會喺夏天帶我坐喺太陽之下 
We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad. ,天空完全冇雲 
Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach. ,過咗一段時間，我開始流汗 
Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole. ,我爺爺就向天指著話： 「你睇下，見唔見到嗰個啊？ 
"With a little bit of practice, it's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this, although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands. ",嗰個就係你嘅一部分。 
It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands. ,嗰嚿就係由你汗水形成嘅雲， 將來化成雨來灌溉植物，同養動物。」 
"Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top, which means that it can be located in the space. ",之後我繼續探索大自然裏面 「生命互連」嘅事物 我個女同我講： 「媽媽，妳應該去追風」 所以 2008 年，我就開始追風 
(Audience) Oh! ,因此我三日之後，渣得好快 為嘅就係追一個叫「超大胞」嘅巨雲 呢種巨雲能夠製造柚咁大嘅冰雹 同壯觀嘅龍捲風 但其實只有 2% 「超大胞」 落到大冰雹 
(Applause) (Applause ends) You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced. ,"呢的雲可以闊成 50 英里 高度可以有 65,000 呎 "
How did we design the algorithms to do this? ,佢哋大到可以阻擋所有陽光 令到下面嘅事物好黑暗、好不祥 
We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad. ,追風係一個非常有質感嘅經驗 
"Once we have a model of the combined quad-pole system, we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it. ",溫暖同潮濕嘅風吹著你嘅背脊 泥土、小麥、青草和帶電粒子帶住氣味 
"Here, you see that it's stable, and even if I give it little nudges, it goes back -- to the nice, balanced position. ",雲層呈現唔同色彩 形成冰雹嘅雲層，有綠色、綠松藍 
We can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space. ,我學識咗對閃電產生敬畏 
"Using this pointer, made out of reflective markers, I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me. ",因為我嘅頭髮以前係直㗎 
"(Laughter) The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms, designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory. ",（笑聲） 講笑咋 
"Let's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop, and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world. ",（笑聲） 真正令我興奮嘅係風暴嘅動態 即佢哋會同熔岩燈形狀嘅乳狀雲 一齊旋動、自轉同起伏 
Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it. ,佢哋就好似可愛嘅怪獸一樣 
"Unlike the balancing pole, I did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system. ",當我影相嘅時候 我無啦啦記返我爺爺教過我嘅嘢 
"In fact, the system doesn't even know that the glass is there. ",當我企喺雲嘅下面 我唔單止見到一嚿雲 我仲明白到我有幸目睹嘅現象 係由製造我哋銀河、太陽系、太陽 甚至我哋地球嘅同一個力量所造成 雲團只係呢股力量嘅迷你版 
"Like before, I could use the pointer to tell the quad where I want it to be in space. ",所以全部嘢都係有關嘅。多謝 
"(Applause) (Applause ends) Okay, you should be asking yourself, why doesn't the water fall out of the glass? ",（掌聲） 
Two facts. ,
The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way. ,如果呢台機器可以做運動 意味著乜嘢？ 
"The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass, pointing up. ",我哋會借助四旋翼飛行器（四旋翼） 去展示機器運動嘅概念 同埋我哋喺機器運動方面嘅研究 
"You put these two things together, the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects, which at these speeds are negligible. ",四旋翼已經面世好耐 
And that's why you don't need to model the glass. ,佢哋最近大熱嘅原因 係因為佢哋嘅機械原理簡單 
"It naturally doesn't spill, no matter what the quad does. ",只要控制呢四個螺旋槳嘅轉速 呢部機器就可以翻側、俯仰、偏航 仲可以向任何一個方向加速 
"(Applause) (Applause ends) The lesson here is that some high-performance tasks are easier than others, and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard. ",呢部機器有電池、微型電腦 各種傳感器同無線電收發器 
"In this instance, carrying a glass of water is easy. ",四旋翼靈活係有代價嘅 
Balancing a pole is hard. ,佢天生唔夠穩定 所以需要自動反饋控制 至保證可以飛得到 
We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured. ,咁點樣做到自動反饋呢？ 
Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage? ,天花板嘅攝像鏡頭同呢部手提電腦 形成咗室內嘅定位系統 
"Conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly, because there are four degrees of freedom to control: roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration. ",用嚟定位空間入面嘅物件 每件物件都有呢種反光標記 
"Hexacopters and octocopters, with six and eight propellers, can provide redundancy, but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four. ",收集到嘅定位數據會發送去 另一部手提電腦 執行估算同控制算法 跟住電腦會發送控制指令畀四旋翼 四旋翼亦都會執行計算同控制算法 
Or do they? ,我哋研究嘅重點就係算法 
"(Laughter) If we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers, we discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it. ",算法賦予呢啲機器活力 
"We relinquish control of yaw, but roll, pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration. ",咁係點樣設計出算法 令機器可以郁嘅呢？ 
Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible. ,我哋利用廣義稱為 「以模型為基礎嘅設計方法」 
"In this instance, this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage, just like human athletes do, instead of building machines with redundancy. ",我哋首先利用數學模型 掌握機器運動嘅物理數據 
"We can't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water, or when a vaulter is twisting in the air, the ground fast approaching. ",然後用數學嘅一個細分學科 叫做控制理論，分析模型同合成算法 從而控制四旋翼 
Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry? ,例如，我哋係咁樣控制四旋翼︰ 
Will the vaulter stick the landing? ,首先，用一系列微分方程 掌握佢嘅運動數據 
Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started. ,藉著控制理論，我哋修改呢啲方程式 得出一啲算法嚟穩定四旋翼 
This maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution. ,等我示範下呢種方法有幾厲害啦 
There simply isn't enough time. ,假設我哋想四旋翼停喺空中之外 仲要穩定一轆棍 
"Instead, what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly, observe how it finishes the maneuver, and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better. ",經過簡單練習 人類已經可以做到呢個動作 雖然我哋比四旋翼有優勢 我哋可以雙腿掂地 有好靈活嘅雙手輔助 
"Similar to the diver and the vaulter, it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard. ",但如果我金雞獨立嘅話，咁就有啲難 
(Laughter) (Applause) Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports. ,注意轆棍頂部有反光標記 用嚟判斷轆棍嘅空間座標 
How do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort? ,（觀眾）哦！ 
"(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause ends) This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large. ",（掌聲） 大家可以睇到部四旋翼一直喺度微調 令轆棍平衡 
"The following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds, or 50 times per second. ",我哋係點樣設計算法搞掂嘅呢？ 
We first figure out where the ball is going. ,我哋將轆棍嘅數學模型輸入到四旋翼 
We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from. ,只要我哋個模型有齊 四旋翼同轆棍嘅資料 我哋就可以利用控制理論 建立控制算法去控制四旋翼 
"Third, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball. ",睇下，就算我郁佢一下 佢都穩如泰山，都會返到去平衡點 
"Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy. ",我哋仲可以修改模型 加入四旋翼預定嘅空間座標 
"Twenty milliseconds later, the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball. ",用著呢條有反光標記嘅指揮棒 就可以點四旋翼去任何我想嘅位置 而且同我保持特定嘅距離 
"(Applause) Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own, they can do it collectively. ",（笑聲） 呢啲特技動作嘅關鍵係算法 算法依賴數學模型同控制理論 
These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net. ,等我指部四旋翼返嚟先 畀四旋翼放低轆棍 宜家我會講解 理解物理模型 同現實世界運作規律嘅重要 
(Applause) (Applause ends) They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me. ,留意喺我放杯水上去嘅時候 四旋翼嘅高度下降咗 
"Notice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical. ",唔似轆棍咁樣 我無喺四旋翼系統度 加入杯水嘅數學模型 
"(Applause) In fact, when fully extended, this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch. ",事實上，系統根本唔知道杯水喺度 
The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me. ,同之前一樣，我可以用指揮棒 指揮四旋翼嘅走向 
Mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second. ,（掌聲） 大家可能會問 點解玻璃杯嘅水唔會倒出嚟？ 
Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities. ,原因有兩個： 
What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being? ,第一，重力對所有物體嘅作用都係一樣 
What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming. ,第二，所有螺旋槳都指向 同玻璃杯一樣嘅方向︰指向上 
It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time. ,呢兩點加埋，結果就係 杯水打側方向嘅作用力太細 四旋翼亦因此主要受到空氣動力控制 所以向側邊嘅力都可以忽略 
"Similar to the pointer that I used earlier, we can use this as inputs to the system. ",亦因為咁，你無需為玻璃杯整數學模型 
We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures. ,因為無論四旋翼做咩，水都唔會漏出嚟 
(Applause) Interaction doesn't have to be virtual. ,（掌聲） 喺度想講嘅係 某啲高性能任務簡單過其他任務 同埋，理解問题背後嘅物理 你就可以知道邊樣簡單、邊樣難 
"Take this quad, for example. ",呢個例子裏面 四旋翼頂住杯水飛就簡單 
It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space. ,平衡轆棍就難 
"If I try to move it out of the way, it fights me, and moves back to where it wants to be. ",我哋都聽過運動員受傷都可以完成壯舉 
"We can change this behavior, however. ",咁機器可唔可以 喺極度損壞嘅情況下運作？ 
We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad. ,傳統科學認為，你要飛 起碼要四塊固定螺旋槳 因為要控制四範嘢︰ 滾轉、俯仰、偏航同加速 
"Once we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics, as far as the quad is concerned, of course. ",六旋同八旋飛行器 分別有六同八塊螺旋槳 佢哋嘅螺旋槳足以應付所需 但係四旋更加受歡迎 因為佢有最少嘅螺旋槳：四套 
"Here, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid. ",係咪？ 
We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine. ,如果我哋分析呢台 只用兩個螺旋槳嘅機器嘅數學模型 我哋發現有種新嘅方式可以令佢飛起嚟 
I will use this new capability to position this camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration. ,就係只要算法容許嘅話 我哋放棄控制偏航 但係我哋仍然控制滾轉、俯仰同加速 
So we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics. ,數學模型精確咁話畀我哋知 幾時同點解呢種配置係有可能 
Let's have a little bit of fun with this. ,喺呢個例子，數學模型嘅知識 令我哋設計出全新嘅機器結構 或者好似人類運動員一樣聰明 應對損害嘅算法 而無需整多餘嘅部件 
"For what you will see next, these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto. ",當我哋睇到跳水運動員空翻入水 或者撐杆跳運動員喺空中翻轉 然後快速著地，我哋一定會屏息以待 
"As time goes on, gravity will be increased until we're all back on planet Earth, but I assure you we won't get there. ",睇下究竟跳水嘅可唔可以壓住水花 
"Okay, here goes. ",撐杆跳嘅可唔可以站立著地 
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) Whew! ,假設我哋希望呢台四旋翼表演三個空翻 然後停喺佢原來嘅位置 
"You're all thinking now, these guys are having way too much fun, and you're probably also asking yourself, why exactly are they building machine athletes? ",但呢個動作快到 我哋用唔到定位反饋信息 糾正執行過程嘅動作 
Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities. ,時間根本唔夠 
"Others think that it has more of a social role, that it's used to bind the group. ",所以四旋翼只能夠盲目執行動作 執行完之後 睇下自己點樣完成呢個動作 然後修改自己嘅動作 令到下一個翻轉好啲 
"Similarly, we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits. ",呢個類似跳水同撐杆跳運動員 只有通過反覆練習 先可以學好動作，做到最好 
What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life? ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 好多運動入面，擊球係一項必須嘅技能 
"Like all our past creations and innovations, they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused. ",我哋點樣令機器做到 運動員隨便就做到嘅動作？ 
This is not a technical choice we are faced with; it's a social one. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 呢部四旋翼個頭綁咗塊球拍 而最有效擊球點同蘋果差唔多大 
"Let's make the right choice, the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines, just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us. ",所以唔係好大 部機嘅計算頻率係 20 毫秒一次 亦即係每秒 50 次 
Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain. ,我哋第一步睇下個波飛去邊 
They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team. ,第二步計算出四旋翼要點樣打波 四旋翼收到指令後 就飛去個波飛出嘅位置 
"(Applause) Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini, Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin, Mark Muller and Robin Ritz. ",第三步，計算出一條從四旋翼 到擊球點嘅飛行軌跡 
Look out for them. They're destined for great things. ,第四步，我哋只執行 上幾個程序 20 毫秒 
Thank you. ,20 毫秒過去，重複以上成個程序 直到四旋翼打到個波 
,（掌聲） 機器唔單止可以獨立運動 佢哋仲可以一齊嚟 
I was born and raised in North Korea. ,呢三部四旋翼就一齊帶住個球網飛 
"Although my family constantly struggled against poverty, I was always loved and cared for first, because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family. ",（掌聲） 佢哋做咗個非常有動態 非常合作嘅操作 嚟丟返個波畀我 
But then the great famine began in 1994. ,注意囉，個網全部打開個陣 呢啲四旋翼全部打側九十度 
I was four years old. ,（掌聲） 實際上，當個網全部打開 會產生相當於笨豬跳嘅人 跌到最低時五倍嘅力 
My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight. ,做一齊打波動作嘅算法好簡單 類似一部四旋翼打返個波畀我嘅算式 
"I would wander the streets searching for food, and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother's back eating chips, and wanting to steal them from him. ",都係利用數學模型持續計算合作策略 每秒計算 50 次 
Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness. ,我哋目前睇到嘅所有嘢 都同機器同埋佢哋能力有關 
"For a hungry child, politics and freedom are not even thought of. ",如果我哋將機器嘅運動能力 同人類結合，會點呢？ 
"On my ninth birthday, my parents couldn't give me any food to eat. ",喺我面前嘅係一部商業用姿勢感應器 主要用喺遊戲 
"But even as a child, I could feel the heaviness in their hearts. ",佢可以實時識別我身體唔同部位嘅動作 
"Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time, and in 2003, when I was 13 years old, my father became one of them. ",而同我之前用嘅指揮棒相似 我可以用呢個感應器 當成系統嘅輸入裝置 
I saw my father wither away and die. ,我哋宜家可以用身體姿勢 自然咁同四旋翼互動 
"In the same year, my mother disappeared one day, and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money, but that she would return with money and food soon. ",（掌聲） 互動唔一定係虛擬，可以係現實嘅 
"Since we had never been separated, and I thought we would be together forever, I didn't even give her a hug when she left. ",以呢部四旋翼為例 
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. ,佢想停喺空間嘅一個固定位置 
"But again, I didn't know it was going to be a long goodbye. ",如果我要擁開佢，佢會抵抗我 佢始終會返去佢想要嘅位置度 
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then. ,但係，我哋可以改變呢種行為 
"Suddenly, I became an orphan and homeless. ",我哋可以用數學模型 估算我用喺四旋翼上面嘅力 
"My daily life became very hard, but very simple. ",只要我哋知道呢個力 我哋就可以改變四旋翼嘅物理定律 
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash. ,依家四旋翼就好似喺粘性流體度 
But that is no way to survive. ,而我哋依家可以好親密咁同機器互動 
"I started to realize, begging would not be the solution. ",我會用呢種新技術 將帶住攝像頭嘅四旋翼放喺適當位置 去錄低餘下嘅示範 
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets. ,正如頭先所講 我哋可以同四旋翼有實體互動 亦可以改變佢哋嘅物理定律 
"Sometimes, I found small jobs in exchange for food. ",等我哋嚟玩下呢樣 
"Once, I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine, 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day. ",接著落嚟 你會睇到四旋翼 一開始好似喺太空咁輕飄飄 
I was not uncommon. ,隨住時間增加，引力亦都加大 直到恢復地球引力為止 但係我保證你同我唔會有事 
"Many other orphans survived this way, or worse. ",好，開始 
"When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains, I hoped that, the next morning, my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food. ",（笑聲） （笑聲） （掌聲） 呼！ 
That hope kept me alive. ,你哋一定諗緊四旋翼嘅 開發人員有太多娛樂 你都可能會問自己 點解佢哋要整運動機械人？ 
"I don't mean big, grand hope. ",有人一口咬定話 「玩」嘅功能就係磨練 包括人在內嘅動物嘅技藝同埋能力 
"I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread, even though it usually didn't. ",其他人就諗，四旋翼更加有社會功能 可以用嚟聚合群體 
"But if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't even try, and then I would die. ",對我哋嚟講 我哋用運動同崇尚運動嘅精神 創造咗新嘅機器算法 將機器嘅潛能發揮到極致 
Hope kept me alive. ,機器嘅速度 對我哋嘅生活方式有咩影響？ 
"Every day, I told myself, no matter how hard things got, still I must live. ",同我哋以前所有嘅創造發明一樣 佢哋可能用嚟改善人類嘅生活條件 亦都可能俾人誤用或者濫用 
"After three years of waiting for my sister's return, I decided to go to China to look for her myself. ",我哋面對嘅，唔係技術決定 而係社會決定 
I realized I couldn't survive much longer this way. ,等我哋做個正確決定 令最好嘅機器可以喺將來問世 就好似崇向運動嘅精神 發掘到運動潛能最勁嘅人咁 
"I knew the journey would be risky, but I would be risking my life either way. ",等我介紹你哋四旋翼項目 背後勞苦功高嘅人 
"I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea, or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China. ",佢哋係飛行器競技場 研究小組嘅現任成員 
I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen. ,"（掌聲） Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin Mark Muller 同 Robin Ritz "
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission. ,請留意佢哋 佢哋日後一定會有偉大嘅成就 
"Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans, where they face severe punishment. ",多謝大家 （掌聲） 
"I decided to cross during the day, first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark, second because I knew I was already taking a risk, and since not many people tried to cross during the day, I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone. ",
"I made it to China on February 15, 2006. ",我喺北韓出世 
I was 16 years old. ,雖然我嘅家庭一直處於貧困狀態 但係我仲係得到屋企人對我嘅關愛 因為我係家中唯一嘅男丁 亦係兩個細路當中細嗰個 
"I thought things in China would be easier, since there was more food. ",但係 1994 嗰年，大饑荒爆發 
I thought more people would help me. ,當時我四歲 
"But it was harder than living in North Korea, because I was not free. ",我同姐姐一起出去搵柴火 從清晨五點開始 一直到凌晨先返返屋企 
I was always worried about being caught and sent back. ,我為咗搵嘢食而喺街上遊蕩 我見過一個母親孭住一個細路 個細路喺母親背脊食緊薯仔 我當時想偷佢薯仔 
"By a miracle, some months later, I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans, and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years. ",飢餓係虐待人、令人覺得絕望嘅一樣嘢 
"Later that year, an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee. ",對於一個受盡飢餓折磨嘅細路嚟講 政治同自由係根本諗都唔使諗 
"I went to America without knowing a word of English, yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school. ",喺我九歲生日嗰日 我嘅父母甚至無辦法畀嘢食我 
"Even in North Korea, I was an F student. ",即使我當時仲好細 我可以感受到父母沉重嘅心 
(Laughter) And I barely finished elementary school. ,大約有一百萬北韓人因為嗰次饑荒餓死 而喺 2003 年，我 13 歲嗰年 我父親亦成為饑荒嘅受害者 
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day. ,我親眼目睹父親慢慢衰退嘅死亡 
Textbooks and the library were not my playground. ,喺同一年嘅某日，我嘅母親突然消失咗 然後我姐姐講比我知 母親去咗中國打工搵錢 但係佢會好快帶著金錢同食物返嚟 
"My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying, but it didn't work. ",因為我哋之前從未分開過 而且我覺得我哋會永遠喺埋一齊 於是佢離開嘅時候 我甚至連擁抱過佢都冇 
"At one point, my father gave up on me. ",呢個係我生命中犯咗嘅最大錯誤 
"He said, ""You're not my son anymore."" ",但係，我當時並唔知道 呢次係我同母親永遠訣別 
"I was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply. ",從嗰時開始 我就一直無見過我家姐同母親 
"But nevertheless, my level of motivation still didn't change before he died. ",刹時間，我成為一個孤兒，無家可歸 
"So in America, it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school. ",我每日嘅生活變得更加艱難 但係我嘅目標好簡單 
I didn't even go to middle school. ,就係可以係垃圾堆度 搵到一片好多塵嘅麵包充飢 
"I decided to go, just because they told me to, without trying much. ",但係咁樣始終畀唔到我生存落去 
"But one day, I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner. ",我開始意識到，乞討解決唔到問題 
"And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing, but I realized there were not enough for everyone, so I decided against it. ",所以我嘗試去黑市偷食品車嘅食物 
"When I looked down at my plate, I saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his. ",有時候，我會打散工嚟換取食物 
I was so happy. ,有一次，我甚至喺一個煤礦度 工作咗兩個月 位於地底 33 米，無任何保護措施 每日工作 16 個鐘 
I looked at him sitting next to me. ,我嘅情況並唔罕見 
"He just looked back at me very warmly, but said no words. ",好多孤兒都係喺同我相似 或者更加惡劣嘅環境生活 
Suddenly I remembered my biological father. ,當我因為太凍或者餓壞而瞓唔到嘅時候 我希望第二朝早 姐姐會攞著我鍾意嘅食物叫醒我 
"My foster father's small act of love reminded me of my father, who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry, even if he was starving. ",呢個希望令我繼續生存落去 
"I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America, yet my father died of starvation. ",我唔係講緊咩偉大嘅希望 
"My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him, and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him. ",我講緊嘅希望係令我相信 可以喺下一堆垃圾度搵到麵包 即使有時真係搵唔到 
And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice. ,但係如果我無呢個信念 我連試都唔去試嘅話 我就會死 
"I took school seriously, and for the first time ever in my life, I received an academic award for excellence, and made dean's list from the first semester in high school. ",係希望令我生存 
(Applause) That chicken wing changed my life. ,每日，我都話畀自己聽 無論生活點樣艱難，我都要生存落去 
(Laughter) Hope is personal. Hope is something that no one can give to you. ,經過三年喺度等阿家姐 我決定去中國搵佢 
You have to choose to believe in hope. ,我發現咁樣嘅話我更加冇可能生存到 
You have to make it yourself. ,我明白呢次旅程非常冒險 但係留喺北韓都係一樣賭緊生命 
"In North Korea, I made it myself. ",因為我可能會好似我父親一樣 餓死喺北韓 走到中國話唔定我嘅生活會更加好 
Hope brought me to America. ,我之前聽講過 好多人嘗試夜晚偷渡到中國 避過俾人發現 
"But in America, I didn't know what to do, because I had this overwhelming freedom. ",北韓邊境嘅警衛好多時射殺 逃到去中國嘅人 
"My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction, and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America. ",中國士兵會逮捕 同埋送返脫北者畀北韓當局 佢哋返到去北韓會受到嚴厲嘅懲罰 
I did not come here by myself. ,我當時決定日頭偷渡 第一係我當時仲係一個細路哥，驚黑夜 第二係我知道 既然我已經冒緊險，所以冇所謂 而且日頭冇咁多人偷渡 我覺得我可能會成功過到去 
"I had hope, but hope by itself is not enough. ",2006 年 2 月 15 日 我成功偷渡到中國 
Many people helped me along the way to get here. ,我當時 16 歲 
North Koreans are fighting hard to survive. ,我以為中國嘅生活會容易啲 因為嗰度有多啲食物 
"They have to force themselves to survive, have hope to survive, but they cannot make it without help. ",我以為多啲人會幫我 
This is my message to you. ,點知中國嘅生活比北韓仲艱難 因為我無自由 
"Have hope for yourself, but also help each other. ",同埋成日擔心俾人捉返返去 
"Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live. ",幸運嘅係，幾個月後，我遇到一個人 佢掌管一個照應北韓人嘅地下組織 佢畀我住喺組織嗰度 係我咁多年嚟第一次有正餐食 
My foster father didn't intend to change my life. ,同年，一個人幫我逃離中國 以難民嘅身份到達美國 
"In the same way, you may also change someone's life with even the smallest act of love. ",我去美國嘅時候一句英文都唔識講 但係我嘅社工話畀我聽我要去讀高中 
"A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger, and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive. ",即使係北韓，我嘅成績一直都唔合格 
But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph's life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive. ,（笑聲） 我連小學都未讀完 
Thank you. ,我記得我以前喺學校 每日至少都要打一次交 
"(Applause) Adrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us. ",我對課本同圖書館毫無興趣 
"I know you haven't seen your sister for, you said, it was almost exactly a decade, and in the off chance that she may be able to see this, we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message. ",父親用盡辦法畀我好好學習 但係都係無用 
Joseph Kim: In Korean? ,去到一個地步係父親放棄咗我 
"AH: You can do English, then Korean as well. ",佢話：「你唔再係我嘅仔喇！」 
"(Laughter) JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don't think I can make it without tearing up. ",我當時得十一二歲 但係呢句話令我好心痛 
"Nuna, it has been already 10 years that I haven’t seen you. ",但無論如何，一直到父親去世之前 我都係冇學習嘅動力 
"I just wanted to say that I miss you, and I love you, and please come back to me and stay alive. ",所以喺美國，佢哋叫我去讀高中 係有啲荒唐 
"And I -- oh, gosh. ",我連中學都無讀過 
I still haven't given up my hope to see you. ,我之所以決定去 都只係因為佢哋叫我去 但係我冇畀心機讀 
"I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you, and I promise I will not cry again. ",但係有一日，我返到屋企 我嘅養母整咗雞翼做晚餐 
"(Laughter) Yes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you, and if you can't find me, I will also look for you, and I hope to see you one day. ",食飯嘅時候，我想食多隻雞翼 但係我發現如果我食多一隻 咁其他人就唔夠食 所以我冇食到多一隻 
And can I also make a small message to my mom? ,當我得低頭望著我個碟嘅時候 我見到養父畀咗我最後一隻雞翼 
"AH: Sure, please. ",我當時好開心 
"JK: I haven't spent much time with you, but I know that you still love me, and you probably still pray for me and think about me. ",我望住坐喺我隔籬嘅佢 
I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world. ,但佢只係好溫暖咁望咗我一眼，無講嘢 
Thank you. ,突然間我諗起我親生父親 
(Applause) ,我養父對我嘅愛令我諗起我嘅父親 即使挨餓，甚至極寒交迫 父親都願意將佢嘅食物畀咗我先 
,美國有咁多嘢食令我好唔習慣 因為畢竟我嘅父親死於饑荒 
I'll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006. ,我嗰晚唯一嘅心願就係 為過生嘅父親煮一餐飯 嗰晚我仲諗緊仲可以 用咩嘢其他方式嚟榮耀佢 
"I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, taking emergency call. ",我嘅答案係 要努力讀書、接受美國最好嘅教育 嚟榮耀父親嘅犧牲 
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot. ,我開始認真咁學習 而且我人生第一次得到最佳學術獎 同埋喺中學嘅第一個學期 上咗優等生名錄 
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her. ,（掌聲） 嗰晚嘅雞翼改變咗我嘅人生 
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital. ,（笑聲） 「希望」係一樣個人嘅嘢 「希望」係其他人無法畀你嘅 
That wasn't being asked. ,你必須要相信希望 
"The question that was being asked of me was a different one, which was, did she also need an amputation? ",你必須要令自己相信希望 
"Now, looking back on that night, I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. ",喺北韓，我令自己相信咗希望 
"In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life. ",希望將我帶到美國 
The cancer was too advanced. ,但喺美國，我迷失咗，我唔知應該做咩 因為突然間我得到咁多自由 
But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee. ,嗰次晚飯我嘅養父畀咗我方向 佢鼓勵我，畀咗我嚟美國生活嘅目的 
I brought some for her parents. ,我並唔係自己一個人就嚟到呢度 
"But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her, because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself. ",我雖然帶著希望嚟到美國 但係希望本身並唔夠嘅 
"So why was it that, just a few nights later, as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation, why did I hold her in such bitter contempt? ",一路上，有好多人幫我嚟到呢度 
"You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes. ",北韓人為咗生存而奮鬥 
"And we all know that's from eating too much and not exercising enough, right? ",佢哋要強迫自己去生活落去 強迫自己抱著對生存嘅希望 但係如果無人幫手，係無法實現嘅 
"I mean, how hard can it be? ",我留畀大家嘅說話就係︰ 
"As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself, if you just tried caring even a little bit, you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot. ",對自己要有希望，同時要彼此守望相助 
Why did I feel justified in judging her? ,無論你住邊度，生活都可以艱難 
I'd like to say I don't know. ,我嘅養父當時並無諗過改變我嘅人生 
But I actually do. ,但小小嘅關愛 你都可以改變一個人嘅一生 
"You see, in the hubris of my youth, I thought I had her all figured out. ",一片麵包可以令你消除飢餓感 擁有希望可以為你帶嚟食物 令你繼續生存落去 
She ate too much. She got unlucky. ,我好相信 你嘅愛同關心 可以救到一個北韓人嘅生命 同改變成千上萬個 仍然抱著生存希望嘅北韓人 
She got diabetes. Case closed. ,多謝 
"Ironically, at that time in my life, I was also doing cancer research, immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific, and in that world I was actually taught to question everything, to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards. ",（掌聲） 主持人： Joseph 多謝你同大家分享 非常私人而且特別嘅故事 
"Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma, I never once questioned the conventional wisdom. ",我知道你一直無見過你嘅姐姐 正如你話齋將近有十年嘞 考慮到佢有可能睇到呢個大會 我哋想畀你同你姐姐講幾句 
I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science. ,講者︰用韓文嗎？ 
"Three years later, I found out how wrong I was. ",主持︰你可以先用英文然後再用韓文 
"But this time, I was the patient. ",(笑聲） 講者︰好嘅 但我覺得我唔會用韓文講好多 因為一講我就會淚流不止 
"Despite exercising three or four hours every single day, and following the food pyramid to the letter, I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. ",努娜，已經有將近十年我無見到你喇 
Some of you may have heard of this. ,我只係想講我好掛住你，我愛你 你一定要嚟搵我，一定要好好生存 
I had become insulin-resistant. ,而且我… 
"You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat, whether we burn it or store it. ",我仍然冇放棄再見到你嘅希望 
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo. ,喺我見到你之前 我都會幸福咁生活落去 同埋努力讀書 而且我保證我唔會再喊 
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life. ,（笑聲） 係嘅，我只係希望能夠再見到你 如果你搵唔到我，我都會去搵你 我希望有一日會見返你 
"And insulin resistance, as its name suggests, is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job. ",我可以同我媽咪都講兩句嗎？ 
"Once you're insulin-resistant, you're on your way to getting diabetes, which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin. ",主持︰當然，請講 
"Now your blood sugar levels start to rise, and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease, cancer, even Alzheimer's disease, and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier. ",講者︰雖然我哋相處嘅時間唔多 但係我知道你依然愛我 並且你可能依然仲為我祈禱同掛住我 
"With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically, adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking. ",我只係想多謝你將我帶嚟呢個世界 
"I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less. ",多謝 
"I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore. ",（掌聲） 
"More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance. ",
"But most important, I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away: How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right? ",2006 年嘅春天 發生咗一件無辦法忘記嘅事 
"If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me, was it possible it was failing someone else? ",我當時係約翰斯 · 霍普金斯醫院 外科駐院醫生 負責急症 
"And underlying these questions, I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance. ",有朝凌晨兩點 急症室打嚟，叫我返去醫院 睇一個隻腳患咗糖尿病潰瘍嘅女病人 
"Now, most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance. ",我到而家都仲記得拉開塊簾 聞到一陣潰爛味 
"Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance, you get people to lose weight, right? ",所有人都認為呢位女士 病情嚴重，需要留醫 
You treat the obesity. ,咁呢當然啦仲使問 
But what if we have it backwards? ,但我當時仲有一個疑問 佢駛唔駛做切肢手術？ 
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all? ,而家，諗返嗰晚嘅事 我拼命令自己相信 我對待呢一位女病人嘅心 同對另一位女病人嘅心，都係一樣 第二位病人 27 歲、結婚冇耐 就喺第一位病人入嚟急症室前嘅三日 因為下腰痛嚟到急症室 結果驗出比較後期嘅胰腺癌 
"In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem, the tip of a proverbial iceberg? ",我知道我做唔到咩保住佢嘅性命 
"I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out. ",癌症已經好後期 
What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell? ,但我仍然向佢保證 我會盡一切努力令佢更加舒服 我帶咗佢一張毯同一杯咖啡 
"I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign, but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils. ",我亦都帶咗啲畀佢父母 
"You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel, as I alluded to a moment ago, taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately. ",但更重要嘅係，我冇批評過佢 因為好明顯，佢患呢個病係無辜嘅 
"When we become insulin-resistant, the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state. ",咁點解，幾晚之後，我喺同一間急症室 決定我嘅糖尿病人需要截肢？ 點解我會咁樣睇低佢呢？ 
"So now, when insulin says to a cell, I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says, ""No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."" ",同第二位女病人唔同 第一位病人有第二類糖尿病，而且肥胖 
"And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells, it's probably the safest place to store it. ",我哋都知道第二類糖尿病 係因為食太多 同唔夠運動引起，係咪？ 
"So for many of us, about 75 million Americans, the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse, getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat. ",我嘅意思係 食少啲同做運動有幾難呢？ 
"This is a really subtle distinction, but the implication could be profound. ",我望住佢瞓喺床，心諗 如果你以前關心自己多啲 你而家就唔會俾醫生截肢 
Consider the following analogy: Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table. ,點解我會覺得咁樣評價佢係合理呢？ 
"Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look, but we all know the bruise per Se is not the problem. ",我想答我唔知道 
"In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma, all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body. ",但我其實心裏面係有原因 
"Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem, and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises: masking creams, painkillers, you name it, all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables. ",你睇下，年輕嘅我幾咁傲慢 覺得自己好了解病人 
How much better would we be if we treated the cause -- telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room -- rather than the effect? ,認為病人因為食得太多，同埋唔好彩 
Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world. ,所以患上糖尿病。完 
"Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins. ",諷刺嘅係我當時做緊癌症研究 研究以免疫系統為本嘅黑色素瘤療法 研究裏面，我學到要凡事問問題 質疑所有假設 同埋將研究保持喺最高嘅科學標準 
Cause and effect. ,但講到一啲好似糖尿病咁嘅病 比黑色素瘤奪去多八倍美國人嘅病 我從未懷疑過前人知識 
So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance. ,我假設咗以前讀到嘅 病理發展次序係成形嘅科學 
"Maybe we should be asking ourselves, is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity, at least in most people? ",三年後，我終於明白自己有幾錯 
"What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening, an underlying epidemic, the one we ought to be worried about? ",但今次，我係一個病人 
Let's look at some suggestive facts. ,雖然我每日都會做三至四個鐘運動 並且不折不扣跟足食物金字塔 我嘅體重仍然增加 而且患上咗代謝症候群 
We know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance. ,可能在座有人會聽過呢個病 
"And by the way, they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people. ",我個身體突然抗拒胰島素 
"Conversely, we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin-resistant, and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts. ",各位可以想像胰島素係一種主要激素 控制身體對食咗嘅食物作出反應 話畀身體知消耗定儲存食物 
"Now I don't know why, but it might be because, in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy. ",呢個生理反應叫能量分區 
"So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance, and you can be lean and have it, this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on. ",產生唔到足夠胰島素係難以令人生活 
"So what if we're fighting the wrong war, fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance? ",而抗胰島素，顧名思義 就係細胞對胰島素所做嘅嘢愈嚟愈抗拒 
"Even worse, what if blaming the obese means we're blaming the victims? ",當你係抗胰島素，糖尿病就會埋你身 你嘅胰腺就會因為抗胰島素嘅關係 製造唔到足夠嘅胰島素 
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong? ,血糖於是會上升 然後病情就會失控 最終引致心臟病、癌症 阿爾茨海默氏病，同埋截肢 即係好似幾年前嗰位女士咁樣 
"Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore, let alone the luxury of certainty. ",因為我好驚會變成咁 所以我徹底改變咗飲食習慣 飲食上開始食加同減一啲 大部分人會驚訝嘅嘢 
"I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this, but I'm wide open to others. ",做咗之後令我輕咗 40 磅 奇怪嘅係我做少咗運動 
"Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me, is this. ",大家見到，我已經唔再超重 
"If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant, the answer probably isn't too much food. ",更重要嘅係，抗胰島素無再發生 
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar. ,但最重要嘅係 我仲有三個急需解決嘅問題︰ 假如我嘅生活習慣係健康 咁點解呢個病係會發生喺我身上呢？ 
"Now, we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run, and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly. ",如果有關營養嘅舊有知識 對我唔適用嘅話 會唔會對其他人都係咁？ 
"So if you put these physiological processes to work, I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes, but through insulin resistance, you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising. ",問咗呢啲問題之後 我更加想了解 肥胖同抗胰島素之間嘅真正關係 
"When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago, I did it simply by restricting those things, which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience. ",如今，大部分學者都相信 肥胖係抗胰島素嘅原因 
"But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong, and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically. ",咁照邏輯推理，如果想醫好抗胰島素 我哋就要鼓勵啲人減肥，係咪？ 
"But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested. ",所以我哋要醫肥胖 
I'm betting my career on this. ,但係如果個關係調轉呢？ 
"Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem, and I'll go wherever the science takes me. ",如果肥胖根本唔係抗胰島素嘅原因？ 
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. ,如果肥胖反映緊一個更深嘅問題？ 
I've been humbled enough by all I don't know. ,我知咁講好似好癲 因為我哋都經歷梗肥胖流行病嘅爆發 但請先聽我講 
"For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country, and the best part is, just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals, we've done the same thing. ",如果肥胖係一個機制 畀我哋抵禦更加兇險嘅細胞問題？ 
"We've recruited a team of scientific rivals, the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic. ",我唔係講緊肥胖係好事 但我認為肥胖係兩種代謝問題之中 影響比較輕微嗰個 
Some think it's too many calories consumed. ,你可以將抗胰島素諗成 細胞獲取能量嘅能力下降 就好似我頭先提到 當我哋攝取卡路里嘅時候 我哋會將部分消耗同部分儲存 
Others think it's too much dietary fat. ,當我哋患上抗胰島素時 消耗同儲存嘅平衡就會消失 
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches. ,宜家當胰島素同細胞講 「我要你消耗更多能量」 但因為細胞覺得消耗率大過安全水平 所以會話「唔駛啦，我會蓄能量」 
"But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. ",而由於脂肪細胞欠缺 其他細胞大部分複雜嘅細胞機制 所以佢哋係一個安全嘅地方儲存能量 
"First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. ",所以對於我哋好多美國人嚟講 即係七千五百萬人嚟講 對抗胰島素最合適嘅做法 反而係我哋儲存脂肪 而唔係因為肥胖所以有抗胰島素 
"And two, if we're willing to be wrong, if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer, we can solve this problem. ",呢兩個次序雖然分別唔大，但意義深遠 
"I know it's tempting to want an answer right now, some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription -- eat this, not that — but if we want to get it right, we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription. ",大家嘗試諗下以下比喻： 當你唔小心俾茶几撞到隻腳時 皮膚會有瘀傷 
"Briefly, to address this, our research program is focused around three meta-themes, or questions. ",當然，瘀傷係好痛 你亦都唔會鍾意變咗色嘅皮膚 但我哋知道瘀傷唔係問題 
"First, how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes, and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms? ",相反，佢係對創傷嘅一個健康反應 所有免疫細胞趕去受傷嘅地方 阻止細胞殘骸擴散 同埋防止身體其他部位受到感染 
"Second, based on these insights, can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that's safe and practical to implement? ",而家，假設我哋覺得瘀傷係一個問題 而且研發到一種醫學技術 同埋形成一種文化去治療瘀傷 當中包括有掩蔽霜、止痛藥 各種你哋諗到嘅嘢都有 但係我哋忽略咗 人仍然會撞到茶几呢個事實 
"And finally, once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet, how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception? ",如果我哋根治呢個原因 叫人喺客廳行嘅時候小心啲 而唔係對付個後果 你話係咪好得多呢？ 
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it. ,搞清原因同後果，世界從此會好唔同 
"Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier, and believe it or not, that can be studied scientifically. ",攪錯咗嘅話 醫藥行業可以仍然會發展得好好 但人嘅小腿嘅瘀傷點都唔會有改善 
"I don't know how this journey is going to end, but this much seems clear to me, at least: We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did. ",講到因果關係 
"Most of them actually want to do the right thing, but they have to know what that is, and it's got to work. ",所以我要講嘅係 可能我哋攪錯咗 肥胖同抗胰島素嘅因果關係 
"I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance, because as medical professionals, we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals: open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working, and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final, but constantly evolving. ",我哋可能要問問自己 喺至少大部分人當中 抗胰島素有冇可能導致肥胖 同各種同肥胖相關嘅疾病呢？ 
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science. ,肥胖會唔會只係一樣 對更有威脅嘅嘢嘅反應呢？ 例如隱性病 咁我哋需唔需要擔心呢？ 
"If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness, what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy? ",我哋睇下一啲事實 
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R. ,有三千萬肥胖嘅美國人係無抗胰島素 
I wish I could speak with that woman again. ,佢哋唔會比瘦嘅人有更大嘅疾病風險 
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. ,相反，美國有六百萬瘦嘅人有抗胰島素 佢哋比肥胖嘅人更加易患上 剛才提及嘅代謝性疾病嘅風險 
"I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered the best clinical care I could, but as a human being, I let you down. ",我唔知原因，但有可能因為 佢哋嘅細胞唔知點樣應對多咗嘅能量 
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt. ,所以，當人可以肥胖而無患上抗胰島素 而你瘦嘅人都可以患上抗胰島素嘅話 肥胖可以推斷只係一個身體狀態嘅訊號 
"You needed my empathy and compassion, and above all else, you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn't let the system down. ",如果我哋醫錯咗 剩係醫肥胖而唔係醫抗胰島素 咁會有咩後果？ 
"Maybe the system, of which I was a part, was letting you down. ",更差嘅係，如果肥胖嘅人 其實係受害者嘅話 咁點算呢？ 
"If you're watching this now, I hope you can forgive me. ",如果我哋對肥胖嘅認識根本係錯架呢？ 
(Applause) ,個人嚟講，我承受唔起自大嘅後果 更受唔起做事絕對嘅後果 
,我對呢件事有我自己一套睇法 但我亦都樂意聽其他人意見 
This is my grandfather. ,由於每個人都問我 所以我會講講我嘅假定 如果你問我 
And this is my son. ,當一個細胞抵抗胰島素嘅時候 究竟佢係遠離緊啲咩 答案應該唔係過多嘅食物 
"My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy, and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something, honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can. ",而係過多嘅葡萄糖 ，亦即係血糖 
"My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world, sometimes just a small block of wood, if you stack it up tall, actually is an incredibly inspiring thing. ",我哋知道加工嘅穀物同澱粉 會短時間內增加血糖 而且有理由相信 糖份可能會直接導致抗胰島素 
These are my buildings. ,所以，如果思考整個生理過程 我會假設增加攝取 加工穀物、糖份同埋澱粉 會透過抗胰島素嘅現象 導致肥胖同埋糖尿病 而唔一定剩關食過多同太少運動 
I build all around the world out of our office in Vancouver and New York. ,幾年前，我只係控制食量同運動量 我就輕咗 40 磅 我承認呢一個係偏見嚟 因為係我嘅個人經歷 
"And we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials, depending on where we are. ",但咁樣唔代表我嘅偏見係錯 最重要係，全部嘢都可經得起科學驗證 
"But wood is the material that I love the most, and I'm going to tell you the story about wood. ",不過首要接受 我哋現有對肥胖、糖尿病 同埋抗胰島素嘅觀念可能係錯 所以呢啲觀念都要驗證埋 
"And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood, I notice they react completely differently. ",我亦為呢樣嘢賭上我嘅生涯 
"I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column, but I've actually seen that happen in a wood building. ",今日，我用我所有時間去研究呢個問題 我會跟著科學嘅指引去做 
"I've actually seen how people touch the wood, and I think there's a reason for it. ",當我決定無辦法或者唔去做一件事 其實係假扮知道答案 
"Just like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on Earth. ",我對於唔知嘅嘢一直好謙虛 
That's a wonderful thing. ,過去嘅一年裡面，我好幸運 能夠同國內最優秀嘅 研究糖尿病同肥胖嘅團隊 共同探索呢一個問題 最美好嘅部分係我哋好似林肯咁 被同時係競爭對手嘅隊員包圍 
I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings. ,我哋其實請嚟一班最頂尖最優秀 又對呢一個病各有見解嘅科學團隊 
It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment. ,其中有啲認為原因係攝取過多卡路里 
"Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest that grows to 33 stories tall. ",有啲認為係飲食高脂 
"Down the coast here in California, the redwood forest grows to 40 stories tall. ",有啲認為係進食太多加工嘅穀物和澱粉 
But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth. ,呢個團隊雖然嚟自多個範疇 又有好高批判能力同又係好叻 但佢哋同意兩樣嘢 
"Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places, and that's true here in the United States. ",第一，因為我哋以為知道答案 所以可以繼續忽視呢個重要問題 
"Now there are exceptions, but there needs to be some exceptions, and things are going to change, I'm hoping. ",第二，如果我哋願意接受自己係錯 並且願意利用最好嘅科學實驗 去挑戰舊有概念 我哋就可以解決問題 
"And the reason I think that way is that today half of us live in cities, and that number is going to grow to 75 percent. ",我哋都好想即刻有一個答案 雖然宜家有各種形式嘅行動同政策 同埋一啲飲食配方 例如食呢樣，唔好食嗰樣 但如果我哋真係想對症下藥 我哋喺處方之前 我哋需要更嚴格嘅科學校證 
"Cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big, and I think there's a role for wood to play in cities. ",簡單嚟講，我哋嘅研究計劃 針對三個大主題或者問題 
"And I feel that way because three billion people in the world today, over the next 20 years, will need a new home. ",第一，我哋食嘅各種食物點樣 透過精密嘅的分子機制 影響新陳代謝、激素同埋酶呢？ 
That's 40 percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next 20 years. ,第二，根據以上答案 人可唔可以對飲食習慣 作出安全而又實際嘅改變呢？ 
"Now, one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum. ",最後，當我哋搵到安全又實際嘅 飲食習慣畀人去跟嘅時候 我哋點樣普及呢一批人嘅行為 而唔係畀人覺得係另類嘅一群呢？ 
That's one billion people in the world live in slums. ,我哋知道應該去做咩嘢 唔代表我哋會做 
A hundred million people in the world are homeless. ,有時候，我哋需要引導人 令研究更加科學化地進行 
The scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people. ,我唔知呢一個旅程嘅終點係點 但最少有一件事係好清楚 就係我哋唔可以好似我以前咁 鬧嗰啲過重同埋患上糖尿病嘅人 
"But the challenge is, as we move to cities, cities are built in these two materials, steel and concrete, and they're great materials. ",佢哋大部分人都想糾正自己 但佢哋需要知道方向點樣行 同埋方向係要可行 
They're the materials of the last century. ,我夢想有一日我哋嘅病人 能夠卸下過重嘅罪名 同埋醫好佢哋嘅抗胰島素 因為作為醫學專家 我哋已經卸下心理包袱 同埋醫好咗抗拒新見解嘅毛病 我哋返返去我哋原本嘅理想： 開放諗法 當昨日嘅觀念唔再啱用 就要有勇氣捨棄昨日嘅觀念 同埋要明白科學無永遠嘅事實 而係不斷演變緊嘅 
But they're also materials with very high energy and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process. ,緊守呢個諗法對我哋病人 同埋科學都有好處 
"Steel represents about three percent of man's greenhouse gas emissions, and concrete is over five percent. ",如果肥胖只係代謝性疾病嘅徵兆 懲罰呢啲有徵兆嘅人 對我哋有咩好處呢？ 
"So if you think about that, eight percent of our contribution to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone. ",有時我會諗返起七年前 喺急症室嗰一晚 
"We don't think about it a lot, and unfortunately, we actually don't even think about buildings, I think, as much as we should. ",我好想再同嗰一位女士傾偈 
This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases. ,我想同佢講我有幾咁內疚 
"Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry, and if we look at energy, it's the same story. ",我會講，作為一個醫生 我提供咗最好嘅臨床護理 但作為一個普通人 我令到你失望 
"You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list, but that's the conversation we mostly hear about. ",你唔需要我嘅批評同埋蔑視 
"And although a lot of that is about energy, it's also so much about carbon. ",你需要嘅係我嘅同情同憐憫 除此之外，你仲需要一個醫生 佢願意考慮︰ 未必係你令社會失望 
"The problem I see is that, ultimately, the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home, and climate change, are a head-on collision about to happen, or already happening. ",而係個社會，包括我在內，令你失望 
"That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways, and I think wood is going to be part of that solution, and I'm going to tell you the story of why. ",如果你而家睇緊呢一個講座 希望你會原諒我 
"As an architect, wood is the only material, big material, that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun. ",（掌聲） 
"When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide, and it dies and it falls to the forest floor, it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground. ",
"If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well. ",呢個係我祖父 
"But if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy, it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration. ",呢個係我個仔 
One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide. ,細個嗰時，爺爺除咗教我木工 佢仲教我一個道理 如果你將樹砍落嚟變成一樣嘢 咁你就要盡力整出 最靚嘅嘢嚟榮耀棵樹 
Now our two solutions to climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage. ,而我個仔提醒咗我 全世界嘅科技產品同玩具 有時候都比唔上一堆小木頭疊高 咁有啟發性 
Wood is the only major material building material I can build with that actually does both those two things. ,呢啲係我參與過嘅建築物 
"So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food, and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes. ",我平時喺溫哥華同紐約嘅辦公室裡邊 參與世界各地嘅建設項目 
"Now, how are we going to do that when we're urbanizing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories? ",視乎我哋喺邊度工作 我哋嘅建築有唔同大小 唔同風格、用唔同材料 
"We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger, and what we've been working on is 30-story tall buildings made of wood. ",但木頭一直係我最喜愛嘅材料 我會講一個木頭嘅故事畀你哋聽 
"We've been engineering them with an engineer named Eric Karsh who works with me on it, and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use, and we call them mass timber panels. ",我鍾意木頭，部分原因係因為 每次人哋走入我設計嘅木製建築 我發覺佢哋嘅反應完全唔一樣 
"These are panels made with young trees, small growth trees, small pieces of wood glued together to make panels that are enormous: eight feet wide, 64 feet long, and of various thicknesses. ",我未見過有人 走入鋼筋水泥建築物去擁抱樁柱 但我就喺木製建築裡面見到呢幕 
"The way I describe this best, I've found, is to say that we're all used to two-by-four construction when we think about wood. ",我睇到人哋點樣掂啲木 我相信呢個背後一定有原因 
That's what people jump to as a conclusion. ,就好似雪花一樣 地球上冇兩塊木係一模一樣嘅 
"Two-by-four construction is sort of like the little eight-dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids, and you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego at that size, and out of two-by-fours. ",所以木係好美妙嘅事 
"But do remember when you were a kid, and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement, and you found that big 24-dot brick of Lego, and you were kind of like, ""Cool, this is awesome. I can build something really big, and this is going to be great."" ",我鍾意將木諗成係 喺我哋建築物上留低嘅大自然足印 
That's the change. ,係大自然嘅足印令建築物 能夠將我哋同大自然連繫起嚟 
Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks. ,宜家我住喺溫哥華，好近一個森林 嗰度嘅樹可以生到 33 層樓咁高 
"They're changing the scale of what we can do, and what we've developed is something we call FFTT, which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to. ",而喺加州海岸嘅紅木林 樹木可以生長到 40 層樓高 
"This animation shows you how the building goes together in a very simple way, but these buildings are available for architects and engineers now to build on for different cultures in the world, different architectural styles and characters. ",但係大多數木建築都只有四層樓高 
"In order for us to build safely, we've engineered these buildings, actually, to work in a Vancouver context, where we're a high seismic zone, even at 30 stories tall. ",喺好多地方，建築法例限制咗我哋 木製樓宇唔能夠高過四層樓 包括美國 
"Now obviously, every time I bring this up, people even, you know, here at the conference, say, ""Are you serious? Thirty stories? How's that going to happen?"" ",宜家已經有例外 我覺得需要有例外嘅情況 而且我希望法例會改 
And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report. ,我之所以咁諗係因為 今日世界一半嘅人口住喺城市 而呢數字仲會增長到 75% 
"I'm just going to focus on a few of them, and let's start with fire, because I think fire is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now. ",城市同人口密度代表 我哋嘅建築將會愈嚟愈大 而木材會喺城市裏面扮演一個角色 
Fair enough. ,我咁諗係因為世界有三十億人 會喺未來二十年需要一個新嘅家 
And the way I describe it is this. ,就啫係話，未來廿年 新嘅建築物需要興建 去迎合世界 40% 人口嘅需要 
"If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire, it doesn't happen, right? We all know that. ",今日，城市裏邊每三個人 就有一個住喺貧民窟裡邊 
"But to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up, and eventually you can add the log to the fire, and when you do add the log to the fire, of course, it burns, but it burns slowly. ",全世界有十億人住緊喺貧民窟 
"Well, mass timber panels, these new products that we're using, are much like the log. ",一億人無家可歸 
"It's hard to start them on fire, and when they do, they actually burn extraordinarily predictably, and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel. ",建築師同社會面對嘅挑戰 就係要為呢啲人搵到棲身之所 
"The next big issue, deforestation. ",但問題在於，當我哋搬到城市 而城市通常以兩種物料起成︰ 鋼筋同水泥 呢兩種都係好好嘅材料 
Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation. ,但係佢哋係上世紀嘅建材 
The last thing we want to do is cut down trees. ,需要好多能源去生產佢哋 仲會喺生造過程中釋放大量溫室氣體 
"Or, the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees. ",鋼材佔咗人類溫室氣體排放量嘅 3% 水泥就佔咗 5% 以上 
"There are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly, and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems. ",所以諗諗，今日溫室氣體排放量嘅 8% 係嚟自呢兩種建材 
Now I actually think that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation. ,我哋冇諗過呢樣嘢好多 我哋冇成日諗下建築究竟要點 
"In countries with deforestation issues, we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encourage people to make money through very fast growth cycles -- 10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale. ",呢度係一份美國有關溫室氣體嘅統計 
We've calculated a 20-story building: We'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes. ,差唔多半數排放量嚟自建造業 能源用量方面，情況都係差唔多 
That's how much it takes. ,我哋成日講交通，但係交通只係排第二 
The carbon story here is a really good one. ,雖然好多時啲嘢都係同能源問題有關 但係碳排放同樣重要 
"If we built a 20-story building out of cement and concrete, the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide. ",我覺得問題最終係 我哋該點樣同時解決 三十億人嘅房屋需求 而又關照到氣候 其實呢個問題正喺度發生緊 
"If we did it in wood, in this solution, we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes, for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes. ",呢個問題代表我哋要創新 所以我會覺得木材將會係對策嘅一部分 我會話畀你知點解 
That's the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year. ,作為一位建築師，木材係唯一一種 我可以使用、兼靠太陽生成嘅大型建材 
"Think back to that three billion people that need a new home, and maybe this is a contributor to reducing. ",森林裡面嘅樹生長 放出氧氣、吸入二氧化碳 當樹木死咗瞓喺地下時 佢哋會將二氧化碳釋放返去 大氣層或者泥土裏面 
"We're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope, in the way we build, because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more. ",如果樹木遇上山火 碳都會重新釋放到大氣層 
"But the challenge is changing society's perception of possibility, and it's a huge challenge. ",但如果你將木頭攞嚟起屋 或者做傢俬、玩具 咁樣其實可以封存到好多碳 
"The engineering is, truthfully, the easy part of this. ",一立方米嘅木頭可以儲存一噸二氧化碳 
And the way I describe it is this. ,我哋控制氣候嘅兩個方法係 減少溫室氣體排放同搵碳嘅儲存空間 
"The first skyscraper, technically -- and the definition of a skyscraper is 10 stories tall, believe it or not — but the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago, and people were terrified to walk underneath this building. ",木頭係主要唯一一種 能夠同時做到以上兩個方法嘅建材 
"But only four years after it was built, Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower, and as he built the Eiffel Tower, he changed the skylines of the cities of the world, changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago, where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering. ",以前，我哋一直相信地球 會製造我哋嘅食物 今個世紀，我哋需要相信 地球會製造我哋嘅家 
"We built this model in New York, actually, as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come, and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like, because the exterior can change. ",當城市化嘅速度係咁快 而我哋慣性諗木建築 最多只有四層高時 我哋可以點做到用木起樓呢？ 
"The reason we picked it is because this is a technical university, and I believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material I can build with. ",我哋要減少鋼材同水泥嘅用量 同時要興建更大嘅木建築 我哋正籌備緊起一啲三十層高嘅木大廈 
"It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent, and we don't really feel comfortable with it. ",我哋同工程師 Eric Karsh 合作 我哋合作做呢個項目係因為 我哋有新嘅木製品可以用 我哋叫呢啲做巨型木嵌板 
"But that's the way it should be, nature's fingerprints in the built environment. ",呢啲嵌板將年幼嘅樹 生得唔高嘅樹、細片嘅木 集合埋一齊變成咗大型嘅嵌板 八呎乘六十四呎，備有唔同厚度 
"I'm looking for this opportunity to create an Eiffel Tower moment, we call it. ",要形容呢樣嘢最好嘅方式係咁： 我哋平時諗到嘅木都係 2X4 規格 
Buildings are starting to go up around the world. ,於是大家好容易就會話木係 2X4 
"There's a building in London that's nine stories, a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is 10 or 11. ",2X4 規格似係細個 玩八個點嘅樂高積木 你可以用咁大嘅樂高積木 造出千變萬化有趣嘅嘢 
"We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings, and we're hoping, and I'm hoping, that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially announces the world's tallest at around 20 stories in the not-so-distant future. ",但你哋記得細路嗰時 你哋喺地牢摷嚟摷去 可能摷到一個有二十四點嘅積木 你會諗︰ 「酷，咁我可以起一個好大嘅嘢𡀔， 整咗出嚟一定好正。」 
"That Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling, these arbitrary ceilings of height, and allow wood buildings to join the competition. ",於是事情唔一樣 
And I believe the race is ultimately on. ,巨型木嵌板就似嗰塊有廿四點嘅積木 
Thank you. ,佢改變咗我哋起樓嘅規模 我哋研發出一個叫 FFTT 嘅嘢 佢係一個開放部分使用權嘅產品 可以用嚟起各式各樣嘅建築 我哋可以用呢啲大型木建材板 每次最多起六層樓 
(Applause) ,呢個動畫顯示啲建築物 點樣好簡單嘅連埋一齊 呢啲建築無論咩文化同建築風格都啱 
,為咗起嘅時候安全 我哋特別設計令呢啲大廈 適合溫哥華嘅環境 就係即使有三十層樓高，都有抗震能力 
Good morning! ,當然，每次當我提起呢個 人哋都會問︰ 「你係認真嘅？三十層？點可能？」 
Are you awake? ,啲人問咗好多好好、好重要嘅問題 我哋都花咗一段時間解答問題 同埋將問題寫喺我哋嘅報告上面 
"They took my name tag, but I wanted to ask you, did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic? ",我只會講其中幾個問題 先講下防火，因為我覺得 防火係大家第一個諗到嘅問題 
"Anyone! No one? All right, no problem. ",呢個唔難理解 
"Once upon a time, not long ago, I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend, ordering food. ",我會咁樣講 
"So I looked at the waiter and said, ""Do you have a menu (Arabic)?"" ",如果我請你點著一枝火柴 再將佢點著一轆木 轆木唔會著，啱唔啱？ 
"He looked at me strangely, thinking that he misheard. ",我哋都知道唔會點著 但要點燃一樣嘢，你必須從細塊開始 慢慢由細燒起 最後至將大塊嘅加到火裏邊 所以當你放轆木去燒嘅時候 佢當然會燒啦，但係會燒得好慢 
"He said, ""Sorry? (English)."" ",而我哋用緊嘅呢個新產品，巨型木嵌板 就好似大塊嘅木咁，佢哋好難燃燒 
"I said, ""The menu (Arabic), please."" ",而且當佢哋燒起上嚟嘅時候 火勢會出奇地預測得到 所以我哋可以用防火嘅科學知識 嚟預測火勢 並將木製大廈設計得 同水泥鋼材大廈一樣安全 
"He replied, ""Don't you know what they call it?"" ",第二個大問題︰森林資源 
I do. ,全球溫室氣體排放量嘅 18% 嚟自採伐森林 
"He said, ""No! It's called ""menu"" (English), or ""menu"" (French)."" ",斬樹係我哋最後嘅方案 
Is the French pronunciation correct? ,應該咁講，我哋最後先至考慮斬樹 
"Come, come, take care of this one! said the waiter. ",現今嘅幾種可持續嘅伐木模式 畀我哋有節制咁取得木材 而斬得嘅樹都必須要適合呢套系統 
"He was disgusted when talking to me, as if he was saying to himself, ""If this was the last girl on Earth, I wouldn't look at her!"" ",我覺得呢啲諗法會改變伐木嘅經濟模式 
"What's the meaning of saying ""menu"" in Arabic? ",喺受伐木問題困擾嘅國家 我哋需要畀到森林最大嘅價值 並鼓勵大家利用 樹木快速生長週期去賺錢 十年、十二年、十五年嘅樹木 都可以用嚟製造呢啲嵌板 同畀我哋大規模咁起樓 
Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant. ,我哋計過一幢廿層嘅建築 只需要北美洲十三分鐘長出嘅木 
How could she speak that way? ,我哋需要嘅就係咁多 
"At that moment, I started thinking. ",呢個就係好嘅碳故事 
It made me mad. ,"但如果我哋起一幢 廿層高嘅鋼材水泥大廈 水泥生產過程將會排出 1,200 噸二氧化碳 "
It definitely hurts! ,"如果我哋以木嚟起 我哋可以封存到 3,100 噸二氧化碳 即係話，兩者嘅二氧化碳排放量 相差 4,300 噸 "
I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country? ,差唔多等於 900 部車一年嘅排放量 
Where could this happen? ,諗諗嗰三十億需要新屋嘅人 或者呢個方法可以減少碳排放 
How did we get here? ,我希望我哋宜家會 喺建築革命嘅起步階段 因為呢個會係起摩天大廈嘅最新方法 
"Well, while we are here, there are many people like me, who would reach a stage in their lives, where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past, just so they can say that they're modern and civilized. ",但最大嘅考驗係嚟自社會 對於創新冒險嘅心態 而且呢個考驗好大 
"Should I forget all my culture, thoughts, intellect and all my memories? ",工程嘅部分，老實講係好容易嘅 
Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war! ,我會咁講 
"Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform? ",摩天大廈最初技術上嘅定義 講你都唔相信︰ 凡係十層或以上高嘅樓都算係 呢座係芝加哥嘅第一座摩天大廈 當時人哋經過佢下面都會驚 
To be one of them? ,但喺佢建成後嘅短短四年 艾菲爾起咗巴黎鐵塔 而且佢起鐵塔嘅時候 佢改變咗全世界城市嘅天際線 促使好似紐約同芝加哥 咁嘅城市開始競爭 開始起愈嚟愈大嘅建築 將天際線愈推愈高 亦令到工程學嘅知識 亦都愈嚟愈成熟 
Where's the logic in that? ,我哋喺紐約為明日一所理工大學嘅校園 整咗呢個建築模型 我哋揀呢個項目做例子 等你可以睇到呢啲建築會係點嘅樣 外觀可以改，所以我哋只係講佢嘅結構 
"Despite all that, I tried to understand him. ",我哋揀呢個嘅原因係 佢係一間理工大學 而且我相信木材係最先進嘅材料 
I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me. ,因為只有大自然至擁有佢嘅專利 但對於呢點我哋無法接受 
The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs. ,但正因為咁 我哋嘅建築裏面 應該要有大自然嘅痕跡 
"It's not a language for science, research, a language we're used to in universities, a language we use in the workplace, a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project, and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport. ",我正喺度搵緊一個機會 締造另一個「巴黎鐵塔時刻」 
"If we did so, they'd strip us of our clothes. ",當世界各地嘅建築愈嚟愈高 
"Where can I use it, then? We could all ask this question! ",倫敦有一幢九層高嘅木製樓 澳洲都有一座新嘅木製樓 大概十至十一層樓高 
"So, you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so? ",呢一刻，我哋開始將木建築愈起愈高 我哋希望，我都希望 我嘅城市溫哥華 可以喺不久嘅將來 起到二十層高嘅全球最高木建築 
This is one reality. ,下一個「巴黎鐵塔時刻」 會打破木建築以往嘅高度 然後同水泥鋼筋大廈一齊比天高 
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about. ,我相信呢場競爭終有一日會開始 
Arabic is the mother tongue. ,多謝 
Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue. ,（掌聲） 
Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages. ,
How? ,早晨！ 
"Gibran Khalil Gibran, when he first started writing, he used Arabic. ",大家瞓醒未呀？ 
"All his ideas, imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up, smelling a specific smell, hearing a specific voice, and thinking a specific thought. ",佢哋收走咗我塊名牌 但我想問下大家 有冇人係用阿拉伯文寫塊名牌㗎？ 
"So, when he started writing in English, he had enough baggage. ",有冇呀？冇？ 好啦，唔緊要 
"Even when he wrote in English, when you read his writings in English, you smell the same smell, sense the same feeling. ",冇幾耐之前 我同個朋友去間餐廳食嘢 
"You can imagine that that's him writing in English, the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon. ",我用阿拉伯話問個侍應︰ 「有冇餐牌可以睇睇？」 
"So, this is an example no one can argue with. ",佢好奇怪咁望實我，好似聽錯咗咁款 
"Second, it's often said that if you want to kill a nation, the only way to kill a nation, is to kill its language. ",佢用英文講︰「咩話？」 
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of. ,我話︰「（阿拉伯話）餐牌，唔該。」 
"The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese, all these nations are aware of this. ",佢答返話︰ 「乜你唔知呢份嘢叫咩名㗎咩？」 
That's why they legislate to protect their language. ,我話：「我知。」 
They make it sacred. ,佢話︰「你根本就唔知！ 份嘢叫做（英文）『餐牌』， 
"That's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it. ",又或者（法文）『餐牌』！」 我啲法文準唔準呀？ 
Do we know better than them? ,個侍應就同個同事講︰ 「嚟嚟嚟，呢張枱你搞掂佢！」 
"All right, we aren't from the developed world, this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet, and we would like to catch up with the civilized world. ",同我講嘢嗰陣，佢一臉不屑 好似同緊自己講： 「就算地球剩返佢一個女人， 我都唔會睺佢！」 
"Countries that were once like us, but decided to strive for development, do research, and catch up with those countries, such as Turkey, Malaysia and others, they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder, protected it like a diamond. ",咁用阿拉伯文講「餐牌」 有乜咁大件事呢？ 
They kept it close to them. ,呢兩粒字就足以 令一個黎巴嫩嘅後生仔覺得 一個女人落後無知 
"Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish, then it isn't a local product. ",「有乜理由用阿拉伯話㗎？」 
You wouldn't believe it's a local product. ,嗰一刻，我個腦係咁轉 
"They'd go back to being consumers, clueless consumers, like we are most of the time. ",愈諗愈嬲 
"So, in order for them to innovate and produce, they had to protect their language. ",我覺得好委屈！ 
"If I say, ""Freedom, sovereignty, independence (Arabic),"" what does this remind you of? ",我喺自己國家 講自己母語嘅權利都被剝奪？ 
"It doesn't ring a bell, does it? ",咁嘅事都有？ 
"Regardless of the who, how and why. ",點解會變成咁㗎？ 
"Language isn't just for conversing, just words coming out of our mouths. ",喺呢度，有好多人同我一樣？ 佢哋人生行到嚟某個階段 被迫放棄自己嘅根？ 先能夠證明畀人哋睇 自己係有文化、有地位 
"Language represents specific stages in our lives, and terminology that is linked to our emotions. ",我係咪要抹走晒我嘅生活方式 思想、知識同記憶呢？ 
"So when we say, ""Freedom, sovereignty, independence,"" each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind, there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period. ",戰亂嘅時候，童年回憶可能 就成為我哋最大嘅情感寄託！ 
"Language isn't one, two or three words or letters put together. ",為咗合群，我就要抹走晒 我母語賜畀我嘅所有嘢？ 
"It's an idea inside that relates to how we think, and how we see each other and how others see us. ",然後隨波逐流？ 
What is our intellect? ,究竟道理何在？ 
How do you say whether this guy understands or not? ,撇除呢堆諗法 我都想去理解呢個侍應 
"So, if I say, ""Freedom, sovereignty, independence (English),"" or if your son came up to you and said, ""Dad, have you lived through the period of the freedom (English) slogan?"" ",雖然佢用歧視嘅目光睇我 但我唔想掉轉頭批判返佢 
How would you feel? ,阿拉伯話滿足唔到當今嘅需要 
"If you don't see a problem, then I'd better leave, and stop talking in vain. ",做科研唔會用到佢 大學課堂同職場上唔會用佢 做高級研究亦用唔著佢 喺機場就更加唔在講啦 
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing. ,咁做嘅話 啲人肯定會搜我哋身都似 
I have a francophone friend who's married to a French man. ,咁仲有邊度可以？ 我哋好應該反思一下 
I asked her once how things were going. ,你要我哋用阿拉伯話 但邊度先用得到呢？ 
"She said, ""Everything is fine, but once, I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him."" ",事實擺在眼前 
"(Laughter) (Applause) The poor woman had mistakenly told him ""toqborni,"" and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him. ",但有一樣嘢更需要我哋思考 
"He was puzzled by the thought: ""How could anyone be this cruel? ",阿拉伯話係我哋嘅母語 
Does she want to commit suicide? ,研究話，想掌握其他語言 首先要掌握好母語 
"'Bury me?' (English)"" This is one of the few examples. ",如果想用其他語言做創作 前提係要掌握好母語 
"It made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband, since he won't understand, and he's right not to; his way of thinking is different. ",點解？ 
"She said to me, ""He listens to Fairuz with me, and one night, I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz."" ",黎巴嫩詩人 Gibran Khalil Gibran 第一次創作就係用阿拉伯文 
"The poor woman tried to translate this for him: ""From them I extended my hands and stole you --"" (Laughter) And here's the pickle: ""And because you belong to them, I returned my hands and left you."" ",佢嘅所有諗法、想像同感悟 都嚟自佢細個喺村莊裡面 聞過、聽過、思考過嘅嘢 
(Laughter) Translate that for me. ,所以當佢開始用英文創作嘅時候 佢彈藥充足 
"(Applause) So, what have we done to protect the Arabic language? ",即使佢寫嘅係英文 你睇嘅係英文 味道質感同樣依舊 
"We turned this into a concern of the civil society, and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language. ",你會想像得到用英文寫作嘅佢 依然係嗰個喺黎巴嫩山長大嘅男仔 
"Even though many people told me, ""Why do you bother? ",呢個例子毋庸置疑 
"Forget about this headache and go have fun."" ",第二，啲人經常話 要一個國家滅亡 唯一方法就係消滅佢嘅語言 
No problem! ,發達國家亦意識到呢個現實 
"The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says, ""I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West."" ",德國、法國、日本、中國 呢啲國家都深明呢個道理 
"We didn't say, ""No! We do not accept this or that."" ",因此佢哋會立法保護佢哋嘅語言 
"We didn't adopt this style because that way, we wouldn't be understood. ",佢哋令自己嘅母語變得有地位 
"And when someone talks to me that way, I hate the Arabic language. ",所以當地人好多時都會用到母語 佢哋花好多錢發展佢哋嘅語言 
"We say-- (Applause) We want to change our reality, and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life. ",我哋比佢哋更清楚語言嗎？ 
In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do. ,好 我哋嘅國家唔發達 民智未開 但我哋要追上世界文明嘅步伐 
"So, ""I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West"" has hit the spot. ",有啲曾經同我哋同樣景況嘅國家 努力發展同做科研 去趕上發達國家 譬如如土耳其、馬來西亞 喺發展嘅同時，佢哋捍衞自己嘅語言 珍而重之咁去捍衞 
"Something very easy, yet creative and persuasive. ",佢哋始終冇離棄過自己嘅語言 
"After that, we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground. ",所以如果你喺土耳其買嘢 見到標籤冇土耳其文 嗰樣嘢一定唔係當地物產 
"You've seen an example of it outside, a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with ""Don't kill your language!"" written on it. ",你亦唔會相信係當地物產 
"Why? Seriously, don't kill your language. ",以至商人會從消費者出發 代入返我哋呢班消費者嘅思維 
We really shouldn't kill our language. ,所以為咗創新同生產 佢哋需要捍衞自己嘅語言 
"If we were to kill the language, we'd have to find an identity. ",如果我講 「（英語）自由、尊嚴、獨立」 你會諗到乜嘢？ 
We'd have to find an existence. ,冇共鳴，係咪？ 
We'd go back to the beginning. ,無論從邊個、點樣同點解嘅方向諗 始終都係冇共鳴 
This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized. ,語言唔係剩係用嚟傾偈 唔係齋係由我哋口裡面講出嚟嘅字 
After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter. ,語言標誌住我哋人生嘅不同階段 盛載住一啲牽動我哋情感嘅詞語 
"Photos of ""cool"" guys and girls. ",所以當我哋講「自由、尊嚴、獨立」 你哋個個腦海中都會畫咗一幅畫 你會聯想起某個歷史時刻 勾起某種情感 
We are very cool! ,語言並唔係幾個單字拼湊埋一齊 
"I say, ""No! I adopt the word 'cool.'"" Let them object however they want, but give me a word that's nicer and matches the reality better. ",語言係關乎我哋點樣思考 
"I will keep on saying ""Internet"" I wouldn't say: ""I'm going to the world wide web"" (Laughs) Because it doesn't fit! We shouldn't kid ourselves. ",我哋點睇其他人 其他人又點睇我哋 
"But to reach this point, we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language, to control us or make us think and feel what they want. ",咁樣，智力係指乜嘢？ 你會點樣判斷人 明唔明白一樣嘢、聰唔聰明？ 
Creativity is the idea. ,如果我講「（英語）自由、尊嚴、獨立」 然後你個仔同你講 「爸爸，你經歷過 （英語）自由標語嘅時代嗎？」 
"So, if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on, we can be creative. ",你會有咩感覺？ 
"At this moment, every one of you is a creative project. ",如果你唔覺得有問題 咁我都唔應該再講落去，費事嘥氣 
Creativity in your mother tongue is the path. ,啱啱嘅對話令我諗起一件事 
Let's start from this moment. ,我有個識得講法文嘅朋友 嫁畀咗一個法國人 
Let's write a novel or produce a short film. ,有一次我問佢近況如何 
A single novel could make us global again. ,佢話︰「一切都好好，但就有一次， 我花咗成晚去向我老公解釋 阿拉伯文裡面『toqborni』嘅意思。」 
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 呢個可憐嘅女人唔小心 同佢講咗「toqborni」 之後花咗成晚解釋個字 
"So, it's not true that there's no solution; there is a solution! ",佢丈夫好困惑： 「（英語）點解會有人咁長氣 講個字嘅解釋呢？ 
"But we have to know that, and be convinced that a solution exists, that we have a duty to be part of that solution. ",佢想殺死我嗎？」 
"In conclusion, what can you do today? ",呢個只係其中一例咋 我個朋友冇可能會解釋得到 
"Now, tweets, who's tweeting? ",因為佢老公實唔會明 唔明亦好合理 因為兩個思維唔一樣 
"Please, I beg of you, even though my time has finished, either Arabic, English, French or Chinese. ",我朋友同我講： 「佢會陪我一齊聽 黎巴嫩歌手 Fairuz 啲歌。 有一晚，我嘗試譯畀佢聽， 等佢體會下 我聽 Fairuz 嗰陣嘅感覺。」 
But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers! ,呢個可憐嘅女人嘗試咁樣譯： 「由佢哋，我伸隻手出嚟， 偷你嘅 ——」 （笑聲） 呢句仲棘手： 「因為你屬於佢哋， 我收返隻手，離開你」 
(Applause) It's a disaster! That's not a language. ,（笑聲） 唔該你哋譯咗佢嘞！ 
You'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language. ,（掌聲） 為咗阿拉伯話，我哋做過啲咩？ 
It's not easy to come back from such a place and rise. ,我哋令社會關注語言保護 我哋發起咗一場運動保護阿拉伯話 
That's the first thing we can do. ,雖然好多人同我講 「你點解要攞苦嚟辛呢？ 
"Second, there are many other things that we can do. ",咪掂呢啲麻煩嘢啦， 輕鬆過下咪算囉。」 
We're not here today to convince each other. ,冇所謂！ 
We're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language. ,呢個運動有個口號： 「我從東方向你說話， 你從西方回答我。」 
Now I will tell you a secret. ,我哋冇話： 「唔得！我哋唔認同呢樣嗰樣。」 
A baby first identifies its father through language. ,我哋冇咁樣講 咁樣盞更加冇人明白我哋 
"When my daughter is born, I'll tell her, ""This is your father, honey (Arabic)."" ",如果有人咁同我講嘢 我會憎咗呢個語言 
"I wouldn't say, ""This is your dad, honey (English)."" ",我哋… （掌聲） 我哋想改變現狀 想堅守我哋嘅夢想、抱負同生活方式 
"And in the supermarket, I promise my daughter Noor, that if she says to me, ""Thanks (Arabic),"" I won't say, ""Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'"" and hope no one has heard her. ",就只係咁樣 
(Applause) Let's get rid of this cultural cringe. ,所以我哋話「我從東方向你說話， 你從西方回答我」 
(Applause) ,呢句話講中曬 
,呢句口號好簡單 但就好有創意同說服力 嗰次之後，我哋又發起另一個運動 我哋喺地下堆砌一啲字母出嚟 
I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before: What is possible with the human voice? ,你喺出面都睇到其中一個作品 一個字母被黑色同黃色膠紙圍封住 上面寫著「唔好殺死你嘅語言！」 
(Beatboxing) ? Ooh baby ? ? baby ? ? baby ? ? baby ? (Baby crying) ? baby ? (Baby crying) ? baby ? (Cat meowing) (Dog barking) Yeah. ,點解？ 真係唔好毀滅你嘅語言 
"(Applause) (Boomerang noises) It was coming straight for me. I had to. It was, yeah. ",我哋真係唔應該殺死我哋嘅母語 
"As you can probably well imagine, I was a strange child. ",如果我哋失去咗我哋嘅母語 我哋就要搵返我哋嘅身份 
"(Laughter) Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be. ",我哋就要搵返我哋存在嘅意義 
I was constantly experimenting with these noises. ,以至到我哋要從頭開始 
And I'm still on that mission. ,我哋仲會失去造就現代文明社會嘅機會 
I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. ,之後，我哋發佈咗小朋友 身穿阿拉伯字母嘅相 
"And the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it can't do. ",相裏面我哋用到 cool（酷）呢個英文字 
And there's things that no one's voice can do. ,但如果有人話 「哈！你用咗英文嘅字！」 
"For example, no one can do two notes at the same time. ",我會答返 「唔係！我只係將 cool 呢個字 融會落去阿拉伯文。」 但如果佢哋堅持要反對就又得佢哋啦 我剩係知道我需要 更好、更切合現實嘅詞語 
"You can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... ",所以我會繼續話「互聯網」 而唔會話「我要去上世界萬維網」 （笑聲） 因為嗰個字同現實脫節！ 我哋唔應該喺度自欺欺人 
(Two-tone singing) But that's cheating. ,但係講到呢度，我哋都應該認同 唔能夠畀任何有勢力過我哋 或者喺語言方面比我哋話得事嘅人 控制我哋，逼我哋行佢哋嗰套 
And it hurts your throat. ,創意係關鍵 
"So there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me. ",即便我哋上唔到太空 唔能夠造到支火箭等等 我哋仍然可以有創意 
"If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it. ",到呢一刻，你哋每個人 都係一個創意嘅項目 
"So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine. ",你母語裏面蘊含嘅創造力 就係我哋要遵循嘅道路 
"We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me. ",等我哋由宜家開始 
And I'm going to show you what it can do. ,寫一部小說，拍一齣微電影 
"And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice, I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice. ",一本小說就可能令我哋重新喺世界出名 
"This system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind. ",佢可能令阿拉伯語重返世界第一語言 
"So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple. ",邊個話冇出路！我哋有辦法！ 
So the polyphony problem: I've only got one voice. ,但係我哋必須知道而且相信我哋有辦法 同埋我哋有責任去執行呢啲辦法 
How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time. ,總結嚟講，你今日可以做啲咩？ 
The simplest way to do it is something like this. ,宜家，推特 邊個宜家喺度發緊推特貼文？ 
(Beatboxing) By dancing. It's like this. ,拜託，我求你 雖然我演講嘅時間好快完 唔理你用阿拉伯文、英文 法文，定係中文 
(Music) Thanks. ,請唔好喺發阿拉伯文時 夾雜拉丁字母同數字！ 
(Applause) So that's probably the easiest way. ,（掌聲） 如果你咁做嘅話，係非常大鑊嘅！ 因為你唔係用緊語言 
"But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up. ",你只係喺虛擬世界用緊虛擬語言 
"There's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like. ",而且要由虛擬語言返返嚟係難嘅 
"So I'm going to start another beat for you, like this. ",呢個係我哋可以做嘅第一件事 
"(Beatboxing) There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want. ",第二，仲有好多事可以做 
You don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. ,我哋今天嚟到呢度唔係爲咗說服彼此 
"(Music) And now, a rockabilly guitar. ",而係爲咗令大家注意到 保護阿拉伯語有幾重要 
"Which is nice. But what if I want to make, say, a -- (Applause) -- Thanks. What if I want to make, say, a rock organ? ",宜家我要話畀你哋知一個秘密 
"Is that possible? Yes, it is, by recording myself like this. ",嬰兒係通過語言第一次認出父親 
"(Organ sound) And now I have that, I have that recorded. ",當我個囡出生時，我會同佢講： 「（阿拉伯語）呢個係你爸爸，囡囡。」 
Assign it to a keyboard. ,我唔會話： 「（英語）呢個係你爸爸，囡囡。」 
(Music) So that's cool. ,喺超級市場，我同我個女 Noor 保證 如果佢用阿拉伯文同我講「多謝」 我唔會用法文同佢講 「你應該講『多謝你，媽咪』」 然後希望冇人剛才聽到佢講阿拉伯語 
(Applause) But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd? ,（掌聲） 我哋一齊嚟擺脫文化上嘅卑躬屈膝！ 唔好再為我哋嘅文化而自卑！ 
"Impossible, you say. No. ",（掌聲） 
"It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out. ",
(Music) So every noise you can hear there is my voice. ,我想各位 問自己一個你可能從來未問過嘅問題 人類嘅聲音有可以做到啲咩？ 
I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that. ,（節奏口技） ♪ 哦奀咕 ♪ ♪ 奀咕 ♪ ♪ 奀咕 ♪ ♪ 奀咕 ♪（嬰兒哭聲） ♪ 奀咕 ♪（嬰兒哭聲） ♪ 奀咕 ♪（貓叫） （狗吠） 耶！ 
There's no samples. There's no synthesizers. ,（掌聲） （迴旋鏢聲） 頭先嗰啲全部都係嚟自我嘅聲音 
"That is literally all my voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you, what's the point? ",冇錯，真係嚟自我 所以你哋大概都可以想像到 我細個係一個好奇怪嘅細路 
"Why do this? (Laughter) Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd, I suppose, is the easy answer. ",（笑聲） 原因係 我一路都嘗試 令我嘅聲音做到最多嘅嘢 
"But in actual fact, I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist. ",我一直以嚟都喺度試緊呢啲聲音 
I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine. ,我到宜家仍然喺度試緊 
"So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see. ",我仍然探索緊我可以發到嘅聲音 
(Voice effects) (Music) Like this. ,但係，我宜家已經大個咗同埋聰明咗 我知道有啲聲音 係我永遠都冇辦法發出嘅 因為礙於身體嘅局限 所以有啲嘢係我做唔到嘅 
"(Music) So, loosely defined, that is what's possible with the human voice. ",而且，有啲嘢係人把聲無可能做到嘅 
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. ",譬如，冇人可以同一個時間唱兩個音 
(Applause) ,你可以好似僧侶咁唱兩個音，即係︰ 
,（複調唱法） 但係咁樣嘅唱法 係同時間唱兩個音 
"In an age of global strife and climate change, I'm here to answer the all important question: Why is sex so damn good? ",而且會傷害你嘅喉嚨 
"If you're laughing, you know what I mean. ",所以有啲嘢你係冇辦法做嘅 人嘅聲音有局限呢樣嘢一直都困擾住我 因為節奏口技雖然係最好方式 將你音樂嘅諗法帶出嚟 但係佢哋最多只係簡單嘅音樂 所以令我好困擾 
"Now, before we get to that answer, let me tell you about Chris Hosmer. ",然後我假設有一種方法 可以將音樂嘅諗法完全咁表達出嚟 而唔受身體所限制 
"Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days, but secretly, I hate him. ",於是我同呢啲人合作 我哋整咗部機器 
"Here's why. Back in university, we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks. ",我哋做咗一個系統 基本上係一個實時嘅生產機器 一個實時嘅音樂製作機器 我只需要用自己把聲 即時創作出我腦海入邊聽到嘅音樂 而唔再受到身體限制 
Here's my clock. ,我宜家會示範佢可以做啲乜嘢 
"It uses something called the dwarf sunflower, which grows to about 12 inches in height. ",喺我用佢整聲音 同埋用佢編輯我把聲之前 我想講多次，所有你會聽到嘅聲音 都通過我把聲造出嚟嘅 
"Now, as you know, sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day. ",呢個系統有… 唔該你，助手 呢個系統本身唔會自己發聲 所以佢冇錄音範本可以用 
"So in the morning, you see which direction the sunflower is facing, and you mark it on the blank area in the base. ",當呢部機運作 當佢開始轉換我把聲嘅時候 聽起上嚟嘅人聲音就會冇咁似人聲 但係，出嚟嘅始終係人聲嚟 我逐步示範畀你哋睇 我哋由簡單嘅開始 
"At noon, you mark the changed position of the sunflower, and in the evening again, and that's your clock. ",首先係複調音樂問題，我只有一把聲 
"Now, I know my clock doesn't tell you the exact time, but it does give you a general idea using a flower. ",咁我點可以做到 同一個時間有多個唔同嘅聲音？ 
"So, in my completely unbiased, subjective opinion, it's brilliant. ",最簡單嘅方法就好似咁︰ 
"However, here's Chris's clock. ",（節奏口技） 通過舞蹈，就會好似咁︰ 
It's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one. ,（音樂） 多謝 
In each shot glass is a different scented oil. ,（掌聲） 呢個可能係最簡單嘅方法 
"In the morning, the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass, focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath. ",但係如果你想做得更加即時 又或者想做實時循環 做唔到嘅嘢 你有其他方法鋪你把聲上去 
"This will warm up the scented oil inside, and a particular smell will be emitted. ",譬如有音調轉移 我會畀大家聽下呢啲聲音係點樣嘅 
"A couple of hours later, the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass, and a different smell will be emitted. ",我會打另一段拍子，好似咁 
"So during the course of the day, five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment. ",（節奏口技） 一開始都會有少少嘅舞蹈 因為咁樣好得意 如果你可以鍾意嘅話 可以跟住一齊打節拍 
Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell. ,宜家聽下我加低音 
You can see why I hate Chris. ,（音樂） 跟住，加搖滾吉他 
"I thought my idea was pretty good, but his idea is genius, and at the time, I knew his idea was better than mine, but I just couldn't explain why. ",個音出嚟好好 但係如果我想做，譬如話…（掌聲） 多謝。假設我想做，例如，搖滾風琴？ 
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose. ,有冇可能呢？係可以嘅 只要好我咁樣錄低我把聲 
This problem's been bugging me for well over a decade. ,（風琴聲） 跟住，宜家我有頭先嗰個錄音 
"All right, let's get back to the question of why sex is so good. ",我擺佢到時間軸上邊 
"Many years after the solar powered clocks project, a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses. ",（音樂） 咁樣就得啦 
"And when she said this, I had an epiphany. ",（掌聲） 但係，如果我想要聽起嚟 好似成支 Pink Floyd 樂隊咁？ 
So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses. ,冇可能，你哋覺得，冇可能 
"To do this, I devised something called the five senses graph. ",係有可能嘅，而且你可以用呢部機 非常簡單就做到。真係好神奇。聽下 
"Along the y-axis, you have a scale from zero to 10, and along the x-axis, you have, of course, the five senses. ",（音樂） 所以所有你聽得到嘅聲音 都係嚟自我把聲 
"Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life, I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary. ",我整咗呢啲聲音 
Here's a quick video to show you how it works. ,我係冇用到樣本音樂，冇合成 
"(Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop, and today, I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses. Hey! ",所有都係經過修改嘅我把聲 當你明白咗製作過程，你一定會問 做呢啲嘢做咩？ 
"Bike designer: This is [unclear], custom bike designer. ",點解要咁做？（笑聲） 我諗簡單嘅答案係 因為平過你去請成支 Pink Floyd 
(Motorcyle revving) [Sound] [Touch] [Sight] [Smell] [Taste] JL: And that's how the five senses graph works. ,但係事實上 我仲未整到一部 模仿已經存在咗嘅嘢嘅機器 
"Now, for a period of three years, I gathered data, not just me but also some of my friends, and I used to teach in university, so I forced my -- I mean, I asked my students to do this as well. ",於是我整咗呢部可以發出 任何我可以想像到嘅聲音 
So here are some other results. ,你哋批准嘅話 我宜家就會表演我腦海入邊嘅嘢 我希望你哋會鍾意啦 但我知道當佢哋本身非比尋常 而且你哋做緊啲嘢好似呢樣咁奇呢時 你哋會好難相信呢啲全部都係我把聲 
The first is for instant noodles. ,（聲音效果） （音樂） 好似咁 
"Now obviously, taste and smell are quite high, but notice sound is at three. ",（音樂） 呢個就係人類聲做到嘅嘢 
Many people told me a big part of the noodle-eating experience is the slurping noise. ,好多謝各位 
"You know. (Slurps) Needless to say, I no longer dine with these people. ",（掌聲） 
"OK, next, clubbing. ",
"OK, here what I found interesting was that taste is at four, and many respondents told me it's because of the taste of drinks, but also, in some cases, kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience. ",喺呢個全球衝突多同氣候改變嘅時代 我嘗試解答一個好重要嘅問題： 點解性愛咁鬼正？ 
These people I still do hang out with. ,如果你笑緊，你知我講緊咩 
"All right, and smoking. ",而家，喺我哋答呢個問題之前 我向你介紹 Chris Hosmer 
"Here I found touch is at [six], and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience, which shows, it's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers. ",Chris Hosmer 係我大學時嘅好朋友 但其實我好討厭佢，我話你知點解 
"OK. Now, what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph? ",喺大學，我哋要做個好短嘅研習 要設計太陽能鐘 
"It would, of course, be a horizontal line along the top. ",呢個係我個鐘 
"Now you can see, not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close. ",我用咗一個叫矮身向日葵 啲花只有 12 吋高 
"In fact, in the years that I gathered data, only one experience came close to being the perfect one. ",大家都知道 向日葵會喺日頭追住太陽嚟移動 
"That is, of course, sex. Great sex. ",所以喺朝早，你睇到向日葵對著咩方向 你就喺盤底空白嘅地方做記號 
Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level. ,中午，你又記低向日葵轉嘅方向 日落又係咁做，呢個就係你個鐘 
"Here I'll quote one of my students who said, ""Sex is so good, it's good even when it's bad."" ",我知我個鐘報唔到準確時間 但用向日葵，你大概會有知道幾多點 
So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good. ,所以，以我絕對冇偏見 冇主觀立場嚟講 個鐘係冇得彈 
"Now in the middle of all this five senses work, I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth. ",但係，呢個係 Chris Hosmer 個鐘 
And I realized this theory also explains why Chris's clock is so much better than mine. ,有五個放大鏡 另外五個酒杯放喺每個酒杯下邊 
"You see, my clock only focuses on sight, and a little bit of touch. ",每個酒杯都裝咗唔同嘅香油 
Here's Chris's clock. ,朝早，太陽曬落嚟，照落第一個放大鏡 聚焦啲光線集中喺下邊個玻璃杯度 
It's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time. ,令杯入面嘅香油發熱 一種特定嘅香味就會釋放 
"In fact, in terms of the five senses, Chris's clock is a revolution. ",幾個鐘頭後，太陽曬到下一個放大鏡 另一種香味又會釋放出嚟 
And that's what this theory taught me about my field. ,所以一日內，五種唔同嘅香味 喺同一個環境散發 
"You see, up till now, us designers, we've mainly focused on making things look very pretty, and a little bit of touch, which means we've ignored the other three senses. ",所有住喺屋內嘅人 只需靠香味就知道時間 
Chris's clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product. ,你就知點解我討厭 Chris Hosmer 
So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs? ,我覺得我個靈感已經算唔錯 但佢嗰個簡直係無敵 而嗰時，我就知佢個概念比我好 但我就係解釋唔到點解 
Here's three quick ideas I came up with. ,識得我嘅人都知我唔鍾意輸 
"This is an iron, you know, for your clothes, to which I added a spraying mechanism, so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent, and your clothes will smell nicer, but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable. ",呢個問題纏繞咗我有十年 
"We could call this ""the perfumator."" ",好，我哋返返去之前個問題： 點解性愛咁正 
"All right, next. ",做完個太陽能鐘嘅好多年之後 我識得一位女士 佢估性愛咁正嘅原因 可能係因為同我哋嗰五個感官有關 
"So I brush my teeth twice a day, and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy, and when the taste of candy ran out, you'd know it's time to change your toothbrush? ",佢咁講之後，我恍然大悟 
"Finally, I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet. ",所以我決定要用五官 去諗返我人生中唔同嘅經歷 
"It's not just the way they look, but I love the way they feel when you press down on them. ",要咁做，我設計咗「五官圖表」 
"Now, I don't play the flute or the clarinet, so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play: the television remote control. ",喺 Y 軸，我哋有 0 到 10 度數 而 X 軸，就有五種觀感 
"Now, when we look at these three ideas together, you'll notice that the five senses theory doesn't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look. ",每一次我有難忘嘅經歷 我就會記錄落個表度 好似一本「五官日記」咁 
"So in conclusion, I've found the five senses theory to be a very useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life, and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs. ",呢度有段短片話你知點樣記錄 
"Now, I realize the five senses isn't the only thing that makes life interesting. ",（短片）Jinsop Lee： 嘿，我叫 Jinsop 今日，我要話你知揸電單車 嘅五官感受係點嘅。嘻！ 
There's also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor. ,電單車設計師：呢個 [ 唔清楚 ] 幫人按個人喜好設計嘅電單車設計師 
Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk. ,（電單車加速） [ 聽覺 ] [ 觸覺 ] [ 視覺 ] [ 嗅覺 ] [ 味覺 ] 講者︰「五官圖表」就係咁用 
"Until then, please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs. ",而家，有三年嘅時間，我收集咗啲資料 唔只係我，我啲朋友都咁做 同埋我以前教大學，所以我逼… 意思係，我叫我啲學生去記錄 
"Oh, one last thing before I leave. ",所以呢度係其中一啲收集到嘅數據 
Here's the experience you all had while listening to the TED Talks. ,第一個關於即食麵 
"However, it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste. ",明顯地，味道同氣味嘅數值都好高 但留意聲音都有 3 
And the best way to do that is with free candy. ,好多人都話我聽 其中一個食麵嘅重要經歷係啜啜聲 
You guys ready? ,你知道嘅。（啜啜聲） 唔洗講，我唔會再同呢啲人食飯 
All right. ,好，下個，去夜店蒲 
(Applause) ,我覺得有趣嘅係味覺都有 4 好多人反映畀我聽係因為飲品嘅味道 同埋，喺某啲情況 親吻係去蒲嘅一個重要經歷 
,我仲有同呢啲人出去 
"What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects, and that is the neuroscience of sleep. ",好，同埋下個，食煙 
"Now, there is a sound -- (Alarm clock) Ah, it worked! ",我發現觸覺有 6 其中一個原因係食煙嘅人話我知 揸住枝煙嘅觸感 同埋放喺唇邊嘅感覺 係食煙嘅最重要經歷 咁樣諗都幾得人驚 所以可想而知煙廠設計香煙 設計得有幾好 
"A sound that is desperately familiar to most of us, and of course it's the sound of the alarm clock. ",好 而家，最完美嘅經歷 喺「五官圖表」上邊會係點嘅樣呢？ 
"And what that truly ghastly, awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have, and that's sleep. ",應該係一條畫到最高嘅橫線啩？ 
"If you're an average sort of person, 36 percent of your life will be spent asleep, which means that if you live to 90, then 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep. ",你而家睇到 就算騎電單車咁強烈 都未攞曬所有分 
Now what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important. ,其實，喺我搜集資料嘅幾年 只有一個近乎完美嘅經歷 
"And yet, for most of us, we don't give sleep a second thought. ",呢個就係性愛，好嘅性愛 
We really just don't think about sleep. ,回覆者就話 好嘅性愛喺五個感官 都達到最高境界嘅體驗 
"And so what I'd like to do today is change your views, change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep. ",呢度我會引述我一個學生嘅說話︰ 「性愛真係好正， 即使差嘅性愛都咁正」 
"And the journey that I want to take you on, we need to start by going back in time. ",所以「五官理論」可以解釋到 點解性愛咁正 
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber. ,喺呢啲五官習作之中 我記起我年青時個太陽能鐘研習 
Any ideas who said that? ,同時我發現 呢個理論都解釋到 Chris 個鐘 點解會比我個好 
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. ,你睇，我個鐘只有視覺同埋少少觸覺 
"Yes, let me give you a few more quotes. ",呢個係 Chris 個鐘 
"O sleep, O gentle sleep, nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee? ",呢個係第一個用到氣味報時嘅鐘 
"Shakespeare again, from -- I won't say it -- the Scottish play. ",其實，喺五官角度嚟講 Chris 個鐘係一個革命 
"(Laughter) From the same time: ""Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together."" ",理論透過呢個鐘提醒咗我設計嘅嘢 
"Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker, another Elizabethan dramatist. ",你睇，到而家，我哋設計師 主要集中去令啲嘢好睇 同埋有少少質感 即係話我哋無視咗其他三種觀感 
"But if we jump forward 400 years, the tone about sleep changes somewhat. ",Chris 個鐘話畀我哋知 即使只係包括多一個感官元素 產品就可以更勝一籌 
"This is from Thomas Edison, from the beginning of the 20th century: ""Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days."" ",所以如果我哋將「五官理論」 套用到我哋嘅設計會點呢？ 
Bang! ,呢度有三個我諗到嘅簡單例子 
"(Laughter) And if we also jump into the 1980s, some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said, ""Sleep is for wimps."" ",呢個係燙斗，燙衫用嘅 我就加咗個噴嘴裝置 你只要喺裝置加入你鍾意嘅香味 你啲衫不但會香 仲會有機會令你燙衫嘅過程愉快好多 
"And of course the infamous -- what was his name? -- the infamous Gordon Gekko from ""Wall Street"" said, ""Money never sleeps."" ",我哋叫呢個「香水燙斗」 
What do we do in the 20th century about sleep? ,好，下一個 
"Well, of course, we use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night, and we occupied the dark, and in the process of this occupation, we've treated sleep as an illness, almost. ",我每日刷兩次牙 如果我哋嘅牙刷帶住糖味 同時，啲糖味冇哂嘅時候 代表要換牙刷呢？ 
We've treated it as an enemy. ,最後一個 我成日都好鍾意長笛或者單簧管嘅鍵 
"At most now, I suppose, we tolerate the need for sleep, and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure. ",唔係淨係因為佢哋個外觀 仲有㩒落去嘅時候嘅嗰種感覺 
And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound. ,而家我唔再吹長笛或單簧管 所以我將啲鍵結合到 一個我會用到嘅裝置上面： 電視機遙控 
Why is it? Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts? ,而家，一齊哋睇下呢三個概念 你會發現「五官理論」 唔單止改變我哋用產品嘅方式 仲有產品嘅外觀 
"Well, it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep, it seems. ",所以總結嚟講，我發現「五官理論」 對於反思我人生中唔同嘅經歷好有用 亦幫我將最好嘅經歷 帶到去我嘅設計上面 
You don't eat. You don't drink. ,而家，我發現唔淨止 「五官理論」令生命有趣 
"Well, most of us anyway. ",仲有「第六情感」 同埋難以測度嘅「X 因素」 
"And so, therefore it's -- Sorry. ",呢兩樣可能會成為我下次演講嘅題目 
"It's a complete waste of time, right? ",而喺下次之前，希望大家享受 將「五官理論」用喺你日常生活 同埋你自己嘅設計上 
"Actually, sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology, and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important. ",噢，離開前最後一件事 
So let's move to the brain. ,呢度係你哋聽 TED 演講時嘅體驗 
"Now, here we have a brain. ",但係，如果其他幾種感官 譬如嗅覺同味覺，可以提高嘅話 咁就最好 
"This is donated by a social scientist, and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so -- (Laughter) Sorry. ",而最好嘅方法係派免費嘅糖果 
So I borrowed it. ,你哋準備好未？ 
I don't think they noticed. OK. ,好 
"(Laughter) The point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep, this thing doesn't shut down. ",（掌聲） 
"In fact, some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state. ",
"The other thing that's really important about sleep is that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain, but is to some extent a network property. ",我今日想講一個我好鍾意嘅話題 就係睡眠嘅神經科學 
"If we flip the brain on its back -- I love this little bit of spinal cord here -- this bit here is the hypothalamus, and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures, not least the biological clock. ",依家，仔細聽下呢個聲音 （鬧鐘響） 啊，響啦 
"The biological clock tells us when it's good to be up, when it's good to be asleep, and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei. ",一個我哋大家都覺得熟悉又絕望嘅聲音 無錯就係鬧鐘聲 
"All of those combine, and they send projections down to the brain stem here. ",而呢種驚怵又恐怖嘅聲音 會停止人類最緊要嘅行為體驗 即係瞓覺 
"The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex, this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here, with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness. ",如果你係普通人 你生命裏面 36% 時間用喺瞓覺 即係話如果你有 90 歲 就會有 32 年嘅時間用嚟瞓覺 
"So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain, and essentially, sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here. ",呢個數字話畀我哋知 睡眠某種意義上好重要 
OK. So where have we got to? ,但我哋好多人唔會反思一下睡眠 
We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes 32 years of our life. ,我哋確實唔關心瞓覺嘅事 
But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about. ,所以我今日想改變大家嘅觀念 改變大家對睡眠嘅概念 
So why do we sleep? ,而我會帶你哋由舊時開始 
"And it won't surprise any of you that, of course, as scientists, we don't have a consensus. ",我哋返到去「安享甜絲絲嘅美夢」 呢句說話 
"There are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep, and I'm going to outline three of those. ",有無人知道呢句話出自邊度？ 
"The first is sort of the restoration idea, and it's somewhat intuitive. ",係莎士比亞嘅《凱撒大帝》 
"Essentially, all the stuff we've burned up during the day, we restore, we replace, we rebuild during the night. ",好，等我讀多幾個經典句子 
"And indeed, as an explanation, it goes back to Aristotle, so that's what -- 2,300 years ago. ",「美夢啊，溫柔的美夢， 你猶如天然溫柔嘅護士， 我點會怕你？」 
It's gone in and out of fashion. ,又係莎士比亞，嚟自…都係唔講 嚟自一部蘇格蘭戲劇 
"It's fashionable at the moment because what's been shown is that within the brain, a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep, and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways. ",（笑聲） 同一時代有另一句嘢： 「睡眠係一條金鍊， 將我哋健康同身體綁埋一齊。」 
So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis. ,呢句極具先見之明嘅話 出自 Thomas Dekker 另一個伊莉莎白時代嘅劇作家 
What about energy conservation? ,但如果將時間跳到 400 年後 人類對睡眠嘅態度就有所變化 
"Again, perhaps intuitive. ",20 世紀初愛迪生話︰ 「睡眠浪費時間， 仲係山洞時代遺留嘅嘢。」 
You essentially sleep to save calories. ,砰！ 
"Now, when you do the sums, though, it doesn't really pan out. ",（笑聲） 如果我哋回顧 80 年代 你哋或者會記得 戴卓爾曾經講過「睡眠係懦夫行為」 
"If you compare an individual who has slept at night, or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much, the energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night. ",仲有惡名昭彰嘅…佢叫咩名？ 《華爾街》惡名昭彰嘅 Gordon Gekko 講過︰ 「金錢永不睡」 
"Now, that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun. ",咁 20 世紀嘅我哋又點睇睡眠？ 
"Now, I would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep. ",我哋用愛迪生發明嘅燈泡 侵佔晚上，強佔黑夜 喺呢個搶佔過程裡面 我哋幾乎將睡眠當做病態 
So I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea. ,我哋將睡眠當做敵人 
"But the third idea I'm quite attracted to, which is brain processing and memory consolidation. ",依家最好嘅情況 係我哋仍然接受到需要睡眠 但最壞嘅情況可能係 好多人認為睡眠係一種要醫嘅病 
"What we know is that, if after you've tried to learn a task, and you sleep-deprive individuals, the ability to learn that task is smashed. ",而我哋對睡眠嘅無知 其實係幾發人深省 
It's really hugely attenuated. ,點解咁講？ 點解我哋潛意識會冇咗瞓覺？ 
So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important. ,答案似乎係 你喺瞓覺期間做唔到任何嘢 
"However, it's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it. ",你唔會食嘢，你唔會飲水，仲做唔到愛 
What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep. ,嗯，起碼大部份人都係咁 
"In fact, it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage. ",於是… 唔好意思 
Sleeping at night enhances our creativity. ,瞓覺係完全浪費時間？錯 
"And what seems to be going on is that, in the brain, those neural connections that are important, those synaptic connections that are important, are linked and strengthened, while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important. ",其實睡眠係我哋生物學裡面 重要嘅一部份 神經科學家正準備解釋 點解睡眠會咁重要 
OK. ,我哋嚟講下大腦 
"So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep, and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary, and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons. ",依家，我哋有一個大腦 
But sleep is not an indulgence. ,呢個腦由一位社會科學家捐贈 佢哋話，佢哋唔知呢件係乜 或者唔知點樣用佢，所以… （笑聲） 唔好意思 
It's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually. ,於是我借嚟用下 
"I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class, you know, the equivalent of. ",我諗佢地唔會發現嘅。好啦 
It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class. ,（笑聲） 我想講嘅係 當你瞓著嗰陣，大腦唔會休息 
"The critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep, you don't fly. ",其實，對比起清醒狀態 熟睡嘅時候大腦部份區域會更加活躍 
"Essentially, you never get there. ",另一樣非常緊要嘅嘢係 睡眠並非源自腦內嘅單一結構 而係源自腦嘅唔同地方 
And what's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep-deprived. ,如果我哋返轉個腦 令佢底部向上… 我鍾意脊髓呢部分 呢點就係下丘腦 下丘腦裡面有一大塊好得意嘅結構 唔單只有生理時鐘 
So let's now look at sleep deprivation. ,雖然生理時鐘話我哋聽幾時起身 幾時瞓覺 呢個結構仲會同下丘腦其他區域互動 包括外側下丘腦、腹外側視前核 
"Huge sectors of society are sleep-deprived, and let's look at our sleep-o-meter. ",佢哋一齊發送訊號落去腦幹呢度 
"So in the 1950s, good data suggests that most of us were getting around eight hours of sleep a night. ",跟住腦幹用神經傳導物 一種令我哋保持清醒 令我哋出現意識嘅嘢 發送訊息 經過腦皮質呢一塊美麗嘅皺褶區域 
"Nowadays, we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night, so we're in the six-and-a-half-hours every-night league. ",所以睡眠其實係 大腦唔同部份互動嘅結果 所以，睡眠係大腦一系列 相互作用嘅結果 
"For teenagers, it's worse, much worse. ",好啦，我哋接落嚟睇啲咩？ 
"They need nine hours for full brain performance, and many of them, on a school night, are only getting five hours of sleep. ",我哋已經知道睡眠係一個複雜過程 佢佔用我哋一生人 32 年時間 
It's simply not enough. ,但我冇解釋到睡眠係乜嘢嚟 
"If we think about other sectors of society -- the aged; if you are aged, then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted, and many sleep, again, less than five hours a night. ",咁點解我哋要瞓覺？ 
Shift work. ,對你哋嚟講，科學家無共識一啲都唔怪 
"Shift work is extraordinary, perhaps 20 percent of the working population, and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night. ",因為我哋科學家有好多唔同嘅解釋 我會重點講下其中三個 
It's locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us. ,第一個解釋 就係認為睡眠係為咗恢復精力 咁嘅解釋好主觀 
"So when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day, desperately tired, the body clock is saying, ""Wake up. This is the time to be awake."" ",實質上，我哋日間消耗好多嘢 於是就喺夜晚補充、替換 重建所有已消耗嘅嘢 
"So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor, again in that sort of five-hour region. ",其實個解釋係嚟自亞里士多德 即係 2300 年前嘅答案 
"And then, of course, tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag. ",呢個解釋曾經流行，但後來又式微 
So who here has jet lag? ,佢宜家又流行嘅原因 係因為研究發現 大腦內有一批基因 只會喺瞓覺嗰時活動 而呢啲基因同恢復精力 以及新陳代謝途徑有關 
"Well, my goodness gracious. ",所以個發現其實係支持恢復精力假說 
"Well, thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep, because that's what your brain is craving. ",咁保存能量假說呢？ 
"One of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro-sleeps, this involuntary falling asleep, and you have essentially no control over it. ",同樣，雖然話瞓覺係用嚟蓄卡路里 
"Now, micro-sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing, but they can also be deadly. ",但個假說可能好主觀 
"It's been estimated that 31 percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life, and in the US, the statistics are pretty good: 100,000 accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness, loss of vigilance, and falling asleep -- a hundred thousand a year. ",就算我哋真係計埋卡路里 個假說都好難有說服力 
"At another level of terror, we dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger, which was so tragically lost. ",如果你對比一個人夜晚瞓足 同冇瞓但唔郁 瞓覺一晚只能夠慳大概 110 卡路里 
"And in the investigations that followed those disasters, poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters. ",相當於一隻熱狗嘅熱量 
"When you're tired and you lack sleep, you have poor memory, you have poor creativity, you have increased impulsiveness, and you have overall poor judgment. ",我認為，一隻熱狗嘅熱量 對於睡眠呢種咁複雜 又牽涉大腦多個地方嘅行為嚟講 實在係杯水車薪 
"But my friends, it's so much worse than that. ",所以我唔多相信保存能量假說 
"(Laughter) If you are a tired brain, the brain is craving things to wake it up. ",我會比較欣賞第三個假說 就係大腦處理同記憶固化假說 
"So drugs, stimulants. ",我哋知道，如果你要去學一樣嘢 但又唔夠瞓 咁基本就學唔到嘢 
Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the Western world. ,睡眠不足會大大削弱學習能力 
"Much of the day is fueled by caffeine, and if you're a really naughty tired brain, nicotine. ",所以睡眠同記憶固化都係非常緊要 
"Of course, you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants, and then, of course, it gets to 11 o'clock at night, and the brain says to itself, ""Actually, I need to be asleep fairly shortly. ",但事情唔係話將知識放入記憶咁簡單 你仲要搵返佢哋 
"What do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired?"" ",令人興奮嘅係 我哋之所以面對複雜問題時 仍然能夠提出解決方案 全靠我哋都喺夜晚瞓覺 
"Well, of course, you then resort to alcohol. ",實質上，睡眠可以為我哋帶嚟三重優勢 
"Now alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice, to use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful. ",夜晚嘅睡眠會增加我哋嘅創意 
It can actually ease the sleep transition. ,原因似乎係，喺個腦裡面 重要嘅神經同重要嘅突觸會相互連結 變得更加強大 而無咁緊要嘅神經同突觸 趨向消失、式微 
But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep. ,咁我哋依家有三個理論 解釋點解要睡眠 
"A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you. ",但我哋要知道，每個理論嘅細節都唔同 我哋好可能因為唔同原因而瞓覺 
So it actually harms some of the neural processing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall. ,但係，睡眠並非一種嗜好 
"So it's a short-term acute measure, but for goodness sake, don't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night. ",佢唔係可以隨便話有就有 
Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain. ,我諗睡眠類似飛機嘅坐位升級 相當於由經濟艙升到上商務艙 
"If you sleep around about five hours or less every night, then you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese. ",但唔係升到去頭等艙 
What's the connection here? ,大家要明白嘅重點係 如果你唔瞓覺，你就飛唔到 
"Well, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone. ",去唔到想要嘅地方 
Ghrelin is released. ,我哋現今社會嘅一大特點係 我哋有嚴重嘅睡眠不足 
"The brain says, ""I need carbohydrates,"" and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars. ",所以依家我哋就嚟睇下睡眠不足 
So there's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain: stress. ,社會上好多人都唔夠瞓 睇一睇呢啲睡眠時間 
Tired people are massively stressed. ,50 年代，數據顯示 大部份人每晚瞓大約八個鐘 
"And one of the things of stress, of course, is loss of memory, which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of. ",依家，我哋每晚瞓少個半到兩個鐘 所以我哋都係瞓六個半鐘嘅人 
But stress is so much more. ,但對細路嚟講，情況更差 
"So, if you're acutely stressed, not a great problem, but it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem. ",要有完整嘅腦部運作 佢哋就需要九個鐘睡眠 好多細路，返學嘅日子 得五個鐘頭睡眠時間 
Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity. ,咁樣絕對係唔夠 
"And so, tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection, and there's some very good studies showing that shift workers, for example, have higher rates of cancer. ",我哋仲要考慮埋其他社會組別 例如年紀組別 如果你已經上咗年紀 你每次瞓覺都會砸醒 令到好多時瞓覺少過五個鐘 
Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation. ,另外，輪班工作嘅情況好特別 
Glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant. ,可能有 20% 嘅人要輪班 佢哋嘅生理時鐘並未有調較 去適應夜晚嘅工作需求 
"Therefore, diabetes 2. ",同我哋一樣，佢哋嘅生理時鐘 依然係正常嘅日夜週期 
Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure. ,所以當年紀大嘅輪班員工返屋企 想喺日頭訓覺，就會超攰 佢哋嘅生理時鐘就會同自己講︰ 「起身啦，係時候起身囉。」 
"So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain, which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides. ",所以要返夜嘅輪班員工嘅 睡眠質量通常好差 尤其係得五個鐘頭嘅睡眠時間 
"So at this point in the talk, this is a nice time to think, ""Well, do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep?"" ",然後仲有幾千萬人經歷捱時差 
So a quick show of hands. ,我哋呢到有幾多人要捱時差？ 
Who feels that they're getting enough sleep here? ,哇，都幾多噃 
"Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive. ",真係非常多謝大家無瞓著覺 因為瞓覺正係你哋大腦好想要嘅 
"Good. We'll talk more about that later, about what are your tips. ",大腦要做嘅其中一樣嘢就係瞌眼瞓 呢種無意識嘅睡眠 基本上係自己控制唔到嘅 
"So most of us, of course, ask the question, ""How do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep?"" ",瞌眼瞓可能係一種好尷尬嘅事 亦可以係致命 
"Well, it's not rocket science. ",據估計 有 31% 司機起碼一世人 會有一次喺開車嘅時候瞓著 而喺美國，統計指出： 十萬單高速公路上面嘅交通事故 同疲勞駕駛 集中唔到精力、瞓著咗有關 一年十萬起事故實在好得人驚 
"If you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning, if you are taking a long time to get up, if you need lots of stimulants, if you're grumpy, if you're irritable, if you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable, chances are you are sleep-deprived. ",更加恐怖嘅事有 切爾諾貝爾事故 同埋挑戰者號太空船解體 兩件事都係慘劇 
Listen to them. Listen to yourself. ,兩件事嘅調查都發現 長時間嘅輪班工作、警覺性降低 同疲倦過度 導致員工出現判斷錯誤 亦係呢次災難嘅一大原因 
What do you do? ,因此，當你攰嘅時候，加上睡眠不足 你嘅記憶力同創造力會降低 個人會更加衝動 於是你整體嘅判斷力下降 
Well -- and this is slightly offensive -- sleep for dummies. ,但接落嚟仲有更衰嘅嘢 
(Laughter) Make your bedroom a haven for sleep. ,（笑聲） 想像你係一個好攰嘅大腦 你會渴求一啲嘢去令自己清醒 
"The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can, and also make it slightly cool. ",例如藥物、興奮劑 
"Actually, reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed. ",咖啡因可以代表 大部份西方國家嘅興奮劑 西方人大部份日子都靠咖啡因度過 
Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep. ,而如果你真係又唔聽話又攰嘅大腦 你就會揀尼古丁 
What's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed? ,當然 服食呢啲興奮劑 可以支持你嘅清醒狀態 但時間去到夜晚 11 點 大腦會同自己講︰ 「啊，啱啦。我好快要瞓覺。 
"We stand in a massively lit bathroom, looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth. ",但我依家咁精神，點先瞓得著呢？」 
It's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep. ,於是乎，你就會求助於酒精 
Turn off those mobile phones. Turn off those computers. ,酒精對於短時間 一至兩次咁輕度鎮靜人嚟講 係非常有用 
Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain. ,酒精可以令人更舒服咁入睡 
"Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day, ideally not after lunch. ",但你一定要留意，酒精唔會提供睡眠 
"Now, we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed, but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light-dark cycle. ",佢只係提供一種好似睡眠嘅生理表像 佢只會鎮靜你 
So seek out morning light. ,因此酒精實際上 會阻礙部份神經傳遞 阻礙鞏固記憶同尋找記憶 
"Basically, listen to yourself. ",所以酒精係一種短期急性療法 但千祈唔好上癮 將酒精當做每晚嘅安眠藥 
Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey-heavy dew of slumber. ,另一樣同睡眠不足有關嘅嘢係肥胖 
OK. ,如果你每晚瞓唔夠五個鐘 咁你就有一半可能肥胖 
That's some facts. What about some myths? ,睡眠同肥胖有乜咩關聯？ 
Teenagers are lazy. ,睡眠不足可能會增加 胃飢餓素荷爾蒙 又稱飢餓荷爾蒙嘅分泌 
No. Poor things. ,胃飢餓素荷爾蒙釋放之後，上到大腦 
"They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late, so give them a break. ",大腦就會話︰「我要碳水化合物。」 於是大腦就開始尋找碳水化合物 
We need eight hours of sleep a night. ,尤其係糖分 由於壓力係肥胖嘅因由 所以疲倦同壓力係有關 
That's an average. ,攰嘅人特別容易感覺到壓力 
And what you need to do is listen to your body. ,而壓力嘅其中一個後果係記憶力衰退 就好似我啱啱差啲唔記得想講嘅嘢 
Do you need that much or do you need more? ,但壓力仲有包括好多嘢 
Simple as that. ,如果你突然覺得有壓力，咁樣係冇問題 但如果睡眠不足 導致持續有壓力嘅話 
Old people need less sleep. ,咁就有問題 持續嘅壓力會抑制免疫力 
The sleep demands of the aged do not go down. ,所以疲倦嘅人嘅整體感染率更加高 有一啲好嘅研究證明 要輪班嘅員工有更高嘅癌症病發率 
"Essentially, sleep fragments and becomes less robust, but sleep requirements do not go down. ",壓力增加會令更加多葡萄糖 流入循環系統裏面 
"And the fourth myth is early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. ",葡萄糖於是佔血管系統嘅大多數 然後你就因為承受唔到咁多血糖 
"Well, that's wrong at so many different levels. ",而患上糖尿病 
(Laughter) There is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all. ,壓力仲會升高血壓，引致心血管疾病 
There's no difference in socioeconomic status. ,所以睡眠不足導致好多病 而並非僅僅令大腦輕微受損咁簡單 我諗大部份人之前都認為 睡眠不足只會影響大腦 
"In my experience, the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug. ",講到呢到，大家可以諗下自己夠唔夠瞓 
(Laughter) (Applause) OK. ,我想問︰ 
"So for the last few minutes, what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new, breaking areas of neuroscience, which is the association between mental health, mental illness and sleep disruption. ",邊個覺得自己有充足睡眠？ 
"We've known for 130 years that in severe mental illness, there is always, always sleep disruption, but it's been largely ignored. ",噢，哇，都幾犀利，非常好 
"In the 1970s, when people started to think about this again, they said, ""Yes, well, of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia, because they're on antipsychotics. ",我哋遲啲再講呢樣嘢，同埋一啲小知識 
"It's the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems,"" ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously, sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics. ",我哋好多人，都會問一個問題 我點先知道我夠瞓？ 
So what's going on? ,其實係無絕對答案 
"Several groups are studying conditions like depression, schizophrenia and bipolar and what's going on in terms of sleep disruption. ",如果你朝早要用鬧鐘叫醒你 如果你要好長時間先起到身 如果你需要大量興奮劑 如果你脾氣好差、好容易發嬲 如果你嘅同事話你睇起嚟好攰、好燥 咁你就好大機會睡眠不足 
"We have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia, and the data were quite extraordinary. ",聽你周圍嘅人講，聽你自己嘅聲音 
"In those individuals with schizophrenia, much of the time, they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day. ",咁你要點做？ 
Other groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever -- their sleep was absolutely smashed. ,嗯，冇禮貌咁講︰ 就係要上傻瓜睡眠課 
And some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light-dark cycle. ,（笑聲） 要令你嘅臥室成為瞓覺天堂 
They were getting up later and later and later and later each night. ,最重要嘅係，整到佢有咁黑得咁黑 亦都要整到間房涼爽 
So what's going on? ,記住，至少喺瞓覺前半個鐘較暗個環境 
"And the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated, but they are physically linked within the brain. ",因為光會增加警覺性，推遲睡眠時間 
"The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep, give you normal sleep, and those that give you normal mental health, are overlapping. ",我哋大多數人瞓覺之前 要做嘅最後一件事係咩？ 
And what's the evidence for that? ,我哋企喺個好光嘅浴室度 一邊望住塊鏡一邊刷牙 
"Well, genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep, when mutated, when changed, also predispose individuals to mental health problems. ",但呢樣其實係我哋瞓覺之前 最唔應該做嘅事 
"And last year, we published a study which showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia, when mutated, also smashes the sleep. ",閂手機，熄電腦 
So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems. ,閂曬所有可以刺激大腦嘅嘢 
Other work flowed from these studies. ,日頭都唔好太遲飲咖啡 最好唔好遲過午飯飲 
"The first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness, and we've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder, they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar. ",我哋講咗瞓覺前要較暗環境 但朝頭早陽光照射 反而會對生理時鐘嘅日夜週期有益 
"The other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate, make worse, the mental illness state. ",所以朝早要有陽光射著 
My colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by 50 percent. ,基本上，要聆聽自己，平靜落嚟 
So what have we got? ,做一啲你知道可以令自己進入夢鄉嘅嘢 
"We've got, in these connections, some really exciting things. ",好，以上都係關於睡眠嘅事實 
"In terms of the neuroscience, by understanding these two systems, we're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain. ",咁有冇睡眠嘅謠言？ 
"The second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal, then we have the chance of going in. ",細路仔好懶？唔係 
"If we know these individuals are vulnerable, early intervention then becomes possible. ",佢哋天生嘅生物傾向性 令佢哋遲瞓覺、遲起身 
"And the third, which I think is the most exciting, is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target. ",所以就畀佢哋唞下 
"Stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable, we can certainly make them healthier, but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness. ",我哋每晚要瞓八個鐘 只係一個平均數 
So let me just finish. ,部份人要瞓多啲，部份人要瞓少啲 
What I started by saying is: Take sleep seriously. ,而你要做嘅，係聆聽自己嘅身體 
"Our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre-industrial age, when we were almost wrapped in a duvet. ",你到底要瞓多啲，定瞓少啲？ 
And this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense. ,就係咁簡單 
This is a pragmatic response to good health. ,老人家唔需要瞓咁耐？錯 
"If you have good sleep, it increases your concentration, attention, decision-making, creativity, social skills, health. ",老人家嘅睡眠時間並無減少 
"If you get sleep, it reduces your mood changes, your stress, your levels of anger, your impulsivity, and your tendency to drink and take drugs. ",佢哋嘅睡眠時間愈嚟愈零碎 而且質素冇咁好 但係對睡眠嘅要求並無減少 
"And we finished by saying that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness, and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions. ",第四個謠言係 早睡早起，身體好，財富高，智力好 
"Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said, ""Sleep is God. Go worship."" ",呢句話真係大錯特錯 
And I can only recommend that you do the same. ,（笑聲） 完全無任何證據表明 早起早睡會令人更加有錢 
Thank you for your attention. ,早起遲起同社會地位並無關係 
,從我嘅經驗睇嚟 早起同遲起嘅人主要分別係 早起身嘅人極其自命不凡 
"Steve Ramirez: My first year of grad school, I found myself in my bedroom eating lots of Ben &amp; Jerry's watching some trashy TV and maybe, maybe listening to Taylor Swift. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 好。最後一部份，最後幾分鐘 
I had just gone through a breakup. ,我想改話題 我想講下神經科學一啲突破性嘅發現 就係精神健康、精神病 以及睡眠障礙嘅關係 
"(Laughter) So for the longest time, all I would do is recall the memory of this person over and over again, wishing that I could get rid of that gut-wrenching, visceral ""blah"" feeling. ",我哋 130 年前已經知道 有嚴重精神病嘅人都會有睡眠障礙 但好多人都會忽視呢個情況 
"Now, as it turns out, I'm a neuroscientist, so I knew that the memory of that person and the awful, emotional undertones that color in that memory, are largely mediated by separate brain systems. ",70 年代，當人開始諗返呢樣嘢 佢地話： 「係啊，思覺失調病人 當然有睡眠障礙， 因為佢哋食梗抗精神病藥物。 
"And so I thought, what if we could go into the brain and edit out that nauseating feeling but while keeping the memory of that person intact? ",係抗精神病藥物造成睡眠問題。」 但佢哋忽略咗 抗精神病藥物出現前嘅一百年 已經有睡眠障礙嘅報告 
"Then I realized, maybe that's a little bit lofty for now. ",咁點樣呢？ 
So what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with? ,有幾班人研究緊抑鬱症 精神分裂、躁鬱症同睡眠障礙 
"Could we jump-start that memory back to life, maybe even play with the contents of that memory? ",而且我哋上年發表一個 有關思覺失調嘅大型研究 個研究數據非常有趣 
"All that said, there is one person in the entire world right now that I really hope is not watching this talk. ",思覺失調病人夜晚大部份時間都會清醒 同埋會喺日頭瞓覺 
(Laughter) So there is a catch. There is a catch. ,其他組別就發現 思覺失調病人無 24 小時生理規律 佢哋嘅睡眠節奏完全被破壞 
"These ideas probably remind you of ""Total Recall,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" or of ""Inception."" ",其中一啲人甚至無辦法 等日夜週期控制佢哋嘅睡眠時間 
But the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab. ,佢哋只能夠越嚟越遲起身同瞓覺 
Xu Liu: Test mice. ,咁點樣呢？ 
"(Laughter) As neuroscientists, we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works. ",令人興奮嘅係 精神病並非咁簡單同睡眠有關係 佢哋喺大腦裡面仲會有物理聯繫 
"And today, we hope to convince you that now we are actually able to activate a memory in the brain at the speed of light. ",而帶畀你正常睡眠嘅神經網絡 同畀你正常精神健康嘅神經網絡 係有關聯嘅 
"To do this, there's only two simple steps to follow. ",有咩證據？ 
"First, you find and label a memory in the brain, and then you activate it with a switch. ",就係對產生正常睡眠 非常重要嘅基因 當基因突變，或者有任何變化 人就會誘發精神健康問題 
As simple as that. ,上年，我哋公佈咗一個研究 顯示當一個 同思覺失調有關嘅基因變異 睡眠就會嚴重影響 
(Laughter) SR: Are you convinced? ,所以我哋有證據證明 精神疾病同睡眠障礙有關係 
"So, turns out finding a memory in the brain isn't all that easy. ",下面嘅研究都基於呢個成果 
"XL: Indeed. This is way more difficult than, let's say, finding a needle in a haystack, because at least, you know, the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on. ",首先，睡眠障礙出現喺 某啲精神疾病發作之前 我哋發現 嗰啲好有機會患上躁鬱症嘅年輕人 佢哋接受躁鬱症臨床診斷之前 已經有睡眠異常情況 
But memory is not. ,另外數據說明 睡眠障礙好可能令精神疾病惡化 
"And also, there's way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack. ",我嘅同事 Dan Freeman 用多種藥物 穩定咗研究對象嘅睡眠質量 同埋減低咗佢哋一半嘅妄想症狀 
"So yeah, this task does seem to be daunting. ",咁我哋得到啲咩？ 
"But luckily, we got help from the brain itself. ",我哋當中有一啲好振奮嘅發現 
"It turned out that all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory, and then the brain will tell us which cells are involved in that particular memory. ",透過了解睡眠同精神疾病 當中嘅神經科學 我哋開始認識 睡眠同精神疾病係點樣 喺大腦裡面生成同受到調節 
SR: So what was going on in my brain while I was recalling the memory of an ex? ,第二樣嘢係 如果我哋可以將睡眠同睡眠障礙 當成早期嘅警號 咁我哋就有機會介入跟進 
"If you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now, you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory. ",如果我哋知某啲人 比較容易患上精神疾病 咁就有可能及早介入 
"Now one brain region that would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus, which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear, which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory. ",第三樣嘢，我認為最震撼人心嘅 係我哋可以將大腦裡面嘅睡眠中樞 睇成係新嘅治療目標 
"XL: When you zoom in into the hippocampus, of course you will see lots of cells, but we are able to find which cells are involved in a particular memory, because whenever a cell is active, like when it's forming a memory, it will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know these cells are recently active. ",只要我哋穩定 容易患精神病嘅人嘅睡眠質量 佢哋就肯定會更加健康 同時可以減輕部份嚇人嘅精神病症狀 
"SR: So the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment, in a very real sense, there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working. ",等我做個總結 
They're sort of biological windows that light up to let us know that that cell was just active. ,我一開始講嘅係要重視睡眠 
"XL: So we clipped part of this sensor, and attached that to a switch to control the cells, and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice. ",我哋對睡眠嘅態度 同前工業時代嘅時候好唔同 緃使嗰陣嘅人仲要捲入被窩取暖 但當時嘅人已經直覺知道睡眠嘅重要 
"So whenever a memory is being formed, any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed. ",呢種直覺並非好似迷信咁無理 
"SR: So here is what the hippocampus looks like after forming a fear memory, for example. ",而其實係對健康好嘅務實做法 
"The sea of blue that you see here are densely packed brain cells, but the green brain cells, the green brain cells are the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory. ",你瞓得好嘅話 你嘅精神集中度、注意力 決斷力、創造力 社交技能同身體健康都會提升 
So you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear. ,瞓覺會減少情緒起伏幅度、壓力 憤怒程度、衝動程度 同埋減少想飲酒吸毒嘅諗法 
You're actually looking at the cross-section of a memory right now. ,最後我想講，理解睡眠嘅神經科學 令大家反思返我哋 係點樣諗部份精神疾病嘅成因 同時為我哋對付呢啲極其無奈嘅病 提供咗全新嘅方向 
"XL: Now, for the switch we have been talking about, ideally, the switch has to act really fast. ",Jim Butcher， 一位奇幻小說作家 話︰「睡眠係神嚟，大家要朝拜佢。」 
It shouldn't take minutes or hours to work. ,所以我只能夠叫你哋 跟住呢句話去做 
"It should act at the speed of the brain, in milliseconds. ",多謝 （掌聲） 
"SR: So what do you think, Xu? ",
"Could we use, let's say, pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells? ",史：諗返我研究生第一年 當時我攤喺床，食好多班傑利雪糕 睇無聊電視 或者聽 Taylor Swift 嘅歌 
XL: Nah. Drugs are pretty messy. They spread everywhere. ,嗰時我啱啱分咗手 
And also it takes them forever to act on cells. ,（笑聲） 所以，第一次長時間 我喺度不斷回憶關於呢個人 我希望能夠擺脫呢種自我苦惱 內臟似俾掏空一樣嘅感覺 
So it will not allow us to control a memory in real time. ,宜家，我係神經生物學家 因此我知道對舊情人嘅記憶 同記憶中唔舒服嘅感覺 大部分係由兩個唔同嘅腦部系統所介導 
"So Steve, how about let's zap the brain with electricity? ",所以，我喺度諗 如果我哋可以進入大腦 剪走嗰種令人作嘔嘅感覺 但仍然保持對舊情人嘅完整記憶 
"SR: So electricity is pretty fast, but we probably wouldn't be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory, and we'd probably fry the brain. ",咁會點？ 然後我認識到，呢個諗法 目前嚟講仲係做唔到 
"XL: Oh. That's true. So it looks like, hmm, indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light. ",咁我哋係咪可以 由進入大腦、尋找單一記憶著手？ 
SR: So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light. ,我哋可唔可以將記憶帶返嚟現實生活 甚至操作記憶？ 
So maybe we could activate or inactive memories by just using light -- XL: That's pretty fast. ,但到呢一刻 我真心希望一個人冇睇到呢場演講 
"SR: -- and because normally brain cells don't respond to pulses of light, so those that would respond to pulses of light are those that contain a light-sensitive switch. ",（笑聲） 所以大家要留意返 
"Now to do that, first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams. ",呢啲諗法或者令你哋諗起 電影《全面回憶》 《暖暖內含光》 或者《盜夢空間》 
XL: Yep. You heard it right. ,但同我哋實驗室合作嘅明星 位位都係星光熠熠 
We are trying to shoot lasers into the brain. ,劉：佢哋就係實驗室老鼠 
(Laughter) SR: And the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics. ,（笑聲） 身為神經生物學家 我哋喺實驗室用老鼠 睇下記憶點樣運作 
"Optogenetics gave us this light switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off, and the name of that switch is channelrhodopsin, seen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell. ",今日，我哋希望令你相信 宜家我哋能夠以光速啟動大腦嘅記憶 
"You can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light-sensitive switch that can be artificially installed in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it, and in this case we click it on with pulses of light. ",為咗令你哋相信 你哋只需要簡單做兩樣嘢 
XL: So we attach this light-sensitive switch of channelrhodopsin to the sensor we've been talking about and inject this into the brain. ,首先，你要搵同埋標記 大腦裏邊嘅一個記憶 然後用開關激活個記憶 
"So whenever a memory is being formed, any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light-sensitive switch installed in it so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laser just like this one you see. ",就係咁簡單 
SR: So let's put all of this to the test now. ,（笑聲） 史︰你哋信未？ 
"What we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here, and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box. ",實際上喺大腦裏面搵一個記憶 並唔係咁容易 
They learn that something bad happened here. ,劉︰冇錯 呢樣比喺禾稈裏面搵一支針仲難 因為至少支針你哋仲可以實在咁掂到 
"Now with our system, the cells that are active in the hippocampus in the making of this memory, only those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin. ",但記憶唔係 
"XL: When you are as small as a mouse, it feels as if the whole world is trying to get you. ",而且，大腦裏面嘅細胞數量 多過禾稈裡面嘅雜草數目 
So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected. ,的確，個項目睇起嚟幾令人心灰意冷 
"Whenever a mouse is in fear, it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box, trying to not move any part of its body, and this posture is called freezing. ",但係幸運嘅係 我哋由大腦自身獲得幫助 
"So if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box, and when we put them back into the same box, it will basically show freezing because it doesn't want to be detected by any potential threats in this box. ",所以我哋要做嘅就只係 畀大腦形成一個記憶 然後大腦會話畀我哋聽 邊啲細胞參與形成記憶 
"SR: So you can think of freezing as, you're walking down the street minding your own business, and then out of nowhere you almost run into an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend, and now those terrifying two seconds where you start thinking, ""What do I do? Do I say hi? ",史︰咁當我諗返前度嘅時候 大腦會有咩變化？ 
"Do I sit here and pretend like I don't exist?"" ",如果你唔講人道主義，將我嘅大腦切片 你會發現當我諗返前度時 有非常多嘅大腦區域會被刺激 
"Those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you, that temporarily give you that deer-in-headlights look. ",而其中一個強烈活躍嘅區域係海馬體 一個幾十年嚟被認為 會處理近期同親切記憶嘅區域 所以佢都係一個理想地方 畀人可以進入、尋找同啟動記憶 
"XL: However, if you put the mouse in a completely different new box, like the next one, it will not be afraid of this box because there's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment. ",劉︰當你令用顯微鏡觀察海馬體 唔單止會見到好多細胞 我哋仲能夠搵到 嗰啲參與某個記憶嘅細胞 因為當細胞活動時 例如當細胞建立某種記憶時 細胞會留低痕跡 我哋就可以透過痕跡 知道最近邊啲細胞啟動過 
"But what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time, we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before? ",史︰呢樣就好似夜晚寫字樓著咗燈 你會知道有人做緊嘢 同樣細胞都有咁嘅燈 不過叫生物感應器 當細胞做緊嘢嘅時候，生物感應器會著 
Are we going to bring back the fear memory for the first box into this completely new environment? ,生物感應器就好似盞燈一樣 畀我哋知道細胞活動 
"SR: All right, and here's the million-dollar experiment. ",劉︰所以我哋將生物感應器 連接到開關，控制呢啲細胞 我哋將呢個開關擺喺 一個改造過嘅病毒裏面 將病毒注入老鼠大腦 
"Now to bring back to life the memory of that day, I remember that the Red Sox had just won, it was a green spring day, perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the North End to get some cannolis, #justsaying. ",於是當一個記憶形成嗰陣 任何參與在內嘅細胞 都會裝上呢個開關 
"Now Xu and I, on the other hand, were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen. ",史︰例如，呢個就係海馬體 建立咗一個恐懼記憶之後嘅樣 
We were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique. ,呢張相藍色部分就係密集嘅腦細胞 而呢啲綠色嘅腦細胞 就係參與形成恐懼記憶 
XL: And this is what we saw. ,你哋宜家睇到嘅 係恐懼快速形成嘅過程 
"When we first put the mouse into this box, it's exploring, sniffing around, walking around, minding its own business, because actually by nature, mice are pretty curious animals. ",正確啲嚟講係記憶嘅橫切面 
"They want to know, what's going on in this new box? ",劉︰我哋一直討論緊嘅開關需要快 
It's interesting. ,佢唔可以花幾分鐘或者幾個鐘去做到 
"But the moment we turned on the laser, like you see now, all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode. ",佢應該以大腦嘅速度去做 
It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body. ,即係以幾微秒為限 史︰劉，咁你點睇？ 
Clearly it's freezing. ,我哋可唔可以用，例如藥物 啟動或者熄咗大腦細胞？ 
"So indeed, it looks like we are able to bring back the fear memory for the first box in this completely new environment. ",劉︰唔得。因為藥物會擴散，好麻煩 
"While watching this, Steve and I are as shocked as the mouse itself. ",而且藥物作用係永遠嘅 
"(Laughter) So after the experiment, the two of us just left the room without saying anything. ",所以我哋唔能夠用藥物即時控制記憶 
"After a kind of long, awkward period of time, Steve broke the silence. ",咁史蒂夫，用電控制大腦你覺得點？ 
"SR: ""Did that just work?"" ",史︰電非常之快 但係我哋未必可以將電帶到 負責某個記憶嘅細胞當中 我哋甚至乎會灼傷大腦 
"XL: ""Yes,"" I said. ""Indeed it worked!"" ",劉︰哦。 的確係 所以我哋應該搵更好嘅方法 以光速進入大腦細胞 
We're really excited about this. ,史︰正因為光本身就有光速 
And then we published our findings in the journal Nature. ,或者我哋可以用光 嚟到激活同熄咗記憶 劉︰光速非常快 
"Ever since the publication of our work, we've been receiving numerous comments from all over the Internet. ",而且由於正常嘅大腦細胞對光冇反應 因此嗰啲對光有反應嘅細胞 就係含有光敏感開關嘅細胞 
Maybe we can take a look at some of those. ,為咗令呢啲細胞對激光有反應 我哋首先要呃腦細胞 
"[""OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation... neural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome""] SR: So the first thing that you'll notice is that people have really strong opinions about this kind of work. ",劉：你哋冇聽錯 
"Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote, because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice, it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way. ",我哋嘗試將激光射入大腦 
"(Laughter) But as you'll see, it's not the only opinion that's out there. ",（笑聲） 我哋靠嘅技術就係光遺傳學 
"[""This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years?! OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED""] XL: Indeed, if we take a look at the second one, I think we can all agree that it's, meh, probably not as positive. ",光遺傳學畀咗光敏感開關我哋 令我哋能夠啟動或者熄咗腦細胞 而呢個光敏感開關個名 叫做光敏感通道 就係嗰啲黏著腦細胞嘅綠色小點 
"But this also reminds us that, although we are still working with mice, it's probably a good idea to start thinking and discussing about the possible ethical ramifications of memory control. ",你哋可以將光敏感通道 當做一種對光敏感 可以俾人安裝入腦細胞嘅開關 所以，宜家我哋可以簡單襟個開關 啟動或熄咗腦細胞 喺呢個情況，我哋用光脈衝開開關 
"SR: Now, in the spirit of the third quote, we want to tell you about a recent project that we've been working on in lab that we've called Project Inception. ",劉︰我哋將呢種 光敏感通道嘅光敏感開關 擺喺生物感應器上，並注入大腦 
"[""They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds, so they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it: Inception.""] So we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory, what if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory? ",當一個記憶形成嘅時候 有份形成嗰個記憶嘅細胞 都會有呢個光敏感開關 咁樣我哋就可以 通過照射激光控制呢啲細胞 
Could we possibly even turn it into a false memory? ,史︰宜家就係測試所有嘢嘅時間 
"XL: So all memory is sophisticated and dynamic, but if just for simplicity, let's imagine memory as a movie clip. ",我哋能夠做嘅就係 將老鼠放入一個咁嘅盒 然後輕微點擊老鼠足部 令老鼠對呢個盒產生一個恐懼記憶 
"So far what we've told you is basically we can control this ""play"" button of the clip so that we can play this video clip any time, anywhere. ",令佢哋知道盒入面有唔好嘅嘢發生 
But is there a possibility that we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie clip so that we can make it different from the original? ,喺老鼠嘅海馬體裏面 形成呢一個記憶嘅活躍細胞 都會有光敏感通道 
Yes we can. ,劉︰當你有一隻老鼠咁細 你會覺得成個世界都喺度想捉你 
"Turned out that all we need to do is basically reactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before, but at the same time, if we present new information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory, this will change the memory. ",所以，你最好嘅防衛 係收埋自己、唔被發現 
It's sort of like making a remix tape. ,當老鼠處於恐懼狀態 就會表現出呢一種典型行為 即係呆喺盒嘅角落唔郁 呢一種狀態我哋稱之為「靜止」 
SR: So how do we do this? ,如果老鼠記得個盒有唔好嘅事發生 而我哋將佢哋放返同一個盒時 佢哋本能反應就係靜止唔郁 咁係因為佢哋唔想俾盒裡面 任何潛在嘅威脅物發現 
"Rather than finding a fear memory in the brain, we can start by taking our animals, and let's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before. ",史︰因此，你哋可以將「靜止」 諗成你喺街行，腦裡面諗著自己嘅嘢 然後幾乎要撞到你嘅前女友或者前男友 喺呢兩秒裏面 你會諗︰我做咩好？打招呼？ 同佢握手？ 抑或轉身走？ 
"Now the next day, we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they've never experienced before. ",我係咪應該坐喺度扮唔存在？ 
We can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box. ,呢啲突然喺腦海出現嘅諗法 令你無法控制自己嘅身體 令你暫時流露出孤獨無助嘅表情 
"So what would happen here if, while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box, we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks? ",劉︰但係，如果你將老鼠 放喺一個完全唔一樣嘅新籠裡面 好似跟著落嚟呢個咁 老鼠就唔會驚呢個籠 因為老鼠冇理由去驚呢個新環境 
So here we're trying to artificially make an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves. ,但如果我哋將老鼠放喺新籠裡面 同時用我哋用激光啟動恐懼記憶嘅話 會發生啲咩？ 
We're just trying to connect the two. ,我哋係咪可以喺一個 完全唔一樣嘅環境裏面 喚醒返老鼠對第一個籠嘅恐懼記憶？ 
"So to test if we had done so, we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box. ",史︰呢個係價值百萬美元嘅實驗 
"Again, we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box while the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks, and now the animal suddenly freezes. ",宜家我哋講返當日嘅記憶 我記得嗰日波士頓紅襪隊贏咗比賽 嗰日又係一個生機勃勃嘅春天日子 極適合喺河邊散步 同埋去 North End 買一啲甜酥卷 
It's as though it's recalling being mildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened. ,另一方面，我同劉 喺一個冇窗、全黑嘅房裡面 眼球郁都唔動 因為隻眼郁嘅話離遠睇似係眨眼 所以我哋眼都冇眨咁望著電腦螢幕 
"So it formed a false memory, because it's falsely fearing an environment where, technically speaking, nothing bad actually happened to it. ",我哋喺度望緊隻老鼠 嘗試第一次用我哋嘅技術 去啟動一個記憶 
"XL: So, so far we are only talking about this light-controlled ""on"" switch. ",劉︰呢個就係我哋睇到嘅 
"In fact, we also have a light-controlled ""off"" switch, and it's very easy to imagine that by installing this light-controlled ""off"" switch, we can also turn off a memory, any time, anywhere. ",當我哋第一次將老鼠放入呢個籠 老鼠會探索，聞嘢，周圍走，做自己嘢 因為老鼠天生係好好奇嘅動物 
"So everything we've been talking about today is based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience that the mind, with its seemingly mysterious properties, is actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with. ",佢哋想知道，呢個新嘅籠有乜嘢 
"SR: And for me personally, I see a world where we can reactivate any kind of memory that we'd like. ",老鼠好得意 
I also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories. ,但當我哋啟動激光嘅一刻 就好似你宜家睇到咁 老鼠即刻進入靜止狀態 
"Now, I even see a world where editing memories is something of a reality, because we're living in a time where it's possible to pluck questions from the tree of science fiction and to ground them in experimental reality. ",老鼠呆咗，唔郁 
"XL: Nowadays, people in the lab and people in other groups all over the world are using similar methods to activate or edit memories, whether that's old or new, positive or negative, all sorts of memories so that we can understand how memory works. ",好明顯，老鼠定咗型 
"SR: For example, one group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurable memory, just like that. ",睇起上嚟，我哋做到 將第一個籠嘅恐懼記憶帶到去新環境 
That's exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes. ,當我哋睇到結果，史蒂夫同我都震驚咗 就好似隻老鼠一樣 
"Now one dude in lab was even able to reactivate memories of female mice in male mice, which rumor has it is a pleasurable experience. ",（笑聲） 實驗完咗之後，我哋離開間房 冇講過嘢 
"XL: Indeed, we are living in a very exciting moment where science doesn't have any arbitrary speed limits but is only bound by our own imagination. ",經過好長又尷尬嘅一段時間 史蒂夫終於打破沉默 
"SR: And finally, what do we make of all this? ",史︰我當時話「我哋嘅技術係得嘅？ 」 
How do we push this technology forward? ,劉：我話「係，真係得咗！ 」 
"These are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab, and so one goal of today's talk was to bring everybody up to speed with the kind of stuff that's possible in modern neuroscience, but now, just as importantly, to actively engage everybody in this conversation. ",我哋對結果都非常激動 
"So let's think together as a team about what this all means and where we can and should go from here, because Xu and I think we all have some really big decisions ahead of us. ",然後我哋將個發現刊登喺自然期刊度 
Thank you. XL: Thank you. ,自從發表咗我哋嘅研究之後 我哋喺網上收到好多留言 
(Applause) ,我哋可以睇其中一啲 
,[ 天啊。最後…有咁多嘢！虛幻科技、神經控制、視覺夢想嘅再現、 神經編碼、「寫同重寫記憶 」、精神疾病。將來係咁好嘅。] 史︰首先你會注意到啲人 對呢項研究有好強烈嘅意見 
You may want to take a closer look. ,宜家，我開始非常認同 第一個人嘅樂觀睇法 因為相對於Morgan Freeman 嘅評論 呢個係我有生以嚟聽到最好嘅讚美說話 
There's more to this painting than meets the eye. ,（笑聲） 但係就好似你哋睇到嘅一樣 呢個並唔係唯一嘅意見 
"And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man, but I didn't paint it on canvas. ",[ 太不可思議啦…如果佢哋可以喺幾年內 將呢種技術應用到人身上會點？ 天啊！我哋命中註定係咁。] 劉︰如果我哋睇睇第二個留言 我諗我哋全部人都覺得 嗰個人講嘅嘢冇咁正面 
I painted it directly on top of the man. ,但呢樣都提醒我哋 雖然我哋宜家仍然以老鼠做實驗對象 但我哋確實應該開始思考同討論 記憶控制帶嚟嘅道德爭議 
"What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether, and if I want to paint your portrait, I'm painting it on you, physically on you. ",史︰透過第三個留言 我想話畀你哋聽一個 我哋最近喺實驗室開展嘅項目 叫「盜夢空間」 
"That also means you're probably going to end up with an earful of paint, because I need to paint your ear on your ear. ",[「佢哋應該整一部關於呢樣嘢嘅電影。當佢哋將記憶植入人嘅意識裏面， 佢哋就能夠控制人，從而達到個人利益。佢哋就能夠控制人，從而達到個人利益。 所以我哋開始諗 雖然我哋可以重啟一個記憶 但如果我哋唔小心 改造咗個記憶，咁點呢？ 
"Everything in this scene, the person, the clothes, chairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what's directly below it, and in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene and make it look like a two-dimensional painting. ",我哋會唔會將個記憶 變成一個錯誤嘅記憶？ 
"I can photograph it from any angle, and it will still look 2D. ",劉︰所有記憶都係複雜而且有動態變化 但我哋可以簡單將記憶當成係一齣電影 
There's no Photoshop here. ,正如我哋一路所講嘅 我哋可以控制電影嘅播放掣 所以我哋可以隨時隨地播呢部電影 
This is just a photo of one of my three-dimensional paintings. ,但有冇可能我哋可以 進入大腦編輯呢部電影 令佢同原本有唔同？ 
You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings. ,係，我哋可以做到 
"But originally, this had nothing to do with either people or paint. ",我哋需要做嘅只係 用我哋之前用過嘅激光 重新啟動一個記憶 但係如果我哋同時將新嘅資訊 擺落去舊嘅記憶當中 舊嘅記憶會改變 
It was about shadows. ,就好似整混合錄音咁 
"I was fascinated with the absence of light, and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed. ",史︰咁我哋點樣做呢？ 
I came up with the idea of painting shadows. ,與其喺大腦搵到恐懼記憶 我哋可以喺動物裏面搵 即係我哋將動物放入 一個咁樣嘅藍色籠裡面 我哋喺動物個腦裏面 搵返代表藍色籠嘅腦細胞 然後我哋令呢啲腦細胞對光有反應 同我哋之前做嘅一模一樣 
"I loved that I could hide within this shadow my own painted version, and it would be almost invisible until the light changed, and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light. ",第二日，我哋可以將動物放入 一個佢哋從來冇遇過嘅紅色籠 
"I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on, and I thought of my friend Bernie. ",我哋可以向佢哋大腦照射激光 重啟佢哋對藍色籠嘅記憶 
But I didn't just want to paint the shadows. ,咁當動物諗返藍色籠嘅嘢時 我哋對佢哋輕微電擊幾次，會點呢？ 
I also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale. ,我哋就嘗試人為咁 令藍色籠嘅記憶同電擊關連起嚟 
"I had a very specific vision of what this would look like, and as I was painting him, I made sure to follow that very closely. ",我哋想將兩樣嘢連埋一齊 
But something kept on flickering before my eyes. ,為咗證實我哋成功 我哋再將老鼠放入藍色籠 
I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. ,我哋今次只係重啟老鼠對藍色籠嘅記憶 但老鼠卻感覺到足部有微弱電擊 然後佢哋突然靜止唔郁 
"And then when I took that moment to take a step back, magic. ",所以就算實際上冇電擊都好 老鼠始終記返起被電擊 
I had turned my friend into a painting. ,因此，老鼠形成咗一個錯誤嘅記憶 因為技術上嚟講 佢哋驚錯咗一個冇電擊嘅環境 
"I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow, I would pull out this whole other dimension, that I would collapse it, that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting. ",劉︰目前為止，我哋只係討論咗 呢種用光控制嘅開掣 
"I was a little conflicted though, because I was so excited about what I'd found, but I was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science, and I'd always had this dream of going to Washington, D.C., and sitting at a desk and working in government. ",其實我哋都有光控制嘅閂掣 而且我哋可以好容易想像到 通過安裝呢種光控制嘅閂掣 我哋可以隨時隨地閂咗一個記憶 
(Laughter) Why did this have to get in the way of all that? ,我哋今日所講嘅嘢 都係基於神經科學一條哲學性嘅原理 就係，思想睇起嚟好神秘 但佢實際上係由物質組成 兼可以俾我哋利用嘅嘢 
"I made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to Capitol Hill, but going down to my parents' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint. ",史︰我見到一個世界 我哋可以重新啟動任何我哋鍾意嘅記憶 
I had no idea where to begin. ,我仲見到一個世界 我哋可以抹走我哋唔想要嘅記憶 
"The last time I'd painted, I was 16 years old at summer camp, and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface, because that's not what this project was about for me. ",宜家，我甚至見到 記憶編輯已經成為現實中嘅一部分 因為我哋生活嘅時代 已經有可能將科幻小說裡邊嘅問題 通過實驗將佢哋帶到嚟現實世界 
It was about space and light. ,劉︰宜家，我哋實驗室嘅人員 同全世界嘅人員 都用緊類似嘅方法啟動或者編輯記憶 無論嗰啲記憶係舊、新、正面、負面 ——總之所有類型嘅記憶 等我哋能夠了解記憶係點樣運作嘅 
"My early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas, like fried food. ",史︰例如，我哋實驗室嘅一個團隊 發現咗形成恐懼記憶嘅腦細胞 並將嗰啲腦細胞轉化成快樂記憶 
It's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg. ,就好似嗰個咁 嗰個就係我想講嘅編輯過程 
(Laughter) Even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit. ,宜家，實驗室人員 甚至可以喺雄性老鼠當中 啟動佢哋對雌性老鼠嘅記憶 有流傳話人員有好愉快嘅經歷 
It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink. ,劉︰我哋正生活喺一個好開心嘅時刻 因為呢一刻科學除咗受制於 我哋嘅想像力之外，就再冇限制 
"I'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone. ",史︰最後，我哋做到啲咩呢？ 
"And if I wanted to paint on people, well, I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast. ",我哋點樣繼續發展呢一個技術？ 
It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself. ,呢啲問題唔應該剩係留返畀 實驗室嘅人解答 我哋今日演講嘅目的就係令所有人 知道現代神經科學有可能嘅事 但宜家重要嘅係 令所有人都參與個討論 
"One of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears, but he also didn't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition, like the Metro. ",等我哋好似一個團隊咁一齊諗下 神經科學可以做到啲咩 我哋可以點樣繼續往前走 因為劉同我都認為 我哋所有人面前都有一啲重大決定要做 
I was having so much fun with this process. ,史、劉︰多謝 
"I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles, and I wanted to see what else I could do with it. ",（鼓掌） 
"I came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand, and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface, and that was milk. ",
We got a pool. We filled it with milk. ,仔細睇下 
We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting. ,呢幅畫其實唔只表面咁簡單 
"And the images were always completely unexpected in the end, because I could have a very specific image about how it would turn out, I could paint it to match that, but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk, everything would change. ",雖然，呢幅係畫一個男人嘅亞加力畫 但係我冇畫喺畫布上 
"It was in constant flux, and we had to, rather than fight it, embrace it, see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better. ",我直接畫喺嗰個男人身上 
"Sometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk, it would wash all the paint off of her arms, and it might seem a little bit clumsy, but our solution would be, okay, hide your arms. ",我唔用畫布 如果我想畫你嘅肖像 我會直接畫喺你身上 
"And one time, she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face. ",即係話你會被搽上好多顏料 包括你嘅耳仔 因為我需要喺你嘅耳仔上面畫你嘅耳仔 
"All right, well, hide your face. ",呢度所有嘢︰人、衫、凳、牆 全都油上一層顏料 咁樣係為咗直接模仿人同物件 透過呢一種方式 我就可以將一個立體環境整到平面畫咁 
"And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined, even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands, just hiding them in the pockets. ",就算我由唔同角度影相 出嚟嘅效果都仍然係平面咁 
"When we started out on the milk project, and when I started out, I couldn't have foreseen that I would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk. ",Photoshop 我都冇用過 
"But then again, I guess it's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar, as long as you're willing to look beyond what's already been brought to light, that you can see what's below the surface, hiding in the shadows, and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye. ",呢張係我其中一幅立體畫嘅相 
Thank you. ,你可能會問︰ 點解我會有呢啲諗法將人變成畫 
(Applause) ,但其實一開始嘅時候 我冇諗過對人或者顏料做啲乜嘢 
,最初諗法只係同影有關 
I have a confession to make. ,我覺得冇光線呢樣嘢好吸引 我想搵一種方法可以令影實物化 喺影改變之前將佢定型 
"But first, I want you to make a little confession to me. ",於我就想畫低啲影 
"In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress. ",我好想可以喺影裏面 收埋油上咗顏料嘅我 令我可以幾乎隱形 直至光線唔同咗，然後突然間 我嘅影會出現喺光線之下 
Anyone? ,我想睇下仲有咩地方我可以畫影嘅 然後我諗起我朋友 Bernie 
How about a moderate amount of stress? ,但我唔只想畫影，我仲想做到加強 
Who has experienced a lot of stress? ,同埋喺佢身上用灰階顏色畫 
Yeah. Me too. ,我好清楚作品會係點嘅樣 所以當我畫緊佢嘅時候 我好小心跟足我嘅構思去畫 
But that is not my confession. ,但有啲嘢一直喺我眼前閃 
"My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. ",我當時唔係好清楚我睇到嘅係咩嘢 
"But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress. ",然後當我褪後去睇嗰陣 神奇嘅嘢就發生咗 
"For years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick. ",我將我嘅朋友變成咗一幅畫 
It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. ,我最初諗唔到當我畫影嘅時候 我會將另一個空間成個帶咗出嚟 然後再將個人融返入去 估唔到我畫畫會變成畫我嘅朋友 甚至將朋友擺返落畫裡邊 
"Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy. ",我心裡面有啲矛盾 因為一方面我為到 我自己發現嘅嘢覺得興奮 但另一方面，我嗰時啱啱大學畢業 攞咗政治學學位 以前成日夢想去華盛頓做政府工 
"But I have changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours. ",（笑聲） 為咩我會提起呢件事呢？ 
Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. ,係因為我做咗個好艱難嘅決定 決定畢業之後放棄到美國國會工作 反而返咗去我父母屋企嘅地下室學畫畫 
"This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, ""How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"" ",我當時唔知道邊度入手 
"They also asked, ""Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?"" ",對上一次我畫畫嘅時候係 16 歲 當時喺夏令營裡面 當時我唔想透過抄襲以前大師作品 或係攤開畫布反複咁喺畫布上面畫 嚟自學畫畫 因為對我嚟講，畫畫唔應該係咁 
And then they used public death records to find out who died. ,畫畫應該係關於空間同光線 
(Laughter) Okay. ,我早期嘅畫布都係啲你諗唔到嘅嘢 就好似用煎炸食物做畫布咁 
People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying. ,所以係幾乎冇可能 將顏料搽上雞蛋嘅油脂度 
But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. ,（笑聲） 更加難去將顏料黐喺柚子嘅果酸度 
(Laughter) People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. ,因為果酸只會抹走筆觸嘅顏料 就好似隱形墨水一樣 
"In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress. ",當我畫一筆，顏料就咁唔見咗 
"Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress is bad for you. ",假如我想喺人上面畫… 我會帶人嚟我嘅工作室 畀佢哋知道我嘅日子喺地下室過 畀佢哋知道我喺多士上面油顏料 但咁樣我會覺得尷尬 
"(Laughter) That is over 20,000 deaths a year. ",似乎喺我身上練習畫畫更加適當 
"Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide. ",其中一個我最鍾意嘅模特兒 係一位退休老人 佢不但唔介意坐定定唔郁 由得顏料搽喺佢耳仔裏面 而且仲冇因為我帶佢出去公眾場所 好似地鐵咁——展出而尷尬 
(Laughter) You can see why this study freaked me out. ,成個過程中我有好多樂趣 
Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health. ,我教自己點樣用唔同風格畫 同時我想知道我仲有咩可以試 
So this study got me wondering: Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier? ,我今日帶咗一位拍檔，Sheila Vand 我哋都覺得畫 可以喺唔平凡嘅介面上面畫 嗰個係牛奶 
And here the science says yes. ,我哋搵嚟咗一個水池 我哋將牛奶倒入去 
"When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's response to stress. ",Sheila 都走埋入去 然後我開始畫 
"Now to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. ",畫出嚟嘅嘢永遠都係意想不到 雖然我腦裏面有一幅好確切嘅圖 好清楚會畫成點 我亦會跟著幅圖去畫出嚟 但係當 Sheila 用背脊 浸入牛奶嘅一刻 所有嘢都變 
It's called the social stress test. ,啲嘢流動緊 而我哋用「既來之，則安之」 嘅方式處理 唔係要同牛奶抗衡 而係順著牛奶嘅流動作出修補 令幅畫更加好 
"You come into the laboratory, and you're told you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you, and to make sure you feel the pressure, there are bright lights and a camera in your face, kind of like this. ",有時 Sheila 成個人浸入牛奶 牛奶會沖走佢手臂嘅顏料 令到睇起嚟有啲笨拙 我哋嘅解決方法係，將佢嘅手臂都遮住 
"(Laughter) And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback, like this. ",仲有一次，佢嘅頭髮吸咗好多牛奶 令面上面嘅顏料通通都溶咗 
"(Exhales) (Laughter) Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two: a math test. ",所以我嗰陣話︰ 「好，咁嘅話，將你塊臉遮著。」 
"And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it. ",最後我哋嘅作品比當初構思嘅更加靚 呢個方法同小朋友因為畫唔到手 所以將手畫到插咗入袋一樣 
Now we're going to all do this together. ,當我哋開始牛奶計劃時 我預料唔到我嘅將來 會由我追政治夢、坐喺辦公室工作 到誤打誤撞發現「影子」呢個概念 繼而將人哋變成畫作 喺牛奶池裡面畫人 
It's going to be fun. ,話說回來，我諗 你喺熟識嘅事物裡面 搵到奇怪嘅嘢根本係有可能 只要你唔好剩係望擺喺眼前嘅事物 而係望事物蘊藏咗嘅嘢 埋藏喺陰影嘅嘢 你會發現更多嘅可能 
Okay. ,多謝各位 
(Laughter) I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven. ,（掌聲） 
"You're going to do this out loud, as fast as you can, starting with 996. ",
Go! ,我要坦白一個事實 
(Audience counting) Go faster. Faster please. ,但係首先，我希望你哋能夠對我坦白 
You're going too slow. ,喺過去嘅一年裡面——舉手就得喇 你有冇經歷過相對較小嘅壓力？ 
"(Audience counting) Stop. Stop, stop, stop. ",有冇人？ 
That guy made a mistake. ,咁中等嘅壓力呢？ 
We are going to have to start all over again. ,邊個又經歷過好大嘅壓力？ 
"(Laughter) You're not very good at this, are you? ",好嘅。我都有 
"Okay, so you get the idea. ",但係呢樣唔係我要坦白嘅 
"If you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out. ",我要坦白嘅係：我係一個健康心理學家 我嘅任務係令人哋更加嘅開心同健康 
"Your heart might be pounding, you might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat. ",但係，我恐怕過去十年我一直所教嘅嘢 壞處多過好處 當中原由同壓力有關 
"And normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure. ",多年嚟，我一直話畀人哋聽 壓力令你病 
"But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge? ",壓力增加患上所有疾病嘅風險： 從普通感冒到心血管疾病 
Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University. ,所以，我將壓力當作係敵人 
"Before they went through the social stress test, they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful. ",但係，我已經改咗對壓力嘅睇法 而且我想你哋改變對壓力嘅睇法 
That pounding heart is preparing you for action. ,等我哋由呢一個 令我重新思考壓力嘅研究開始 
"If you're breathing faster, it's no problem. ",呢個研究用八年時間 追蹤咗三萬個美國成年人 研究問嘅問題係︰ 「喺過去嘅一年裡面， 你經歷過幾多壓力？」 
It's getting more oxygen to your brain. ,研究又問：「你哋相唔相信 壓力對你嘅健康有害？」 
"And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance, well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident, but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed. ",之後，研究員翻查公眾死亡記錄 嚟確定邊個死亡 
"Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood vessels constrict like this. ",（笑聲） 先講一啲壞消息 
And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease. ,嗰啲喺過去嘅一年經歷好多壓力嘅人 死亡風險增加咗 43% 
It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time. ,但係呢個結果係講緊嗰啲 相信壓力對健康有害嘅人 
"But in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this. ",（笑聲） 嗰啲經歷好多壓力 但唔認為壓力對身體有害嘅人 唔會話容易死亡 
"Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile. ",實際上，佢哋嘅死亡風險 喺呢個研究嘅所有對象當中 包括嗰啲經歷相對少壓力嘅人當中 
It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage. ,"係最低嘅 目前，研究員估計 喺過去佢哋追蹤死亡嘅八年當中 有 182,000 個美國人 冇因為壓力而提早死亡 而係因為信咗壓力對佢哋嘅健康有害 "
"Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s. ",（笑聲） 即係話，每年會有 超過二萬人因為咁而死亡 
"And this is really what the new science of stress reveals, that how you think about stress matters. ",如果呢一估計係正確嘅話 相信壓力對身體有害呢一個觀念 就會變成舊年美國第十五大死亡原因 排喺皮膚癌、愛滋病同謀殺前面 
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. ,（笑聲） 可想而知我睇到 呢個研究嗰陣有幾錯愕 
I no longer want to get rid of your stress. ,過去，我一直花費大量精神話畀人知 壓力對你嘅健康有害 
I want to make you better at stress. ,所以呢個研究令我諗： 改變你對壓力嘅態度 會唔會令你更加健康？ 
And we just did a little intervention. ,科學話畀我哋聽的確係咁 
"If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year, we could have saved your life, because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself, this is my body helping me rise to this challenge. ",當你改變對壓力嘅睇法時 你就能夠改變身體對壓力嘅反應 
"And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response becomes healthier. ",要解釋個原理 我想你哋都想像自己參與 一個特登令到你感覺到壓力嘅研究 
"Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from, so we are going to do one more intervention. ",呢一個研究叫做社會壓力測試 
"I want to tell you about one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response, and the idea is this: Stress makes you social. ",你入去實驗室 你被告知要坐喺你專家評委面前 即場做一個五分鐘嘅演講 講你嘅性格弱點 為咗等你感受到壓力 會有好強嘅燈光同攝影機 好似咁樣 
"To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. ",（笑聲） 呢啲評委，事先訓練好 畀你非言語上嘅消極反應 好似咁樣（吸氣） 
"It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone. ",（笑聲） 宜家，你已經夠曬失落 然後你就要嚟到第二部分：數學測驗 
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in. ,令你措手不及嘅係 實驗人員喺過程中不斷咁騷擾你 
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone. ,宜家等我哋一齊嚟做呢個實驗 
It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts. ,對我嚟講會係好歡樂嘅時刻 
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. ,（笑聲） 
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family. ,我希望你哋所有人倒數數字 由 996 開始以 7 遞減 
It enhances your empathy. ,你哋必須大聲講出嚟 盡可能嘅快，由 996 開始 
It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about. ,開始！ 
Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin... ,（聽眾倒數） 快啲。快啲 
to become more compassionate and caring. ,你哋太慢喇（聽眾倒數） 
But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. ,停，停，停，停，停 
It's a stress hormone. ,呢位男士數錯咗 
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. ,我哋必須從新開始 
It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. ,你哋都唔擅於減數，係嗎？ 
"And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support. ",所以，你哋宜家知道嗰種感覺喇 
"Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel, instead of bottling it up. ",如果你哋真係參與呢個研究 你哋應該會有一啲壓力 
Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other. ,你嘅心臟或者會砰砰跳 呼吸可能加快，亦可能會流汗 
"When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you. ",正常情況下 我哋會話呢種係焦慮嘅反應 或者係一種訊號反映 我哋唔能夠好好應對呢種壓力 
"Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier? ",但係如果你將呢種反應解讀為 身體充滿活力 而且準備好應對壓力，咁又會係點呢？ 
"Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain. ",呢啲說話正係 哈佛大學一個研究裏面 參與者被告知嘅 
"It also acts on your body, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress. ",喺佢哋做社會壓力測試之前 佢哋被引導去諗 呢啲壓力嘅反應係有益嘅 
It's a natural anti-inflammatory. ,心跳加快係令你準備好應對 
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress. ,如果你呼吸加快，冇問題 
But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart. ,咁會令你嘅大腦獲得更多嘅氧氣 
"Your heart has receptors for this hormone, and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage. ",嗰啲學識將壓力視為 對表現有幫助嘅參與者 佢哋嘅壓力降低咗 少咗一份焦慮，多咗一份自信 但係更加令人欣喜嘅發現係 佢哋身體對壓力嘅反應有所改變 
This stress hormone strengthens your heart. ,一般嘅壓力反應都係 心跳會加快、血管收窄 
And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support. ,呢啲都係慢性壓力 同心血管疾病有關嘅原因 
"So when you reach out to others under stress, either to seek support or to help someone else, you release more of this hormone, your stress response becomes healthier, and you actually recover faster from stress. ",持續咁樣嘅狀態對身體冇好處 
"I find this amazing, that your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress resilience, and that mechanism is human connection. ",但係，喺個研究裏面 當參與者認為 佢哋嘅壓力反應係正面嘅時候 佢哋嘅血管保持鬆弛，就好似咁樣 
I want to finish by telling you about one more study. ,而佢哋嘅心臟仍然係砰砰直跳 但呢種心血管嘅情況更加健康 
"And listen up, because this study could also save a life. ",呢個時候嘅心血管就同你 開心、受到鼓舞時嘅心血管一樣 
"This study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States, and they ranged in age from 34 to 93, and they started the study by asking, ""How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"" ",喺你一生經歷咁多壓力裏面 呢一個生理變化足以決定 一個人五十歲因為壓力而心臟病發 定係直到九十歲仍然活得好好 
"They also asked, ""How much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors, people in your community?"" ",呢個就係科學 喺研究壓力方面嘅新發現︰ 你點樣看待壓力，足以影響你嘅健康 
And then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died. ,作為一個健康心理學家 我嘅目標都唔同咗 
"Okay, so the bad news first: For every major stressful life experience, like financial difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent. ",我唔再想清除你嘅壓力 
"But -- and I hope you are expecting a ""but"" by now -- but that wasn't true for everyone. ",我想讓你哋將壓力處理得更加好 
People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying. ,而我哋只做少少介入療法 
Caring created resilience. ,如果你舉手話 喺過去嘅一年，你感受到好大嘅壓力 咁今日呢個演講可以拯救到你嘅生命 因為可能下一次 你嘅心跳因為壓力而加快 你會記得呢場演講，然後話畀自己 呢個係我嘅身體幫我應對挑戰 
And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable. ,當你用咁樣睇壓力嘅時候 你嘅身體會信任你 身體對壓力嘅反應就會更加健康 
How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. ,我剛才講過 過去十年我一直將壓力妖魔化 並試圖從壓力裏面釋放自己 所以我想做多一樣嘢 
"When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage. ",我想話畀你哋知 壓力反應最被低估嘅一樣嘢係： 壓力可以令得你更加交際 
"And when you choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience. ",要明白壓力呢方面嘅特性 我哋需要睇下一種激素，催產素 我知道催產素已經同其他激素一樣出名 
"Now I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life, but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress. ",催產素甚至有一個可愛嘅別名︰ 「擁抱激素」 因為當你擁抱某個人時，催產素會釋放 
Stress gives us access to our hearts. ,但係呢樣僅僅係催產素其中一個作用 
"The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others, and yes, your pounding physical heart, working so hard to give you strength and energy. ",催產素係一種神經激素 
"And when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress, you're actually making a pretty profound statement. ",佢可以調節大腦嘅社交本能 
You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges. ,催產素能夠令你做 一啲加強同別人聯繫嘅事情 
And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone. ,催產素令你渴望同 朋友、同家人有身體接觸 
Thank you. ,催產素能夠增加你嘅同情心 
"(Applause) Chris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us. ",佢仲會令你更願意幫助同支持 嗰啲你關心嘅人 
It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy. ,有啲人甚至提議 我哋應該用鼻吸催產素 
"How would that extend to advice, like, if someone is making a lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go? ",令我哋變得更有同情心同愛心 
"It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense? ",但係呢正表明大部分嘅人 並唔了解催產素 
"KM: Yeah, and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort. ",佢係壓力激素 
"And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions, is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows. ",你嘅腦垂體釋放呢種物質 作為對壓力反應嘅一部分 
"CA: Thank you so much, Kelly. It's pretty cool. ",腎上腺素令心跳加快 其實係身體對於壓力嘅反饋 
(Applause) ,當身體應對壓力釋放催產素時 催產素能夠促使你去搵人幫手 
,呢啲壓力嘅生理反應 促使你話畀人知你嘅感受 而唔係屈喺心裡面 
"When I was about three or four years old, I remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers, and I remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book, to feel the picture they were discussing. ",壓力反應令你會留意 生活當中嘅人有冇遇到困難 如果有，你就可以互相幫助 
"And my mum said, ""Darling, remember that you can't see and you can't feel the picture and you can't feel the print on the page."" ",當生活變得困難嘅時候 壓力反應會叫你走去俾人關心你 
"And I thought to myself, ""But that's what I want to do. ",咁樣知道壓力嘅呢一面 點樣令你哋更健康？ 
"I love stories. I want to read."" ",催產素並唔單單對你嘅大腦有作用 
Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true. ,佢同樣對你嘅身體有作用 佢對身體嘅其中一個重要作用 係保護你嘅心血管功能免受壓力傷害 
"I was born premature by about 10 weeks, which resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago. ",催產素係天然嘅抗炎物 
"The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia, and it's now very rare in the developed world. ",佢幫助你嘅血管 喺應對壓力時保持放鬆 
"Little did I know, lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948 that I'd been born at the right place and the right time, that I was in a country where I could participate in the technological revolution. ",但係我最感興趣嘅，係佢對心臟嘅作用 
"There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet, but those of us who've shared in the technological changes mainly come from North America, Europe, Japan and other developed parts of the world. ",你嘅心臟有催產素受體 佢幫助心肌細胞重生 同從壓力導致嘅損傷中復元 
"Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world, but I think they've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group. ",壓力激素強化你嘅心臟 
And so I want to tell you about the interaction between computer-based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person I am today. ,更加犀利嘅係 催產素對身體嘅呢啲好處 可以透過社交接觸 同別人嘅支持去加強 
"It's an interaction between volunteers, passionate inventors and technology, and it's a story that many other blind people could tell. ",因此，當你有壓力去搵人 或者人哋有壓力你幫人 你嘅身體都會釋放更多催產素 你嘅壓力反應會變得更加健康 你亦會快啲由壓力當中復元 
But let me tell you a bit about it today. ,我發現一樣嘢好神奇 就係壓力反應有 一個內在機制去釋放壓力 而呢個機制就係同人嘅接觸 
"When I was five, I went to school and I learned braille. ",我想講另一個故事去結束我嘅演講 
"It's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper, and I can feel them with my fingers. ",因為呢個研究可以救到某個人嘅生命 
"In fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report. ",呢個研究追蹤咗大約一千位美國成年人 佢哋嘅年齡喺 34 歲到 93 歲之間 個研究開始時問佢哋： 「喺過去嘅一年，你經歷幾多壓力？」 
I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from. ,然後又問佢哋，「你哋花幾多時間嚟 幫助朋友，鄰居同你社區嘅人？」 
"(Laughter) I was pretty good in reading, but religion and musical appreciation needed more work. ",然後佢哋令用公共記錄 睇返之後五年有邊個死咗 
"(Laughter) When you leave the opera house, you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts. ",首先講壞消息： 每個人生重大嘅壓力經歷 譬如經濟困難或者家庭危機 都會增加 30% 死亡風險 
Look for it. Have you noticed it? ,但係——你哋都係想聽到「但係」啫 但係呢樣嘢並唔係對每一個人都適用 
I do. I look for it all the time. ,嗰啲會關心人嘅人 死亡風險並冇實質嘅增加 —— 係零呀！ 
"(Laughter) When I was at school, the books were transcribed by transcribers, voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so I'd have volumes to read, and that had been going on, mainly by women, since the late 19th century in this country, but it was the only way I could read. ",關心人令你對抗到壓力 
"When I was in high school, I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder, and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning. ",然後，我哋再一次睇到 壓力對於健康嘅害處並唔係必然嘅 
"I could have family and friends read me material, and I could then read it back as many times as I needed. ",你點樣思考及點樣應對壓力 能夠影響你嘅壓力反應 
And it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers. ,當你將身體嘅壓力反應睇得好正面時 你就建立咗一種生理性嘅激勵 
"For example, when I studied at graduate school at Queen's University in Canada, the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me. ",當你選擇喺壓力下同人接觸、交流 你就會建立到抗逆機制 
"I gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it. ",我當然唔需要多啲嘅壓力經歷 但係科學令我對壓力有全新嘅認識 
"As one of them said to me, ""Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment."" ",壓力令得我哋認識心臟 
"(Laughter) But think of it. These men, who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had, helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help. ",喺我哋同人聯繫嘅時候 會搵到歡樂同意義 同時心臟努力揼動俾你力量同能量 
"Well, I went back and became an academic at Melbourne's Monash University, and for those 25 years, tape recorders were everything to me. ",當你用呢種方式睇壓力時 你唔單止能夠喺壓力之下做嘅更好 你仲話俾自己聽 
"In fact, in my office in 1990, I had 18 miles of tape. ",你可以信任自己應對生活嘅挑戰 
"Students, family and friends all read me material. ",同埋你會記得你唔需要獨自面對壓力 
"Mrs. Lois Doery, whom I later came to call my surrogate mum, read me many thousands of hours onto tape. ",多謝 
One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her. ,（鼓掌） Chris Anderson： 你話畀我哋知嘅呢啲嘢真係好神奇 
"But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today. ",對我嚟講，好神奇在於 點樣睇壓力原來可以影響一個人嘅壽命 
"But I thank you here, Lois, from this platform. ",就住呢個發現，我哋可唔可以建議人 譬如：有人諗緊做 有壓力嘅工定無壓力嘅工 佢哋應該點樣揀好？ 
"(Applause) I saw my first Apple computer in 1984, and I thought to myself, ""This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me."" ",係咪只要相信你應付壓力 無論揀邊個都係咁明智？ 
How very wrong I was. ,講者︰係嘅，而且我哋能夠肯定嘅係 追尋意義比逃避不安 對你嘅身體更加好 
"In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born, I got my first blind computer, and it's actually here. ",所以我想講，最好嘅決定 就係當你可以做構成你生命意義嘅事 同埋相信自己能夠處理伴隨嘅壓力 
See it up there? ,Chris Anderson： 非常感謝 Kelly 呢場演講非常精彩 
"And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen. ",（鼓掌） 
(Laughter) It's a blind computer. ,
"(Laughter) It's a Keynote Gold 84k, and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory. ",喺我三四歲嘅時候 我記得阿媽同我同兩個大佬 講過一個故仔 我記得嗰時用手觸摸書嘅紙 想像佢哋討論梗嘅圖畫 
"(Laughter) Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter) I think there's more memory in my watch. ",我阿媽講︰「阿仔， 記住，你睇唔見， 你感受唔到圖畫， 你感受唔到頁面嘅印刷。」 
"It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people. ",我心諗︰ 「但係，我正想掂書。 
"Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005, but his memory lives on in my heart. ",我鍾意故仔，我想讀佢哋。」 
"It meant, for the first time, I could read back what I had typed into it. ",我真係冇諗到 我會係一場技術革命嘅一分子 令到細個想摸書嘅願望成真 
It had a speech synthesizer. ,阿媽早產我十個禮拜 導致我 64 年前失明 
I'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory. ,呢種情況稱為晶狀體後纖維增生症 已經喺發達國家好少見 
"This now allowed me to read back what I'd written and to enter the computer world, even with its 84k of memory. ",我唔知道喺 1948 年 我喺初生恆溫箱裏邊時 我出世嘅地方同時間都咁啱 我原來出世喺一個 可以參與到技術革命嘅國家度 
"In 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor, worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech. ",全球有三千七百萬盲人 但係，當中受惠於科技嘅盲人 主要嚟自北美，歐洲、日本 同其他發達國家 
"Optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font, but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers, he developed a machine that could read any font. ",電腦已經改變咗在座各位 以至世界各地嘅人嘅生活 但我覺得電腦改變盲人嘅程度 比其他人仲要高 
"And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine, was launched on the 13th of January, 1976. ",所以我想講下我同電腦輔助科技 同埋無數多年嚟 幫我嘅義工之間嘅互動 因為互動，至有今日嘅我 
"I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil in March 1989, and it blew me away, and in September 1989, the month that my associate professorship at Monash University was announced, the law school got one, and I could use it. ",亦都因為義工、熱情嘅發明家 同科技之間嘅互動 先至有今日嘅我 我嘅故事有好多盲人都講過 
"For the first time, I could read what I wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner. ",但係，等我我講少少我嘅故事 
I didn't have to be nice to people! ,五歲嗰時我返學係學盲人凸字 
(Laughter) I no longer would be censored. ,盲人凸字係一個 剩係得六個點嘅巧妙系統 嗰啲點鑿入紙裏邊 透過手指，我可以感覺到佢哋 
"For example, I was too shy then, and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material. ",事實上，我覺得學校啲人 喺度展示梗我六年班嘅報告 
"(Laughter) But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and -- (Laughter) (Applause) Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop. ",我唔知 Julian Morrow 佢喺邊度攞返嚟 
And now I can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries. ,（笑聲） 我閱讀科好叻 但宗教同音樂科要多啲努力 
I can keep up with my friends. ,（笑聲） 當你離開劇院 你會發現，電梯裡邊有盲人凸字 
"There are many people who have helped me in my life, and many that I haven't met. ",搵下！搵唔搵到？ 
One is another American inventor Ted Henter. ,我成日都搵嗰喎！ 
"Ted was a motorcycle racer, but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight, which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes. ",（笑聲） 我返學嘅時候 書本由抄卷員，即係義工 一點一點咁樣抄錄 所以我至有一堆書睇 美國嘅抄錄工作自十九世紀末開始 主要由女性做 抄錄亦係唯一方式令我可以閱讀 
He then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier. ,當我讀高中嘅時候 我有第一個磁帶錄音機 菲利普牌子嘅 磁帶錄音機成為我 電腦時代之前嘅學習工具 
"But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the Net or from what was on the computer. ",有咗錄音機之後 我可以請家人朋友將文字讀一次 然後我就可以將佢讀返，讀幾多次都得 
"It's called JAWS, Job Access With Speech, and it sounds like this. ",佢令我可以接觸義工同助手 
(JAWS speaking) Ron McCallum: Isn't that slow? ,譬如 當我喺加拿大皇后大學度 讀研究生嘅時候 Colloins Bay 監獄嘅囚犯同意幫我錄音 
"(Laughter) You see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep. ",我將錄音機交畀佢哋，佢哋錄低聲音 
I slowed it down for you. ,有一個人同我講︰ 「Ron，我哋宜家無地方去， 我哋可以幫你。」 
I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it. ,（笑聲） 但諗一諗呢啲囚犯 嗰啲冇同我一樣受過教育嘅人 無私咁協助我讀到法學研究生 
"(JAWS speaking) (Laughter) RM: You know, when you're marking student essays, you want to get through them fairly quickly. ",之後我去咗墨爾本 Monash University 做教職員 25 年裏邊 所有嘢都係透過錄音機接收資訊 
(Laughter) (Applause) This technology that fascinated me in 1987 is now on my iPhone and on yours as well. ,1990 年我嘅辦公室收藏嘅磁帶 長達 18 英里 
"But, you know, I find reading with machines a very lonely process. ",學生、家人、朋友都幫過我錄音 
"I grew up with family, friends, reading to me, and I loved the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading. ",Lois Doery 女士係我後來嘅代母 佢幫我讀咗成千上萬個鐘頭 
Do you love being read to? ,其中一個我今日應承講上嚟講嘅原因 係我希望 Lois Doery 佢今日能夠喺度 令我可以介紹佢畀你哋，並公開多謝佢 
"And one of my most enduring memories is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children down near Manly Beach ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."" ",可惜今日，佢身體抱恙，未能夠嚟到 
Isn't that a great book? ,但我想喺呢度多謝你 Lois Doery 
I still love being close to someone reading to me. ,（掌聲） 1984 年，我有我第一台電腦 我諗︰ 「呢樣嘢雖然有玻璃屏幕， 但對我冇用。」 
"But I wouldn't give up the technology, because it's allowed me to lead a great life. ",我諗得好錯 
"Of course, talking books for the blind predated all this technology. ",1987 年，我嘅大仔 Gerard 出世嘅嗰個月 我終於有我第一台盲人電腦 台上擺咗部咁嘅電腦 
"After all, the long-playing record was developed in the early 1930s, and now we put talking books on CDs using the digital access system known as DAISY. ",見到未？ 
"But when I'm reading with synthetic voices, I love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice. ",你發現佢冇屏幕 
Now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities. ,（笑聲） 佢係一台盲人電腦 
Many websites we can't read using JAWS and the other technologies. ,（笑聲） 佢叫做 Keynote Gold 84k 84k 代表佢有 84KB 記憶體 
"Websites are often very visual, and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled, and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3, known as W3C, has developed worldwide standards for the Internet. ",（笑聲） 唔好笑，當時佢使咗我四千美金 （笑聲） 我諗我手錶嘅記憶體都多過佢 
And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field. ,佢係由一個充滿熱情嘅發明家 Russell Smith 發明 居住喺新西蘭，致力幫助盲人 
There are other barriers brought about by our laws. ,不幸地，2005 年 佢因為小型飛機墜毀而離世 但佢永遠喺我心裡面 
"For example, Australia, like about one third of the world's countries, has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we blind persons. ",講返轉頭，即係話第一次 我可以將我打出嚟嘅嘢讀出嚟 
But those books can't travel across borders. ,佢有一個語音合成器 
"For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000 accessible books in Spanish. ",喺 1979 年，我喺打字機上純粹憑記憶 完成我第一部關於勞工法嘅合著書 
"In Argentina, there are 50,000. ",咁嘅電腦令我知道自己打咗乜嘢 同埋，就算係得 84k 記憶體 我都一樣可以走進電腦世界 
In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand. ,1974 年，美國發明家 Ray Kurzweil 開發一台可以掃描書本嘅機器 透過語音合成讀出嚟 
But it's not legal to transport the books from Spain to Latin America. ,而光學字符識別單元 通常剩係展示到一種字體 但用咗感光耦合元件桌式掃描儀 同語音合成之後 佢開發到一台能夠讀任何字體嘅機 
"There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc., but they can't be transported to the 60 countries in our world where English is the first and the second language. ",佢呢部同洗衣機一樣大嘅機 喺 1976 年 1 月 13 日推出 
And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter. ,而喺 1989 年 3 月 我擁有第一台商業用嘅 Kurzweil 電腦 部電腦令人好感動 1989 年 9 月 Monash University 宣佈 聘請我做助理教授 法學院有一部 Kurzweil 電腦我可以用 
"Well, because we can't transport books across borders, there had to be separate versions read in all the different English-speaking countries: Britain, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all had to have separate readings of Harry Potter. ",第一次，我可以讀我鍾意讀嘅 只要將書放喺掃描器上面就可以讀嘞 
"And that's why, next month in Morocco, a meeting is taking place between all the countries. ",我就唔需要求人啦！ 
"It's something that a group of countries and the World Blind Union are advocating, a cross-border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception, we can transport those books across borders and give life to people, particularly in developing countries, blind people who don't have the books to read. ",（笑聲） 唔好再有人審査我 
I want that to happen. ,例如，嗰時我好怕羞 其實宜家也好怕求人 幫我大聲讀性禁書 
"(Applause) My life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children and certainly interesting work to do, whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School, where I served a term as dean, or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva. ",（笑聲） 但你知啦 我可以喺半夜攞一本書，然後… （笑聲） （掌聲） 宜家，Kurzweil 閱讀器 縮細到我筆電嘅一個程式 
I've indeed been a very fortunate human being. ,宜家，我可以掃描最新嘅小說 唔使等佢擺喺發聲圖書館入邊先聽到 
I wonder what the future will hold. ,我可以同老友記聯絡 
"The technology will advance even further, but I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago, ""Remember, darling, you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers."" ",我生命裏邊有好多幫過我嘅人 仲有好多我從未見過嘅人 
"I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers, volunteer readers and passionate inventors, has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world. ",其中一位係美國發明家 Ted Henter 
"I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin, who is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides, and my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life, is coming on to collect me. ",佢以前係電單車車手 1978 年因為車禍失明 對於渣電單車嘅人嚟講非常之慘 
I want to thank her too. ,之後佢轉咗去玩滑水 仲成為殘疾人滑水比賽冠軍 
I think I have to say goodbye now. ,1989 年，佢同 Bill Joyce 組隊 開發一款能夠閱讀 無論網頁定電腦文字嘅程式 
Bless you. Thank you very much. ,亦叫做 JAWS 全稱 Job Access With Speech 名符其實 
(Applause) Yay! (Applause) Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (Applause) ,（JAWS 發聲） 講者：係咪好慢？ 
,（笑聲） 如果佢咁嘅速度讀，我實瞓著咗 
"This is our life with bees, and this is our life without bees. ",其實係我較慢咗啫 
Bees are the most important pollinators of our fruits and vegetables and flowers and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals. ,大家想唔想用我平時聽嘅速度播？ 
More than one third of the world's crop production is dependent on bee pollination. ,（JAWS 發聲） （笑聲） 講者：你要明白，當你批改學生功課 您要快速咁讀 
But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 呢個 1987 年 曾經令我著迷過嘅技術 宜家喺同你哋 iPhone 上面都有 
They're out there because they need to eat. ,但我發覺用機器讀 係一個好寂莫嘅過程 
Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar. ,喺我成長裏面，家人、朋友 都有讀書俾我聽 我鍾意啲人讀書嗰陣 嗰份溫暖、呼吸同親近 
"They're flower-feeders, and as they move from flower to flower, basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart, they end up providing this valuable pollination service. ",你哋鍾唔鍾意有人讀俾你聽？ 
"In parts of the world where there are no bees, or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees, people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand. ",我印象中最深刻一次 係 1999 年喺曼利海灘附近 瑪麗喺度讀「哈利波特與魔法石」 俾我同小朋友聽 
These people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush. ,唔係一本好書嗎？ 
Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon. ,我仲鍾意坐近讀俾我聽嘅人 
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator. ,但我唔會因此唔用文字閱讀器 事關閱讀器帶俾我精彩生活 
"Now this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter) Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower, the anther, and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it. ",當然發聲圖書比閱讀器更加早出現 
"So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it, and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C. ",畢竟，收錄長錄音嘅錄音帶 喺 19 世紀 30 年代初出現 宜家發聲圖書都入落去光碟入裏邊 用簡稱 DAISY 嘅數碼存取系統儲存 
"So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it, and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh, and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body, and she takes it home as food. ",但當我用合成語音讀書嘅時候 我習慣返到屋企 讀一本內容生動嘅小說 兼且真人發音 
Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes. ,宜家我哋殘疾人士仍然有一啲問題 
"So there's other, maybe more personal reasons, to care about bees. ",例如有好多網站都冇得用 JAWS 閱讀 其他技術都唔得 
"There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world, and they're absolutely gorgeous. ",又例如網站通常都好多圖 有啲圖表冇標示 有啲按鈕都冇標示 呢樣正正係世界萬維網聯盟 3 簡稱 W3C 針對互聯網製定咗國際標準 
These bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees. ,我哋希朢所有互聯網用戶或網主 可以令網站更兼容 令我哋盲人都享有一個同等對待嘅環境 
"Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other 19,900-plus species because there's something about honeybees that draws people into their world. ",我哋嘅法律也帶嚟咗障礙 
"Humans have been drawn to honeybees since early recorded history, mostly to harvest their honey, which is an amazing natural sweetener. ",例如 澳洲好似世界三分之一嘅國家一樣 有版權豁免，令書籍可以製成盲人凸字 或者發出聲俾盲人閱讀 
I got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke. ,但呢啲書唔能夠喺其他國家使用 
"I was 18 years old and bored, and I picked up a book in the library on bees and I spent the night reading it. ",例如西班牙文嘅書籍 喺西班牙有十萬 
I had never thought about insects living in complex societies. ,喺阿根廷有五萬 
It was like the best of science fiction come true. ,但喺其他拉丁美洲國家就少過幾千本 
"And even stranger, there were these people, these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family, and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself. ",但如果將盲人凸字嘅書 由西班牙運去拉丁美洲，係唔合法 
"So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper, a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico. ",成千上萬嘅可以用嘅盲人凸字書籍 遍佈喺美國、英國 加拿大、澳洲等國家 但佢哋唔可以運去其他 60 個 以英語為第一、第二語言嘅國家 
And I was permanently hooked. ,記得我頭先講過哈利波特 
"Honeybees can be considered a super-organism, where the colony is the organism and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual bee organisms. ",因為我哋唔可以運書去第二個國家 所以同一本書喺唔同英語國家 英國、美國、加拿大、澳洲、新西蘭 就會有唔同版本嘅哈利波特 
Now this society has no central authority. ,呢樣亦都係點解，下個月喺摩洛哥 有一個所有國家都會參加嘅會議 
"So how they come to collective decisions, and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor, how they communicate where the flowers are, all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing. ",事關個會議關乎到 一啲國家同世界盲人聯盟 倡導嘅跨國協定 當中講到，如果兩個國家都有版權豁免 我哋就可以將書 喺兩個國家之間運嚟運去 尤其喺發展中國家 為冇書讀嘅盲人重新燃點生命 
"My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years, is their system of healthcare. ",我想呢樣發生 
So bees have social healthcare. ,（掌聲） 我嘅生活一直都幸福 結咗婚又有細路 仲有得意嘅工作做 無論喺悉尼大學法學院擔任院長 定係宜家坐喺日內瓦 聯合國殘疾人權利委員會 
"So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy. ",我自覺係一個幸福嘅人 
"For example, we study hygiene, where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest, from the colony, and it keeps the colony healthy. ",我唔知將來會點 
"And more recently, we've been studying resins that bees collect from plants. ",但科技必然會更加先進 我仲記得阿媽 60 年前講過︰ 「記住阿仔， 你永遠唔會用手指嚟閱讀。」 
"So bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very, very sticky resins off the leaves, and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis. ",我好高興呢種我同 凸字抄寫員、志願讀者 同埋熱情嘅發明家之間嘅互動 令到我同全世界盲人嘅閱讀夢想成真 
We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant. ,我想多謝我嘅研究員 Hannah Martin 佢一路喺度幫我襟下一張投影片 我要多謝老婆 Mary Crock 佢係我嘅生命之光 佢會嚟接我 
It's a natural antibiotic. ,我要感謝我太太 
"It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony, and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity. ",我諗我要講再見喇 
Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times. ,祝大家平安。多謝曬 
"We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies for human medicine, but we didn't know how good it was for the bees. ",（掌聲） 耶！ （掌聲） 好，好，好，好 
So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over 50 million years. ,
"So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse, first in the United States, it was clear that there was something really, really wrong. ",有蜂嘅日子係咁 無蜂嘅日子就會變成咁 
"In our collective conscience, in a really primal way, we know we can't afford to lose bees. ",蜂係最重要嘅傳粉者 幫水果、蔬菜、花卉同農作物 例如餵家畜嘅紫花乾草 
So what's going on? ,傳花粉 超過三分一嘅世界農作物 需要靠蜂傳播花粉 
"Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes, and I'll go through each of these. ",諷刺嘅係 蜂無專登為人類糧食傳播花粉 
"The bottom line is, bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system. ",佢地之所以出動，係因為要搵食 
"Now we have the best data on honeybees, so I'll use them as an example. ",花粉可以為蜂提供所有嘅蛋白質 而花蜜就完全俾到佢哋 所需嘅碳水化合物 
"In the United States, bees in fact have been in decline since World War II. ",花係佢地嘅食物 佢哋採花嘅過程 就好似喺花市買花一樣 逛緊嗰陣，仲做埋有值錢嘅傳粉服務 
We have half the number of managed hives in the United States now compared to 1945. ,喺無蜂嘅地方 或者無植物啱蜂心水嘅地方 只能夠俾錢請人做人工授粉 
"We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think. ",授粉需要工人用板刷，逐棵花刷 
"And the reason is, after World War II, we changed our farming practices. ",人工授粉行業，依家其實好普遍 
We stopped planting cover crops. ,番茄果農成日用手提震動器 去幫茄花傳粉 
"We stopped planting clover and alfalfa, which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil, and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers. ",呢個就喺番茄搔癢器 （笑聲） 用佢嘅原因係因為 茄花嘅花粉埋喺花嘅深處 雄蕊入邊，即係花粉囊邊 唯一將佢整出嚟嘅方法 就係震動花粉囊 
Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees. ,世上只有幾種蜂可以幫茄花傳粉 熊蜂係其中一種 佢地可以抓住朵花，顫動飛行肌 發出類似 C 音頻率嘅聲波 
"And after World War II, we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms. ",咁樣，透過將花震動，將花粉震出嚟 黐喺毛茸茸嘅熊蜂身上 然後熊蜂帶返屋企開餐 
Many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival. ,依家，茄農將熊蜂竇放喺溫室入邊 用佢哋幫番茄傳粉 咁樣傳粉有效率又自然 番茄品質又更加好 
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures. ,所以，我哋有更多理由去關注蜂群 
"Now we talk about food deserts, places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores. ",世界上，有超過兩萬種蜂 呢樣嘢絕對係了不起 
"The very farms that used to sustain bees are now agricultural food deserts, dominated by one or two plant species like corn and soybeans. ",呢啲蜂大半生喺地底 或者中空嘅植物莖部生活 只有極少數好似蜜蜂咁 進化出高度嘅社會行為 
"Since World War II, we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival. ",依家，蜜蜂係 其他一萬九千幾種蜂嘅代表 蜜蜂確實有佢哋引人注目嘅魅力 
"And these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees, like almonds. ",自從有歷史文獻開始 人類就已經留意蜜蜂 主要因為可以 喺佢哋身上提取到蜂蜜 蜂蜜係天然嘅甜味劑 
"Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies, hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination, and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein. It's really good for bees. ",而我對蜜蜂產生興趣完全係意外 
"Now, the scale of almond monoculture demands that most of our nation's bees, over 1.5 million hives of bees, be transported across the nation to pollinate this one crop. ",當時我 18 歲，覺得好無聊 喺圖書館睇到一本關於蜂類嘅書 嗰晚，我睇咗本書 
"And they're trucked in in semi-loads, and they must be trucked out, because after bloom, the almond orchards are a vast and flowerless landscape. ",之前我從未諗過 昆蟲可以有咁複雜嘅社會組織 
"Bees have been dying over the last 50 years, and we're planting more crops that need them. ",就好似一本超精彩科幻小說嘅真實版 
There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination. ,更離奇嘅係 有班養蜂人佢哋好錫自己啲蜂 就好似屋企人一樣 當我讀完本書，我決定要親身去睇 
And then there's pesticides. ,於是，我去咗幫一個養蜂商人打工 佢成家喺新墨西哥州，擁有兩千個蜂巢 
"After World War II, we started using pesticides on a large scale, and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests. ",從此，我同蜜蜂結下不解之緣 
"Recently, researchers from Penn State University have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food, and they've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it, and this includes every class of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient. ",蜜蜂唔單止係生物 每一個蜂群仲係一個個體 每個蜂群通常由四到五萬隻蜜蜂組成 
This small bee is holding up a large mirror. ,但個體冇首領，無人話事 
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans? ,佢哋點樣行集體決定 點樣分配任務同勞工 點樣傳達採花地點嘅信息 佢哋所有社會行為都令人興奮不已 
"One of these class of insecticides, the neonicontinoids, is making headlines around the world right now. ",我用咗好多年研究自己 最鍾意嘅蜂群保健系統 
You've probably heard about it. ,無錯，蜜蜂都有保健 
This is a new class of insecticides. ,我嘅實驗室研究蜜蜂點樣維持健康 
"It moves through the plant so that a crop pest, a leaf-eating insect, would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die. ",例如，我哋研究衛生學 發現蜜蜂可以搵到同分開 蜂巢裏邊有病嘅成員 確保蜂群健康 
"If one of these neonics, we call them, is applied in a high concentration, such as in this ground application, enough of the compound moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and the nectar, where a bee can consume, in this case, a high dose of this neurotoxin that makes the bee twitch and die. ",最近，我哋研究緊 蜜蜂喺植物度收集返來嘅樹脂 
"In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms, it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide, and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar, and if a bee consumes this lower dose, either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented and she may not find her way home. ",蜜蜂會喺某啲樹嘅樹葉度 刮出癡蠟蠟嘅樹脂 然後帶返蜂巢 鋪落個巢度 我哋叫佢做蜂膠 
"And on top of everything else, bees have their own set of diseases and parasites. ",大家都知道蜂膠係一種天然殺菌劑 
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing. ,又係天然抗生素 
It's aptly named. ,佢可以將蜂群入邊嘅細菌、霉菌 仲有其他病菌殺死 確保蜂群健康，增強群體免疫力 
"It's this big, blood-sucking parasite that compromises the bee's immune system and circulates viruses. ",人類自從聖經年代 就已經知道蜂膠嘅效用 
Let me put this all together for you. ,我哋一直採集蜂巢入邊嘅蜂膠做藥物 但從來唔知蜂膠對蜂群有幾重要 
"I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it, and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus, but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu, and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition. ",蜜蜂憑藉呢種出色嘅天然防禦物 健康繁盛咗超過五千萬年 
But what if I lived in a food desert? ,直到七年前 美國首次報導有大量蜂群死亡 我就知道發生咗好大問題 
"And what if I had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store, and I finally got my weak body out there and I consumed, in my food, enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin, that I couldn't find my way home? ",好簡單，從我哋嘅認知 我哋知道人類 承受唔到冇蜜蜂嘅後果 
And this is what we mean by multiple and interacting causes of death. ,咁究竟發生咗咩一回事？ 
And it's not just our honeybees. ,蜜蜂死於多種互相影響嘅因素 陣間我會逐一講解 
"All of our beautiful wild species of bees are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees. ",重點係蜜蜂死亡 反映咗個環境無花 同埋食物系統運作有問題 
These bees are providing backup for our honeybees. ,我會攞我哋宜家 最好嘅蜜蜂數據做例子︰ 
They're providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees. ,美國嘅蜜蜂數量 由二戰之後就一直減少 
We need all of our bees. ,對比 1945 年 美國現時嘅蜂箱數量只剩返一半 
So what are we going to do? ,我哋估計剩返二百萬個蜂箱 
What are we going to do about this big bee bummer that we've created? ,原因係，二戰之後我哋改變耕種方式 
"It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful. ",唔再種「遮蓋作物」 
Every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways. ,好似三葉草同苜蓿咁 佢哋都係天然嘅土壤固氮肥料 但係宜家大家都用化肥代替 
"Plant bee-friendly flowers, and don't contaminate these flowers, this bee food, with pesticides. ",三葉草同苜蓿都係蜂類嘅高級營養品 
So go online and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them. ,二戰後，我哋開始 用除草劑清理田間雜草 
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep. ,但好多雜草都係開花植物 蜂要靠佢哋維生 
"Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns, in your boulevards. ",同時，單一作物嘅種植規模越來越大 
"Campaign to have them planted in public gardens, community spaces, meadows. ",我哋宜家講「食物荒漠」 正係指城市裏邊、社區附近 買唔到多款食物 
Set aside farmland. ,蜂類以前覓食嘅農田 今日變咗「食物荒漠」 得返一兩種農作物喺度大量種植 好似粟米同大豆咁 
"We need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season, from spring to fall. ",自從二戰之後，我哋一直喺度有系統 剷除好多蜂類賴以為生嘅開花植物 
"We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees, but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife. ",單一大規模種植甚至包括杏仁 呢啲對蜂類有益嘅植物 
And we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops to nourish our soil and nourish our bees. ,50 年前，養蜂人會將 一啲蜂巢擺喺杏仁果園 用嚟傳播杏仁花粉 亦都因為杏仁花粉有好多蛋白質 對蜂類好有益 
And we need to diversify our farms. ,依家，杏仁嘅種植規模 大到需要動用全國大部份嘅蜂嚟幫手 超過一百五十萬個蜂箱 需要千里迢迢咁運 就係為咗幫杏仁傳花粉 
We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we've created. ,蜂巢用貨車運去 之後又要用貨車運走 因為花期過後 成個果園就係一個無花嘅世界 
"So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers -- but when bees have access to good nutrition, we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services. ",蜂類喺過去五十年間不斷減少 但需要佢哋傳粉嘅農作物 數量一直增加緊 
"And when bees have access to good nutrition, they're better able to engage their own natural defenses, their healthcare, that they have relied on for millions of years. ",增幅達到三倍 
"So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me, is that every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society, where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution, an emergent property, that's much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions. ",跟住講下殺蟲劑 
So let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change. ,二戰之後，單一種植引發蟲害氾濫 以致必須大規模 用殺蟲劑嚟控制蟲害 
"On behalf of the bees, thank you. ",最近，賓夕法尼亞州立大學嘅研究人員 對蜜蜂帶返巢嘅花粉 量度殺蟲劑殘留量 發現每一批蜜蜂收集嘅花粉 都起碼有六種農藥 包括各類殺蟲劑、除草劑、殺菌劑 甚至包括無標示嘅佐劑 佐劑係殺蟲配方嘅成份 毒性分分鐘比活躍成份勁 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question. ,蜜蜂令我哋問︰ 
"The latest numbers on the die-off of bees, is there any sign of things bottoming out? ",農藥幾時會毒害到人體？ 
What's your hope/depression level on this? ,其中一類殺蟲劑叫敵敵畏 全世界新聞都講緊佢 
Maria Spivak: Yeah. ,你可能都聽過 
"At least in the United States, an average of 30 percent of all bee hives are lost every winter. ",佢係新型殺蟲劑 
"About 20 years ago, we were at a 15-percent loss. ",植物吸收咗佢之後 只要食葉嘅昆蟲咬植物塊葉一啖 就足以致命 
So it's getting precarious. ,如果任何一種敵敵畏高濃度咁用 就會好似頭先講到咁 當足夠劑量嘅敵敵畏 去到植物嘅花粉同花蜜 而蜜蜂食用嘅話 高劑量嘅神經毒素會令蜜蜂抽搐同死亡 
"CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's -- MS: Yes, thirty percent a year. ",美國大多數農場裏邊 只有種子會噴咗殺蟲劑 所以植物嘅殺蟲劑濃度都會低啲 花粉同花蜜嘅殺蟲劑都冇咁多 蜜蜂如果攝取咁少嘅殺蟲劑 佢一係無事 一係因為中毒而簜失路，返唔到屋企 
"CA: Thirty percent a year. MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies and so they can maintain the same number, they can recuperate some of their loss. ",除此之外，蜂都有自己嘅病同寄生蟲 
We're kind of at a tipping point. ,佢哋頭號敵人係狄氏瓦蟎 
We can't really afford to lose that many more. ,呢個名好啱佢 
We need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers. ,因為狄氏瓦蟎係 一種體型大嘅吸血寄生蟲 會削弱蜂嘅免疫系統，同時傳播病毒 
CA: Thank you. ,等我將蜂嘅困難總結一下 
(Applause) ,我唔知一隻被大隻吸血蟲 躝住全身嘅蜂會有咩感覺 亦唔知佢感染咗病毒嘅感覺 我凈係知自己有流感嗰時 連去士多買嘢食，補充營養嘅力都無 
,更何況，我仲身處「食物荒漠」？ 
The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals. ,我仲要行好遠嘅路先去到士多 去到嗰時，我買嘢食 但點知食物裏面有殺蟲劑同神經毒素 令我搵唔到返屋企嘅路 
It involves the design of cities and the design of city streets. ,以上就係我哋所講 蜂類死亡嘅多種關聯因素 
"Streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has, and yet it's an asset that's largely hidden in plain sight. ",唔止蜜蜂，所有野生蜂都喺危險邊緣 
And the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset. ,包括幫番茄傳粉嘅熊蜂 
"You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively, it can provide immediate benefits, and it can be quite popular. ",佢哋係蜜蜂嘅後援 
You just need to look at them a little differently. ,佢哋保障花粉傳播 
This is important because we live in an urban age. ,所以，我哋需要各種蜂 
"For the first time in history, most people live in cities, and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years, the population is going to double on the planet. ",咁要點做？ 
So the design of cities is a key issue for our future. ,我哋為蜂類整咗咁大麻煩 點先可以補到鑊？ 
Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in 2007. ,原來仲有希望 
"The plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace, and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here, we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure. ",有兩個簡單直接嘅辦法可以幫到佢哋 
"For many cities, our streets have been in a kind of suspended animation for generations. ",首先，種蜂鍾意嘅花 唔好用殺蟲劑 唔好污染啲花 
"This is a picture of Times Square in the '50s, and despite all of the technological innovation, cultural changes, political changes, this is Times Square in 2008. ",喺網上查你住緊地方嘅本地花卉品種 
Not much has changed in those 50 years. ,然後將佢哋種喺門口嘅花盤、前院 
"So we worked hard to refocus our agenda, to maximize efficient mobility, providing more room for buses, more room for bikes, more room for people to enjoy the city, and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them. ",草地同馬路旁邊 
We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks. ,喺公園、社區空間同公眾草坪 舉辦種花活動 
"Having goals is important, because if you want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction, you need to know where you're going and why. ",唔講農田，我哋要種唔同品種嘅花 
The design of a street can tell you everything about what's expected on it. ,令成個生長季節，春天到秋天都有花開 
"In this case, it's expected that you shelter in place. ",馬路兩邊都需要為種花 唔止為咗蜜蜂 仲為咗遷徙中嘅蝴蝶、候鳥 同其他野生動物而種 
"The design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible from point A to point B, and it misses all the other ways that a street is used. ",亦都係時候認真諗下 重新種返「遮蓋植物」 令土地增肥之餘 又可以養肥蜜蜂 
"When we started out, we did some early surveys about how our streets were used, and we found that New York City was largely a city without seats. ",農場都需要多樣化種植 
"Pictures like this, people perched on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city. ",我哋要喺田嘅邊緣種開花農作物 同做灌木籬牆 咁樣可以間斷食物荒漠 而且，要開始糾正 人類一手造成嘅食物系統紊亂 
(Laughter) It's not great for parents with kids. ,相比起大嘅難題 種花可能只係一個小小嘅解決方法 但係，如果蜂類營養充足 佢哋就可以傳播好嘅花粉 我哋咁先可以有好嘅食物 
It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers. ,而且，好營養可以鞏固 佢哋嘅天然抵抗力 同蜂類賴以為生過百年嘅保健系統 
It's probably not good for the fire hydrants. ,我覺得，咁樣幫蜂類嘅好處係 每個人都可以好似 蜜蜂社會裏面嘅一隻蜂 團結就是力量，每個人付出少少 再大嘅問題都可以解決到 
Certainly not good for the police department. ,所以，依家就等我哋開始種花 唔加任何農藥 一齊帶領改變呢片大地嘅顏色 
"So we worked hard to change that balance, and probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square. ",我代表蜂類多謝你哋 
"Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square, and people had tried for years to make changes. ",（掌聲） Chris Anderson：多謝 想問一個問題 
"They changed signals, they changed lanes, everything they could do to make Times Square work better. ",從最近蜜蜂死亡嘅數字睇 蜂類嘅數量有冇觸底反彈？ 
"It was dangerous, hard to cross the street. ",你對數字樂觀定失望？ 
"And so, none of those approaches worked, so we took a different approach, a bigger approach, looked at our street differently. ",講者：嗯 
And so we did a six-month pilot. ,至少喺美國 平均每個冬季就冇咗三成蜂巢 
We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space. ,大約喺廿年前，跌幅係 15% 
"And the temporary materials are an important part of the program, because we were able to show how it worked. ",所以，宜家處境更危急 
"And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know. ",#NAME?
So it was all about the data. ,Chris Anderson：係嘅三成 講者︰不過養蜂嘅人 可以將蜜蜂分到空嘅巢度 咁樣，數字就會一樣 損失就減少咗 
"So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility, if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it, and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul, we could put it back the way that it was, because these were temporary materials. ",但目前正係臨界點 
"And that was a very big part of the buy-in, much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back. ",蜂巢已經唔可以再少 
But the results were overwhelming. ,跟著落嚟，真係好希望大家都會種花 
Traffic moved better. It was much safer. ,Chris Anderson：唔該曬 
Five new flagship stores opened. ,（掌聲） 
It's been a total home run. ,
Times Square is now one of the top 10 retail locations on the planet. ,交通專員嘅工作 唔係剩係同停車牌、交通信號有關 
"And this is an important lesson, because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space. ",佢嘅工作仲包括設計城市同街道 
"Every project has its surprises, and one of the big surprises with Times Square was how quickly people flocked to the space. ",一座城市最有價值嘅資源 包括本身嘅街道 街道亦都係一種我哋成日睇唔到嘅資產 
"We put out the orange barrels, and people just materialized immediately into the street. ",過去六年紐約嘅經驗可以睇到 呢種資產係可以升級嘅 
"It was like a Star Trek episode, you know? ",改造街道可以好快、好平 可以有即時效果 兼且可以係一種潮流 
"They weren't there before, and then zzzzzt! ",你只需要換個角度去睇 
All the people arrived. ,呢點好重要 因為我哋宜家生活嘅係都市年代 
"Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there. ",歷史上第一次大部分人都住喺城市 聯合國估計 40 年內全球人口增加一倍 
"And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us, because the street furniture had not yet arrived. ",所以，城市規劃對我哋未來好關鍵 
"So we went to a hardware store and bought hundreds of lawn chairs, and we put those lawn chairs out on the street. ",彭博市長 2007 年提出紐約計畫嘅時候 佢已經意識到呢一點 
And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town. ,個計畫指出 城市好似全球市場嘅商品一樣 如果我哋想繼續發展、繁榮 吸引多一百萬有意移居紐約嘅人移居 我哋就需要關注 生活質素、基礎設施嘅效率 
It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars. ,對於好多其他城市嚟講 紐約嘅街道一直都好似 一部好多年前就已經停播嘅動畫片一樣 
It was about those lawn chairs. ,呢個係上世紀 50 年代嘅時代廣場 唔計科技創新、文化轉變、政治變遷 呢個係 2008 年嘅時代廣場 
What did you think about the lawn chairs? ,呢 50 年無好大嘅變化 
Do you like the color of the lawn chairs? ,我哋致力將計畫重新對焦 務求提升交通效率至極致 為巴士、單車營造更多便利條件 令街道安全到每個人都可以用 
"So if you've got a big, controversial project, think about lawn chairs. ",我哋制定咗一份清晰嘅行動規劃 有目標，有基準 
"(Laughter) This is the final design for Times Square, and it will create a level surface, sidewalk to sidewalk, beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards, creating a great new energy on the street, and we think it's going to really create a great place, a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name. ",訂立目標係好重要 因為如果你想改變大城市嘅發展方向 你需要知道你會去邊同點解 
"And we will be cutting the ribbon on this, the first phase, this December. ",城市佈局反映咗喺街道設計裏面 
"With all of our projects, our public space projects, we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who maintain the spaces, move the furniture, take care of the plants. ",而喺設計裏邊 要做到行車分隔 先至令車輛可以快速行駛 
"This is in front of Macy's, and they were a big supporter of this new approach, because they understood that more people on foot is better for business. ",但咁樣，往往忽略咗街道其他用途 
And we've done these projects all across the city in all kinds of neighborhoods. ,我哋一開始就做咗一啲早期調查 睇下紐約街道係點樣用 我哋發現紐約係無凳嘅城市 
"This is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, and you can see the short leg that was there, used for cars, that's not really needed. ",好似呢張相咁 啲人坐喺消防喉度 完全唔係世界級城市應有嘅模樣 
"So what we did is we painted over the street, put down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle to the storefronts on Grand Avenue, created a great new public space, and it's been great for businesses along Grand Avenue. ",（笑聲） 對有小朋友嘅父母唔好 
"We did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn, and this is one of our first projects that we did, and we took an underutilized, pretty dingy-looking parking lot and used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend. ",對老人家唔好 對零售商唔好 
"And in the three years since we've implemented the project, retail sales have increased 172 percent. ",對消防喉都唔好 
And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood. ,更加唔好講警察要成日要拉人 
"We've moved very, very quickly with paint and temporary materials. ",所以我哋努力解決呢樣嘢 可能新方法嘅最好證明 就係時代廣場 
"Instead of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done, we've done it with paint and temporary materials. ",每日平均有 35 萬人經過嗰度 但啲人好多年前就已經想改變一下 
And the proof is not in a computer model. ,佢哋換路牌，改行車線 用盡一切方法搞好時代廣場 
It is in the real-world performance of the street. ,但事與願違 過馬路既危險，又難，又混亂 
You can have fun with paint. ,呢啲方法一啲都無用 所以我哋用另一種方法 規模更加大嘅方法 用第二個角度睇街道 
"All told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city. ",我哋花六個月做事前研究 
We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space. ,我哋由 42 街至到 47 街封閉 Broadway 劃出新嘅 2.5 英畝嘅行人專用區 
I think one of the successes is in its emulation. ,臨時工程物料係成個計劃 好重要嘅一部分 因為我哋可以用佢嚟了解運作過程 
"You're seeing this kind of approach, since we've painted Times Square, you've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago, in San Francisco, in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, you name it. ",你哋可能都知，市長非常重視數據 
"This is actually in Los Angeles, and they actually copied even the green dots that we had on the streets. ",所以，呢個實驗係數據話事 
But I can't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods. ,如果新做法可以改善交通、車流、安全 對商業有益 我哋可以繼續用 但如果冇效、冇害 我哋可以將街道回復返以前嘅樣 因為呢啲工程物料只係暫時 
"We also brought this quick-acting approach to our cycling program, and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York. ",就好似買嘢一樣 唔要啲嘢可以擺返去，咁就冇傷肝啦 
"I think it's fair to say -- (Applause) -- it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike, and now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States. ",但實驗結果係壓倒性 
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes. ,交通改善咗，路面更加安全 
You can see the map in 2007. ,五間新旗艦店進駐 
This is how it looked in 2013 after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes. ,我哋一次徹徹底底勝利 
I love this because it looks so easy. ,今日，時代廣場係 全球前十名嘅零售集中地 
"You just click it, and they're there. ",今次係好重要嘅經驗 因為交通同公共空間之間 再唔係零和遊戲 
We also brought new designs to the street. ,每個工程項目都有自己嘅驚喜所在 而時代廣場咁多個驚喜入邊 其中一個就係 啲人好快佔用咗個空間 
We created the first parking-protected bike lane in the United States. ,我哋一移走橙色水桶 人就湧入條街 
"(Applause) We protected bikers by floating parking lanes, and it's been great. ",好似 Star Trek 裏面嘅情節 
Bike volumes have spiked. ,啲人之前都唔係度 
"Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, are all down 50 percent. ",突然間全部人都出現 
"And we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes, and now you're seeing them pop up all over the country. ",我唔知佢哋之前喺邊 但喺嗰一刻，佢哋就出現啦 
And you can see here that this strategy has worked. ,不過咁樣有個問題 因為街上設施仲未送到 
"The blue line is the number of cyclists, soaring. ",於是乎我哋去一間園藝用品店 買咗幾百張草坪凳 我哋將草坪凳裝設喺街上 
The green line is the number of bike lanes. ,草坪凳於是成為人討論嘅話題 
"And the yellow line is the number of injuries, which has remained essentially flat. ",封路唔係重點 
"After this big expansion, you've seen no net increase in injuries, and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers. ",重點係嗰啲草坪凳 
"Not everybody liked the new bike lanes, and there was a lawsuit and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago. ",「你覺得啲凳點呀？ 」 
"One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on Prospect Park West ""the most contested piece of land outside of the Gaza Strip."" ",「你鐘唔鐘意凳嘅顏色？ 」 
(Laughter) And this is what we had done. ,所以如果你手上有 一個大型、富爭議嘅計劃 就諗下嗰啲草坪凳啦 
"So if you dig below the headlines, though, you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press, far ahead of the politicians. ",（笑聲） 呢個係時代廣場嘅最終設計 佢會有一個平嘅地面 成塊地都係平嘅 水晶裝飾會加設喺地板之間 咁樣可以反射廣告燈箱嘅光 為成條街道帶嚟一份新活力 我哋覺得呢種設計令到哋方好靚 係世界新嘅靚景，名不虛傳咁靚 
"In fact, I think most politicians would be happy to have those kind of poll numbers. ",今年 12 月 我哋會為第一階段嘅施工剪綵 
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes. ,所有工程、公共空間項目 我哋都有同本地公司 商人保持密切合作 佢哋打理空間、植物，搬動設施 
"This summer, we launched Citi Bike, the largest bike share program in the United States, with 6,000 bikes and 330 stations located next to one another. ",呢度係梅西百貨前面 梅西百貨係我哋今次項目 一個重大支持者 因為佢哋意識到行人越多，生意越好 
"Since we've launched the program, three million trips have been taken. ",宜家我哋已經喺成個城市做咗呢啲項目 
People have ridden seven million miles. ,呢度係布魯克林嘅 Bed-Stuy 你可以睇到有畀車用嘅短柱係度 但其實支柱冇需要 
That's 280 times around the globe. ,所以我哋油曬成條街 用環氧樹脂鋪路 將三角形行人島同 Grand Avenue 嘅商店連埋一齊 形成一個新嘅公共空間 空間有利 Grand Avenue 嘅舖頭做生意 
"And so with this little blue key, you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand new transportation option. ",喺布魯克林嘅 DUMBO 我哋做咗同樣嘅嘢 呢個係我哋一個早期項目 我哋用油漆同花盆 用一個禮拜改造 一個污糟、廢置嘅停車場 
And daily usage just continues to soar. ,項目實行三年內 嗰度嘅零售額提高咗 172% 
"What has happened is the average daily ridership on the streets of New York is 36,000 people. ",係同區嘅兩倍 
"The high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August. ",利用油漆同物料，我哋嘅進展好快 
"Yesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City. ",與其我哋花幾年慢慢規劃 電腦慢慢模擬 我哋倒不如切實咁 用油漆同臨時物料完成佢 
The bikes are being used six times a day. ,因為方法可唔可行嘅證據 唔喺電腦模型入邊 
And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets. ,而係喺現實街道 
"In the past, it looked like the guy on the left, ninja-clad bike messenger. ",咁樣仲可以同油漆玩遊戲添 
"And today, cyclists look like New York City looks. ",我哋係紐約 5 個區總共設立咗 50 個新嘅行人專用區 
"It's diverse -- young, old, black, white, women, kids, all getting on a bike. ",我哋將 26 英畝嘅馬路變成行人路 
"It's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around. ",我認為我哋成功嘅其中一個原因 就係帶動模仿風氣 
Quite radical. ,自從我哋改造時代廣場之後 你周圍都可以見到改善工程 無論喺波士頓、芝加哥 三藩市、墨西哥城 定係布宜諾斯艾利斯 
"We've also brought this approach to our buses, and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America, the slowest bus speeds. ",你講得出嘅都有 呢度係洛杉磯 佢哋連我哋街上面嘅綠點都抄埋 
"As everybody knows, you can walk across town faster than you can take the bus. ",或者我要好好強調 相比傳統建築方法 新方法可以令到交通變得好快 
"And so we focused on the most congested areas of New York City, built out six bus rapid transit lines, 57 miles of new speedy bus lanes. ",我哋仲將呢種快趣嘅方法 應用到我哋嘅單車項目裏邊 我哋六年就已經將單車 變成紐約一種交通工具 
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus. ,呢樣係我可以光明正大咁講 （掌聲） 以前紐約踩單車都幾危險 但係宜家紐約已經變成 全美其中一個單車城市 
"We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane, and it's been a huge success. ",所以我哋之後好快鋪設咗單車徑網絡 
"I think one of my very favorite moments as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched Citi Bike, and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue in my protected bike lane, and I looked over and I saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands, and the traffic was flowing, birds were singing -- (Laughter) -- the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes. ",呢份係 2007 年嘅地圖 
It was just fantastic. ,而 2013 年就係咁樣 我哋已經興建咗 350 英里長嘅單車徑 
And this is how it looked six years ago. ,我好鐘意呢個，因為佢望落去好簡單 
"And so, I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it's possible to change your streets quickly, it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits, and it can be quite popular. ",襟一襟滑鼠，佢哋就出現 
You just need to reimagine your streets. ,我哋仲有新嘅街道設計 
They're hidden in plain sight. ,美國第一條單車泊位 有保安措施嘅單車徑 （掌聲） 
Thank you. ,我哋升起泊位保護單車 效果非常之好 
(Applause) ,單車數目急升 
,對於所有人 包括行人、踩單車嘅人同司機 受傷機會都跌咗一半 
I've spent my life working on sustainability. ,同時我哋起咗 30 英里 有保安措施嘅單車徑 
I set up a climate change NGO called The Climate Group. ,宜家你喺全美國都可以見到 呢啲單車徑起緊 
I worked on forestry issues in WWF. ,呢度，你可以睇到我哋嘅措施有效 代表踩單車人數嘅藍色線不停上升 
I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system. ,綠色線表示單車徑嘅數目 
"About 25 years in total, and then three years ago, I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team. ",黃色線表示受傷人數 受傷人數基本上無點變 
"Like many people here, well, I want to maximize my personal impact in the world, so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there. ",你會發現係咁大型嘅擴建之後 受傷人數無增加到 所以事實話畀我哋聽，安全一直喺度 
"But first, let's just take three numbers. ",只係唔係每個人都鐘意新單車徑 幾年前曾經有過一宗訴訟引起媒體關注 
The first number is three: three billion people. ,一份布魯克林報紙曾經將 我哋喺 Prospect Park West 嘅單車徑 叫做「 加沙地帶以外 最受爭議嘅土地 」 
"This is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030, coming out of poverty. ",（笑聲） 呢啲就係我哋做嘅嘢 
"It's fantastic for them and their families, but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today, and this swells that number to five, a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity. ",所以，如果你繼續讀落去 你會發現民眾係走喺傳媒同政客之前 
"The second number is six: This is six degrees centigrade, what we're heading towards in terms of global warming. ",我覺得大部分政客 見到呢啲調查結果都好開心 
"We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees. ",64% 紐約人支持呢啲單車徑 
"And if you think about it, all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years, much of that is due to just one degree warming, and we need CO2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. ",今個夏天，我哋落實咗城市單車系統 全美最大嘅單車租用系統 我哋有 6000 部單車 同 330 個分佈得好近嘅單車站 
"It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively. ",自從計劃開始 使用人次已經達到 300 萬 
The third number is 12: That's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born. ,使用里程達到 700 萬英里 
You can see my grandmother there. ,足以圍繞地球 280 圈 
That was in the beginning of the last century. ,就係呢條細嘅藍色鎖匙 你可以踩單車去市區 
"So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England, the ninth largest city in the world. ",日常使用率持續上升 
"Now there are 500 cities, nearly, with a million people or more in them. ",每日平均喺紐約街上踩單車嘅人數 已經達到三萬六千人 
"And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050, that's the century when we build all the world's cities, the century that we're in the middle of right now. ",最高試過八月份四萬四千人 
"Every other century was kind of practice, and this lays down a blueprint for how we live. ",琴日已經有四萬人 用紐約城市單車系統 
So think about it. ,每架單車每日平均使用六次 
"We're building cities like never before, bringing people out of poverty like never before, and changing the climate like never before. ",我諗你平時喺街上 都可以睇到租單車踩嘅人 
Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do. ,以前，踩單車嘅人睇落去 就好似左邊嗰個男人咁 著到好似忍者咁嘅單車郵差 
"it's about what we do right here, right now, and for the rest of our working lives. ",但宜家，踩單車嘅人呼應著紐約嘅面貌 
"So I'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like IKEA can do, and we have a sustainability strategy called ""people and planet positive"" to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world. ",佢哋好多元化 無論年輕嘅、老嘅、白嘅、黑嘅 女嘅、細嘅，都踩住單車 
Why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business? ,單車每個人都負擔得起 而且安全、方便我哋周圍去 
Other companies have sustainability strategies. ,個轉變實在係好大 
"I'm going to refer to some of those as well, and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got. ",我哋仲將呢種方法 應用到我哋巴士上面 紐約有全北美最大 亦係最慢嘅巴士團隊 
"But first, let's think of customers. ",所有人都知要穿過城市 你行路仲快過搭巴士 
We know from asking people from China to the U.S. ,所以我哋著手紐約最塞嘅地方 設立咗六條巴士快速轉乘路線 57 英里長嘅巴士專線 
"that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day-to-day issues, the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school? ",上車前你先喺自動售票處畀錢 
Can I pay the bills at the end of the month? ,我哋劃出巴士專線，唔畀其他車用 如果其他車用嗰條線 會有相機影低，會有罰款 個方法好成功 
Then they care about big issues like climate change. ,我諗作為交通專員我最鐘意嘅一刻 係我哋啟動城市單車嗰日 我喺第一大道嘅安全單車徑 踩住城市單車嘅單車 我望下周圍 行人安全企喺行人島上 交通暢通 雀仔唱歌 （笑聲） 巴士喺專線行得好快 
"But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive, and they expect business to help, and they're a little bit disappointed today. ",太好啦 
So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products. ,呢個就係六年前嘅樣 
We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer. ,所以由紐約呢件事我哋知道 短時間內改善街道係有可能嘅 工程唔會貴，仲可以產生即時效應 可以好受歡迎 
We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color. ,你只需要重新想像下你身邊嘅街道 
"And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper. ",改變就喺街道裏邊 
"So every time you pulled on a t-shirt, or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom, or sometimes all three together, you were reminded sustainability was about compromise. ",多謝 
It wasn't a great start. ,（掌聲） 
Today we have choices. ,
"We can make products that are beautiful or ugly, sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive, functional or useless. ",我一世人都係為可持續發展工作 
"So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable, sustainable products. ",我成立咗一個關注 氣候變化嘅非牟利組織 叫氣候組織 
Let's take the LED. ,我曾經係世界自然基金會 做過林業嘅工作 
The LED is the next best thing to daylight. ,我曾經喺聯合國組織 做過發展同農業嘅工作 
"The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs -- I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes, wasting energy every time you switch them on -- change them after this -- or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not -- but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters. ",經過一共 25 年嘅工作 三年前，我同宜家家居嘅總裁講 想加入佢嘅隊伍 
They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years. ,好似在座各位一樣 我想對世界有最大嘅影響 我會解釋點解我加入嗰個隊伍 
They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side. ,但首先，等我哋睇下￼三個數字 
Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side. ,第一個數字係三 代表三十億人 
You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent. ,呢個數字表示到 2030 年 全球將會有三十億人脫離貧窮 加入中產階級 
"And the best thing is, they'll also last for more than 20 years. ",對於佢哋同佢哋家人嚟講，係非常好 但全世界已經有二十億中產人士 所以總數會增加到五十億 喺我哋資源缺乏下，情況更加嚴峻 
So think about that. ,第二個數字係六 六表示温度 指全球變暖嘅温度 
"You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times, probably more if you're in this audience. ",我哋唔係增加一度、三度或者四度 而係增加六度 
"You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times. ",當你認真諗下，我哋係過去幾年 所經歷嘅極端天氣 大部分都只係因為一度 就算我哋想全球 二氧化碳排放量減少 都要等呢個十年結束之前 達到最高峰 先至可以回落 
"Your kids could go to school, go to college, go away and have kids of their own, come back, bring the grandkids, you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy. ",呢個唔係無可避免，但我哋要果斷行動 
So LEDs are fantastic. ,第三個數字係十二 即係我阿嫲出世嗰陣 世界上擁有一百萬 或以上人口嘅城市數量 
"What we decided to do was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs, the halogens and the CFLs. ",你可以見到我阿嫲係￼度 
"We decided, over the next two years, we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. ",講緊係上個世紀頭嘅時候 只有十二個城市 
We will go all in. ,我阿嫲喺曼徹斯特出世 曼徹斯特係嗰時 全世界第九大城市 
"And this is what business needs to do: go all-in, go 100 percent, because then you stop investing in the old stuff, you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs, you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy. ",但全世界而家就有大概五百個 一百萬或以上人口嘅城市 
(Applause) It's not just about products in people's homes. ,當你睇返 1950 年 到 2050 年嘅一百年間 喺呢段時間裏面 我哋起咗全世界所有城市 而我哋正處於呢一百年嘅中間 
We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products. ,每一個世紀都好似有一樣嘢要做 呢個世紀就係我哋定下 下一幅生活藍圖 
"Obviously there's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials, and we can and will go zero waste. ",諗下啦 
And there's opportunities in a circular economy. ,我哋前所未有咁起城市 前所未有咁令人脫離貧窮 同時前所未有咁改變氣候 
"But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials. ",可持續發展已經由「做下都唔錯」 變成「必須要做」 
Let's take cotton. ,關乎到我哋而家 同埋我哋工作裡面要做嘅嘢 
Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now. ,所以我會講下企業可以做乜 同埋好似宜家咁嘅企業可以做乜 我哋有一個可持續發展策略 叫「人類同地球嘅希望」 希望企業可以 為世界帶嚟正面影響 
It's a brilliant textile in use. ,點解我哋企業唔想 為世界帶嚟正面影響呢？ 
It's really dirty in production. ,其他公司亦都有 可持續發展嘅策略 
"It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water. ",我會講其中一啲策略 我只會講當中嘅一啲承諾 
"So we've worked with others, with other businesses and NGOs, on the Better Cotton Initiative, working right back down to the farm, and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs, the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports. ",但首先，等我哋諗下消費者 
"Yields increase, and you halve the input costs. ",我哋訪問中國同美國嘅人 
Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. ,佢哋大部分人面對日常問題之餘 都會關心可持續發展 日常問題指，點樣送我嘅細路返學？ 
"Already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached, and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business. ",我月尾還唔還得曬帳單？ 
"Again, we're going all-in. ",之後佢哋就關心大問題，例如氣候變化 
"By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton. ",但希望解決方法會簡單 可以負擔得到同吸引 佢哋希望企業會幫手 但今時今日，佢哋有啲失望 
"Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually. ",所以我哋返轉頭去諗 第一個環保產品 
"People sometimes think that 100 percent's going to be hard, and we've had the conversation in the business. ",我哋嘅洗衣產品 可以將白衫洗成灰色 
"Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent. ",我哋有早期需要五分鐘 去預熱嘅省電膽 而之後你只會睇到一種奇怪嘅顏色 
"If you have a 90 percent target, everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the 10 percent. ",我哋有粗糙、可回收廁紙 
"When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear, and businesspeople like clarity, because then you just get the job done. ",所以無論你著上一件襯衫 或者開燈，或者去廁所 或者三樣一齊做 你都會記得可持續發展 指生活上嘅讓步 
"So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice. ",但咁樣似乎唔係 可持續發展嘅好開始 
"You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale, or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry that we can be proud of. ",今日我哋有各種選擇 
"It's a simple choice, so we've worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council, with literally hundreds of other organizations, and there's a point here about collaboration. ",我哋可以將產品做得 好靚或者好醜 環保或者唔環保 實惠或者昂貴 實用或者無用 
"So hundreds of others, of NGOs, of forest workers' unions, and of businesses, have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council, which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground. ",所以我哋一齊製造 又靚，又實用 又實惠，又環保嘅產品 
"Now together, through our supply chain, with partners, we've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry. ",睇下 LED 燈 
That's about the size of Germany. ,LED 係僅次於日光嘅最好發光物體 
"And we've decided in the next three years, we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business. ",而舊式燈泡，鎢絲燈膽… 我唔係叫你哋舉手 話俾我知你屋企係唔係仲用緊 每次用都浪費能源，今日之後要換啦咁 或者 TED 個台有冇舊式燈泡… 但我會話舊式鎢絲燈膽 應該當暖爐嚟賣 
So be decisive on these issues. ,佢哋賣錯咗成過百年 
Use your supply chain to drive good. ,佢哋發出好少光，但產生大量熱力 
But then it comes to your operations. ,而家我哋嘅燈可以發出好多光 但同時只有非常小嘅熱力 
"Some things are certain, I think. ",LED 燈比傳統鎢絲燈膽慳電 85％ 
We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time. ,最正嘅係，LED 燈可以用超過廿年 
"We know the sun will be shining somewhere, and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time. ",所以諗一諗 
So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind? ,你會換七至八次手機 呢度嘅觀眾或者換得更加多 
And why not take control of it ourselves? ,如果你有渣車，你一世會換三至四次車 
So we're going 100 percent renewable. ,但 LED 唔同 你嘅細路會長大，有自己嘅下一代 然後帶埋佢哋小朋友見你 但你仲用緊同一個 LED 燈泡 LED 幫你慳咗好多電 
"By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. ",所以 LED 燈好正 
"For all of our stores, our own factories, our distribution centers, we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far, and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate in six countries, and we're not done yet. ",我哋決定去做嘅嘢 唔係將 LED 吊高嚟賣 繼續賣舊式燈膽、鹵鎢燈同慳電膽 
But think of a solar panel. ,我哋決定，跟住嚟緊呢兩年 我哋會唔會再賣鹵鎢燈同慳電膽 
The electricity is free. ,我哋會盡全力賣 LED 
"Every time the sun comes out after that, the electricity is free. ",而呢樣係企業需要做：盡全力 盡百分百嘅力 因為你唔可以再投資落舊嘢度 你只有投資新產品，減低成本 利用供應鏈，善用創意 令你嘅產品價格下降 令到所有人都買得起最好嘅燈膽 跟住佢哋就會慳到能源 
"So this is a good thing for the CFO, not just the sustainability guy. ",（掌聲） 唔單止係大家屋企都有嘅產品 
Every business can do things like this. ,我哋同時要諗下產品嘅原材料 
"But then we've got to look beyond our operations, and I think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain. ",好明顯，回收物料創造好多機會 我哋可以做到零浪費 
"Many businesses now, fortunately, have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains, but not every business. Far from it. ",我哋嘅循環經濟先至會有機遇 
And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s. ,但我哋依然依賴自然原料 
"We found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain, and people in the business were shocked. ",睇下棉花 
"And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act. ",棉花真係好有用 可能在座各位 好多都著棉花嘅衣物 
"So a code of conduct was developed, and now we have 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor. ",佢係非常好嘅紡織物 
But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor. ,但生產過程就好污糟 
You've got to say that's not enough today. ,佢用到好多殺蟲劑、化肥、水 
I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable. ,所以我哋同其他人 其他企業，同埋非牟利組織合作 實行「更優質棉花倡議」嘅計劃 直接追溯到農場 喺嗰度將用水減半 化肥減半 然後產量增加咗 對於收入低嘅棉農嚟講 六成嘅農場經營成本嚟自化肥 
So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights? ,收入增加，成本又減半 
We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. ,可以走出貧窮，棉農都好鍾意 
"Increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these, but actually in a survey, many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children. ",而家我哋已經接觸咗幾十萬嘅農民 而家我哋六成嘅棉花都係優質 
"So what we decided to do was, we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us, what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children? ",同樣，我哋盡曬全力 
We also have a foundation that's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of 100 million children by 2015. ,去到 2015 我哋會百分百採用優質棉花 
"You know the phrase, you can manage what you measure? ",我哋講下 100% 呢個目標 
"Well, you should measure what you care about. ",大家有時會諗 100% 好難做到 公司裡面都有咁樣嘅講過 
"If you're not measuring things, you don't care and you don't know. ",實際上，我哋發覺 100% 比 90% 或者 50% 更加容易做到 
"So let's take an example, measure the things that are important in your business. ",如果你嘅目標要做到 90% 企業入邊嘅人都會 用盡方法唔做嗰 90% 
Isn't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women? ,當目標係 100%，一切清楚 商人都鍾意直接了當 因為只有咁，你至會做到個目標 
"(Applause) So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA that 47 percent are women today, but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management. ",跟住，木材 我哋知道林業可以有另一個出路 
And we do not want to wait another hundred years. ,但而家仍然有非法砍木嘅問題 森林砍伐依然好多 或者你可以選用有企業責任 而我哋都認同嘅林業公司 
"So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA, and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change. ",所以好簡單，我哋同森林管理委員會 以及其他過百個組織一齊合作好多年 合作有一個重點 
"So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years. ",過百個組織，包括非盈利組織 森林工作者聯盟同埋企業 一齊成立咗森林管理委員會 制定林業準則 確保林業健康發展 
So we've gone from sustainability being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do. ,"通過我哋供應鏈 同埋同合作夥伴一齊 我哋而家認可咗 3,500 萬公頃嘅森林 "
"It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do. ",幾乎係德國咁大 
And everybody can do something on this as an individual. ,而我哋決定嚟緊三年 我哋公司會用認可原材料多一倍 
Be a discerning consumer. ,所以喺環保問題上要果斷 
Vote with your wallets. ,用自身嘅供應鏈去推動環保 
Search out the companies that are acting on this. ,跟住落嚟就係實行 
"But also, there are other businesses already acting. ",我覺得有啲嘢係好明確 
I mentioned renewable energy. ,當我哋知道我哋 嚟緊二、三十年仲會用電 
"You go to Google or Lego, they're going 100 percent renewable too, in the same way that we are. ",我哋知道太陽會照住某個地方 風仍然會喺度 
"On having really good sustainability strategies, there are companies like Nike, Patagonia, Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer. ",咁點解唔利用太陽同風去發電呢？ 
But I don't think any of those businesses would say they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't. ,點解我哋唔控制佢哋呢？ 
"We'll make mistakes going forward, but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent, having a dialogue with the right partners, and choosing to lead on the issues that really count. ",所以我哋會用 100% 可再生能源 
"So if you're a business leader, if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model, I'd urge you to do so. ",到 2020 年 我哋會產生嘅可再生能源 比我哋公司需要嘅更多 
"And together, we can help create a sustainable world, and, if we get it right, we can make sustainability affordable for the many people, not a luxury for the few. ",喺我哋所有鋪頭、工廠、物流中心 我哋已經裝咗三十萬塊太陽能板 喺 6 個國家有 14 個自己嘅風電場 呢啲都未止 
Thank you. ,諗下一塊太陽能板 可以喺七至八年內回到本 
(Applause) ,電仲係要免費 
,每次太陽出嚟，電都係免費 
Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. ,呢樣唔單止 對於提出可持續發展嘅人 對於財務總監嚟講，都係好事 
"It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you, the player, the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less. ",每間公司都可以咁樣做 
"This is true, so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute, you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise, pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder, contentment, and creativity, all in the span of one minute. ",唔止營運，將眼光放遠 我覺得每個人都會贊成 今時今日嘅企業 需要對供應鏈負全責 
"So this sounds pretty good, right? Now you're willing to play. ",好彩好多企業而家都有行為守則 同埋對供應鏈嘅審計 但唔係每間企業都做到 
"In order to teach you this game, I'm going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly, and we're going to do a little hands-on demo. ",而且數目遠遠唔夠 呢個問題其實喺 90 年代 曾經喺宜家發生過 
"While they're coming up, I should let you know, this game was invented 10 years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom. ",我哋發現供應鏈裡面 有使用童工嘅風險 而公司裡面嘅人都好震驚 
"So thank you, Monochrom. ",好明顯呢種情況係接受唔到 
"Okay, so most people are familiar with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling. ",所以就要行動 於是制訂行動守則 而呢家我哋全世界有 80 個審計員 每日確保我哋所有工廠 都有好嘅工作環境 同埋保障到人權 確保無童工 
"Sunni, let's just remind them. ",但唔係話確保無童工咁簡單 
"One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle, and of course Sunni beats me because she's the best. ",你要知道今時今日咁樣仲未夠 
"Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling, we're the gamer generation. ",我覺得我哋都會同意 兒童係世界上最重要 又係最易受到傷害嘅一班人 
"There are a billion gamers on the planet now, so we need more of a challenge. ",所以今日企業 點樣可以利用自己嘅價值鏈 支持更好嘅生活質素 同保護兒童權益呢？ 
So the first thing we need is more thumbs. ,我哋同聯合國兒童基金會 同救助兒童會合作 針對兒童權益制定新嘅商業守則 
"So Eric, come on over. ",愈嚟愈多企業簽署呢個守則 但一個調查發現，好多企業老闆 覺得佢哋企業同兒童毫無關係 
"So we could get three thumbs together, and Peter could join us. ",所以我哋決定 同知得比我哋多嘅合作夥伴一齊 問自己最難嘅問題︰ 我哋點樣先可以喺企業以外 幫到兒童提升佢哋嘅生活質素？ 
"We could even have four thumbs together, and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb. ",我哋有一個基金 承諾同合作夥伴一齊 喺 2015 年之前幫一億兒童 改善生活同維護權益 
"This is really important. You can't, like, wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute. ",你哋有冇聽過 「你能夠管理你檢討嘅嘢」？ 
That is not how you win. ,其實你應該檢討你關心嘅嘢 
"Ah, who did that? Eric you did that. ",如果你唔檢討 表示你唔關心，亦唔會了解 
So Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb. ,舉個例，檢討對企業重要嘅野 
"Okay, so that's the first rule, and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node, but if you feel ambitious, you don't have to hold back. ",係咪時候男同女都可平等 一齊領導企業呢？ 
We can really go for it. ,（掌聲） 宜家一萬七千個經理裡面 47% 係女性 但仲未夠，而我哋希望縮小差距 兼且一路實行到管理層 
So you can see up here. ,我哋唔想再等多一百年 
"Now the only other rule you need to remember is, gamer generation, we like a challenge. ",所以宜家今個星期 搞咗個女性公開交流嘅活動 我哋為咗改變，會做任何嘅嘢 
I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using. ,所以訊息係︰ 諗下你關心嘅嘢，然後改變嗰樣嘢 唔好再等一百年啦 
So I think we should kind of get some more involved. ,我哋嘅可持續發展 由以前「做下都幾唔錯」 到家下「必須做」 
"And if we had just four people, we would do it just like this, and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time. ",做係好嘅，同埋必須要做到 
Perfect. ,每個人都可以以個人身份出一分力 
"Now, if we had more people in the room, instead of just wrestling in a closed node, we might reach out and try and grab some other people. ",做一個有辨別能力嘅消費者 
"And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now. ",用你嘅銀包去表態 
"We're going to try and get all, something like, I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node. ",幫襯嗰啲有實際行動嘅公司 
"And we have to connect both levels, so if you're up there, you're going to be reaching down and reaching up. ",但同時，已經有好多企業坐言起行 
"Now — (Laughter) — before we get started -- This is great. You're excited to play. — before we get started, can I have the slides back up here really quick, because if you get good at this game, I want you to know there are some advanced levels. ",我提過可再生能源 
"So this is the kind of simple level, right? ",你去 Google 或者 Lego 公司 佢哋已經做緊百分百可再生能源 就好似我哋咁 
But there are advanced configurations. ,至於有好好可持續發展策略嘅公司 好似 Nike、Patagonia Timberland、瑪莎等企業 
This is called the Death Star Configuration. ,但我唔覺得上邊提及嘅 任何一間公司 會話自己係完美，我哋亦唔會 
Any Star Wars fans? ,我哋喺前進過程裏面都會犯錯 但更重要係有 清晰嘅方向、透明度 同適當嘅夥伴有溝通 同埋幫手解決真正重要嘅問題 
And this one's called the Möbius Strip. ,所以如果你係公司主席 如果你未準備好將可持續發展 擺喺你商業模式裡面 我求你去做 
"Any science geeks, you get that one. ",我哋一齊會創造 一個可持續發展嘅世界 如果我哋做得啱￼ 我哋可以將可持續發展 變成係好多人 都可以承受嘅一樣嘢 而唔係少數人嘅專利 
This is the hardest level. This is the extreme. ,多謝 
"So we'll stick with the normal one for now, and I'm going to give you 30 seconds, every thumb into the node, connect the upper and the lower levels, you guys go on down there. ",（掌聲） 
Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node. ,
Stand up! It's easier if you stand up. ,今日我要教你哋 點去玩我最鍾意嘅遊戲︰ 大型多人手指公摔角 
"Everybody, up up up up up! ",呢個係世界上我知道嘅唯一一個 可以令到你哋，即係玩家 喺 60 秒以內體驗到十種正面情緒 
"Stand up, my friends. ",呢個係真嘅 所以如果你今日 同我一齊玩呢個遊戲 用僅僅一分鐘時間 你就會體會到快樂、放鬆、愛、驚喜 自豪、好奇、刺激、美妙同驚奇 滿足同創意 就係短短嘅一分鐘之內 
All right. ,聽落唔錯，係咪？ 你哋都想玩嘅 
Don't start wrestling yet. ,為咗教你哋點玩 我需要幾個人 自願快啲上台做一個小小嘅實際演示 
"If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected. ",當佢哋上嚟嘅同時，我想話畀你哋知 呢個遊戲係十年前 由奧地利一個叫 Monochrom 嘅藝術家團體發明 
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check. ,所以多謝你 Monochrom 
"If you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure. ",好啦，咁好多人其實都熟悉 傳統嘅二人手指公摔角 
Grab that thumb! ,Sunni，等我哋幫大家溫習一下 
Reach behind you. There you go. ,一，二，三，四 我發起拇指戰爭，跟住我哋開始摔角 咁當然 Sunni 擊敗我啦，因為佢最勁 
Any other thumbs? ,玩大型多人拇指摔角 要注意嘅第一件事係 我哋係遊戲世代 
"Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go. ",現時全球有十億個玩家 所以我哋唔止需要挑戰 
"Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it. ",咁我哋需要嘅第一樣野嘢 就係更多手指公 
"Okay? One, two, three, go! ",所以，Eric，過來 
(Laughter) Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent! ,我哋可以將三隻手指公擺埋一齊 Peter 都可以加入來 
(Applause) Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much. ,我哋甚至可以四個手指公一齊 而贏嘅方法 就係你係第一個壓住是旦一個嘅手指 
All right. ,呢個非常重要 你唔可以等到其他人都打晒，先至襲擊 
"While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game, let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions. ",你唔可以咁贏 
So curiosity. ,啊，邊個壓住手指？Eric 係你 
"I said ""massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."" ",所以 Eric 頭先就贏咗 佢係第一個壓住我手指公嘅人 
"You were like, ""What the hell is she talking about?"" ",好啦，呢個係第一條規則 咁我哋可以睇到 3 或者 4 係通常一局嘅人數 但如果你雄心壯志 
So I provoked a little curiosity. ,你唔使壓抑住自己 我哋真係可以嘗試下 
Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node. ,你睇呢度 
I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up. ,唯一另一條你需要記得嘅規則係 遊戲世代啊嘛，我哋鍾意挑戰 
So you used creativity. That was great. ,咁啱我注意到大家未有用到兩隻手指公 
How about surprise? The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising. ,我覺得我哋可以加埋佢哋入嚟 
You heard that sound go up in the room. ,所以如果我哋得四個人 我哋可以咁樣玩 而我哋就可以試下 同時用兩隻手指公摔角 
"We had excitement. As you started to wrestle, maybe you're starting to win or this person's, like, really into it, so you kind of get the excitement going. ",非常好 
We have relief. You got to stand up. ,呢家呢，如果我哋係房裡面有更加多人 與其形成一個剩係得四個人玩 我哋可以捉埋其他人隻手 
"You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief, getting to shake it out. ",呢個就係我哋宜家要做嘅嘢 
"We had joy. You were laughing, smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy. ","我哋要試下將所有房裏面嘅指隻公 我唔知有幾多，大概有 1,500 隻 全部連埋一齊 "
We had some contentment. ,而且我哋要連接兩層 如果你喺側邊，你要 向下伸手或者向上伸手 
"I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing, so you were totally content to be playing. ",好啦（笑聲） 係我哋開始之前… 宜家氣氛唔錯，你哋都好興奮 我哋開始之前，我要頭先張投影片 因為當你玩呢個遊戲、玩得唔錯嘅時候 我想話畀你哋知，仲有一個高級玩法 
"The most important three emotions, awe and wonder, we had everybody connected physically for a minute. ",呢個其實係入門等級 
When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room? ,但其實仲有高級玩法 
And it's truly awesome and wondrous. ,呢個係死星結構玩法 
"And speaking of physical connection, you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin, you release oxytocin, you feel bonded to everyone in the room. ",有冇星球大戰嘅影迷？ 
You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds. ,呢個叫「梅比斯環」 
"You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds, so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other. That is great. ",有冇研究科學嘅人？你哋一定明 
And the last emotion of pride. ,呢個喺最難嘅一關，叫「極端」 
How many people are like me. Just admit it. ,不過我哋做簡單嘅先 我會畀 30 秒你哋 將所有手指公都連埋一齊 連起上下兩層 你哋行去嗰邊 
You lost both your thumbs. ,30 秒連成一個網 
It just didn't work out for you. ,企起身！企起身會容易啲 
"That's okay, because you learned a new skill today. ",所有人起身！起身！起身！ 
"You learned, from scratch, a game you never knew before. ",企起身，各位 
Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people. ,好 
So congratulations. ,唔好開始住 
How many of you won just won thumb? ,如果你有多出嚟嘅手指公 咁就向周圍揈下 確保所有手指公都連埋 
All right. I have very good news for you. ,我哋最後再檢查一次 
"According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling, this makes you a grandmaster of the game. ",如果你有多出嘅手指公就周圍郁下 
"Because there aren't that many people who know how to play, we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess. ",捉住手指公！ 
"So congratulations, grandmasters. ",去你後面，非常好 
"Win one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster. ",仲有冇其他手指公？ 
Did anybody win both their thumbs? ,好，我數三下，你哋就開始 
Yes. Awesome. Okay. ,記得你手指公嘅位置。捉，捉，捉住！ 
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status. ,得未？一，二，三，開始！ 
"You guys, according to the rules, are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations. ",（笑聲） 你贏咗？你捉到？你捉到？非常好！ 
"I will just leave you with this tip, if you want to play again. ",（掌聲） 好好啊。多謝晒。多謝你哋 
"The best way to become a legendary grandmaster, you've got your two nodes going on. ",好啦 
Pick off the one that looks easiest. ,當你好開心咁享受緊你 第一次大型多人手指公摔角 我哋好咁諗返下剛才嘅感受 
They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak. ,第一個係好奇心 
Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm. ,當我話「大型多人手指公摔角」 
"As soon as you win, suddenly stop. ",你哋就諗，佢究竟講緊咩呀 
Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill. ,所以我引起咗小小好奇心 
That's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. ,創意：你哋需要創意去 將所有手指公連埋一齊 
Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game. ,我要周圍揾或者向上揾 
Wooo! (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ,所以你哋用咗創意。非常好 
,仲有驚喜呢？ 當你嘗試兩邊手指公同時摔角 嗰一刻嘅感覺其實喺好意外 
"Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical, and I returned to the medical university where I studied. ",你哋可以聽到 房入面嘅聲音都提高咗 
"I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years, in fact since I became a management consultant. ",我哋有刺激。當你開始摔角時 可能一邊你就嚟贏，但對手都好似就嚟贏 所以你可以一直感受到刺激 
"The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting, and the second thing, which really bothered me, actually, was that several of the colleagues I met, former friends from medical school, who I knew to be some of the smartest, most motivated, engaged and passionate people I'd ever met, many of them had turned cynical, disengaged, or had distanced themselves from hospital management. ",因為坐得耐，企起身可以令你放鬆 
"So with this focus on cost-cutting, I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient? ",手腳都揈下揈下 
Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare. ,我哋有快樂，你哋一直喺度笑 睇你哋嘅表情，呢度充滿住快樂 
It's a big part of the national budgets. ,我哋有投入 
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth. ,我冇見到有人喺摔角時候 發短信或者睇郵件 所以你哋完全投入呢個遊戲 
"In some countries, we have long waiting times for patients for surgery. ",最重要嘅三個情感︰美妙同驚奇 我哋呢度所有人連埋一齊一分鐘 
"In other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed, and therefore don't reach patients. ",你哋上一次喺 TED 裏面 同所有人連埋一齊係幾時？ 
"In several countries, doctors and nurses are the targets, to some extent, for the governments. ",呢個其實係非常美妙同美好 
"After all, the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses. ",講到連繫其他人 你哋都知我鍾意後葉荷爾蒙 葉荷爾蒙令你覺得你 同呢度每個人都喺埋一齊 
"You choose an expensive lab test, you choose to operate on an old and frail patient. ",最快令人產生後葉荷爾蒙嘅辦法 就係捉住另一個人嘅手 6 秒以上 
"So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians, this is a way to hold costs down. ",你哋大家都捉住大家嘅手 遠遠超過 6 秒 所以我哋都喺生理上準備好 去接受每一個人。呢個非常好 
"And ultimately, some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients. ",最後係自豪 
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated. ,幾多人好似我咁。唔好怕羞 
"At BCG, we looked at this, and we asked ourselves, this can't be the right way of managing healthcare. ",邊個兩隻手指公都輸咗？ 
"And so we took a step back and we said, ""What is it that we are trying to achieve?"" ",呢個遊戲就係唔啱你 
"Ultimately, in the healthcare system, we're aiming at improving health for the patients, and we need to do so at a limited, or affordable, cost. ",但無所謂。因為你今日學咗新技能 
We call this value-based healthcare. ,你從乜都唔知，唔知遊戲點玩 
"On the screen behind me, you see what we mean by value: outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. ",到你宜家知道點玩 你仲可以教埋人哋玩 
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg. ,所以恭喜你 
"On this picture, you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters. ",幾多人贏咗一隻手指公？ 
"When we started doing our research at BCG, we decided not to look so much at the costs, but to look at the quality instead, and in the research, one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw. ",好。我有好消息要話畀你知 
"You compare hospitals in a country, you'll find some that are extremely good, but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse. ",根據大型多人手指公摔角官方指引 贏咗意味你已經係大師級 
The differences were dramatic. ,因為仲有好多人 都未知點玩呢個遊戲 我哋要加快呢個遊戲嘅推廣 要比象棋仲傳得更廣 
"Erik, my father-in-law, he suffers from prostate cancer, and he probably needs surgery. ",所以恭喜晒，大師嘅你哋 
"Now living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system. ",只要贏咗一隻手指公，你就係大師啦 
"If he goes there and goes to the average hospital, he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent, so he would have to start wearing diapers again. ",有無人兩隻都贏？ 
You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot. ,哇。好！ 
"If he instead would go to Hamburg, and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik, the risk would be only one in 20. ",準備更新你 Twitter 或者 Facebook 狀態 
"Either you a flip a coin, or you have a one in 20 risk. ",根據指引 你哋喺傳奇級大師，所以恭喜你哋！ 
"That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference. ",如果你哋以後仲想玩 我畀個提示你 
"When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases, we see these huge differences. ",成為傳奇級大師嘅最好辦法 就係你兩邊都同時進行比賽 
But you and I don't know. We don't have the data. ,先玩簡單嘅一邊 
"And often, the data actually doesn't exist. ",佢哋唔認真玩，或者佢哋睇起嚟渣 
Nobody knows. ,專注嗰隻 跟住用另一邊手臂 做超誇張嘅動作 
So going the hospital is a lottery. ,當你贏，就即刻停低 
"Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope. ",每一個人都反應唔切，你就趁機贏佢哋 
"In the late '70s, there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting, and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery. ",呢個就係你點樣成為 遊戲嘅傳奇級大師 
"To the left of this slide, you see a variety of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. ",多謝你哋畀我教你哋 我最鍾意嘅遊戲 
They all realized they had their individual way of operating. ,（歡呼聲、掌聲） 多謝 （掌聲） 
"They all argued that, ""My technique is the best,"" but none of them actually knew, and they admitted that. ",
"So they said, ""We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best."" ",五年前，我放咗一年假 之後我返去我以前讀過嘅醫學院 
"So they in fact spent two years debating, ""So what is quality in hip surgery?"" ",十七年嚟，自從我做咗顧問之後 我第一次見到病人同著住白袍 嗰個月裡面，有兩樣令到我好驚訝 
"Oh, we should measure this. ""No, we should measure that."" ",第一樣，嚟嚟去去都只係講同一樣嘢 唔係醫院預算，就係開源節流 第二樣，真係令我非常煩 就喺之前識得嘅幾個同事 以前讀醫學院嘅同學 佢哋都好醒目 好有鬥志、有承擔、滿腔熱血 但係，佢哋好多都睇穿人性嘅羞惡 已經無曬擔戴 又或者已經對醫院管理置之不理 
And they finally agreed. ,所以呢，當醫院講緊節流 我就問自己 我哋係唔係忘記咗病人呢？ 
"And once they had agreed, they started measuring, and started sharing the data. ",在座各位你哋嘅國家，同我嘅國家 都要處理醫療嘅開支問題 
"Very quickly, they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in, it actually lasted a lot longer, and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime. ",呢樣係佔咗國家預算嘅一大筆 
"They published the data, and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. ",好多唔同嘅改革 都想限制醫療嘅開支增長 
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense. ,有啲國家，病人做手術要排好耐 
"Since then, they publish every year. ",有啲國家，新藥唔可以報銷 所以新藥病人用唔到 
"Once a year, they publish the league table: who's best, who's at the bottom? ",有啲國家，醫生同護士某程度上 係政府落手嘅對象 
"And they visit each other to try to learn, so a continuous cycle of improvement. ",畢竟，醫療開支係由醫生同護士做決定 
"For many years, Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world, at least for those who actually were measuring, and many were not. ",你揀好貴嘅實驗測試 你選擇幫又老又殘嘅病人做手術 
Now I found this principle really exciting. ,就係咁，政府想限制醫生 從而削減開支 
"So the physicians get together, they agree on what quality is, they start measuring, they share the data, they find who's best, and they learn from it. ",到最後，有啲醫生就話 佢哋就算覺得有啲決定對病人有益 佢哋都落實唔到 
"Now, that's not the only exciting part. ",所以，都好難怪我有啲舊同事咁沮喪 
That's exciting in itself. ,喺 BCG，我哋討論到呢個問題 我哋問自己 咁樣做醫療管理係行唔通？ 
"But if you bring back the cost side of the equation, and look at that, it turns out, those who have focused on quality, they actually also have the lowest costs, although that's not been the purpose in the first place. ",所以我哋退後一步諗︰ 我哋想達到咩目標？ 
"So if you look at the hip surgery story again, there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden. ",我哋希望喺醫療系統裡面 用有限或負擔得起嘅預算 最終可以改善病人健康 
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery. ,我哋叫呢個做 以成本效益為本嘅醫療 
"In the United States, the number was three times higher than in Sweden. ",我身後嘅屏幕，大家可以見到何謂價值 既可以幫到病人 我哋開支又可以控制喺合埋水平 
"So many unnecessary surgeries, and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period. ",2006 年一本書描述得好好 書嘅作者係 Michael Porter 同 Elizabeth Teisberg 
"Now, you can imagine how much savings there would be for society. ",呢張相，你見我岳父同佢身邊三個女 
We did a study where we looked at OECD data. ,當時我哋喺 BCG 開始做研究 我哋決定唔好太介意使費幾多 反而要注重研究質量 研究裏面，有一樣嘢令我哋讚嘆嘅 係我哋見到分別 
"OECD does, every so often, look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries. ",你比較一個國家嘅醫院 你會發現有啲醫院做得好好 但其他好多醫院就水皮 
"The United States has, for many diseases, actually a quality which is below the average in OECD. ",分別非常之大 
"Now, if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality, and raise quality just to the level of average OECD, it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year. ",Erik 我嘅岳父 佢有前列腺癌 佢需要做手術 
"That's 20 percent of the budget, of the healthcare budget of the country. ",佢宜家住喺歐洲，佢可以選擇去德國 德國有出名嘅醫療系統 
"Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic, and it's all logical, but is it possible? ",如果佢選擇去嗰度 住一間中等水平嘅醫院 佢手術後大小失禁嘅機會係 50% 如果真係咁嘅話，佢就又要再著過尿片 
"This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare, and I would argue that not only can it be done, but it has to be done. ",你掟個銀仔，50% 風險都幾多 
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system. ,但係，如果佢決定去漢堡 一間叫 Martini-Klinik 嘅診所 風險就會降到 5% 
"In my practice as a consultant, I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year. ",一係你就 50% 風險 一係就 5% 風險 
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients. ,差別好大，兩者相差十倍 
"Physicians are, like most of you in the audience, very competitive. ",只有當我哋去睇好多醫院 睇唔同嘅病 我哋至知道有咁大嘅分別 
They were always best in class. ,但事前你同我都唔知道。我哋冇數據 
We were always best in class. ,好多時，數據根本唔存在 
"And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do, they will do whatever it takes to improve. ",從來冇人知兩間醫院有分別 
But most of them don't know. ,所以去醫院就好似買六合彩咁 
But physicians have another characteristic. ,宜家，已經唔使再估估下 我哋有希望 
They actually thrive from peer recognition. ,七十年代尾，有一班瑞典整形外科醫生 佢哋每年都開會 討論佢哋臀部手術過程中 用嘅唔同方法步驟 
"If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results, they will share. ",投影片左邊，你可以見到 唔同嘅金屬件、人造臀部 應用喺病人身上 
They will share the information on how to improve. ,佢哋都知道，佢哋各自有一套手術方法 
"So it is, by measuring and creating transparency, you get a cycle of continuous improvement, which is what this slide shows. ",個個都話佢嘅技術係最優秀 但冇一個知道佢哋自己嗰個係最好 
"Now, you may say this is a nice idea, but this isn't only an idea. ",所以佢哋就話︰「我哋要評估質素， 咁樣先知邊個最好，學最好嗰個。」 
This is happening in reality. ,跟住，佢哋用咗兩年時間拗，譬如 臀部手術嘅質量點樣定義？ 
"We're creating a global community, and a large global community, where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve. ",「我哋評估呢個。」 「唔係，我哋評估嗰個。」 
"Together with two academic institutions, Michael Porter at Harvard Business School, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, BCG has formed something we call ICHOM. ",最後佢哋至達成共識 
"You may think that's a sneeze, but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym. ",有咗共識之後 佢哋就開始評估，開始交換數據 
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. ,好快，佢哋就發現 如果先將膠接劑放入病人舊骨度 再將金屬桿放入去 咁樣會更加持久耐用 而且大部分病人有生之年 都唔需要再做手術 
"We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss, disease by disease, what is really quality, what should we measure, and to make those standards global. ",呢班人登咗呢啲數據 將佢哋國家嘅臨床診治模式 嚟個大革新 
"They've worked -- four working groups have worked during the past year: cataracts, back pain, coronary artery disease, which is, for instance, heart attack, and prostate cancer. ",人人都覺得咁樣做更加合理 
The four groups will publish their data in November of this year. ,嗰次之後，佢哋就年年刊登一次 
"That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples, not only within a country, but between countries. ",佢哋每年都會刊登一個表： 話畀人知邊個係最好同最差嘅醫生 
"Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases, the year after, 16. ",而且佢哋會逐個拜訪、學習 所以至會不斷有改善 
"In three years' time, we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden. ",多年嚟，就算只有 少數瑞典臀部手術嘅醫生有評估結果 但佢哋做出嚟嘅手術結果 係全世界最好嘅 
Compare apples to apples. Who's better? ,我發現呢個措施真係好好 
Why is that? ,醫生可以走埋一齊，傾好質素嘅定義 佢哋量度同交換數據 跟最好嘅學習，不斷咁改善 
"Five months ago, I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe. ",呢個唔止令人開心 
"They have a new CEO, and she has a vision: I want to manage my big institution much more on quality, outcomes that matter to patients. ",佢本身就係一樣好嘢 
"This particular day, we sat in a workshop together with physicians, nurses and other staff, discussing leukemia in children. ",你諗返起計算開支嘅方程式 就會發現之前嗰啲關注質素嘅人 雖然冇將開支擺喺首位 但佢哋嘅使費都係最低 
"The group discussed, how do we measure quality today? ",所以，你睇返幾年前 一個臀部手術嘅研究 比較美國同瑞典 
Can we measure it better than we do? ,研究人員統計 幾多個病人需要喺第一次手術之後 七年內要再做手術 
"We discussed, how do we treat these kids, what are important improvements? ",美國嘅數字比瑞典高出三倍 
"And we discussed what are the costs for these patients, can we do treatment more efficiently? ",咁樣講 好多病人做咗好多不必要嘅手術 經歷過好多不必要嘅痛苦 
There was an enormous energy in the room. ,你又可以想像社會可以慳返幾多錢 
"There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm. ",我哋做過一個研究 觀察經濟合作與發展組織 OECD 嘅數據 
"At the end of the meeting, the chairman of the department, he stood up. ",OECD 定期調查成員國嘅生活質素 佢哋集合成員國嘅數據 
"He looked over the group and he said -- first he raised his hand, I forgot that -- he raised his hand, clenched his fist, and then he said to the group, ""Thank you. ",美國好多病嘅治療水平都係 低於 OECD 嘅平均 
"Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way."" ",咁樣講 如果美國醫療系統 專注多啲喺質素上面 將水平提高到 OECD 嘅平均水平 就可以幫到美國人 每年慳返五千億美元 
"By measuring value in healthcare, that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients, we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution. ",亦即係慳返國家醫療預算嘅兩成 
"I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution, and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates, who always put the patient at the center, he would smile in his grave. ",你可能話 呢啲數據好好，非常合邏輯 但係，有冇可能做到？ 
Thank you. ,呢個會係醫療嘅改革示例 我堅信，不單止可以做到 而且必須要做 
,而改革者係醫療系統嘅醫生同護士 
"So yesterday, I was out in the street in front of this building, and I was walking down the sidewalk, and I had company, several of us, and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks. ",我做諮詢咁耐 年年都會見過百個 甚至更多嘅醫生、護士 同其他醫護員工 
We're not talking each other. We're facing forward. ,佢哋有一個共同點： 佢哋真係好緊張 為病人服務嘅質素 
When the person in front of me slows down. ,醫生，正如在座咁多位一樣 非常拼搏 
"And so I'm watching him, and he slows down, and finally he stops. ",佢哋一直都係班內最優秀 
"Well, that wasn't fast enough for me, so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him, and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing, and he was doing this. ",我哋一直都係班內最優秀 
"He was texting, and he couldn't text and walk at the same time. ",如果有人可以話畀佢哋知 佢哋醫人嘅結果比其他人差 佢哋會用盡一切方法改善 
Now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective. ,但係，佢哋大部分 都唔知道比其他人差 
We're going to do working memory today. ,但係醫生有另一個特點： 
"Now, working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. ",佢哋渴望得到行內認同 
You're going it right now. ,如果一個心臓科醫生 打電話畀對手醫院嘅一個心臓科醫生 問佢點解佢間醫院有更好結果時 嗰個醫生會分享俾佢聽 
It's not something we can turn off. ,佢哋會分享改善方法 
"If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay? ",所以，因為有透明度，你可以不斷改善 正如投影片所講一樣 
"So right now, you're doing just fine. ",咁你可能會話，諗法唔錯 但係呢個唔止係諗法 
Now working memory has four basic components. ,呢樣嘢真係發生咗 
It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. ,我哋嘗試令到全世界 都可以評估同比較醫療結果 
"It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of that in as we need it, mixes it, processes it in light of whatever our current goal is. ",BCG 聯同兩間學術機構 哈佛商學院嘅 Michael Porter 同瑞士嘅卡羅林斯卡醫學院 已經成立咗一個叫 ICHOM 嘅機構 
"Now the current goal isn't something like, I want to be president or the best surfer in the world. ",你可能以為我打乞嗤 呢個唔係乞嗤，而係一個縮寫 
"It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie, or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room. ",全名係︰健康成果測量國際聯盟 
"Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that, our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal. ",我哋令頂尖醫生同病人 一齊討論每一種疾病 咩為之質素 我哋應該量度啲乜嘢 務求令標準國際化 
"Now working memory capacity has a fairly long history, and it's associated with a lot of positive effects. ",佢哋都做緊 舊年有四個工作小組做梗 白內障、背痛 冠心病，例如心臓病 同前列腺癌 
People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. ,四個小組會喺今年十一月 刊登佢哋嘅數據 
"They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests, however important that is. ",呢次會係第一次 我哋真正比較到同類嘅嘢 唔止係比較國內 而係比較唔同國家 
They're able to have high levels of writing ability. ,下一年，我哋計劃研究八種疾病 再下一年，研究十六種 
They're also able to reason at high levels. ,三年內，我哋計劃覆蓋 疾病總數嘅四成 
So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that. ,比較同類型邊個好啲？ 
"So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks, and we're going to take your working memory out for a ride. ",同埋點解？ 
You up for that? Okay. ,五個月前，我喺北歐最大嘅大學醫院 主持一個工作坊 
"I'm going to give you five words, and I just want you to hang on to them. ",怇哋請咗新 CEO，佢有一個願景： 令醫院注重多啲病人嘅 醫療質素同醫療成果 
Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. ,嗰日，我哋喺工作坊 同一啲醫生、護士同其他員工一齊坐 討論兒童白血病 
Five words. ,我哋討論咗： 我哋應該點樣評估質素？ 
"While you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. ",現有評估方法可唔可以改善？ 
I want to see what happens with those words. ,我哋討論：點樣醫好呢啲兒童 有咩重大嘅進步？ 
"So here's the words: tree, highway, mirror, Saturn and electrode. ",我哋又討論：啲病人要使幾多錢 我哋可唔可以更有效咁治療？ 
So far so good? ,當時房裏邊啲人好積極 
Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight. ,有好多想法、好熱情 
Just shout it out. ,會議結束時，系主任企起身 
"(Mumbling) (Laughter) In fact it's -- (Mumbling) -- exactly. (Laughter) All right. I want you to take out your left hand and I want you to go, ""One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."" ",佢望下小組 佢舉手，緊握拳頭 然後對小組嘅人講： 「多謝你哋，今日我哋終於可以討論 
"It's a neurological test, just in case you were wondering. ",呢間醫院應該點樣做。」 
"All right, now what I want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the English alphabet backwards. ",通過評估醫療成效 其中不單止費用，仲包括治療嘅成果 我哋會令到醫院嘅員工 以至醫療系統其他崗位 唔再係煩惱 而係解決方案嘅重要一部分 
You should have started with Z. ,我相信，評估醫療成效會帶嚟革命 我相信現代醫學嘅始祖 希臘嘅希波克拉底 一位永遠將病人放喺第一位嘅人 會喺上天覺得欣慰 
(Laughter) All right. How many people here are still pretty sure you've got all five words? ,多謝 （掌聲） 
"Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half, right, which is normal. There will be a range. ",
Some people can hang on to five. ,琴日，我喺街度 喺一幢樓前面 我喺行人路行 仲有幾個人同我一齊行 
Some people can hang on to 10. ,大家冇傾偈，大家都係向前行 
Some will be down to two or three. ,喺我前面嘅人行慢咗 
"What we know is this is really important to the way we function, right? ",我睇住佢，佢減慢，跟住就停咗落嚟 
And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas. ,由於件事發生得唔算太突然 所以個腦有轉彎嘅提示，我就兜過咗佢 一邊走，我一邊睇佢做梗乜嘢 佢就喺度發梗短訊 
"Now the problem that we have is that life comes at us, and it comes at us very quickly, and what we need to do is to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea. ",佢唔能夠一邊打字一邊行路 
"Now don't get me wrong, working memory is awesome. ",宜家等我哋 由工作記憶嘅角度 或者從多作業角度，睇剛才呢件事 
Working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward. ,我哋今日講工作記憶 
It allows us to make sense of the world around us. ,工作記憶就係我哋每日嘅主動意識 
But it does have certain limits. ,你宜家就係用梗工作記憶 
Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. ,我哋唔會熄到佢 
"We can have a conversation, and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation. ",如果你真係要熄咗佢，你就會昏迷 
"It allows us to problem-solve, critical think. ",（笑聲） 所以呢，你哋宜家都冇熄咗佢 
"We can be in the middle of a meeting, listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it, decide whether or not we like it, ask follow-up questions. ",工作記憶有四個基本元素 
All of that occurs within working memory. ,佢可以儲存上一秒嘅經歷 同埋少少知識 
It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter) Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for. ,佢又可以令我哋搵返我哋好耐嘅記憶 提取我哋想要嘅長期記憶 再按我哋當時嘅目的加以組合、處理 
"Now, a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. ",所謂當時嘅目的唔係話 我想成為總統或世界最勁嘅滑浪手 
"It's limited in capacity, limited in duration, limited in focus. ",而係比較日常，就好似我要嗰塊餅 或者我要諗方法入去酒店房間 
We tend to remember about four things. ,工作記憶嘅容量 指我哋善用我哋已知嘅嘢 用佢哋嚟完成啲嘢 嚟滿足我哋當時嘅目的 
"Okay? It used to be seven, but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four, and we were overachieving. ",工作記憶容量由來已久 帶畀人類好多好處 
"Now we can remember those four things for about 10 to 20 seconds unless we do something with it, unless we process it, unless we apply it to something, unless we talk to somebody about it. ",工作記憶容量大嘅人一般都擅長講故仔 
"When we think about working memory, we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us. ",而且無論測驗對佢哋有幾重要都好 佢哋都考得好好 
Have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you're there? ,佢哋嘅寫作能力都好高 
"You do know the solution to that, right? ",推理水平都好高 
You go back to that original room. (Laughter) Have you ever forgotten your keys? ,咁宜家，我哋就嚟玩一個 工作記憶容量嘅遊戲 
You ever forgotten your car? ,我會叫你哋做一啲任務 你哋就要用你哋嘅工作記憶 
You ever forgotten your kids? ,你哋準備好未？ 
"Have you ever been involved in a conversation, and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting? (Laughter) So you're nodding and you're smiling, but you're really paying attention to this one over here, until you hear that last word go up, and you realize, you've been asked a question. (Laughter) And you're really hoping the answer is no, because that's what you're about to say. ",我會講五個字，你哋要記著佢 
"All of that talks about working memory, what we can do and what we can't do. ",唔要寫落嚟，只可以用腦記住 
"We need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity, and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that. ",五個字 
We negotiate that through strategies. ,你哋記住嘅同時，要答我三個問題 
"So what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here, and these will be really important because you are now in an information target-rich environment for the next several days. ",我想睇下你哋嘅記憶係點 
"Now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence, our life, immediately and repeatedly. ",好，呢五個字係： 樹 公路 鏡 土星 電極 
"We need to process what's going on the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later, not a week later, at the moment. ",冇問題呀嗎？ 
"So we need to think about, well, do I agree with him? ",好！宜家我要請你哋 話畀我聽 23 乘 8 係幾多 
What's missing? What would I like to know? ,大聲講出嚟 
Do I agree with the assumptions? ,（講者模彷口結）（笑聲） 口結係完全正常嘅（笑聲） 好。宜家我要你哋伸出左手 你哋要數一至十 
How can I apply this in my life? ,如果你唔知嘅話，呢個係一個神經測試 
It's a way of processing what's going on so that we can use it later. ,好，宜家你哋要背英文最後五個字母 由尾背返起 
Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice. ,由 Z 開始 
So we need to think about it here. ,（笑聲） 好。宜家有幾多人 仲記得我頭先講嗰五個字？ 
"We're going to write it down, and when you get home, pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time. ",好。通常唔到一半嘅人仲記得 冇錯，呢個好正常。因人而異 
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. ,有啲人可以記到五個 
It's very positive. ,有啲人可以記到十個 
"The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively. ",有啲人剩係記到兩三個 
"Oftentimes, we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge. ",我哋知道，工作記憶 對大腦嘅運作好重要，係嗎？ 
What we want to do is spin that around. ,喺 TED 呢度尤其重要 因為你會聽到好多嘅諗法 
We want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful. ,宜家我哋嘅問題係 時間向我哋衝埋嚟 時間轉瞬即逝 我哋要把握每一殺那 用豆咁細嘅工作記憶 喺每一秒裏面搵到意思 
We also want to use imagery. We are built for images. ,唔好誤會，工作記憶其實好犀利嘅 
We need to take advantage of that. ,工作記憶令我哋可以 一路向前嗰陣 一路了解自己當時嘅感受 
"Think about things in images, write things down that way. ",令我哋明白周圍嘅嘢 
"If you read a book, pull things up. ",佢雖然有限制 
"I just got through reading ""The Great Gatsby,"" and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head, so my own version. ",但工作記憶可以令我哋同人溝通 
The last one is organization and support. ,令我哋可以同人傾偈 令我知道我哋講梗啲乜嘢 要講啲乜嘢 同埋點樣令個討論更加好 
We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do. ,工作記憶令我哋解決問題 識得批判思考 
We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us. ,喺會議途中 我哋可以分析個報告好唔好 諗下自己鍾唔鍾意個報告 跟住問問題 
"Organization helps, so we need to structure what we're doing in ways that make sense. ",呢啲嘢都係由工作記憶完成 
"If we are providing knowledge and experience, we need to structure that. ",佢畀我哋可以去到鋪頭買嘢 買牛奶、蛋同乳酪 更重要去買紅牛飲品同豬肉 （笑聲） 佢令我哋確定買咗要買啲嘢 
And the last one is support. ,工作記憶有佢嘅局限 呢樣亦都係佢嘅核心問題 
We all started as novices. ,容量、儲存時間、焦點都有限 
Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication. ,我哋一般可以記到四樣嘢 
We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that. ,係嗎？以前話係七樣 但功能性磁力共振影像指出，係四件 所以之前誇大咗 
"The support may come in asking people questions, giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images, but we need to support it. ",我哋一般可以記著四樣嘢大概十至廿秒 除非我哋開始落手做呢四樣 除非個腦處理佢哋 我哋將佢哋應用出嚟 除非我哋同人講嗰四樣嘢 
"Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this: what we process, we learn. ",我哋睇工作記憶 我哋必須認清佢容量係有限 所以佢對我哋會有好多影響 
"If we're not processing life, we're not living it. ",你有冇試過由一個房行到另一間 但你唔記得咗點解要行過嚟？ 
Live life. Thank you. ,你知道點做，係咪？ 
(Applause) ,就係返去原本間房！ （笑聲） 你有冇曾經唔記得鎖匙喺邊？ 
,你有冇唔記得架車喺邊？ 
I have a question: Who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die? ,有冇唔記得咗細路？ 
"I do. I was a young boy, and my grandfather had just died, and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened. ",你有冇曾經同一班人傾偈 但發現左邊另一班人傾嘅嘢更加吸引？ （笑聲） 唔，你喺度點頭，你喺度笑 但你係唔留心嘅 直到聽到我最尾個字高音 然後你知道人哋問梗你一個問題 （笑聲） 而你真係希望答案係「否」 因為「否」正係你想講嘅嘢 
What did it mean that he was dead? ,上述講嘅都係關於工作記憶 以及我哋可以做同唔可以做嘅嘢 
Where had he gone? ,但我哋必須認清工作記憶嘅容量係有限 所以我哋要識得運用工作記憶 
It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him. ,我哋可以用一啲方法 
"But then the really shocking question occurred to me: If he could die, could it happen to me too? ",我會喺度講少少呢啲方法 呢啲方法真係幾重要 因為你嚟緊幾日會收到好多資訊 
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me? ,首先，我哋個腦每日每一秒 都要不斷即時咁處理 我哋嘅生存、我哋嘅生活 
Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept? ,我哋要即時知道眼前發生梗嘅事 而唔係十分鐘之後至知 亦唔係一個禮拜之後至知 
"Well, at some point, all children become aware of death. ",我哋即時要諗嘅包括︰我同意佢嗎？ 
"It can happen in different ways, of course, and usually comes in stages. ",少咗啲咩？我想知道啲咩？ 
Our idea of death develops as we grow older. ,我同意呢啲假設嗎？ 
"And if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory, you might remember something like what I felt when my grandfather died and when I realized it could happen to me too, that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting. ",可以知道套用到生活？ 
And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species. ,明白目前發生嘅事 我哋就可以有經驗，之後再用得返 
"Just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were mortal, so at some point in the evolution of our species, some early human's sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize, ""I'm going to die."" ",我哋亦都需要重複練習 
"This is, if you like, our curse. ",我哋同人討論啲事 
It's the price we pay for being so damn clever. ,我哋要將佢哋記錄低 返屋企之後，攞出筆記，思考筆記 同埋要定時練習 
"We have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will, the end of all our projects, our hopes, our dreams, of our individual world. ",「練習」因為某啲原因令人覺得係負面 
We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse. ,但佢其實係好正面 
And that's frightening. It's terrifying. ,下一步，我哋就要諗得仔細同好清晰 
And so we look for a way out. ,好多時，我哋都覺得要 將新知識連到去已有嘅知識 
"And in my case, as I was about five years old, this meant asking my mum. ",我哋就想倒轉 
"Now when I first started asking what happens when we die, the grown-ups around me at the time answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness and half-hearted Christianity, and the phrase I heard most often was that granddad was now ""up there looking down on us,"" and if I should die too, which wouldn't happen of course, then I too would go up there, which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator. ",用新知識解釋現有嘅嘢 令新知識同舊知識更有意思咁走埋一齊 
Now this didn't sound very plausible. ,我哋都會用圖像 因為人類天生對影像敏感 
"I used to watch a children's news program at the time, and this was the era of space exploration. ",我哋可以善用呢個特點 
"There were always rockets going up into the sky, up into space, going up there. ",用圖像去諗嘢 用圖畫記低事情 
But none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people. ,如果你睇梗一本書，就要連埋啲嘢 
"But I was scared, and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while I slept. ",就好似之前我讀《大亨小傳》一樣 我喺腦裏面構想主角個樣 咁我就有咗自己對主角容貌嘅概念 
"And so I believed it anyway, even though it didn't make much sense. ",最後一樣係組織同支援 
"And this thought process that I went through as a child, and have been through many times since, including as a grown-up, is a product of what psychologists call a bias. ",人類係會對事物附加意思 
"Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong, ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge, distort reality, or see what we want to see, and the bias I'm talking about works like this: Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn't true and they can, instead, live forever, even if it means taking the existential elevator. ",人類就係咁 我哋會喺每件事裏邊搵意思 
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all. ,事情嘅組織幫到我哋搵意思 所以我哋要組織 令事情易於明白 
It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies. ,如果我哋要向人講解知識同經驗 我哋先要有組織能力 
"Now these studies are ingenious, but they're simple. ",最後係支援 
"You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects, and you remind one group that they're going to die but not the other, then you compare their behavior. ",我哋都係由初學者開始 
So you're observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality. ,我哋做嘅每一件事都係朝著複雜進發 
"And every time, you get the same result: People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever. ",因為我要知道事情會愈嚟愈難 
"So here's an example: One recent study took two groups of agnostics, that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs. ",所以我哋要加多啲支援 支援可以係向問人問題 例如畀佢哋一張紙 上面有組織圖表或者提示嘅圖片 我哋要支援 
"Now, one group was asked to think about being dead. ",最後，我想帶出一個重點 喺工作記憶裏面 我哋個腦處理嘅嘢，就係我哋要學嘅嘢 
The other group was asked to think about being lonely. ,假如我哋個腦冇處理過生活大小事情 我哋就從來都冇生存過 
They were then asked again about their religious beliefs. ,好好過你嘅生活。多謝 
Those who had been asked to think about being dead were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in God and Jesus. ,（掌聲） 
Twice as likely. ,
Even though the before they were all equally agnostic. ,我想問一問︰ 在場有邊個仲記得自己第一次意識到 自己係要面對死亡？ 
"But put the fear of death in them, and they run to Jesus. ",我記得當時我係個細路仔 而祖父啱啱過咗身 我記得幾日後嘅夜晚我攤喺床上 想了解到底發生咗咩事 
"Now, this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence, and it works not just for religion, but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form, whether it's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism, which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole. ",祖父「死」到底係乜意思？ 
This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history. ,佢去咗邊度？ 
"Now, the theory behind this bias in the over 400 studies is called terror management theory, and the idea is simple. It's just this. ",嗰刻我覺得死亡就好似 個世界有個窿打開、吞咗佢落去 
"We develop our worldviews, that is, the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it, in order to help us manage the terror of death. ",但同時我又諗到一個非常可怕嘅問題 既然祖父會死，我係唔係都會死？ 
"And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations, but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take. ",嗰個窿會唔會都打開吞咗我架？ 
"And we can see them repeating themselves throughout history, just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day. ",會唔會趁我瞓著喺床下底 打開吞咗我？ 
"Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story, and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they're retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day. ",其實到某個歲數 所有細路仔都會察覺到死亡 
"Now, the first story is the simplest. ",當然，佢哋發現嘅方式可能唔一樣 但通常都係有幾個階段嘅 
"We want to avoid death, and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story, and it might at first sound implausible, but actually, almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever. ",我哋對死亡嘅認識隨著年齡增長 
"Ancient Egypt had such myths, ancient Babylon, ancient India. ",假如你去返隱藏咗嘅記憶 你可能會諗返起原來祖父過身時 自己都曾經諗過「我都會死﹗」 仲有就係覺得個窿喺度等緊自己 
"Throughout European history, we find them in the work of the alchemists, and of course we still believe this today, only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science. ",呢一種童年經歷其實同 我哋人類身體發展好有關係 
"So 100 years ago, hormones had just been discovered, and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease, and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology. ",當你發育嘅時候，會去到一個位 你對自己同時間嘅觸覺 都發展得好成熟 足夠令你意識到 你只係一個同樣會面對死亡嘅生物 所以喺人類進化過程裏面 有啲人對自我同時間嘅意識 都發展得好成熟 足以令佢哋第一個去意識到 「我原來會死嘅！」 
"But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir, a story that is as old as civilization. ",或者，呢個就係對人類嘅詛咒 
But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy. ,亦係我哋聰明所付出嘅代價 
"When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past, the one thing they now have in common is that they're all dead. ",我哋生存，必須要知道 惡夢可能終會成真 終有一天，我哋所有計劃、希望、夢想 同自我嘅世界都會完結 
"So we need a backup plan, and exactly this kind of plan B is what the second kind of immortality story offers, and that's resurrection. ",而我哋各自都活喺自己嘅陰影裏面 
"And it stays with the idea that I am this body, I am this physical organism. ",呢樣嘢係好可怕、好恐佈 
"It accepts that I'm going to have to die but says, despite that, I can rise up and I can live again. ",所以我哋就搵方法擺脫佢 
"In other words, I can do what Jesus did. ",由於我當時五歲，我就問媽咪 
"Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb], and then he rose up and lived again. ",當我問，人死嘅時候會點樣 當時我身邊嘅成年人 都用典型嘅英文語氣回答 即係混雜尷尬 同半虔誠嘅基督徒口吻 我成日聽到嘅說話 就係祖父喺「個天度望著我哋」 如果我離世嘅話…呢個當然唔會發生啦 但萬一嘅話，我都一樣會上去 咁樣講，令到死亡聽上去 就好似一部「現實存在」嘅升降機 
"And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe, not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims. ",但呢種講法好似唔太合理 
"But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age, for example, with the idea of cryonics. ",我嗰時收睇緊一個兒童嘅新聞節目 嗰陣係太空探索嘅年代 
"That's the idea that when you die, you can have yourself frozen, and then, at some point when technology has advanced enough, you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected. ",成日有火箭升空 升到上太空 
"And so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again, and other people believe an omnipotent scientist will do it. ",但冇一個太空人返嚟之後 提過佢哋見到祖父 或者其他過咗身嘅人 
"But for others, the whole idea of resurrection, of climbing out of the grave, it's just too much like a bad zombie movie. ",當時我有啲驚 但所謂「死後坐升降機」見祖父嘅講法 聽起上嚟，比趁我瞓著時 個窿會吞咗我嘅講法好好多 
"They find the body too messy, too unreliable to guarantee eternal life, and so they set their hopes on the third, more spiritual immortality story, the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul. ",所以就算唔太合理，我都信咗先 
"Now, the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul, and the idea is central to many religions. ",而呢個由細個開始已經有嘅諗法 伴隨咗我好耐 亦都形成咗心理學家叫嘅「偏謬」 
"But even though, in its current form, in its traditional form, the idea of the soul is still hugely popular, nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age, for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind, your essence, the real you, onto a computer, and so live on as an avatar in the ether. ",「偏謬」令我哋成日誤解同做錯啲嘢 令我哋誤算、錯判、扭曲事實 或者只睇到我哋想睇嘅嘢 而我所講嘅「偏謬」 係會推翻人對死亡嘅睇法 令佢哋相信死亡係假嘅 相反，佢哋可以永生 就算同佢哋講「升降機」嘅嘢 
"But of course there are skeptics who say if we look at the evidence of science, particularly neuroscience, it suggests that your mind, your essence, the real you, is very much dependent on a particular part of your body, that is, your brain. ",佢哋都會信 我哋可以見到 呢個有關永生嘅說法係最大嘅偏謬 
"And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story, and that is legacy, the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world, like the great Greek warrior Achilles, who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame. ",亦都喺 400 幾個實證研究裏面証明咗 
"And the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was, and in our digital age, it's even easier to achieve. ",呢啲研究好高明，但其實又好簡單 
You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles or a great king or hero. ,就係將一批各方面都相似嘅人分成兩組 剩係同其中一組講佢哋會死 然後比較佢哋嘅行為 
"All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat. (Laughter) But some people prefer to leave a more tangible, biological legacy -- children, for example. ",你就可以觀察到句說話 點樣喺人注意死亡嘅時候 影響佢哋嘅行為 
"Or they like, they hope, to live on as part of some greater whole, a nation or a family or a tribe, their gene pool. ",每次結果都一樣 留意到生死嘅人更加願意 去相信得到永生嘅故事 
"But again, there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality. ",呢度有一個例子： 最近一項研究以不可知論者做對象 即係冇宗教信仰嘅人做對象 
"Woody Allen, for example, who said, ""I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen. ",佢哋分成兩組，一組要諗下死亡 
"I want to live on in my apartment."" ",另一組要諗下寂獨 
"So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories, and I've tried to give just some sense of how they're retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day. ",然後佢哋會再回答佢哋嘅信仰 
"And the fact that they recur in this way, in such a similar form but in such different belief systems, suggests, I think, that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories. ",諗自己死亡嘅一組 佢哋信主耶穌嘅傾向比之前多一倍 
The fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this on the strength of the evidence. ,係高一倍 
"Rather, we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them, and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death. ",即使之前佢哋同樣冇信神 
"So the question is, are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial, or can we overcome this bias? ",但只要將死亡嘅恐懼擺喺跟前 佢哋就投向耶穌 
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could. ,証明咗只要令人諗返死亡 無論理據係點，都能夠令佢哋相信 唔只係對宗教湊效 對任何信念都一樣湊效 只要啲人聽到有永生就得架啦 無論係變得出名、有細路仔 抑或係寄託喺更加大嘅民族主義度 啲人都會肯制 
"He argued that the fear of death is natural, but it is not rational. ",呢樣就係改變咗 人類歷史進程嘅「偏謬」 
"Death, he said, ""is nothing to us, because when we are here, death is not, and when death is here, we are gone."" ",呢 400 幾個研究 針對偏謬所提出嘅理論 叫做「恐懼管理理論」 原理好簡單 我哋想我哋嘅世界觀 
"Now this is often quoted, but it's difficult to really grasp, to really internalize, because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine. ",幫到我哋控制死亡嘅恐懼 
"So 2,000 years later, another philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this: ""Death is not an event in life: We do not live to experience death. ",世界觀當中有關永生嘅故事 有成千上萬個咁多 但我認為喺咁多故事之中 嚟嚟去去都只有四種基本路數 佢哋四個都喺歷史裡面一直重覆 
"And so,"" he added, ""in this sense, life has no end."" ",只係每個時代為咗配合當時嘅語言 而改咗少少嘢 
"So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void, but it wasn't rational, because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience. ",我簡單咁介紹下呢四個故事路數 我會令你明白呢啲故事路數 喺各個文化或世代裡面 點樣用當時嘅用語重新演繹 
"Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us, yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational, and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us, then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives. ",好，第一類故事係最簡單嘅 
"Now, I find it helps to see life as being like a book: Just as a book is bounded by its covers, by beginning and end, so our lives are bounded by birth and death, and even though a book is limited by beginning and end, it can encompass distant landscapes, exotic figures, fantastic adventures. ",我哋都想避開死亡 而為咗令我哋喺呢個世界得到永生 就有咗第一個同最簡單嘅永生故事 初初聽起上嚟係覺得冇乜可能嘅 但其實，歷史裏面幾乎每一個人類文化 都有一啲關於長生不老藥 或不老之泉之類 可以令我哋永生嘅傳說或神話 
"And even though a book is limited by beginning and end, the characters within it know no horizons. ",古埃及有呢類傳說 古巴比倫有、古印度都有 
"They only know the moments that make up their story, even when the book is closed. ",環顧成個歐洲歷史 煉金術士裏面都搵到咁嘅嘢 當然，今時今日我哋仍然會相信 只係宜家我哋用科學去講呢個故事啫 
And so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page. ,百幾年前，人類發現咗荷爾蒙 然後人就希望荷爾蒙療程 能夠阻止衰老、治療疾病 咁宜家，我哋將希望轉移到 幹細胞、基因工程同納米科技 
"Long John Silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of ""Treasure Island."" ",科學之所以講到可以對抗死亡 只係魔法藥水故事加插多一章而已 呢啲魔法藥水故事 其實同人類文明一樣咁耐 
And so it should be with us. ,咁如果我哋將注碼 都押喺搵長生不老藥度 係咪好危險？係 
"Imagine the book of your life, its covers, its beginning and end, and your birth and your death. ",當我哋睇返歷史 以前搵長生不老藥嘅人 佢哋有嘅共通點就係 佢哋都已經唔喺呢個世界 
"You can only know the moments in between, the moments that make up your life. ",所以啲人作過第二個故事 就係第二類永生故事所講嘅「復活」 
"It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers, whether before your birth or after your death. ",當中嘅概念就係話 我係一個軀殼、動物 
"And you needn't worry how long the book is, or whether it's a comic strip or an epic. ",我都會死亡 但係我可以復活 
The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story. ,換句話講，我都可以同耶穌一樣復活 
Thank you. ,耶穌死咗，喺墓嗰度過咗三天 然後佢復活重生 
,而我哋所有人都可以復活嘅諗法 係源於傳統嘅信念 唔只係基督教先有 就連猶太教同回教都有 
"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, and Mourners to and fro kept treading -- treading -- till [it seemed] that Sense was breaking through -- And when they all were seated, a Service, like a Drum -- kept beating -- beating -- till I [thought] my Mind was going numb -- And then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul with those same Boots of Lead, again, then Space -- began to toll, As [all] the Heavens were a Bell, and Being, [but] an Ear, and I, and Silence, some strange Race, wrecked, solitary, here -- [And] then a Plank in Reason, broke, and I fell down and down -- and hit a World, at every plunge, and Finished knowing -- then -- We know depression through metaphors. ",但我哋太想相信呢啲故事啦 以至我哋會為個故事重新演譯過 令佢更加適合呢個科學年代 例如人體冷凍技術概念 
"Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language, Goya in an image. ",就係當你死嗰時，你可以急凍自己 然後當科技先進到某個位 你可以解凍、修復、甦醒，然後復活 
Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states. ,一啲人相信一位全能嘅上帝會復活佢哋 其他人相信一位好勁嘅科學家 會令佢哋復活 
"As for me, I had always thought myself tough, one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentration camp. ",但對其他人嚟講 成個由墓裏面復活嘅概念 其實就好似一齣喪屍片一樣 
"In 1991, I had a series of losses. ",如果要確保永生嘅話 肉體實在太污衊、太唔可靠啦 所以佢哋將希望擺喺第三個故事度 一個比較靈性嘅故事度 就係話我哋可以脫離肉體 化成靈魂咁生活 
"My mother died, a relationship I'd been in ended, I moved back to the United States from some years abroad, and I got through all of those experiences intact. ",宜家，大部份人都相信 佢哋自己係有靈魂 而呢個觀念亦都係 好多宗教嘅核心價值 
"But in 1994, three years later, I found myself losing interest in almost everything. ",「靈魂」嗰概念無論去到家下 有幾傳統都好 仍是極之為人接受 無論點樣，我哋再一次 因為時代唔同嘅關係，重新演譯佢 例如你可以透過 將你嘅心思、你嘅心靈 你自己成個人都上載去電腦 咁樣，你嘅靈魂就可以脫離身體 然後以化身存活於空間裏面 
"I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do, and I didn't know why. ",不過當然會人懷疑咁話 假如我哋睇下科學嘅證據 尤其係神經科學嘅數據 佢哋都指出 你嘅心思、心靈同你自己 其實好大程度依賴 你身體嘅一個部分，就係你個腦 
"The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality. ",而呢班懷疑嘅人 會喺第四種故事裏邊搵到慰藉 嗰樣嘢就係「傳承」 就係用你留喺世界嘅迴響 延續你嘅生命 就好似希臘戰士阿基里斯 喺特洛伊中壯烈犠牲 贏得千秋萬世嘅名聲，用名聲延續後世 
And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment. ,人類對名氣嘅追求同以前一樣咁強 我哋尤其喺數碼年代 更加容易得到名氣 
Everything there was to do seemed like too much work. ,你唔需要成為阿基里斯一樣咁嘅戰士 國王或者英雄 
"I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine, and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends, I would think, ""What a lot of people that is to have to call back."" ",你只需要連接到互聯網 同有一隻攪笑嘅貓就得啦 （笑聲） 但有啲人鐘意遺傳一啲更加實在嘅嘢 亦即係生物嘅遺物，例如細路仔咁 
"Or I would decide I should have lunch, and then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it, and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross. ",或者佢哋希望 寄託喺更加大嘅事物上面去繼續生存 例如國家、家庭、種族 或者佢哋嘅基因 
And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous. ,但又係啦，總會有人質疑 「傳承」實際上算唔算得上係永生 
You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it. ,舉個例 伍迪 ‧ 艾倫講過︰ 「我唔想喺其他國民嘅心裏面住， 
"You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it's not a big deal, and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. ",我住喺自己嘅屋就好啦。」 
And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. ,以上就係四種永生嘅故事 你哋都明白到呢四種故事喺每一代 總會有少少嘅改動去切合唔同年代 
It was a kind of nullity. ,正正因為佢哋喺唔同信念系統裏面 改少少嘢而重新演譯 我認為 我哋應該對任何一個故事版本 都抱有懷疑 
And then the anxiety set in. ,有啲人相信全能嘅上帝會復活佢哋 而另一啲人就相信犀利嘅科學家會 呢樣嘢話畀我哋聽呢兩班人 都冇按理據嘅可信性 去揀佢哋要信嘅嘢 
"If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month, I would say, ""As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it."" ",相反，我哋信呢啲故事 只係因為我哋一開始有偏謬，所以至信 我哋之所以有偏謬 係因為我哋太驚死亡啦 
"But if you said to me, ""You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,"" I would rather slit my wrist than go through it. ",所以問題係 我哋係否命中注定 要活喺恐懼同否定之中？ 定係我哋可以擺脫呢種偏謬？ 
"It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you, but instead of lasting half a second, the way that does, it lasted for six months. ",希臘哲學家 Epicurus 認為 我哋可以擺脫偏謬 
It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of. ,佢指出對死亡嘅恐懼係自然嘅 但唔係理性 
"And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive, and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people. ",佢話：「死亡對我哋根本冇嘢， 因為當我哋仲在世時，死亡唔存在。 而當死亡來臨時，我哋已經唔存在。」 
"And finally one day, I woke up and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke, because I lay in bed completely frozen, looking at the telephone, thinking, ""Something is wrong and I should call for help,"" and I couldn't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial. ",呢句話經常被引用 但要真正理解同做到呢句話係好難嘅 因為好難想像到 人離開世界時嘅情況 
"And finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it, the phone rang, and somehow I managed to pick it up, and it was my father, and I said, ""I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something."" ",所以二千年後 另一位哲學家 路德維希 ‧ 維特根斯坦 咁樣演繹： 「死亡唔係生命裏嘅一環， 我哋生存並唔係為咗經歷死亡。」 
The next day I started with the medications and the therapy. ,佢又話：「從呢個角度諗， 生命並冇盡頭。」 
"And I also started reckoning with this terrible question: If I'm not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp, then who am I? ",所以，我細個時驚黑洞會食咗我 係好正常嘅，只係唔理性啫 因為冇一個人係為咗 俾黑洞吞食而生存 
"And if I have to take medication, is that medication making me more fully myself, or is it making me someone else? ",要克服呢個偏謬並唔容易 因為死亡嘅恐懼深深埋喺我哋心入邊 但當我哋知道恐懼本身係非理性 當我哋拆穿呢啲故事 點樣靜雞雞咁誤導我哋時 咁我哋至少可以 將佢哋對我哋人生嘅影響減到最低 
And how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else? ,我發覺將生命睇成一本書係好有幫助 一本書前後都有封面 而我哋嘅生命就係由出生同死亡包著 就算一本書受制於底同面 佢裏面都可以印有遙遠國度嘅風景 異國風情嘅相、難忘嘅旅程 
I had two advantages as I went into the fight. ,就算一本書受制於佢嘅開始同結束 裡面嘅角色睇嘢並唔會有界限 
"The first is that I knew that, objectively speaking, I had a nice life, and that if I could only get well, there was something at the other end that was worth living for. ",佢哋剩係會知道佢哋出現過嘅時空 
And the other was that I had access to good treatment. ,正因為咁 書裡邊嘅角色都唔會怕 嚟到書嘅最後一頁 
"But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever. ",海滋客唔會怕你讀完《金銀島》 
"And I thought, ""But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem? ",所以我哋都應該好似啲故事人物一樣 
"And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure?"" ",想像一下你自己生命嘅嗰本書 佢嘅封面、開頭、收尾、出生同死亡 
And I couldn't figure out which it was. ,你只知道書中間嘅內容 構成你生命嘅中間內容 
"And then I understood that actually, we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully. ",你根本冇理由需要因為 書以外嘅嘢而驚 包括你出世之前，抑或你死咗之後 
"The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play, and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality. ",你亦都毋須擔心書有幾厚 擔心佢係漫畫定係史詩 
I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling. ,你只需要問自己有冇 為你本書編寫好嘅故事 
They're not very effective. ,多謝 （掌聲） 
They're extremely costly. ,
They come with innumerable side effects. ,「我腦裏面感覺到有一場葬禮， 而殮葬嘅人不停行嚟行去， 當我嘅感覺返返嚟，佢哋就坐返埋位， 葬禮儀式好似鼓一樣敲打著。 直至我嘅腦完全麻木， 跟住我聽到佢哋移靈安葬我嘅遺體， 而我嘅靈魂就好似木一樣敲碎緊， 仲有佢哋好似之前一樣 鉛一樣沉重嘅腳步， 而成個大嘅空間好似有一個鐘喺度響。 天堂好似一個鐘咁， 而人就好似耳朵， 聽到定時響起嘅鐘聲， 但我同寂靜屬於同一個異端， 都係擱淺喺荒島上，孤零零喺度。 隨著支持我嘅木板斷開， 我不斷墜落， 墜落， 撞到好多嘢然後跌落一個世界， 我唔再認識事物。」 我哋喺好多喑喻裏邊見到抑鬱症 
They're a disaster. ,艾米莉 ‧ 狄金森將抑鬱症轉化為文字 戈雅將抑鬱症轉化成油畫 
"But I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago, when there would have been almost nothing to be done. ",一半嘅藝術創作 係想表達抑鬱症嘅典形狀態 
"I hope that 50 years hence, people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science. ",至於我， 我一直認為自己係堅強 如果一班人被咗去集中營嘅話 我會係其中一個可以存活落嚟嘅人 
Depression is the flaw in love. ,1991 年，我經歷一連串嘅打擊 
"If you were married to someone and thought, ""Well, if my wife dies, I'll find another one,"" it wouldn't be love as we know it. ",我母親過世、一段感情結束咗 同埋我結束咗幾年外國生活 返返去美國 而我經歷以上打擊都仍然係好硬淨 
"There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss, and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy. ",但係喺 1994，三年之後 我發覺自己幾乎對所有嘢都冇興趣 
"There are three things people tend to confuse: depression, grief and sadness. ",我唔想做任何之前想做嘅嘢 我都唔知點解會噉樣 
Grief is explicitly reactive. ,抑鬱嘅反面唔係快樂， 係活力 
"If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy, and then, six months later, you are still deeply sad, but you're functioning a little better, it's probably grief, and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure. ",活力就係嗰時我覺得我失去咗嘅嘢 
"If you experience a catastrophic loss, and you feel terrible, and six months later you can barely function at all, then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances. ",每日要做嘅嘢實在太多啦 
The trajectory tells us a great deal. ,我想返屋企 見到電話答錄機上面閃著紅色燈 我冇咁驚 因為唔使聽到朋友留言 我就諗︰點解我要覆返咁多人嘅電話？ 
People think of depression as being just sadness. ,或係我應該要食午餐啦 但我會諗， 我要將食物攞出嚟 擺喺個碟度 又要切、又要擺入個口度，又要吞咗去 感覺好似耶穌行十架嘅路一樣 
"It's much, much too much sadness, much too much grief at far too slight a cause. ",而有一樣成日喺討論抑鬱症嘅時候 會忽略嘅嘢係 你知道抑鬱症係非常荒謬嘅一件事 
"As I set out to understand depression, and to interview people who had experienced it, I found that there were people who seemed, on the surface, to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it. ",你知道當你經歷抑鬱症嘅時候 佢係有幾咁荒謬 
And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes. ,你知道大部分人 會聽答錄機嘅留言同食晏 安排好沖涼、出去屋企 呢啲都係好簡單 但當你仍然係喺抑鬱症嘅控制當中 你搵唔到方法解決佢 
And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people. ,之後我覺得自己做嘢做得愈嚟愈少 又諗得少、感受又愈嚟愈少 
What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive? ,可以話係無能 
And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression. ,跟著焦慮嚟勒 
"One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead, and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness, that this is a serious business. ",如果你話俾我聽之後嗰幾個月 我都要處於抑鬱狀態 我會話︰只要佢十一月完，我就冇問題 
"It's the leading disability worldwide, and people die of it every day. ",但係如果你同我講 我呢幾個月都要極度焦慮 我寧願割腕自殺，好過極度焦慮幾個月 
"One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years, and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college, and then plummeted into a horrific depression. ",我嗰陣成日都會有一種感覺 好似你行路突然跣襯或者拤倒 而地下快速衝埋你度咁嘅感覺 但係嗰種恐懼感並唔係 剩係跌落地嘅半秒鐘 而係持續咗半年 
"She had bipolar illness, or manic depression, as it was then known. ",嗰種感覺令你一直覺得好驚 但你又唔會知道你驚嘅係乜嘢 
"And then she did very well for many years on lithium, and then eventually, she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it, and she had another psychosis, and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat in her parents' apartment, more or less catatonic, essentially without moving, day after day after day. ",就喺嗰個時候我開始諗 活著真係太痛苦 而唯一唔自殺嘅理由 就係因為唔想 因為我自殺會傷害到其他人 
"And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later -- she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins -- when I interviewed her, she said, ""I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone,' over and over, to occupy my mind. ",然後有一日，當我瞓醒 突然間覺得我中風 因為我喺床上完全郁唔到 我望住個電話，諗 「有啲唔對路， 我要打去搵人幫手」 但我連手都遞唔到 噉點拎起電話打呢？ 
"I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying, which were, 'You are nothing. You are nobody. ",經過四個鐘頭我依煞瞓喺張床 郁都郁唔到 電話響，我用盡力咁攞起個電話 嗰個係我老豆打嚟 我話「 我遇到好大嘅麻煩， 我哋必須諗辦法解決佢。」 
"You don't even deserve to live.' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself."" ",第二日我就開始治療同食藥 
You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. ,而我同時諗到一個好弊嘅問題 如果我唔係一個堅強嘅人 可以喺集中營裏面生存嘅人 噉我係乜？ 
"You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you're seeing truly. ",如果我要靠藥物 噉藥物係咪令我做返真正嘅自己？ 定係將我變成第二個人？ 
"It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives, because we believe we are seeing the truth. ",如果藥物令我變成第二個人 噉我應該有咩感受？ 
But the truth lies. ,我對抗抑鬱會有兩個好處 
"I became obsessed with that sentence: ""But the truth lies."" ",第一就係客觀嚟講，我會有好嘅生活 如果當我好返 噉之後就會有更美好嘅嘢等住我 
"And I discovered, as I talked to depressive people, that they have many delusional perceptions. ",第二樣就係我會得到好好嘅治療 
"People will say, ""No one loves me."" ",但我好轉又復發，好轉又復發 最後我終於明白 我以後都要靠食藥同治潦生活 
"And you say, ""I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you."" ",我就諗 ，抑鬱症到底 係化學問題定精神問題呢？ 
"You can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people. ",需要化學治療定係心理治療？ 
"But people who are depressed will also say, ""No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end."" ",我搞唔清楚 
"Or they'll say, ""There can be no true communion between two human beings. ",跟住我明白到 我哋無論呢兩個領域嘅知識 都未夠深入去解釋事物 
"Each of us is trapped in his own body."" ",化學治療同心理治療都有佢哋嘅作用 我同時發覺抑鬱症係一種 同我哋內心深深糾纏著嘅嘢嚟 即係話我哋冇辦法將 佢由我哋人格同個性當中分離 
"To which you have to say, ""That's true, but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast."" ",我想講我哋對抑鬱症嘅治療方法 其實係唔係好好 
"(Laughter) A lot of the time, what they are expressing is not illness, but insight, and one comes to think what's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don't distract us very much. ",嗰啲治療都唔係好有效 
"There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour, and at the end of the hour, they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed. ",而且仲非常昂貴 
"The depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent, and the non-depressed people guessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters -- (Laughter) as they had actually killed. ",有好多數唔曬嘅副作用 
"A lot of people said, when I chose to write about my depression, that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet, to have people know. ",呢啲治療嘅禍害好大 
"They said, ""Do people talk to you differently?"" ",但慶幸嘅係我生活喺呢個年代 而唔係五十年前 五十年前面對抑鬱症係束手無策 
"I said, ""Yes, people talk to me differently. ",我希望五十年之後 當人聽到我呢一刻接受過嘅治療 會覺訝異點解會有人接受咁原始嘅科學 
"They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience, or their sister's experience, or their friend's experience. ",抑鬱症喺感情上係一個裂口 
Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has. ,如果你今日同某人結婚，然後諗 「如果我老婆過生， 我會搵另一個」 噉樣就唔係我哋所認知嘅愛情 
"I went a few years ago to a conference, and on Friday of the three-day conference, one of the participants took me aside, and she said, ""I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it, but I've been taking this medication, and I just wanted to ask you what you think?"" ",如果冇預料過會失去，噉就唔叫做愛情 預見過絕望係人變得親密嘅原動力 
And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could. ,人成日會撈亂三樣嘢︰ 抑鬱、哀痛同悲傷 
"And then she said, ""You know, my husband would never understand this. ",哀痛係好有反應 
"He's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense, so, you know, it's just between us."" ",如果你因為失去某樣嘢而非常唔開心 半年之後你仲係覺得好難過 但比起半年前好咗啲 嗰種應該哀痛 佢自己最後會慢慢消失 
"And I said, ""Yes, that's fine."" ",如果你經歷過一場浩劫，感覺好慘 六個月後你只能夠僅僅噉捱落去 好可能就係浩劫發生嗰陣 同時引起你嘅抑鬱 
"On Sunday of the same conference, her husband took me aside, (Laughter) and he said, ""My wife wouldn't think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this, but I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication, and I wondered what you think?"" ",噉樣嘅軌跡畀我哋了解到 抑鬱症係一件好嚴重嘅事 
They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom. ,人哋覺得抑鬱症就同等於悲傷 
(Laughter) And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems. ,但係抑鬱症卻係帶著太多太多嘅悲傷 同埋太多太多嘅哀痛 而一切都係由小事引起 
(Laughter) But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy. ,當我開始去了解抑鬱症 開始同一啲曾經患過嘅人傾嘅時候 我發現嗰啲人表現上睇起嚟 有輕微嘅抑鬱 但實際上抑鬱症令佢哋失去咗生活能力 
Depression is so exhausting. ,另一邊有批人聽起上嚟 有好嚴重嘅抑鬱 但佢哋卻係兩次病發之間生活得好好 
"It takes up so much of your time and energy, and silence about it, it really does make the depression worse. ",跟著我開始搵出 係乜原因畀令某啲人比另一啲更堅強 
And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better. ,係乜嘢機制 令人就算有抑鬱都可以生存落嚟？ 
I'd started off as a medical conservative. ,跟著我一個又一個咁同曾經抑鬱嘅人傾 
"I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked, it was clear what they were -- there was medication, there were certain psychotherapies, there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment, and that everything else was nonsense. ",其中一個人形容抑鬱症 係一個慢慢死亡嘅過程 一開頭聽到呢種講法係好事嚟 因為佢提醒咗我 慢慢步入死亡真係可以死亡 呢樣嘢係好嚴肅 
But then I discovered something. ,抑鬱症係全世界第一大 引致失去活動能力嘅疾病 每日都有人因為抑鬱症而離開世界 
"If you have brain cancer, and you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but you still have brain cancer, and you'll still probably die from it. ",其中一個喺我了解抑鬱症嘅時候傾嘅人 係我一個認識多年嘅好友 佢喺大學第一年有精神問題 之後惡化成幾多人驚嘅抑鬱症 
"But if you say that you have depression, and standing on your head for 20 minutes every day makes you feel better, then it's worked, because depression is an illness of how you feel, and if you feel better, then you are effectively not depressed anymore. ",佢精神好兩極化 即係之後嘅躁狂抑鬱症 
So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments. ,經過多年鋰鹽治療 佢復完得相當唔錯 到最後醫生停咗開鋰鹽俾佢 睇下佢可唔可以唔使藥物都得 跟著佢又再度精神失常 仲惡化成我見過最嚴重嘅抑鬱症 佢坐喺佢父母間屋裏面 手腳好硬，坐喺度唔郁 日日都係咁 
"And I get letters, I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what's worked for them. ",幾年之後我問佢呢段經歷時 佢已經係詩人同心理治療師 Maggie Robins 佢話︰「我一直重複唱著 Where Have All The Flowers Gone， 令我個腦剩係得呢首歌。 
Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation. ,我唱著呢首歌去掩蓋心入邊把聲， 嗰把聲就係 『你係冇用嘅， 你對世界嚟講可有可無。 
"My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy, medication, she had tried pretty much everything, and she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world, and that was making little things from yarn. ",你根本唔配活喺呢個世界上。』 呢個時候我開始諗住自殺。」 
(Laughter) She sent me some of them. ,你有抑鬱嘅時候唔會諗 你戴咗一塊灰色面紗 唔會覺得自己係透過負面情緒去睇嘢 
(Laughter) And I'm not wearing them right now. ,你只會認為一塊 代表快樂嘅面紗被人攞走咗 你覺得宜家先係睇到真實嘅世界 
(Laughter) I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM. ,同樣係人格分裂嘅病人 內心覺得有嘢需要驅趕嘅一類病人 比較容易治療 但抑鬱類型嘅病人就難啲 因為病人相信佢哋睇到真實世界 
"And yet, when I went to look at alternative treatments, I also gained perspective on other treatments. ",但真實世界卻係講緊大話 
"I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal that involved a great deal of ram's blood and that I'm not going to detail right now, but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda, working on a different project, and I happened to describe my experience to someone, and he said, ""Well, that's West Africa, and we're in East Africa, and our rituals are in some ways very different, but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what you're describing."" ",我成日聽到呢句說話 「但真實世界卻係講緊大話」 
"And he said, ""But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers, especially the ones who came right after the genocide."" ",當我同抑鬱嘅人傾計嘅時候 我發現佢哋有好多幻覺 
"I said, ""What kind of trouble did you have?"" ",佢哋會話「冇人愛我」 
"And he said, ""Well, they would do this bizarre thing. ",然後你同佢講 「我愛你，你老婆愛你， 你媽咪愛你。」 
They didn't take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better. ,你可以好快咁應返佢哋大部分人 
They didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going. ,但係抑鬱症嘅人會話 「無論我哋點樣努力， 我哋最後都會死。」 
They didn't involve the whole community. ,或者佢哋會話 「兩個人之間唔會有真正嘅溝通。 
They didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit. ,每個人只會畀自己嘅身體困住。」 
"Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them."" ",你只可以回答 「冇錯，但我覺得我哋宜家應該諗， 我哋早餐食啲乜。」 
"(Laughter) (Applause) He said, ""We had to ask them to leave the country."" ",（笑聲） 好多時佢哋表逹嘅並唔係一種病， 而係佢哋睇嘢嘅角度 而佢哋會覺得好特別嘅嘢會係 我哋大部分人都一早知道嘅問題 呢啲問題唔會好令我哋分心 
"(Laughter) Now at the other end of alternative treatments, let me tell you about Frank Russakoff. ",我幾鐘意一個調查 一班抑鬱症病人同一班冇抑鬱嘅人 需要分別玩電子遊戲一粒鐘 當佢哋玩完 佢哋要回答佢哋覺得喺遊戲裏面 殺咗幾多隻怪獸 
Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man. ,抑鬱症嗰班人通常講到 10% 之內誤差嘅數字 至於冇抑鬱症嘅人 佢哋估嘅數字 係佢哋真正殺咗數目嘅 15-20 倍 （笑聲） 
He was constantly depressed. ,好多人會話，當我決定寫我嘅抑鬱症 係一個非常困難嘅決定 
"He was, when I met him, at a point at which every month, he would have electroshock treatment. ",佢哋問︰ 「人哋同你傾計嘅時候會唔會唔同？」 
Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week. ,我話︰「係， 人哋同我傾計會有唔同。」 
Then he would feel okay for a week. ,佢哋會同我講佢哋抑鬱症嘅經驗 可能係佢哋家姐、細妹 可能係佢哋嘅朋友 
Then he would have a week of going downhill. ,宜家唔同啦因為我知道 抑鬱症每個家庭都曾經有過 
And then he would have another electroshock treatment. ,前幾年我去咗個研討會 喺嗰個為期三日嘅研討會入面 其中一日，係星期五嚟 其中一個參加者將我拉到一旁 然後佢同我講︰ 「我有抑鬱症，呢個病令我覺得尷尬， 但係我一路有食藥。 我剩係想問下你你點樣睇？」 
"And he said to me when I met him, ""It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way. ",所以我就盡我所能答佢 
"I can't go on this way, and I've figured out how I'm going to end it if I don't get better."" ",佢跟住話︰ 「你知嗎？ 我老公永遠唔會明白架。 
"But, he said to me, ""I heard about a protocol at Mass General for a procedure called a cingulotomy, which is a brain surgery, and I think I'm going to give that a try."" ",呢樣嘢對佢完全冇意義。 所以， 呢個係我哋嘅秘密。」 
"And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism to reach out for one more. ",我答 ︰「冇問題。」 
"And he had the cingulotomy, and it was incredibly successful. ",跟著喺研討會嘅最後一日 佢丈夫又拉埋我一邊 （笑聲） 佢話 ︰「我老婆 如果知道我有抑鬱症嘅話， 絕對唔會覺得我係一個男人。 我有療程，有食藥。 我想知道你點諗？」 
He's now a friend of mine. ,佢哋兩夫妻將佢哋同一款藥 收埋喺同一間睡房嘅唔同地方 
He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children. ,（笑聲） 我諗佢哋溝通唔係好好 導致一啲問題出現 
"He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery, and he said, ""My father sent me two presents this year, First, a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image that I didn't really need, but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love. ",（笑聲） 同時我都因為佢哋互相提防而覺得辛苦 
"And the other present was a photo of my grandmother, who committed suicide. ",抑鬱症令人好攰 
"As I unwrapped it, I began to cry, and my mother came over and said, 'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew?' And I said, 'She had the same disease I have.' I'm crying now as I write to you. ",佢用咗你好多時間同精力 唔理抑鬱症只會令抑鬱症惡化 
"It's not that I'm so sad, but I get overwhelmed, I think, because I could have killed myself, but my parents kept me going, and so did the doctors, and I had the surgery. ",然後我開始諗抑鬱症患者康復嘅方法 
"We live in the right time, even if it doesn't always feel like it."" ",我會由傳統治療開始 
"I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern, Western, middle-class thing, and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts, and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent. ",我知道只有少數治療 至可以對患者有幫助 好明顯係某幾種方法 有藥物治療 有一啲心理治療 仲可能有電痙攣療法 但其他方法都係冇用 
And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression. ,我發現咗一樣嘢 
And what I discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression. ,如果你有腦癌 而每朝倒立廿分鐘會令你感覺好啲 可能真係會畀你感覺好啲啦 但係你嘅腦癌從來都冇消失過 你最終都有可能死於腦癌 
"Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability, which is presumably evenly distributed in the population, and triggering circumstances, which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished. ",但如果你有抑鬱症 每日倒立廿分鐘 會畀你感覺好一啲， 噉就真係有效啦 因為抑鬱症係你認知上出現咗問題 你感覺好啲就代表咗你唔再係抑鬱 
"And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time, you think, ""Why do I feel like this? ",所以我開始接受其他唔同嘅治療 
"I must have depression."" ",然後我收到好多患者寄嚟嘅信 講有咩方法對佢哋奏效 
And you set out to find treatment for it. ,就好似今日噉就有人喺後台 問我藥物方面嘅嘢 
"But if you have a perfectly awful life, and you feel miserable all the time, the way you feel is commensurate with your life, and it doesn't occur to you to think, ""Maybe this is treatable."" ",一個女士曾經寫過一封我係最鐘意嘅 佢話佢曾經嘗試過治療、藥物 所有嘅嘢都試過曬 最後佢搵到一種方法，想我同大家分享 就係用毛冷整唔同嘅小飾物 
"And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people that's not being picked up and that's not being treated and that's not being addressed, and it's a tragedy of a grand order. ",（笑聲） 佢仲送咗啲佢整嘅作品 
"And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C., where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression, and then provided six months of the experimental protocol. ",（笑聲） 不過我宜家冇帶著佢哋 
"One of them, Lolly, came in, and this is what she said the day she came in. ",我叫佢睇一睇 心理醫學診斷同統計手冊裡面 有關強迫症嘅部分 
"She said, ""I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldn't go out of the house. ",當我搵其他治療嘅時候 我對佢哋了解深咗 
I have nothing to say to my children. ,我曾經去過塞內加爾 一個部落嘅驅邪儀式 儀式入面有好多公羊嘅血 我唔喺度描述啦 但幾年後我喺盧旺達參與另一項計畫 我要同人講我喺塞內加爾嘅經歷 佢話︰「嗰度係西非，你知嗎？ 我哋係喺東非， 我哋嘅儀式同佢哋嘅 喺幾方面都有好大分別， 但同時都有一啲相同嘅地方。 
"In the morning, I can't wait for them to leave, and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head, and three o'clock when they come home, it just comes so fast."" ",我話係呀 佢話佢哋同西方心理健康人員 有唔少麻煩 尤其係嗰啲喺種族屠殺之後嚟嘅人 
"She said, ""I've been taking a lot of Tylenol, anything I can take so that I can sleep more. ",我問︰「佢哋帶俾你咩麻煩？」 
"My husband has been telling me I'm stupid, I'm ugly. ",佢話︰「佢哋做啲嘢真係好好， 
"I wish I could stop the pain."" ",佢哋不但止冇帶病人曬太陽， 令病人感覺好啲， 
"Well, she was brought into this experimental protocol, and when I interviewed her six months later, she had taken a job working in childcare for the U.S. Navy, she had left the abusive husband, and she said to me, ""My kids are so much happier now."" ",佢哋仲冇打鼓或者播音樂， 令病人嘅血活起上嚟。 
"She said, ""There's one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls, but at night, they're just all up on my bed, and we're doing homework all together and everything. ",佢哋冇帶動成個社群， 
"One of them wants to be a preacher, one of them wants to be a firefighter, and one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer. ",佢哋冇將抑鬱症 講成係一種入侵性嘅惡靈。 
"They don't cry like they used to, and they don't fight like they did. ",佢哋反而將病人逐個帶入黑房， 由佢哋自己講返 佢哋經歷過痛苦嘅嘢。」 
"That's all I need now, is my kids. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 佢話 ︰「 我哋只好請佢哋離開國家。」 
"Things keep on changing, the way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act. ",（笑聲） 宜家講下其他另類療法 介紹一下 Frank Russakoff 
"I can go outside not being afraid anymore, and I don't think those bad feelings are coming back, and if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that, I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head, if I were still alive at all. ",Frank Russakoff 有好嚴重嘅抑鬱症 應該話我係從來未喺 任何一個男人身上見過嘅 
"I asked the Lord to send me an angel, and He heard my prayers."" ",佢成日抑鬱 
"I was really moved by these experiences, and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on, but also in an article, and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent. ",當我見佢嘅時候 佢每個月都要接受電擊治療 
"And I turned in my story, and my editor called me and said, ""We really can't publish this."" ",治療完之後嘅一個禮拜佢會覺得迷茫 
"And I said, ""Why not?"" ",之後第二個禮拜又會好返 
"And she said, ""It just is too far-fetched. ",跟著又會抑鬱 
These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley? ,噉樣嘅話佢又要去接受電擊治療 
"It's just too implausible."" ",當我見到佢，佢同我講 「我已經忍受唔到噉樣過日子， 
"She said, ""I've never even heard of anything like it."" ",我唔可以再繼續噉樣落去。 假如情況冇好轉，我知道點樣解決佢。」 
"And I said, ""The fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news."" ",佢又同我講︰「但係， 我聽過麻省總醫院有個療法叫做 扣帶回切開術， 係一種腦科手術， 我諗我可以試試。」 
"(Laughter) (Applause) ""And you are a news magazine."" ",我記得當時我好開心 因為一個人已經經歷過咁多 慘痛經歷、咁多唔同嘅治療 但佢內心仲抱著一絲嘅樂觀 佢願意再試多次 
"So after a certain amount of negotiation, they agreed to it. ",佢做咗個好成功嘅手術 
"But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment, the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities, that would be exploitative, because we would be changing them. ",宜家仲係我朋友 
"There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us, that treatment of depression, the medications and so on, are an artifice, and that it's not natural. ",佢有一個好老婆同兩個可愛嘅細路 
And I think that's very misguided. ,佢手術之後嘅聖誕節寫咗封信俾我 佢話︰ 「我老豆今年寄咗我兩份禮物， 第一份係 The Sharper Image 牌嘅 可捲動式 CD 架， 但我唔需要佢。 不過我知道佢送嚟係想 慶祝我可以獨立生活、 有自己鐘意嘅工。 
"It would be natural for people's teeth to fall out, but there is nobody militating against toothpaste, at least not in my circles. ",另一份禮物係我婆婆嘅相， 我婆婆死於自殺。 
"People then say, ""But isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience? ",當我拆禮物，我就喊咗出嚟， 然後我媽咪過嚟同我講︰ 『你係咪未見過婆婆而喊？』 我答︰『婆婆同我都有同樣嘅病。』 我喊係因為我寫俾你。 
Didn't we evolve to have depression? ,我唔係傷心， 而係我個腦太多嘢啦。 我覺得自己會自殺， 但父母同醫生支持我。 我做咗手術，我仲生存，我好感激。 
"Isn't it part of your personality?"" ",雖然有時感覺唔係活喺一個啱嘅年代， 我哋確實活喺一個啱嘅年代。」 
"To which I would say, mood is adaptive. ",我驚訝抑鬱症竟然 被認為係一種現代、西方、中產嘅嘢 於是我就睇下抑鬱症 喺其他唔同地方係點發生 我最感到興趣嘅係低下階層嘅抑鬱情況 
"Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have, that's incredibly valuable. ",所以我搵出針對窮人嘅抑鬱有乜係做咗 
And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken. ,我發現大多數有抑鬱症嘅窮人 都冇接受過治療 
It's maladaptive. ,抑鬱症係基因易受損嘅結果 呢種基因按理會喺 成個人口裡面平均分布 而發病情況，尤其窮人會相對嚴重 
"People will come to me and say, ""I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year, I think I can just get through this."" ",但實情係如果你有一個美好嘅生活 但一直覺得自己好淒慘 同埋問︰「點解我會有咁嘅感覺？ 
"And I always say to them, ""You may get through it, but you'll never be 37 again. ",我應該有抑鬱啦。」 
"Life is short, and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up. ",然後你去搵治療 
"Think it through."" ",但係如果你有一個好慘嘅人生 而你一直都覺得好慘 你慘嘅感覺同你慘嘅生活呼應 你唔會諗呢個病可以醫得好 
"It's a strange poverty of the English language, and indeed of many other languages, that we use this same word, depression, to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday, and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide. ",換句話講，我哋抑鬱國家 入面嘅貧窮人口 爆發咗一種流行病叫做抑鬱症 但冇人提過佢、冇人會醫過佢 冇人重視過佢 可以話係社會悲劇 
"People say to me, ""Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?"" ",所以我搵咗一個學者 佢進行梗一個 關於華盛頓外圍貧民區嘅研究 佢揀咗求診嘅女性做對象 呢啲女性係因為其他病至求診 但後來都發現到有抑鬱 於是班人得到六星期嘅試驗性治療 
"And I say, in a way it's continuous with normal sadness. ",Lolly 係其中一個參加嘅人 佢第一日入嚟就話佢係七個細路嘅母親 
"There is a certain amount of continuity, but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting, and what happens if you leave the house for 100 years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust. ",佢以前有做嘢，但佢宜家要放棄份工 「因為我出唔到間屋。 
"And it's that orange dust spot, that orange dust problem, that's the one we're setting out to address. ",我同細路冇嘢講。 
"So now people say, ""You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?"" ",朝早， 我唔可以等住佢哋走， 我只好返上床用被遮住個頭。 三點鐘當小朋友返到屋企， 我覺得時間過得好快。 
And I don't. ,佢仲話︰ 「我一直有食開 Tylenol， 任何可以畀我瞓耐啲嘅藥物。 
"But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch, and I don't feel sad about my answering machine, and I don't feel sad about taking a shower. ",我丈夫一直話我又蠢又醜， 
"I feel more, in fact, I think, because I can feel sadness without nullity. ",我希望痛楚可以停止。」 
"I feel sad about professional disappointments, about damaged relationships, about global warming. ",佢就係噉帶咗入嚟呢個試驗性嘅治療 六個月後我再同佢傾 佢已經喺一間美國海軍嘅托兒所度做 佢離開有暴力傾向嘅丈夫 佢話畀我知 佢啲細路比以前仲開心咗添 
Those are the things that I feel sad about now. ,佢間新屋入面整咗一間房專門俾男仔 仲有一間房專門俾女仔 「但係夜晚細路都去晒我張床， 我哋一齊做功課同埋其他嘢。 
"And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion? ",其中一個小朋友話想做牧師， 另一個想做消防員。 有個女話想做律師。 
How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through? ,佢哋唔似以前噉喊，同埋冇再打交。 
What is the mechanism of resilience? ,我宜家需要嘅就只係我小朋友。 
"And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience, and say, ""I was depressed a long time ago, I never want to think about it again, I'm not going to look at it and I'm just going to get on with my life,"" ironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have. ",事情一直喺度改變梗， 我著衫、我對事物嘅感覺， 仲有我平時嘅態度都有唔同。 
Shutting out the depression strengthens it. ,我可以行出門口而唔覺得驚。 我唔覺得以前唔好嘅感覺會返返嚟。 如果唔係 Miranda 醫生， 我可能仲要匿喺屋企用被襟著個頭。 如果我仲活著嘅話， 
"While you hide from it, it grows. ",我會問上帝派一隻天使嚟， 令佢可以聽到我嘅禱告。」 
And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition. ,佢嘅經驗令我非常感動 我決定將佢嘅經歷寫落嚟 唔只寫入我喺寫梗嘅一本書 仲會寫喺專欄裡面 同埋紐約時代雜誌邀請我 寫關於窮人嘅抑鬱症 
Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience. ,我就寫咗我遇過真實嘅故事 但編輯打嚟話︰ 「我哋登唔到噉樣嘅文章。」 
"So Frank Russakoff said to me, ""If I had a do-over, I suppose I wouldn't do it this way, but in a strange way, I'm grateful for what I've experienced. ",我話點解唔得？ 
I'm glad to have been in the hospital 40 times. ,佢話個故事太牽強啦 
"It taught me so much about love, and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me, and will be always."" ",「呢啲人係社會嘅最底層， 佢哋接受咗幾個月治療之後， 就可以去摩根史坦利返工？ 
"And Maggie Robbins said, ""I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic, and I would just talk and talk and talk, and the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive, and I thought, 'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.'"" (Laughter) ""And then I realized, I realized that they weren't going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk. ",簡直難以置信。」 
"It was simply going to be an occasion where I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying, but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were. ",佢話︰「我從來未聽過噉樣嘅嘢。」 
Our needs are our greatest assets. ,我話你冇聽過就代表咗 呢單係一單「新」聞 
"It turns out I've learned to give all the things I need."" ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 我仲話呢個係一間新聞雜誌社嚟架 
"Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse, but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate. ",噉傾咗一輪之後 佢哋同意刊登我嘅文章 
The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful. ,但我諗好多佢哋講嘅嘢都係好怪 同埋有偏見 佢哋覺得如果我哋去醫班窮人 就係剝削梗佢哋 原因係我哋會改變佢哋 
"It's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again, ""This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it."" ",呢啲虛偽嘅道德情操似乎無處不在 佢哋覺得抑鬱症嘅治療 藥物以至其他嘢 都係人工合成嘅、唔係自然嘅 
"I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be, how it can be more real than facts, and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. ",而我覺得佢哋係非常之誤導 
"The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and these days, my life is vital, even on the days when I'm sad. ",人隻牙脫落係正常不過嘅事 但唔會因為噉有人反對用牙膏 至少我圈子裏面嘅人冇 
"I felt that funeral in my brain, and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world, and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit. ",然後有人會話 抑鬱症唔係每個人都一定會經歷嘅嘢？ 
"I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again, I've found a way to love my depression. ",我哋唔係進化到有抑鬱症架咩？ 
I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. ,抑鬱症唔通唔係我哋性格嘅一部分？ 
"I love it because each day I decide, sometimes gamely, and sometimes against the moment's reason, to cleave to the reasons for living. ",噉我就會話，情緒係可以改嘅 
"And that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture. ",能夠有傷痛、恐懼、快樂、舒適 以及其他唔同嘅情緒 其實係非常珍貴嘅 
Thank you. ,抑鬱症係由於情緒系統崩潰 
(Applause) Thank you. ,係壞嘅轉變 
,有啲人走嚟同我講︰ 「如果我再撐多年， 我應該會走出抑鬱症。」 
Joe Kowan: I have stage fright. ,我一直同佢哋講︰ 「你可以走得返出嚟， 但你永遠唔會再係年輕。 
"I've always had stage fright, and not just a little bit, it's a big bit. ",人生短暫， 但你成年都喺度講想放棄。 
And it didn't even matter until I was 27. ,諗下啦。」 
"That's when I started writing songs, and even then I only played them for myself. ",英文入面關於抑鬱嘅字真係好少 其他語言都係噉 我哋用同一個字︰depression 去形容一個細路 喺佢生日嗰日遇到落雨時嘅感覺 同一個字會形容一個人自殺前嘅心情 
Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable. ,有啲人同我講︰ 「抑鬱係唔係平時傷心嘅延續？」 
"But after a couple of years, just writing songs wasn't enough. ",我話︰「可以係延續嘅， 抑鬱係有傷心嘅延續。」 
"I had all these stories and ideas, and I wanted to share them with people, but physiologically, I couldn't do it. ",打個比喻 你間屋出面道圍欄有一個好細嘅鏽跡 你可以磨佢然後再上漆 但如果你唔理間屋一百年 成個欄就會生鏽到剩返一堆橙色嘅鏽屑 
I had this irrational fear. ,就係開頭小小嘅生鏽我哋要去解決 
"But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced, the more I wanted to perform. ",所以宜家啲人話 「你食咗開心丸， 你會開心嗎？」 
"So on the week of my 30th birthday, I decided I was going to go to this local open mic, and put this fear behind me. ",對於我嚟講冇 
"Well, when I got there, it was packed. ",我唔會因為食晏而覺得傷心 我唔會因為我嗰電話答錄機而傷心 我唔會因為沖涼而傷心 
There were like 20 people there. ,我諗我感受到更多 因為我唔會冇嘢走去傷心 
(Laughter) And they all looked angry. ,我可以因為工作上嘅失望而傷心 或者因為轉壞嘅關係，又或者全球暖化 
"But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play, and I felt pretty good. ",呢啲嘢都係我宜家傷心嘅 
"Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn, when my whole body rebelled, and this wave of anxiety just washed over me. ",然後我同自己講，噉又點？ 
"Now, when you experience fear, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in. ",有更好生活嘅人，甚至有更嚴重抑鬱 係點樣走出嚟架呢？ 
"So you have a rush of adrenaline, your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster. ",對抗逆境個心理機制又係點架呢？ 
"Next your non-essential systems start to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter) So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities, so your fingers don't work anymore. ",我慢慢總結出否定過往有抑鬱嘅人 話自己好耐以前曾經抑鬱 但唔想諗返轉頭，唔再面對佢 只係想過好嘅生活 非常諷刺地 呢啲人卻係畀佢哋擁有嘅嘢控制咗 
"Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract, your Spidey sense tingles, basically your whole body is trigger-happy. (Laughter) That condition is not conducive to performing folk music. ",唔正視抑鬱症只會令得情況更加嚴重 
"(Laughter) I mean, your nervous system is an idiot. ",當你避佢，佢反而惡化 
"Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic? ",表現比較好嘅人反而會 接受佢哋有抑鬱症 
(Laughter) I have never been more terrified -- until now. ,肯面對抑鬱嘅人就會更堅強 
"(Laughter and cheers) So then it was my turn, and somehow, I get myself onto the stage, I start my song, I open my mouth to sing the first line, and this completely horrible vibrato -- you know, when your voice wavers -- comes streaming out. ",所以 Frank Russakoff 同我講︰ 「如果我可以再嚟一次， 我唔會揀呢條路， 我反而會揀一個唔尋常嘅方式。 我好感激我經歷過嘅嘢。 
"And this is not the good kind of vibrato, like an opera singer has, this is my whole body just convulsing with fear. ",我好開心我留過院四十次。 
"I mean, it's a nightmare. ",我留院學識咗乜係愛。 我同父母、醫生嘅關係 係以後都係最珍惜嘅。」 
"I'm embarrassed, the audience is clearly uncomfortable, they're focused on my discomfort. ",而 Maggie Robbins 話︰ 「我以前喺一個愛滋病嘅診所做義工。 我工作嘅時候，我會唔停咁講嘢。 我對著嘅人冇乜反應， 所以我就覺得佢哋唔係好友善。」 （笑聲） 「但我之後發覺， 佢哋除咗頭五分鐘嘅傾計之外， 
It was so bad. ,就唔想做其他嘢。 好似我冇愛滋病、唔使死， 但又可以接受到嗰啲人一樣， 
But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter. ,我哋嘅需求正正係我哋最大嘅本錢。 
And something good did happen -- I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for. ,我學識點樣放開我想要嘅嘢。」 
And I wanted more. But I knew I had to get past this nervousness. ,重視抑鬱症唔擔保抑鬱症唔會復發 但會令復發嘅心理準備 同復發本身都更容易去接受 
That night I promised myself: I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore. ,個意義唔係在於去搵抑鬱症嘅意義 或者覺得自己嘅抑鬱症好有意義 
"And I did. I went back every single week, and sure enough, week after week, it didn't get any better. The same thing happened every week. (Laughter) I couldn't shake it. ",而係當抑鬱症再嚟嘅時候 雖然好似好弊 但我會從中學到嘢 
And that's when I had an epiphany. ,由以前嘅抑鬱學到情緒可以有幾大 而又點樣可以比事實更加真實 經歷過之後，令我情緒正面嘅時候 我識得更加集中同投入咁感受正面情緒 
"And I remember it really well, because I don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter) All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness. ","抑鬱症嘅相反唔係快樂，係活力 而這些日子我的生命充滿活力, 就算傷心嘅時候都係 "
"That only seems authentic when I have stage fright, and the more nervous I was, the better the song would be. Easy. ",我腦入面感受到嗰場葬禮 我同一個巨人坐喺世界嘅邊緣 我發現自己內心嘅一啲嘢 以前我要呼喚內心 但直到廿年前嘅一日 地獄好似派咗使者嚟 之後我明白到所有嘢 我唔使再呼喚自己 
So I started writing a song about having stage fright. ,當我唔鐘意抑鬱、唔想再抑鬱嘅時候 我搵到一個愛上抑鬱症嘅方法 
"First, fessing up to the problem, the physical manifestations, how I would feel, how the listener might feel. ",我愛佢係因為佢令我去尋同埋堅持快樂 
"And then accounting for things like my shaky voice, and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal, because I was nervous. ",我愛佢因為我決定每日… 有時因為玩 有時因為喺嗰刻特登唱反調 去擁抱生存嘅理由 
"By having a song that explained what was happening to me, while it was happening, that gave the audience permission to think about it. ",呢樣嘢可喜可賀，亦係一份榮譽 
"They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous, they could experience that with me, and we were all one big happy, nervous, uncomfortable family. (Laughter) By thinking about my audience, by embracing and exploiting my problem, I was able to take something that was blocking my progress, and turn it into something that was essential for my success. ",多謝 
And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance. ,（掌聲） 
"And then I could move on, and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease. ",
"And eventually, over time, I didn't have to play the stage fright song at all. ",我好驚上台 
"Except for when I was really nervous, like now. (Laughter) Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you? ",唔係少少驚 係好驚 
(Applause) Can I have a sip of water? ,27歲以前都唔覺得有咩問題 
(Music) Thank you. ,直至我開始寫歌 我都只係彈俾自己聽 
"? I'm not joking, you know, ? ? this stage fright is real. ? ? And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ? ? well, you'll know how I feel. ? ? And the mistake I'd be making, ? ? the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ? ? As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ? ? well, you don't have to be. ? ? Well, maybe just a little bit. ? (Laughter) ? And maybe I'll try to imagine you all without clothes. ? ? But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows. ? ? Not to discuss this at length, ? ? but my body image was never my strength. ? ? So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ? ? I mean, you're not even really naked. ? ? And I'm the one with the problem. ? ? And you tell me, don't worry so much, you'll be great. ? ? But I'm the one living with me ? ? and I know how I get. ? ? Your advice is gentle but late. ? ? If not just a bit patronizing. ? ? And that sarcastic tone doesn't help me when I sing. ? ? But we shouldn't talk about these things right now, ? ? really, I'm up on stage, and you're in the crowd. Hi. ? ? And I'm not making fun of unnurtured, irrational fear, ? ? and if I wasn't ready to face this, ? ? I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ? ? But if I belt one note out clearly, ? ? you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ? ? And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ? ? my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ? ? But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ? ? my vocal cords movin', ? ? at speeds slightly faster than sound. ? (Applause) ",如果室友喺度，我就會就身唔自在 
,但寫咗歌幾年，發覺仲未夠 
"I had brain surgery 18 years ago, and since that time, brain science has become a personal passion of mine. ",我想將我嘅故事同想法話俾其他人知 但我生理上就係做唔到 
I'm actually an engineer. ,我有呢種唔合理嘅恐懼 
"And first let me say, I recently joined Google's Moonshot group, where I had a division, the display division in Google X, and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I joined Google and on the side outside of Google. ",但係我越寫得多，練習得越多 我就越想上台表演 
"So that said, there's a stigma when you have brain surgery. ",就喺30歲生日嗰個禮拜 我決定去參與呢個表演 同埋先擺低內心嘅恐懼 
Are you still smart or not? ,去到表演場地，見到爆滿 
"And if not, can you make yourself smart again? ",整整坐咗20人 
"After my neurosurgery, part of my brain was missing, and I had to deal with that. ",（笑聲） 佢哋睇嚟都好嬲 
"It wasn't the grey matter, but it was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters. ",我深呼吸，然後報名上台表演 我當時仲覺得唔錯 
"Immediately after my surgery, I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day, because if I just took nothing, I would die within hours. ",直至我上台前十分鐘 身體開始唔聽話，焦慮嘅情緒湧埋嚟 
"Every day now for 18 years -- every single day -- I've had to try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals, and try to get them, to stay alive. ",當你驚嘅時候，交感神經就會活躍 
There have been several close calls. ,腎上腺素急速增加，心跳加快 呼吸變得急促 
"But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart, so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn't a clear road map on this that's detailed. ",跟住落黎一啲唔重要嘅器官 好似消化系統，會停止運作 （笑聲） 口會乾，血液由身體盡頭流返去中央 所以你嘅手指唔聽使 
"I began to try different mixtures, and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self, my sense of who I was, my thinking, my behavior towards people. ",加上瞳孔放大，肌肉緊張 第六感有啲痛 成個身體隨時可以進入作戰狀態 （笑聲） 呢種狀態唔適合表演民謠歌曲 
"One particularly dramatic case: for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s, and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed. ",（笑聲） 其實神經系統好蠢 
"(Laughter) I was angry all the time, I thought about sex constantly, and I thought I was the smartest person in the entire world, and —(Laughter)— of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that, or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that. ",你話真係架？ 人類進化咗二十萬年 仲分唔到劍齒 定星期二夜晚開咪嘅廿個民謠歌手？ 
I was kind of extreme. ,（笑聲） 自從嗰次之後我都冇再咁驚 
"But to me, the surprise was, I wasn't trying to be arrogant. ",（笑聲同鼓勵） 然後到我表演 我上台開始唱 我唱第一句時 唱出嚟嘅係好多人驚嘅音 當你聲帶嗌 就唔會發出好聽嘅震音 
"I was actually trying, with a little bit of insecurity, to actually fix a problem in front of me, and it just didn't come out that way. ",就發唔到歌劇院歌手咁嘅聲線 好驚嘅我成個身都震 
So I couldn't handle it. ,簡直係一場惡夢 
I changed my dosages. ,我好尷尬，觀眾也唔係好舒服 佢哋留意著我嘅不安 
"But that experience, I think, gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through, and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then. ",情況壞到極點 
"What I was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery, my creative thought, my idea flow. ",但嗰次係我第一次唱住自已寫嘅歌 
"And I think mostly in images, and so for me that became a key metric -- how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping, if you will, my ideas, trying on different new ideas for size, playing out scenarios. ",好嘅係，我有望到觀眾一眼 令我同觀眾有交流 呢個係我一直想做嘅 
This kind of thinking isn't new. ,我仲想要更多 但我知道我一定要刻服緊張先 
Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes saw things similarly. ,所以嗰晚我決心要毎個禮拜都返去 直到我唔緊張為止 
They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing. ,我真嘅每個禮拜都返去表演 雖然每個禮拜都有去 但係情況冇改善。每個禮拜都舊態復發 （笑聲） 我仲係咁驚 
"There are those today that dispute that, and lots of debates about how the mind works, but for me it's simple: Mental images, for most of us, are central in inventive and creative thinking. ",有一日我突然感悟到啲嘢 
"So after several years, I tuned myself up and I have lots of great, really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them. ",我好記得呢次感悟，因為我好少會有感悟 （笑聲） 其實我只需要寫一首 關於自己恐懼嘅歌就得啦 
"And so now I'm working on, how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster? ",當我喺台上驚嗰陣 呢首歌就珍珠都冇咁真 我愈緊張，首歌就愈精彩，噉就容易啦 
"Can you imagine, if you will, a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her? ",所以我開始寫一首有關怯場嘅歌 
Or a musician to get the music out of his head? ,首歌開頭講我承認我嘅問題 身體反應點樣、我感覺點樣 觀眾感覺點樣 
There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed. ,跟著描述我顫抖嘅聲音 同埋我知道我到時會唱高半八度 因為我會好緊張 
"And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck in being able to do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems. ",用一首講述自己嘅歌 而歌詞裏面嘅嘢正正係發生梗嘅時候 觀眾就有想像嘅空間 
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups. ,佢哋唔需要因為我嘅緊張 而覺得唔係好好 佢哋可以感同身受 噉大家就可以成為一個快樂 緊張而唔太舒服嘅大家庭 （笑聲） 只要顧及觀眾，同擁抱、利用我嘅短處 我可以將一啲問題化為優勢 
"Both used fMRI technology -- functional magnetic resonance imaging technology -- to image the brain, and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues at Harvard. ",有咗呢首怯場嘅歌令我克服 初時表演最大嘅難題 
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image. ,然後就可以容易啲唱之後嘅歌 
"The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining, seeing that same image. ",最後，我連呢首怯場嘅歌都唔使唱啦 
"And the right column was created by subtracting the middle column from the left column, showing the difference to be nearly zero. ",但當然非常緊張嘅時候就例外 好似宜家咁 （笑聲） 你哋想我表演呢首歌嗎？ 
"This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result. ",（掌聲） 俾我飲啖水好唔好？ 
The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing. ,（音樂） 唔該 
"Next let me share with you one other experiment, this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley. ",♫ 你哋知道嗎，我唔係講笑 ♫ ♫ 我上台好驚係真嘅 ♫ ♫ 如果我一路震一路唱 ♫ ♫ 你就知道我嘅感受 ♫ ♫ 我會犯嘅錯 ♫ ♫ 因身體抖動引致嘅震音 ♫ ♫ 台下嘅你為我尷尬 ♫ ♫ 但你唔需要 ♫ ♫ 或者少少都得嘅 ♫ （笑聲） ♫ 或者我會想像你哋都冇著衫 ♫ ♫ 但係喺赤祼嘅人面前唱歌 會令我更驚 ♫ ♫ 呢樣就唔使多講 ♫ ♫ 但我嘅身體形象 永遠都唔係我嘅長處 ♫ ♫ 真心，我希望你哋都可以著衫 ♫ ♫ 我嘅意思係，你唔係真係赤祼 ♫ ♫ 我係有問題嗰個 ♫ ♫ 你叫我唔使擔心你會表演得好好 ♫ ♫ 但係我只係最終面對自己嘅人 ♫ ♫ 我知道我會點 ♫ ♫ 你嘅說話好好，可惜太遲啦 ♫ ♫ 若果唔係有啲哄騙 ♫ ♫ 諷刺嘅語氣對我嘅表演無補於事 ♫ ♫ 不過宜家我哋唔應該討論呢啲嘢 ♫ ♫ 因為講真嘅 我喺台上，你喺台下。你好呀 ♫ ♫ 而且我唔係用恐懼感黎開玩笑 ♫ ♫ 如果我仲未準備好面對佢 ♫ ♫ 我今日就唔會喺度 ♫ ♫ 如果我唱到明亮嘅音符 ♫ ♫ 你就知道我逐漸喺度復原 ♫ ♫ 或者下個禮拜，我會彈吉他 ♫ ♫ 我把聲會好似水咁清 而大家都會一齊唱 ♫ ♫ 但我宜家只想演奏 ♫ ♫ 同唱歌 ♫ ♫ 要比音速仲快 ♫ （掌聲） 
They've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields. ,
So let me set this up for you. ,我十八年前做過腦部手術 自從嗰次之後，腦科學就成為我嘅興趣 
"In this experiment, individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences. ",實際上我係一個工程師 
"Then a new movie was shown with new images, new people, new animals in it, and a new scan set was recorded. ",首先，我想講嘅係 最近我加入咗 Google 嘅月球探測器小組 喺入面我管理一個部門 係 Google X 嘅顯示器部門 今日我所講關於腦科學嘅研究 係我加入Google 之前做嘅研究 係喺 Google 出面做嘅 
"The computer, using brain scan data alone, decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing. ",所以當你要做腦部手術 會被人標籤 
"On the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess, and on the left-hand side, the presented clip. ",會俾人質疑你係咪仍然聰明 
This is the jaw-dropper. ,如果唔係嘅話 你可唔可以令你自己變返聰明 
We are so close to being able to do this. ,喺我做完神經外科手術之後 我冇咗大腦一部份 而我就要面對呢樣嘢 
We just need to up the resolution. ,唔係因為灰物質 而係又黏又軟嘅「死點」 「死點」係產生主要荷爾蒙 同神經傳遞素嘅地方 
"And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image, it creates the same brain scan. ",我一做完手術 就要打超過一打強力化學劑 仲要決定每隻每日要食幾多 因為如果我唔服用任何藥物 我會喺幾個小時內死亡 
"So this was done with the highest-resolution brain scan systems available today, and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years. ",我過去嘅十八年 每日我都要決定藥物嘅配搭 要配搭得啱先至可以生存落去 
Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse. ,曾經有幾次我瀕臨死亡邊緣 
How do we do that? ,但係好彩嘅係 我天生係一個玩試驗嘅人 所以我決定我要通過試驗 去發現更多適當嘅藥物劑量配搭 因為從來冇清晰嘅指引 
There's a lot of techniques in this approach. ,我開始嘗試唔同嘅配搭 而且我曾經怕只係少少劑量唔同 而令到自我意識、想法、對人嘅行為 有好大唔同 
One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes. ,一件特別喜劇性嘅事就係 我有幾個月喺度服食緊 20 歲青年 會用嘅藥物配方 然後對於自己食咗之後 思想出現改變而驚訝 
I'm not for that. ,（笑聲） 我嗰時一直都發脾氣 我成日都諗住「性」 而且我覺得我係世界上最聰明嘅人 仲有… （笑聲） 當然呢幾年嚟我遇過呢類型嘅人 或者比嗰啲冇咁極端嘅人 
"There's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed, some even by me, but given the recent success of MRI, first we need to ask the question, is it the end of the road with this technology? ",而我係極端嘅人 
"Conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets, but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements, not the thousandfold we need. ",但對於我嚟講 最驚訝嘅係我冇努力令自己傲慢 
"I'm putting forward an idea: instead of bigger magnets, let's make better magnets. ",實際上我喺度試下 冇咗少少嘅安全感會點 從而解決一個擺喺我面前嘅問題 不過事情發展唔係好似我所諗嘅 
"There's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets, and with these magnets, we can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain, and using those, we can actually create holographic-like interference structures to get precision control over many patterns, as is shown here by shifting things. ",我解決唔到 
"We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrangements, kind of like making Spirograph. ",我改變劑量 
So why does that matter? ,但係嗰次嘅經歷 我對人同佢哋經歷嘅嘢有新嘅認識 從此之後，我同男性容易相處好多 
"A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big, really huge magnets, right? ",我調較呢啲荷爾蒙同神經傳遞素就係想 恢復我患病前同手術前嘅智力 仲有恢復我嘅創意同思維 
But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the MRI systems. ,我係一個視覺型思考嘅人 所以影像就成為咗我依賴嘅嘢 點樣用用嚟快速定型 自己諗法嘅心理影像 去嘗試唔同嘅諗法 去模擬一下場景 
"Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field, put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies. ",呢種思維其實唔算新 
So by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan. ,哲學家，例如休謨、笛卡兒以及霍布斯 亦都有類似嘅觀點 
"And on top of that, we can then layer our ever-growing knowledge of brain structure and memory to create a thousandfold increase that we need. ",佢哋覺得心理影像同諗法 本質上係同一樣嘢 
"And using fMRI, we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow, but the hormones and neurotransmitters I've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity, which is the dream. ",今日會有人對呢種觀點有異議 亦都有好多辯論拗話意識點樣運作 但對我嚟講成件事好簡單啫 心理影像對於大多數我哋嚟講 都係創造力同創意思維嘅地方 
We're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media. ,所以幾年後我調整咗我自己 我得到好多好好 非常生動、精美嘅心理影像 同背後嘅分析 
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought? ,所以我宜家正喺度研究 點樣令我腦海呢啲心理影像 更快地顯示喺電腦屏幕上 
What would we be capable of then? ,唔知道你哋有冇諗過 一個電影導演能夠 剩係用佢嘅想像力指揮成個世界？ 
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought? ,或者一個音樂家可以 將佢腦入邊嘅歌搬出嚟 
You think the Internet was big. ,如果呢樣嘢可以俾創意嘅人 用光速分享佢哋唸嘅嘢 呢樣嘢係無限可能 
These are huge questions. ,事實上要完成呢個可能性所遇到嘅瓶頸 就係提升腦掃描系統嘅解像度 
It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills. ,宜家等我用最近兩個實驗話俾你聽 點解我哋就快可以跨過呢個樽頸啦 呢兩個實驗係由 兩個最頂尖嘅神經科學小組做 
"And indeed, this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases. ",佢哋都用咗 fMRI 技術 即係功能性磁力共振造影技術 掃描大腦 呢張係哈佛大學嘅 Giorgio Ganis 同佢嘅同事 製成大腦掃描圖 
We have little option but to open this door. ,左邊係當一個人睇圖片時嘅腦部情況 
"Regardless, pick a year -- will it happen in five years or 15 years? ",中間係同一個人諗返嗰張圖片時 腦部嘅情況 
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer. ,右邊係左邊幅圖減去中間幅圖得出嘅 兩者幾乎冇分別 
We need to learn how to take this step together. ,同一個實驗無論係 用唔同人、唔同嘅相都得出同一個結果 
Thank you. ,所以睇一個影像同想像嗰一個影像 其實係沒有分別嘅 
(Applause) ,我再講多一個實驗 呢個實驗係嚟自 Jack Gallant 喺加州大學柏克萊分校嘅實驗室 
,佢哋能夠將腦電波轉做可認知嘅影像 
The 2011 Arab Spring captured the attention of the world. ,等我準備好先 
"It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries, who were worried that revolution would spread. ",喺實驗裏面 參加者要睇好幾百小時嘅 YouTube 影片 同時佢哋腦部會被掃描 用嚟整一個有關佢哋腦部 對影片次序嘅反應嘅大型資料庫 
"To respond, they ramped up surveillance of activists, journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries. ",跟住一條新影片會播俾佢哋睇 裏面有新圖片、新人物、新動物 仲會有新嘅掃描 
"One prominent Bahraini activist, who was arrested and tortured by his government, has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages. ",電腦運用腦部掃描數據 嚟解讀新嘅大腦掃描 然後電腦顯示佢認為 參加者實際睇到嘅嘢 
"Of course, it's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages. ",右手邊你會睇到嚟自電腦嘅推算 左邊就係實際上放映嘅片 
It's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone. ,呢個結果真係令人呆咗 
"Instead, they use tools like Skype, which they think are immune to interception. ",我哋嘅技術已經非常接近 
They're wrong. ,我哋只需要提高解像度 
"There have now been over the last few years an industry of companies who provide surveillance technology to governments, specifically technology that allows those governments to hack into the computers of surveillance targets. ",而且記住當你睇到一個圖像嘅時候 同你想像同一個圖像嘅時候 你嘅大腦都會產生相同嘅掃描圖 
"Rather than intercepting the communications as they go over the wire, instead they now hack into your computer, enable your webcam, enable your microphone, and steal documents from your computer. ",大腦掃描講緊已經係用緊 最高像素嘅大腦掃描系統 近幾年大腦掃描系統嘅解像度 提高咗一千倍 
"When the government of Egypt fell in 2011, activists raided the office of the secret police, and among the many documents they found was this document by the Gamma Corporation, by Gamma International. ",下一步就係再提升解像度一千倍 令我哋可以睇到更深入嘅嘢 
Gamma is a German company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments. ,我哋點樣做好？ 
It's important to note that most governments don't really have the in-house capabilities to develop this software. ,有好多技術可以做到 
"Smaller ones don't have the resources or the expertise, and so there's this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price. ",其中一個方法係撬開你嘅頭顱 然後擺電極入去 
Gamma is just one of these companies. ,但我唔贊成呢種做法 
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government. ,宜家已經有好多造影技術提出咗 有啲我都有份提出 但因為宜家 MRI 技術嘅成功 我哋首先要諗一個問題 呢種技術係咪已經過時呢？ 
"They'd sent them an invoice for a sale, but the Egyptians never bought it. ",傳統理論嚟講 唯一能夠提高解像度嘅方法 係採用更加大嘅磁鐵 但係更大嘅磁鐵 只係提高解像度少少 而唔能夠達到我哋需要嘅好一千倍 
"Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma's software. ",我諗與其用大舊磁鐵 不如改善磁鐵嘅質素 
(Laughter) So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced. ,宜家納米科學有新嘅突破 新技術可以用喺新型磁鐵嘅構造上面 有咗呢啲磁鐵 我哋可以做到非常仔細 睇曬成個大腦嘅磁場造影 用呢啲工具 我哋可以整到全息樣嘅干預結構 嚟準確控制好多病情 就好似呢度見到嘅影像轉換咁 
"Really, they're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air-conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it's going on. ",我哋可以整到更複雜 帶有少少唔同排列方式嘅結構 有啲似生產呼吸運動記錄器 
"You know, your webcam light won't turn on. ",噉點解呢個會咁重要？ 
There's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled. ,過去幾年喺 MRI 嘅努力 一直係整更大嘅磁鐵，係吧 
This is the managing director of Gamma International. ,但係至今大部份解像度嘅增加 都係嚟自MRI 系統 FM 無線電頻發射器同接收器裡面 非常勁嘅加密同解密方法 
His name is Martin Muench. ,與其用均勻磁場 同埋喺 FM 無線頻率之外 不如用有結構嘅磁模板 
There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist. ,所以我哋通過結合磁規律 同 FM 無線電頻處理嘅規律嚟 大幅度增加一個掃描 入面可以獲得嘅資訊 
This is perhaps my favorite. ,除此之外 因為關於大腦結構 同記憶嘅知識不斷增加 我哋可以做到 需要嘅千倍解像度增加 
I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam. ,運用 fMRI 我哋應該可以量度 唔單止含氧血嘅流量 以至我之前所講嘅荷爾蒙同神經傳遞素 可能甚至係直接嘅神經活動 ——我哋想做到嘅一個夢想 
You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera. ,我哋將來可以直接將我哋嘅想法 轉落去數碼媒體 
"He knows what kind of surveillance is possible, and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used against him. ",你可唔可以想像到 如果我哋唔需要用語言 只需要用大腦嘅思想 兩個人都可以傾到計？ 
Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles. ,我哋如果真係咁嘅話可以做到啲咩？ 
"Of course, he's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments, he has no way of knowing how it can be used. ",我哋應該點樣面對 每個人未經過濾嘅諗法？ 
"Gamma's software has been located on servers in countries around the world, many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations. ",你認為網絡係好大 
They really are selling their software around the world. ,但呢啲都係需要認真研究嘅問題 
Gamma is not the only company in the business. ,可能網絡真係一個好吸引嘅工具 去加強我哋思考同溝通嘅技巧 
"As I said, it's a $5 billion industry. ",的而且確，相同嘅工具 磁力造影將會證明可以用於 阿爾海默症以及相關疾病嘅治療 
One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team. ,我哋冇其他太多辦法，只有行呢條路 
"Now, Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation. ",唔理點樣，或者有一年 呢個治療技術會唔會 5 年或者 15 年之內發生？ 
"The video they've produced is very sexy, and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients. ",如果要用更多時間就有啲失望 
(Video) Narrator: You want to look through your target's eyes. ,我哋需要一齊去實現佢 
(Music) You have to hack your target. ,多謝 
"[""While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders""] You have to hit many different platforms. ",（掌聲） 
"[""Windows, OS X, iOS, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Linux""] You have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data. ",
"[Skype &amp; encrypted calls, target location, messaging, relationships, web browsing, audio &amp; video""] Being stealth and untraceable. ",2011 年阿拉伯之春引起世界嘅關注 
"[""Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure""] Deployed all over your country. ",亦都引起其他國家獨裁政府嘅警覺性 佢哋擔心運動會蔓延 
"[""Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot""] Exactly what we do. ",為咗應對 佢哋加強對社會運動人士、 記者同異議分子嘅監控 佢哋驚呢班人會喺自己國家裏面 引發一場革命 
"Christopher Soghoian: So, it would be funny if it wasn't true, but, in fact, Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world. ",一個巴林出名嘅社運人士 被政府拘捕同虐待 佢話，問話嘅人俾佢睇 佢電話嘅通話內容同短訊內容 
"Last year we learned, for example, that it's been used to target Moroccan journalists by the Moroccan government. ",當然 政府能夠截聽電話同埋短訊 早已經唔係咩秘密 
"Many, many countries it's been found in. ",正因為係咁 好多社運人士都避免用電話 
"So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market. ",佢哋會用类似 Skype 嘅工具 因為佢哋認為咁樣就唔會俾人截聽到 
"In the last year or so, the company has opened a sales office in Maryland. ",但佢哋錯啦 
The company has also hired a spokesperson. ,从前幾年開始 已經有好多公司向政府提供監控技術 尤其係 俾政府可以入侵監察對象電腦嘅科技 
They've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up. ,由佢哋以前喺線路中間一半截聽通訊 改為宜家直接入侵你嘅電腦 启动你嘅網絡攝錄機、麥克風 盜取你電腦裡邊嘅文件 
They've spoken at the conferences. ,當埃及政府喺 2011 年倒台時 社運人士搜查咗秘密警察嘅辦公室 喺好多文件裏面 發現一份嚟自 Gamma International 旗下子公司 Gamma Corporation 嘅文件 
What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. ,Gamma International 係一間德國公司 佢研發監控軟件同埋剩係向政府售卖 
"I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team has sold their technology in the United States, but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it, it isn't because they haven't been trying hard. ",值得注意嘅係 大部分政府本身係冇能力開發呢啲軟件 
"So as I said before, governments that don't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off-the-shelf surveillance software, and so for that reason, you see that the government of, say, Tunisia, might use the same software as the government of Germany. ",更細規模嘅政府更加冇 咁樣嘅資源同人才 因此 西方企業好樂意提供呢啲工具同技術 以換取收入 
They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff. ,Gamma 只係其中一間咁樣嘅公司 
"The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology, and so for several years, I've been trying to figure out if and how the FBI is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets. ",我亦都要強調事實上 Gamma 從來冇賣軟件俾埃及政府 
My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation -- they're a civil society group — obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. ,佢哋有寄過報價嘅發票 但係埃及從來冇買過 
"Most of these documents were heavily redacted, but what you can see from the slides, if I zoom in, is this term: Remote Operations Unit. ",好明顯 埃及政府係用紧 Gamma 嘅免費試用版 
"Now, when I first looked into this, I'd never heard of this unit before. ",（笑聲） 呢個截圖係嚟自 Gamma 銷售推廣嘅片 
I've been studying surveillance for more than six years. ,佢哋喺呢個比較簡潔流暢嘅影片裏面強調 其實警察坐喺冷氣辦公室 就能夠遙控地監控著某人 而被監聽嘅人係唔知情嘅 
I'd never heard of it. ,你知嗎？ 網絡攝錄機嘅燈唔會著 
"And so I went online and I did some research, and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn, the social networking site for job seekers. ",唔會有嘢話你知個麥克風被人開咗 
"There were lots of former U.S. government contractors who had at one point worked for the Remote Operating Unit, and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs what they had done in their former job. ",呢位係 Gamma International 嘅董事總經理 
"(Laughter) So I took this information and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal, and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets. ",Martin Muench 
"Like Gamma and Hacking Team, the FBI also has the capability to remotely activate webcams, microphones, steal documents, get web browsing information, the works. ",佢出現過喺好多相裏邊 
"There's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking, and that's that terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers, journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers. ",呢張係我最鍾意嘅 
There's no drug dealer phone and there's no journalist laptop. ,我哋放大佢嘅網絡攝錄機 
"We all use the same technology, and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys, they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too. ",可以見到有一張細黐紙 黐咗喺攝錄機度 
So governments around the world have been embracing this technology. ,佢知道有咩監控係可能發生嘅 所以好明顯佢唔希望咁樣嘅嘢 發生喺佢自己身上 
"They've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique, but without any real debate. ",Martin 話 佢希望佢嘅軟件 可以用嚟捉恐怖分子 或者搵出戀童癖嘅藏身之處 
"In the United States, where I live, there have been no congressional hearings. ",當然 佢都承認呢個軟件賣咗俾政府之後 佢哋點樣用就唔知啦 
"There's no law that's been passed specifically authorizing this technique, and because of its power and potential for abuse, it's vital that we have an informed public debate. ",全世界好多伺服器都裝咗 Gamma 個軟件 好多伺服器都有驚人嘅追蹤紀錄 同埋好多都違反人權 
Thank you very much. ,佢哋真係做到銷售全球化 
,Gamma 唔係唯一一個咁嘅公司 
"I was born and raised in Sierra Leone, a small and very beautiful country in West Africa, a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent. ",好似我話齋 呢個係一個價值五十億美元嘅行業 
"However, Sierra Leone is infamous for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s when entire villages were burnt down. ",呢行嘅另一間大公司係 義大利嘅 Hacking Team 
"An estimated 8,000 men, women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time. ",今日嚟講 呢家公司做嘅匯報可能係最簡潔流暢 
"As my family and I ran for safety when I was about 12 from one of those attacks, I resolved that I would do everything I could to ensure that my own children would not go through the same experiences we had. ",佢哋整嘅宣傳片非常有吸引力 我一陣間會播出嚟 令你哋感受下呢間公司嘅軟件有幾勁 以及係佢哋係點樣向政府推銷呢件產品 
"They would, in fact, be part of a Sierra Leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power. ",(影片嘅聲音) 錄音︰你想睇你監控對象睇梗啲乜 
"As I watched people who I knew, loved ones, recover from this devastation, one thing that deeply troubled me was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses. ",(音樂) 你要攻擊你個對象 
"The reason, I would come to find out, was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well. ",[「當你監控對象喺度上網、 交換文件、收短訊、過境」] 你必須要攻入好多唔同嘅平台 
"The prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb, and which connects to the prosthetic ankle. ","[「Windows, OS X, iOS, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Linux」] 你必須要克服加密嘅問題以獲取相關資料 "
"Even in the developed world, it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket, if ever. ",[「Skype 以及已加密嘅通話 目標位置、短訊、 關係、 網頁瀏覽、錄音及影片」] 隱形而冇被偵測到 
Prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create single-material prosthetic sockets. ,[「對任何保護系統都有抗禦能力」] [「隱藏嘅資料收集設施」] 遍佈全國 
"Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient, leaving them with pressure sores and blisters. ",[「一個設施可以監控數以千計嘅目標」] 正係我哋做嘅嘢 
It does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is. ,講者：如果頭先講嘅嘢係虛構 噉就幾搞笑啦 但事實上 駭客團隊嘅軟件係賣俾全世界嘅政府 
"If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable, you will not use your leg, and that is just simply unacceptable in our age. ",舉個例 舊年我哋至知摩洛哥政府 一直用呢個科技監控記者 
"So one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr about two and a half years ago, and he asked me if I knew how to solve this problem, I said, ""No, not yet, but I would love to figure it out."" ",好多國家都有類似嘅情況 
"And so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab, I designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses. ",所以 駭客團隊都留意 美國司法管轄地方嘅市場 
"I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy, then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces, and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture. ",舊年左右呢間公司 喺維珍妮亞州或者馬里蘭州 
We use a 3D printer to create a multi-material prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient. ,開設銷售辦公室 仲請咗一名發言人 
"In short, we're using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply. ",佢哋有參與監控業界嘅研討會 執法官員都有出席 
"In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab, one of our patients, a U.S. veteran who has been an amputee for about 20 years and worn dozens of legs, said of one of our printed parts, ""It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows, and it's effing sexy."" ",佢哋有喺研討會度發言 
(Laughter) Disability in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives. ,我覺得最得意嘅係 佢哋今年初喺其中一個 有關執法嘅會議裏面贊助咗休息時間 
My hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them. ,我唔可以好肯定咁話你知駭客團隊 有冇賣咗佢哋嘅科技俾美國政府 但我可以話俾你聽 如果佢哋冇賣到 唔係因為佢哋冇努力推銷 
"For me, a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies. ",正如我之前所講 冇資源開發軟件嘅政府 會買呢啲上咗架嘅監控軟件 正因為咁 你會見到，譬如，突尼斯政府 可能會同德國政府一樣用同一款軟件 
"Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston, I hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential. ",佢哋都係買貨架上嘅軟件 
Thank you very much. ,美國聯邦調查局 FBI 有筆預算去研發佢哋 自己一套嘅監控技術 於是呢幾年嚟 我嘗試搵出 FBI 有冇真係入侵 同埋點樣入侵監控對象嘅電腦 
,我有個朋友喺電子領域基金會度做 呢個基金會一個民間組織 佢哋攞咗好多 FBI 嘅文件 裏邊寫低 FBI 下一代嘅監聽科技會係點 
"There's a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8, 2009. ",呢啲文件大多數內容都俾人大執過 但若果我放大熒幕上面嘅嘢 你會見到呢行字： 遠端營運單位 
"On that day, a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials, a group of Afghan government officials, who would be meeting with some local village elders. ",當我第一次見到呢樣嘢 我從來未聽過呢個單位 
"The column came under ambush, and was surrounded on three sides, and amongst many other things, Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead. ",我已經研究咗監控呢樣嘢超過六年啦 
"One of the people he rescued was a sergeant, and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter. ",但我由未聽過呢個單位 
"And what was remarkable about this day is, by sheer coincidence, one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. ",於是我上網搵 最後我搵到答案 就係我上 Linkedin 一個求職者嘅社交網站嗰時 
It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck. ,嗰度有好多美國政府嘅前合約僱員 佢哋都曾經都喺 呢個遠端營運單位裏面做 佢哋仲係履歷上面詳細描述 佢哋做呢份工嗰陣做過啲乜 
"They put him in the helicopter, and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more. ",(笑聲) 我將呢啲資料 交俾一個我識得同信得過嘅 華爾街日報記者 佢聯絡咗一啲前執法人員 佢哋喺背後承認同證實 FBI 的確有一個專責單位 入侵監控對象嘅電腦 
"I saw this, and I thought to myself, where do people like that come from? ",好似 Gamma 同駭客團隊噉 FBI 都有能力 遙控啟動網絡攝錄機、麥克風 去偷文件、攞上網紀錄、電腦檔案 
"What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion, when you would want to do that. ",政府入侵電腦係一個大問題 恐怖分子、戀童癖嘅人 毒販、記者同埋從事人權運動嘅人 全部都用同一款電腦 
"There's a love there, and I wanted to know why is it that I don't have people that I work with like that? ",嗰度冇專為毒販而設嘅電話 冇專為記者而設嘅手提電腦 
"You know, in the military, they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. ",我哋都係梗用同一種科技 咁代表咗 政府有能力入侵真正壞人嘅電腦 同時政府都有能力入侵我哋嘅電腦 
"In business, we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain. ",所以全世界嘅政府都好鍾意用呢種技術 
We have it backwards. Right? ,佢哋鍾意將監控當係一種執法工具 但啲人從來冇辯論過呢樣嘢 
"So I asked myself, where do people like this come from? ",喺美國，我生活嘅國家 國會從來冇聽證過 
And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people. ,或者冇通過任何嘅法律 明確授權政府使用呢種技術 鑒於監控力量之大同埋有可能被濫用 我哋必須要有一場公開辯論 等公眾知道呢回事 
That's why they're attracted to the military. ,多謝晒 (掌聲) 
These better people are attracted to this concept of service. ,
But that's completely wrong. ,我喺塞拉里昂出世長大 塞拉里昂係一個 位於西非嘅，細但美麗嘅國家 塞拉里昂擁有 豐富嘅天然資源同創新人才 
"What I learned was that it's the environment, and if you get the environment right, every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things, and more importantly, others have that capacity too. ",但係，塞拉里昂唔出名 原因係九十年代 打咗十年嘅反抗戰爭 全部村莊都被燒毀 
"I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these, who we would call heroes, who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others, and I asked them, ""Why would you do it? ",據統計大約八千名男人、女人同兒童 喺戰爭期間失去手同腳 
"And they all say the same thing: ""Because they would have done it for me."" ",我同家庭喺我十二歲嗰年 遇到嘅一次襲擊之後走難 嗰陣我決定要盡一切辦法 令自己嘅小朋友 唔需要再經歷我哋曾經經歴過嘅苦痛 
It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation. ,塞拉里昂嘅兒童 唔會再經歷呢啲慘痛嘅事 塞拉里昂再唔會 有人靠發動戰爭同殘害他人身體去奪權 
So trust and cooperation are really important here. ,當我望著我識得嘅、鍾意嘅人 戰後過返正常生活 有一件事情深深咁困擾著我 塞拉里昂有好多傷殘嘅人唔用義肢 
"The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings, they are not instructions. ",我後嚟發現佢哋唔用義肢嘅原因 係由於義肢嘅穿戴嘅地方 唔係好套到落隻腳到而造成痛楚 
"I can't simply say to you, ""Trust me,"" and you will. ",義肢嘅穿戴嘅地方係 殘疾人士嘅腳套入去義肢嘅地方 噉義肢另一端就係腳跟關節 
"I can't simply instruct two people to cooperate, and they will. ",即使喺發達國家 病人都需要三星期至幾年嘅時間 至會達到一個舒適嘅義肢穿戴狀態 
It's not how it works. It's a feeling. ,義肢矯形師仍然用梗傳統方法 好似塑模同鑄造 加上用單一物料，製成義肢穿戴嘅凹位 
So where does that feeling come from? ,噉樣嘅凹位往往向病人隻腳 施加好大嘅壓力 因為噉而生咗褥瘡同水泡 
"If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era, to the early days of Homo sapiens, what we find is that the world was filled with danger, all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us. ",就算義肢腳跟關節好有力都係咁話 
Nothing personal. ,如果義肢穿戴嘅凹位唔舒服 你會唔想行 凹位唔舒服喺宜家嚟講係唔可以接受嘅 
"Whether it was the weather, lack of resources, maybe a saber-toothed tiger, all of these things working to reduce our lifespan. ",咁有一日，大概兩年半之前 我遇到 Hugh Herr 教授 佢問我係咪知道點樣解決呢個問題 我話：冇，仲未呀 但我好鍾意解決咗佢 
"And so we evolved into social animals, where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe, where we felt like we belonged. ",喺我麻省理工學院 媒體實驗室嘅博士學位裏面 我設計咗個自選嘅義肢套 又快又平 相對傳統義肢，新義肢更加舒服 
"And when we felt safe amongst our own, the natural reaction was trust and cooperation. ",我利用磁力共振掌握病人腳部嘅構造 然後通過有限單元模型更加精準咁預測 喺正向力嘅情況下內部嘅壓力同張力 然後鑄造一個義肢套嘅模，用嚟生產 
There are inherent benefits to this. ,我哋利用一台 3D 打印機嚟整出 一個由複合材料製成嘅義肢套 佢能夠減輕傷殘人士身體嘅壓力 
It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger. ,即係話，我哋通過收集人體工學嘅資料 又平又快咁製造義肢套 
"If we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you, that means you won't watch for danger. ",最近一次喺媒體實驗室裡面 完成嘅試驗當中 我哋其中一位病人 佢係一個切肢已經廿年 著過幾打義肢嘅美國退役軍人 佢話我哋其中一件打印製成品 好柔軟，好似喺枕頭上面行路一樣 而且係抵死嘅性感 
Bad system of survival. ,（笑聲） 殘疾喺我哋今日嘅情況嚟講 唔應該阻到任何人過有意義嘅生活 
The modern day is exactly the same thing. ,我希望我哋喺研究小組裏面 開發嘅工具同發展嘅步驟 可以向需要嘅人提供高性能嘅義肢 
"The world is filled with danger, things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success, reduce our opportunity for success. ",對於我嚟講 要醫好因戰爭同疾病而受傷嘅靈魂 首先就要係為佢哋 整一個舒適、可負擔嘅活動輔助工具 
"It could be the ups and downs in the economy, the uncertainty of the stock market. ",無論係塞拉里昂或者波士頓 我希望呢個研發唔單止恢復 仲可以改變佢哋嘅潛能 
It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight. ,多謝 （掌聲） 
Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you. ,
"It's sometimes trying to put you out of business, but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you. ",最近 William Swenson 隊長 由於佢喺 2009 年 9 月 8 日嘅表現 獲國會頒授榮譽勳章 
We have no control over these forces. ,就喺嗰日 一班美國同阿富汗軍人組成嘅步隊 經過阿富汗一個地方 去保護一班阿富汗政府官員 班官員正係前往 同當地一啲村落長老見面 
"These are a constant, and they're not going away. ",呢一步隊中途遇到埋伏 被人三面包圍 當中隊長 William Swenson 喺駁火其間衝入去救受傷嘅戰友 同埋拖返死咗嘅戰友出嚟 
"The only variable are the conditions inside the organization, and that's where leadership matters, because it's the leader that sets the tone. ",其中一個被佢救出嚟嘅係一位軍士 佢同另一個冇受傷嘅士兵 帶住軍士行去一架醫療直升機 
"When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first, to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results, so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong, remarkable things happen. ",嗰日之所以特別係因為 咁啱嗰日其中一位救護人員 頭盔上有一個 GoPro 牌嘅攝錄機 架機錄低成個畫面 
"I was flying on a trip, and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called, and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law, like a criminal. ",畫面中隊長 William Swenson 同佢嘅隊員 將呢位頸中咗槍嘅士兵帶返嚟 
He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon. ,佢哋將呢位士兵運到直升機上 然後睇到隊長 William Swenson 彎低身 錫咗呢位士兵一啖 然後返返去救更多受傷嘅戰友 
So I said something. ,睇到呢樣之後，我沉思 好似 William Swenson 嘅人 喺邊度嚟嘅呢？ 
"I said, ""Why do you have treat us like cattle? ",乜嘢令佢有咁嘅舉動？ 就係深層嘅情感 就係當你想做某樣嘢嘅時候就會有 
"Why can't you treat us like human beings?"" ",呢種情感裏面係有愛 我想知道點解同我共事嘅人裏面 冇好似佢一樣嘅人？ 
And this is exactly what she said to me. ,你知啦，軍隊裏面 獎牌係俾嗰啲捨己為人嘅人 
"She said, ""Sir, if I don't follow the rules, I could get in trouble or lose my job."" ",喺商場上，獎金係俾嗰啲損人利己嘅人 
All she was telling me is that she doesn't feel safe. ,我哋倒返轉做。係嗎？ 
All she was telling me is that she doesn't trust her leaders. ,所以我問自己 
The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people. ,好似佢一樣嘅人喺邊度嚟架？ 我開頭嘅結論係 佢哋心地只係比一般人好 
It's because they don't fear their leaders. ,就係點解軍隊吸引佢哋嘅原因 
"You see, if the conditions are wrong, we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other, and that inherently weakens the organization. ",呢啲人更講求服務精神 
"When we feel safe inside the organization, we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities. ",但呢一個諗法係完全錯嘅 
"The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is, is like being a parent. ",我所學到嘅係，係環境導致噉樣嘅情況 如果將個環境較返啱 任何人都可以好似佢咁 做到呢啲咁有愛心嘅嘢 而更重要嘅係，其他人都會變得有愛心 
"If you think about what being a great parent is, what do you want? What makes a great parent? ",我好榮幸有機會見到佢哋其中一啲人 我哋稱之為英雄嘅人 佢哋唔理自己生命去拯救其他人 我會問佢哋 「點解你會噉樣做？」 
"We want to give our child opportunities, education, discipline them when necessary, all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves. ",佢哋所有人都講咗同一個理由： 「 因為佢哋都會噉樣對我 」 
Great leaders want exactly the same thing. ,呢個就係信任同合作嘅精神 
"They want to provide their people opportunity, education, discipline when necessary, build their self-confidence, give them the opportunity to try and fail, all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves. ",因此，信任同合作喺呢度係非常重要 
"Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City, a tech company, he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family, would you ever consider laying off one of your children? ",問題係，信任同合作係講緊感覺 而唔係指令 
We would never do it. ,我冇可能同你講，「 信我呀 」 然後你就會信我 
Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization? ,我冇可能叫兩個人合作，佢哋就會合作 
Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment. ,信唔係咁樣 佢係講感覺 
"If you get a job at Next Jump, you cannot get fired for performance issues. ",噉呢種感覺係點樣嚟嘅呢？ 
"In fact, if you have issues, they will coach you and they will give you support, just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school. ",如果我哋返到五萬年前 舊石器時代嗰陣、人類起源嘅時候 我哋會發現，成個世界充滿危險 所有呢啲危險嘅力量 都好似要趕絕人類噉 
It's the complete opposite. ,冇嘢係私人嘅 
"This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred, anger, at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures. ",無論係天氣、資源缺乏 或者一隻劍齒虎 所有呢啲嘢都會縮短人類嘅壽命 
It's not the numbers. ,所以，人類進化成群居動物 我哋住埋一齊、一齊做嘢 就係咁部落成為咗一個安全嘅環境 就係呢個部落，我哋搵到歸屬 
It's that they have violated the very definition of leadership. ,當我哋喺其他人當中感到安全嘅時候 最本能夠嘅反應就係發展信任同合作 
They have violated this deep-seated social contract. ,信任同合作有本質嘅好處 
"We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests, or worse, they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests. ",我意思係我哋夜晚就可以瞓得著 同埋會放心部落裏邊嘅人 幫我哋提防危險 
"This is what so offends us, not the numbers. ",如果我哋彼此唔信任，如果我唔信任你 啫係話你唔保護我哋安全 
Would anybody be offended if we gave a $150 million bonus to Gandhi? ,噉就會係一個非常差劣嘅生存模式 
How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa? ,現代社會也係一樣 
Do we have an issue with that? None at all. ,呢個世界充滿危險 好多嘢都喺度糟蹋我哋生活 阻止我哋嘅成功、減少我哋嘅成功率 
None at all. ,危險可以係經濟嘅波動 股票市場唔穩定 
Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers. ,或者會有一個新技術 令你嘅商業模式喺一夜之間過時 
They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people. ,或者係你嘅競爭對手硬係想將你打敗 
"Bob Chapman, who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller, in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession, and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight. ",有時可能係試圖將你由商場上面淘汰 但係至少佢哋會盡一切辦法 阻止你嘅業務增長、搶你嘅生意 
"Now in a large manufacturing company, this is a big deal, and they could no longer afford their labor pool. ",我哋只係唔能夠控制呢啲危險嘅力量 
"They needed to save 10 million dollars, so, like so many companies today, the board got together and discussed layoffs. ",佢哋永恆存在、唔會消失 
And Bob refused. ,唯一可以改變嘅就係組織裏面嘅情況 亦啫係領袖發揮作用嘅地方 因為係領袖決定成個調子 
"You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts. ",當一個領袖選擇 將組織入面嘅人嘅安全同生命 放喺第一位嘅時候 即使噉樣會犧牲佢哋嘅舒適度 同埋佢哋嘅物質財富 啲人仍然會覺得安全 覺得自己屬於呢個組織 然後犀利嘅嘢就會發生 
"Bob believes in heart counts, and it's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count. ",有一次旅行搭飛機 我親身經歷咗一件事 當時一個乘客喺未嗌號碼之前就想上機 然之後我睇到地勤職員 將呢位乘客當做係犯咗法咁 
And so they came up with a furlough program. ,嗰名乘客因為早咗一輪上機而被人喝著 
"Every employee, from secretary to CEO, was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation. ",於是我同地勤職員講 
"They could take it any time they wanted, and they did not have to take it consecutively. ",我話 ︰ 「點解你對我哋好似對畜牲一樣？ 
But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much. ,點解唔可以用對人嘅態度對我哋？」 
"He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot, and morale went up. ",佢就真係咁樣同我講 
"They saved 20 million dollars, and most importantly, as would be expected, when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization, the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate. ",佢話︰「 先生，如果我唔跟返個規定， 我會有麻煩或者冇我份工。」 
"And quite spontaneously, nobody expected, people started trading with each other. ",從佢嘅話裏面感覺到佢冇安全感 
Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less. ,佢唔信佢嘅組長 
People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three. ,我哋鍾意坐西南航空 並唔係因為佢哋請更加好嘅員工 
Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank. ,而係因為呢啲員工唔會驚佢哋嘅上頭 
I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. ,呢樣嘢反映咗如果情況出錯 我哋就要被迫花自己嘅時間同精神 去保護自己 而呢樣嘢本質上削弱組織嘅力量 
"They are authorities, and we do what they say because they have authority over us, but we would not follow them. ",當我哋喺一個組織裏面感覺安全時 人就會自然集合本身嘅才華同力量 唔會覺得攰咁 不斷工作去應對外部嘅威脅 同埋會捉緊機會 
"And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders, and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them, and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them. ",最貼切嘅比喻係 一個偉大嘅領袖就好似父母一樣 
This is what a leader is. ,如果你諗下偉大嘅父母係點嘅時候 你會諗到乜嘢？ 點先能夠成就出偉大嘅父母？ 
"I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater, and as is the Marine custom, the officer ate last, and he let his men eat first, and when they were done, there was no food left for him. ",我哋都想俾機會、教育孩子 同埋適當嘅紀律 令佢哋比我哋 能夠更好咁成長、成就更多 
"And when they went back out in the field, his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat, because that's what happens. ",偉大嘅領袖都想要同樣嘅嘢 
We call them leaders because they go first. ,佢哋希望能夠俾到人機會 教育、同適當嘅紀律 塑造佢哋嘅自信 俾機會佢哋去試下失敗嘅滋味 以至於佢哋能夠獲得 連我哋自己都唔會有、更大嘅成就 
"We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain, and when we do, the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us. ",Charlie Kim 係 Next Jump 嘅首席執行官 Next Jump 係喺紐約一家科技公司 佢話如果你屋企處於一個艱難時期 你會考慮唔養你其中一個細路嗎？ 
"They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader's vision comes to life, and when we ask them, ""Why would you do that? ",冇人會噉做 
"Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person?"" they all say the same thing: ""Because they would have done it for me."" ",噉點解我哋會解僱 我哋組織裏邊嘅人呢？ 
And isn't that the organization we would all like to work in? ,Charlie Kim 喺公司實施終身聘用制度 
Thank you very much. ,如果你喺 Next Jump 公司裏面有一份工 你唔會因為工作問題而俾人炒 
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) ,實際上，如果你有問題 佢哋會教你同支援你 就好似對住個我哋成績得 C 嘅孩子一樣 
,而好多公司嘅做法卻係啱啱相反 
"(Music) This is the human test, a test to see if you are a human. ",呢個就係點解會有咁多人 對著銀行首席執行官嘅時候 內心會有怨恨 而呢啲執行官收著 唔成比例嘅人工同獎金 
Please raise your hand if something applies to you. ,其實並唔係因為錢嘅問題 
Are we agreed? Yes? ,而係因為佢哋違背做領導嘅原義 
Then let's begin. ,佢哋違反呢一條根深蒂固喺社會嘅原則 
Have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood? ,佢哋容許職員犧牲自己 去維護佢哋嘅利益 更甚者，佢哋犧牲其他人 去維護佢哋自己嘅利益 
"(Laughter) It's okay, it's safe here. ",唔係錢嘅問題 而係佢哋做出嚟嘅嘢好睇唔過眼 
"Have you ever made a small, weird sound when you remembered something embarrassing? ",如果我哋俾甘地一千五百萬美元嘅獎金 有冇人覺得被冒犯嗎？ 
Have you ever purposely lowercased the first letter of a text in order to come across as sad or disappointed? ,如果二億五千萬美元獎金俾咗德蘭修女 
(Laughter) Okay. ,我哋對於嗰樣嘅做法會有意見嗎？ 
Have you ever ended a text with a period as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period. ,唔會 
Have you ever laughed or smiled when someone said something shitty to you and then spent the rest of the day wondering why you reacted that way? ,真正嘅領袖絕唔會犧牲他人去換取金錢 
Yes. ,相反，佢哋總係犧牲金錢去幫其他人 
Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket a thousand times as you walked from the check-in to the gate? ,Bob Chapman，喺美國中西部 經營一家大型製造商叫做 Barry-Wehmiller 喺 2008 年，由於經濟危機 佢受影響得好深 一夜之間，佢哋損失咗 30% 嘅訂單 
Yes. ,呢樣對於大型嘅製造商嚟講 係好大嘅損失 佢哋唔能夠再養咁多嘅員工 
Have you ever put on a pair of pants and then much later realized that there was a loose sock smushed up against your thigh? ,公司需要減少一千萬美元嘅開支 所以好以好多其他公司一樣 董事開會傾裁員 
(Laughter) Good. ,但係，Bob Chapman 拒絕 
Have you ever tried to guess someone else's password so many times that it locked their account? ,可以睇到，佢唔講錢 
Mmm. ,佢係講人情呢樣嘢 相比起開源節流，拋棄感情要難得多 
Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day you will be discovered as a fraud? ,於是乎佢提出咗一個休假嘅計畫 
"Yes, it's safe here. ",每一個員工，由秘書到首席執行官 都被要求放四星期無薪假期 
Have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn't discovered yet that you were just naturally great at? ,員工可以喺任何時間放咗呢個假去 而且唔需要連續咁放 
Mmm. ,而 Bob Chapman 公佈呢樣嘢 至係更加重要 
"Have you ever broken something in real life, and then found yourself looking for an ""undo"" button in real life? ",佢同大家講 「我哋每個人損失少少， 總好過只係某啲人失去好多」 佢呢番話公司士氣上升 
Have you ever misplaced your TED badge and then immediately started imagining what a three-day Vancouver vacation might look like? ,佢哋省咗二千萬美元 但更重要嘅係，金額超出咗佢哋預期 當員工因為組織嘅領導 而覺得安全同有保障之後 自然反應就係信任同合作 
Have you ever marveled at how someone you thought was so ordinary could suddenly become so beautiful? ,冇人估到，大家都自發地調配呢啲假期 
Have you ever stared at your phone smiling like an idiot while texting with someone? ,等錢用嘅員工 會同冇咁等錢用嘅員工賣假期 
"Have you ever subsequently texted that person the phrase ""I'm staring at the phone smiling like an idiot""? ",有啲員工就有五個星期嘅無薪假期 而其他員工就放三星期嘅無薪假期 
"Have you ever been tempted to, and then gave in to the temptation, of looking through someone else's phone? ",領導其實係一種個人選擇 而唔係一種等級 
Have you ever had a conversation with yourself and then suddenly realized you're a real asshole to yourself? ,我知道好多人 喺組織裏面坐最高級嘅職位 但係佢哋唔係真正嘅領袖 
"(Laughter) Has your phone ever run out of battery in the middle of an argument, and it sort of felt like the phone was breaking up with both of you? ",佢哋只係有權威 我哋下屬只係按佢哋嘅要求做嘢 因為佢哋對我哋有權力 但係我哋唔會跟隨佢哋 
"Have you ever thought that working on an issue between you was futile because it should just be easier than this, or this is supposed to happen just naturally? ",我仲知道好多人 佢哋係屬於組織嘅底層 佢哋冇權力 但係佢哋絕對係領袖 噉係因為 佢哋選擇去照顧佢哋身邊嘅人 
"Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run, just happens naturally? ",呢個至係真正嘅領導 
Have you ever woken up blissfully and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance that someone had left you? ,我聽過一個關於海軍嘅故事 呢個並唔係電影裏面嘅情節 而係海軍歷嚟嘅傳統 長官會最後一個食飯 佢俾部下食先 而當佢哋嘅部下吃完之後 冇曬嘢食 
Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future without a person that no longer was in your life? ,但係當佢哋返到自己崗位時 佢嘅部下便會帶一啲食物俾佢 呢個就係佢哋嘅傳統 
Have you ever looked back on that event with the sad smile of autumn and the realization that futures will happen regardless? ,我哋稱長官做領袖 係因為佢哋總係會行頭、甘願冒險 
Congratulations. ,係因為佢哋選擇犧牲自己，保護其他人 當領袖噉樣做，人最自然嘅反應 就係願意為領袖犧牲自己 
You have now completed the test. ,佢哋願意為實現佢哋領袖嘅夢想 而流血汗、流眼淚 而當佢哋被問到點解會噉樣做時 點解要流血汗、流眼淚 
You are all human. ,佢哋會不約而同咁回答： 因為，佢哋都咁樣為我哋做 
(Applause) ,唔通噉嘅組織 唔係我哋想留喺度做嘢嘅地方嗎？ 
,多謝 
"Ten years ago, I wrote a book which I entitled ""Our Final Century?"" Question mark. ",多謝 （掌聲） 多謝 
"My publishers cut out the question mark. (Laughter) The American publishers changed our title to ""Our Final Hour."" ",
Americans like instant gratification and the reverse. ,（音樂） 呢個係一個人類測試 睇下你係唔係人類 
"(Laughter) And my theme was this: Our Earth has existed for 45 million centuries, but this one is special — it's the first where one species, ours, has the planet's future in its hands. ",如果想玩下，請舉手 
"Over nearly all of Earth's history, threats have come from nature — disease, earthquakes, asteroids and so forth — but from now on, the worst dangers come from us. ",大家贊唔贊成？ 
"And it's now not just the nuclear threat; in our interconnected world, network breakdowns can cascade globally; air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days; and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light. ",好？ 咁我地開始啦 
"We fret too much about minor hazards — improbable air crashes, carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, and so forth — but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios. ",好耐之前嘅童年裡面 你有冇試過食鼻屎？ 
The worst have thankfully not yet happened. ,（笑聲） 冇所謂，隨便講，呢度好安全 
"Indeed, they probably won't. ",你有冇試過諗起某樣尷尬嘅事嘅時候 細細聲發出怪聲？ 
"But if an event is potentially devastating, it's worth paying a substantial premium to safeguard against it, even if it's unlikely, just as we take out fire insurance on our house. ",你有冇試過 將一段文字嘅第一個字母轉做細階 用嚟表達傷心或者失望？ 
"And as science offers greater power and promise, the downside gets scarier too. ",（笑聲） 好 
We get ever more vulnerable. ,你有冇試過將句號用喺段文字嘅結尾 用嚟表示敵對抵觸嘅情緒？ 嗯。句號 
"Within a few decades, millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech, just as they misuse cybertech today. ",你有冇試過當人哋同你講衰嘢嘅時候 你笑騎騎或者微笑 然後果日淨低嘅時間 都喺度諗點解你反應係咁？ 
"Freeman Dyson, in a TED Talk, foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets. ",無錯 
"Well, this may be on the science fiction fringe, but were even part of his scenario to come about, our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed. ",你有冇試過寄存行李之後 一路行去登機口時 每行一步都驚唔見左張機票？ 
"For instance, there are some eco-extremists who think that it would be better for the planet, for Gaia, if there were far fewer humans. ",啱啦 
What happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by 2050? ,你有冇試過著咗一條褲 好耐先發現 原來有一隻襪套咗上個大肶？ 
"And by then, other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality: dumb robots going rogue, or a network that develops a mind of its own threatens us all. ",（笑聲） 好 
"Well, can we guard against such risks by regulation? ",你有冇試過估其他人嘅密碼 不斷撞，直至撞到佢哋賬戶被人鎖咗？ 
"We must surely try, but these enterprises are so competitive, so globalized, and so driven by commercial pressure, that anything that can be done will be done somewhere, whatever the regulations say. ",嗯 
"It's like the drug laws — we try to regulate, but can't. ",你有冇試過有陰魂不散嘅感覺 覺得有朝一日會俾人發現係老千？ 
"And the global village will have its village idiots, and they'll have a global range. ",係，呢度好安全 
"So as I said in my book, we'll have a bumpy ride through this century. ",你有冇試過期望你擁有一啲 未被發掘嘅天賦？ 
"There may be setbacks to our society — indeed, a 50 percent chance of a severe setback. ",嗯 
"But are there conceivable events that could be even worse, events that could snuff out all life? ",有冇試過喺現實生活中做錯嘢 然後發現自己想喺現實中 搵一個「重置」鍵？ 
"When a new particle accelerator came online, some people anxiously asked, could it destroy the Earth or, even worse, rip apart the fabric of space? ",有冇試過擺錯咗你嘅 TED 徽章 然後即刻開始想像 三日嘅溫哥華假期會係點樣？ 
"Well luckily, reassurance could be offered. ",你有冇試過驚歎 點解你以前覺得平平無奇嘅人 會突然之間變得咁靚？ 
"I and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times already, via cosmic ray collisions. ",你有冇試過發短信嘅時候 望住手機 笑到好似個傻瓜咁？ 
But scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world. ,有冇試過跟住同發短信嗰個人 講「我睇住手機笑到好似個傻瓜」咁？ 
Biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens. ,你有冇好想好想 然後抵擋唔住誘惑 偷睇其他人嘅手機？ 
"And by the way, our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question, and it's this: Consider two scenarios. ",有冇試過同自己講嘢 然後突然發現 自己真係個屎忽鬼？ 
Scenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity. ,（笑聲） 你有冇試過 喺你同人哋嘈得火熱時 手機忽然冇電 令你覺得手機同你兩個分手？ 
Scenario B wipes out 100 percent. ,你有冇諗過 解決你哋之間嘅拗叫係徒氣嘅 因為事情本身唔複雜 定係事情容易係理所當然？ 
How much worse is B than A? ,你有冇發現長遠嚟講 好少可會有容易嘅事？ 
Some would say 10 percent worse. ,你有冇試過瞓醒之後覺得好幸福 但之後諗返起有人離開咗你嘅恐佈回憶？ 
The body count is 10 percent higher. ,有冇試過想像唔到失去一個人嘅未來？ 
But I claim that B is incomparably worse. ,你有冇試過用秋天一樣嘅苦笑 睇返以前失去咗嘅人 然後意識到無論點樣 未來總係會嚟到？ 
"As an astronomer, I can't believe that humans are the end of the story. ",恭喜你 
"It is five billion years before the sun flares up, and the universe may go on forever, so post-human evolution, here on Earth and far beyond, could be as prolonged as the Darwinian process that's led to us, and even more wonderful. ",你通過咗測試 
"And indeed, future evolution will happen much faster, on a technological timescale, not a natural selection timescale. ",你哋都係人類 
"So we surely, in view of those immense stakes, shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential. ",（掌聲） 
"Some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction, but others may be disquietingly real. ",
"It's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable, and in fact, that's why we at Cambridge University are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks. ",十年前，我寫咗一本書 叫做 「 我哋最後世紀？ 」問號 
It seems it's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters. ,我嘅出版商將問號刪咗 （笑聲） 美國出版商將題目改咗做 「 我哋最後一個鐘 」 
"And we need all the help we can get from others, because we are stewards of a precious pale blue dot in a vast cosmos, a planet with 50 million centuries ahead of it. ",（笑聲） 美國人鍾意即時行樂，將事情倒轉嚟睇 
And so let's not jeopardize that future. ,（笑聲） 我嘅主題係噉樣嘅： 我哋嘅地球已經有四十五億年歷史 但過去一百年嚟係特別嘅 呢個係有史以嚟第一次 有一個物種，即係我哋人類 將呢個星球嘅未來掌握喺自己手裏面 
And I'd like to finish with a quote from a great scientist called Peter Medawar. ,睇返地球歷史 威脅絕大部分都係嚟自大自然 疾病、地震、隕石撞擊等等 但係由宜家開始 最大嘅威脅嚟自於我哋自己 
"I quote, ""The bells that toll for mankind are like the bells of Alpine cattle. ",並且宜家，唔單止核威脅 喺我哋全球化嘅世界裏面 網路故障可以癱瘓全球 航班令流行病 可以喺幾日之內喺全世界傳播 並且社會媒體可以散佈恐慌同謠言 傳播速度同光速有得輝 
"They are attached to our own necks, and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound."" ",我哋會為到細小嘅威脅而焦慮 冇乜可能發生嘅空難、食物嘅致癌物質 低水平輻射等等 但係我哋同我哋嘅政治領袖 都唔肯面對災難情景 
Thank you very much. ,好彩最壞嘅仲未發生 
,確實，佢哋應該唔會發生 
(Music) (Applause) ,但係如果有件潛在毀滅性嘅事發生 噉就值得我哋持續開支 防止嗰件事發生 即使件事唔太可能發生都好 就好似我哋會幫間屋買火險一樣 
,道高一尺魔高一丈 科學俾我哋更加多嘅力量同願望嘅同時 科學可以係好危險 
"An 18-year-old, African-American male joined the United States Air Force and was assigned to Mountain Home Air Force Base and was a part of the air police squadron. ",我哋於是更加經唔起考驗 
"Upon first arriving there, the first goal that I had was for me to identify an apartment, so I could bring my wife and my new baby, Melanie, out to join me in Idaho. ",幾十年後，幾百萬嘅人會有能力 濫用發展一日千里嘅生物科技 就好似宜家嘅人濫用網絡科技一樣 
"I immediately went to the personnel office, and talking with the guys in personnel, they said, ""Hey, no problem finding an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho. ",Freeman Dyson 喺一場 TED 演講入面 預見小朋友設計同創造新嘅生物 就好似佢嗰代人當化學實驗遊戲噉玩 
"The people down there love us because they know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent one of their apartments, they'll always get their money."" ",當然，呢樣可能只會喺科幻小說出現 但亦有可能係佢預言嘅情景︰ 我哋嘅生態、以至物種 一定唔會平安無事咁長期生存 
And that was a really important thing. ,例如，有一啲生態學嘅極端人士 好似 Gaia 咁 佢認為人類幾量越少 會對我哋嘅星球越好 
"He said, ""So here is a list of people that you can call, and then they will then allow you to select the apartment that you want."" ",如果人類掌握咗 2050 年 就會全世界廣泛使用嘅合成生物技術 會點樣？ 
So I got the list; I made the call. ,到嗰個時候 其他嘅科幻小說裏面所提到嘅噩夢 或者會成為現實 沉默嘅機器人變得瘋狂 網路有自己嘅思想，威脅我哋全人類 
The lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted. ,噉，我哋可以通過規管 去避免呢啲危機嗎？ 
"She said, ""Oh, great you called. ",我哋確實要去嘗試 但係呢啲企業都好有競爭性 喺全世界都有生意利益 太受市場影響 因為法律 令可以做嘅嘢 都要搬到去其他地方先做到 
"We have four or five apartments available right now."" ",就好似禁毒法律咁 我哋去監管，但始終失敗 
"She said, ""Do you want a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?"" ",並且地球村將會有 一班蠢嘅人遍佈全世界 
"Then she said, ""Let's not talk about that. ",所以，我喺書裏面話 我哋喺呢個世紀嘅路會比較難行 
"Just come on down, select the apartment that you want. ",我哋社會可能會有一啲難題 其實係有一半機會面對重大問題 
"We'll sign the contract and you'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away."" ",但係會唔會有可以預見到 但更加弊、滅絕所有物種嘅事發生？ 
So I was excited. ,當新嘅粒子加速器嘅消息喺上網出現 一啲人會緊張咁問 佢會唔會破壞地球 或者話更弊嘅，將太空空間撕開？ 
I jumped in my car. I went downtown and knocked on the door. ,值得慶倖嘅係，我哋仍然係安全嘅 
"When I knocked on the door, the woman came to the door, and she looked at me, and she said, ""Can I help you?"" ",我同其他人指出過 大自然其實已經透過宇宙射線碰撞 做過無數次同樣嘅實驗 
"I said, ""Yes, I'm the person who called about the apartments. ",但係科學家喺做研究嘅時候 必須要小心整咗啲 宇宙從來冇發生過嘅嘢 
"She said, ""You know what? I'm really sorry, but my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them."" ",生物學家應該避免泄漏 經過基因改造 具有潛在毀滅後果嘅病原體 
"I said, ""You mean he rented all five of them in one hour?"" ",順便講下，我哋 對真正嘅災難之所以特別厭惡 係源於一個哲學倫理問題 個問題係： 想像有兩個場景 
"She didn't give me a response, and what she said was this: She said, ""Why don't you leave your number, and if we have some openings, I'll give you a call?"" ",場景一，消滅 90% 人類 
"Needless to say, I did not get a call from her. ",場景二，消滅所有人類 
Nor did I get any responses from the other people that they gave me on the list where I could get apartments. ,場景二比場景一壞幾多呢？ 
"So as a result of that, and feeling rejected, I went back to the base, and I talked to the squadron commander. ",有人會話差十個百分點 
"His name was McDow, Major McDow. ",死亡統計係高出十個百分點 
"I said, ""Major McDow, I need your help."" ",但係我唔會話場景二比較差 
"I told him what happened, and here's what he said to me: He said, ""James, I would love to help you. ",作為一個天文學家 我唔相信人類只係 成個地球歷史嘅最後一部分 
But you know the problem: We can't make people rent to folks that they don't want to rent to. ,仲有五十億年 太陽至會加劇燃燒，步入衰退期 但宇宙仍然會繼續走落去 噉樣，後人類嘅進化過程 喺地球同埋外太空 可以同達爾文進化論一樣咁長 甚至更加精彩 
"And besides, we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don't want to damage that."" ",其實，未來進化嘅速度會更加快 呢樣係基於技術上嘅時間嘅考慮 而並非自物競天擇嘅時間考慮 
"He said, ""So maybe this is what you should do. ",所以面對咁大嘅利害關係 面對十億個危險 我哋都唔應該妥栛一個危險 因為要記住人類滅絕嘅可能 
"Why don't you let your family stay home, because you do know that you get a 30-day leave. ",一啲俾人提過嘅場景 都可能出自於科幻小說裏邊 但係其他嘅場景 可能真係會成為現實 
"So once a year, you can go home to your family, spend 30 days and then come on back."" ",有句重要嘅教誨係講︰ 未知唔等於唔可能 實際上因為噉樣 我哋喺劍橋大學成立咗一個中心 研究點樣降低以上存在嘅風險 
"Needless to say, that didn't resonate for me. ",幾個人去思考呢啲潛在災難睇落幾唔錯 
"So after leaving him, I went back to personnel, and talking to the clerk, he said, ""Jim, I think I have a solution for you. ",但係我哋需要更加多嘅人幫手 因為我哋係茫茫宇宙中 一個藍色星球嘅打理人 呢個星球喺人類出現之前 已經有五十億年嘅歷史 
There's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer. ,我哋唔要糟塌呢個星球嘅未來 
"If you noticed, in Mountain Home, there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place. ",我諗引用著名科學屋 Peter Medawar 嘅一句話收尾 
"You can buy his trailer, and you'd probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town as soon as possible. ",「 為人類而設嘅鈴鈴 就好似阿爾卑斯山嘅小牛嘅鈴鈴一樣， 
"And that would take care of your problem, and that would provide the solution for you."" ",呢啲鈴鈴就好似掛喺我哋頸上面 如果佢哋冇發出和諧而有旋律嘅聲音， 噉就必定係我哋嘅錯。 」 
"So I immediately jumped in my car, went downtown, saw the trailer -- it was a small trailer, but under the circumstances, I figured that was the best thing that I could do. ",多謝 （掌聲） 
So I bought the trailer. ,
"And then I asked him, ""Can I just leave the trailer here, and that would take care of all my problems, I wouldn't have to find another trailer park?"" ",（音樂） （掌聲） 
"He said, ""Before I say yes to that, I need to check with management."" ",
"So I get back to the base, he called me back and management said, ""No, you can't leave the trailer here because we had promised that slot to some other people."" ",一個十八歲、非洲裔美國男仔 加入咗美國空軍 佢被分配到 Mountain Home 空軍基地 加入空軍警衛中隊 
"And that was strange to me because there were several other slots that were open, but it just so happened that he had promised that slot to someone else. ",我啱啱到空軍基地時 第一件事情就係要搵屋 然後將太太同啱啱出世嘅 Melanie 接嚟愛達荷州度住 
"So, what I did -- and he said, ""You shouldn't worry, Jim, because there are a lot of trailer parks."" ",我第一時間搵咗人事部 同佢哋講我嘅情況 人事部話 喺 Mountain Home 搵間屋冇問題 
So I put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks. ,呢裡嘅人都幾鍾意我哋 因為佢哋知道空軍租客係會交租嘅 
"I went to one after another, after another. ",收租對於業主嚟講係好重要嘅 
And I got the same kind of rejection there that I received when I was looking for the apartment. ,人事部話 呢裡有一份人名表 你可以打俾呢啲人 佢哋會俾你揀屋 
"And as a result, the kind of comments that they made to me, in addition to saying that they didn't have any slots open, one person said, ""Jim, the reason why we can't rent to you, we already have a Negro family in the trailer park."" ",我由人事部嗰度攞咗份名單 打第一個電話 
"He said, ""And it's not me, because I like you people."" ",接電話嘅係一個女人 我同佢講咗我要間屋 
"(Laughs) And that's what I did, too. I chuckled, too. ",佢話：「你打嚟啱啦， 
"He said, ""But here's the problem: If I let you in, the other tenants will move out and I can't afford to take that kind of a hit."" ",我哋宜家有四、五間屋出租。」 
"He said, ""I just can't rent to you."" ",佢問：「你要一間定兩間睡房？」 
"Even though that was discouraging, it didn't stop me. ",佢又話：「我哋唔好喺電話講啦。 
"I kept looking, and I looked at the far end of the town in Mountain Home, and there was a small trailer park. ",你直接過嚟睇下想要邊間仲好啦。 
"I mean, a really small trailer park. ",睇好咗，我哋就可以簽約。 你就可以攞鎖匙接家人過嚟。」 
"It didn't have any paved roads in it, it didn't have the concrete slabs, it didn't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot from other trailer slots. ",我聽咗之後好興奮 
It didn't have a laundry facility. ,即刻開車去市中心去搵個代理 
But the conclusion I reached at that moment was that I didn't have a lot of other options. ,去到，我敲門啦，一個女士開門 佢睇一睇我，問： 「有乜可以幫到你嗎？」 
"So I called my wife, and I said, ""We're going to make this one work."" ",我答話：「我頭先打嚟話睇屋， 想睇下邊間合適。」 
"And we moved into it and we became homeowners in Mountain Home, Idaho. ",佢話：「真係唔好意思， 我先生將嗰啲屋都租出啦， 但係冇同我講佢租曬出去。」 
"And of course, eventually things settled down. ",我話：「你係話一個小時內 佢將五間屋都租出去？」 
"Four years after that, I received papers to move from Mountain Home, Idaho to a place called Goose Bay, Labrador. ",佢冇答我 只係話：「要唔要噉樣，你留低電話， 如果到時有人出租，我通知你？」 
"We won't even talk about that. It was another great location. (Laughter) So my challenge then was to get my family from Mountain Home, Idaho to Sharon, Pennsylvania. ",唔使講，佢之後當然係冇打電話俾我 
That wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand-new automobile. ,嗰份名單上面其他業主我都打過 但係都冇回音 
My mother called and said she'll fly out. ,我就好似俾人拒絕咁 我返到空軍基地，搵到中隊嘅指揮官 
"She'll be with us as we drive, she'll help us manage the children. ",McDow 少校 
"So she came out, her and Alice put a lot of food together for the trip. ",我話：「McDow 少校， 我需要你嘅幫忙。」 
"That morning, we left at about 5 a.m. ",我話俾佢聽我嘅遭遇 佢話：「James，我好樂意幫你。 
"Great trip, having a great time, good conversation. ",但問題係， 我哋唔能夠迫人 將屋租俾佢哋唔鍾意嘅人。 
"Somewhere around 6:30, 7 o'clock, we got a little bit tired, and we said, ""Why don't we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early start in the morning?"" ",而且我哋同呢個社區嘅關係幾好， 唔想因咩事令大家關係緊張。」 
"So we were looking at a number of the motels as we drove down the road, and we saw one, it was a great big, bright flashing light that said, ""Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies."" ",佢又話：「一係噉呀， 你叫屋企人留返喺屋企。 
So we stopped in. ,一年有三十日嘅假期， 
"They were in the parking lot, I went inside. ",你趁假期返返去， 三十日後再返嚟。」 
"When I walked inside, the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks, some other people were coming in behind me. ",但佢冇說服到我 
"And so I walked to the counter, and she said, ""How can I help you?"" ",我又返去人事部 同裡面嘅文員解釋我嘅情況 佢話：「 Jim，我有個辦法。 
"I said, ""I would like to get a motel for the evening for my family."" ",有個機師要走。 佢有一架露營車。 
"She said, ""You know, I'm really sorry, I just rented the last one. ",如果你有留意嘅話， Mountain Home 好多地方 都有露營車嘅公園。 
"We will not have any more until the morning."" ",如果你買佢架露營車， 趁佢趕著走， 仲可以買得平啲添。 
"She said, ""But if you go down the road about an hour, 45 minutes, there's another trailer park down there."" ",咁樣嘅話，你嘅問題就可以解決啦。」 
"I said, ""Yeah, but you still have the 'Vacancies' light on, and it's flashing."" ",我聽咗之後即刻趕去市中心 去睇嗰架露營車 架車睇落都幾細架咁 但喺當時嘅情況嚟講 呢個係最好嘅辦法 
"She said, ""Oh, I forgot."" ",於是我就買咗架露營車 
And she reached over and turned the light off. ,我問嗰個文員： 「我可唔可以將架露營車擺喺度？ 噉樣所有問題就解決曬， 噉樣我就唔使搵地方泊。」 
She looked at me and I looked at her. ,佢回答話： 「我要問管理部門，再答你。」 
There were other people in the room. ,我就返基地先 返到基地，文員打嚟話： 「唔得，你唔能夠將露營車泊喺嗰度， 因為我哋已經預留嗰位俾人。」 
She kind of looked at them. No one said anything. ,咁我就覺得成件事幾奇怪 因為我見到其他車位都係空嘅 咁都算啦 就當佢真係將啲位留俾其他人 
"So I just got the hint and I left, and went outside to the parking lot. ",我就問個文員 佢話：「唔使擔心喎 Jim， 仲有好多地方可以泊露營車。」 
"And I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie, and I said, ""It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight."" ",佢俾咗一份泊露營車地方嘅名單俾我 
"And we did drive down the road, but just before we took off and pulled out of the parking lot, guess what happened? ",我逐個逐個搵 
The light came back on. ,但當我搵到一個車位 同樣都係好似睇屋咁被人拒絕 
"And it said, ""Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacancies."" ",除咗佢哋回覆話泊車嘅地方滿咗之外 一個人仲同我講： 「 Jim，我哋唔租俾你， 因為我哋已經有一個黑人家庭 住喺呢個露營車停車場。」 
We were able to find a nice place. ,佢話：「呢個決定唔係我落， 因為我都鍾意你哋架。」 
"It wasn't our preference, but it was secure and it was clean. ",（笑聲） 我同你哋一樣，我當時都笑咗 
And so we had a great sleep that night. ,佢話：「宜家問題係， 如果我俾你搬入嚟， 其他租客會搬走。 我只係唔咁樣揹鑊啫， 
"The piece that's important about that is that we had similar kinds of experiences from Idaho all the way through to Pennsylvania, where we were rejected from hotels, motels and restaurants. ",所以我冇辦法租俾你。」 
But we made it to Pennsylvania. ,呢件事雖然幾灰 
We got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids. ,但係冇停止我繼續搵嘅決心 我搵到 Mountain Home 偏遠地區 嗰度有一個小型露營車停車場 
"I jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay, Labrador, which is another story, right? ",細到冇人有嘅停車場 
"(Laughter) Here it is, 53 years later, I now have nine grandchildren, two great-grandchildren. ",裡面仲未鋪路、冇水泥平板 冇欄杆用嚟劃分泊位 
Five of the grandchildren are boys. ,冇可以洗衫嘅設施 
"I have master's, Ph.D., undergrad, one in medical school. ",但當時我明白我冇太多其他選擇 
I have a couple that are trending. ,我打俾太太 話：「我哋就噉樣樣啦。」 
They're almost there but not quite. (Laughter) I have one who has been in college now for eight years. ,我哋成家就噉樣搬咗過去 喺愛達華州 Mountain Home 呢個城市 我哋終於有咗自己嘅家 
"(Laughter) He doesn't have a degree yet, but he wants to be a comedian. ",當然，事情最後都安定落嚟 
So we're just trying to get him to stay in school. ,四年後，我批准咗 由愛達華州嘅 Mountain Home 搬到 Labrador 嘅 Goose Bay 
"Because you never know, just because you're funny at home, does not make you a comedian, right? ",我就唔喺度多講啦 不過嗰度環境都唔錯 （笑聲） 我嗰時面對嘅問題係 將屋企由愛達華州嘅 Mountain Home 搬到賓夕法尼亞州嘅 Sharon 
"(Laughter) But the thing about it, they're all good kids -- no drugs, no babies in high school, no crime. ",其實問題都唔大 因為我哋啱啱買咗一架車 
"So with that being the backdrop, I was sitting in my TV room watching TV, and they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on. ",我媽咪電話裏面話佢會飛過嚟 
"And all of a sudden, one of the news commentators got on the air and she said, ""In the last three months, eight unarmed African-American males have been killed by police, white homeowners, or white citizens."" ",佢會喺開車嗰陣幫我哋照顧細路 
"For some reason, at that moment it just all hit me. ",所以媽咪就嚟咗 佢同我太太為成個路程準備咗好多食物 
"I said, ""What is it? It is so insane. ",嗰日上晝，我哋五點就出發 
"What is the hatred that's causing people to do these kinds of things?"" ",成個旅程都好好，大家都好鍾意 
"Just then, one of my grandsons called. ",傾得都幾開心 到咗夜晚大概六點半、七點 我哋開始有啲攰 我哋就話：「不如搵一間汽車旅館， 先住宿一晚，聽日一早再上路？」 
"He said, ""Granddad, did you hear what they said on TV?"" ",我哋開始物色路上嘅汽車旅館 我哋睇到一間，用紅色光管寫著： 「有空房，有空房，有空房」 
"I said, ""Yes, I did."" ",我哋就停低 
"He said, ""I'm just so confused. ",佢哋留喺停車場 我入去個旅館 
"We do everything we do, but it seems that driving while black, walking while black, talking while black, it's just dangerous. ",當我入去嘅時候 前台嘅一位女職員 啱啱辦埋完幾個人嘅入住手續 另一啲人嚟到前台，企喺我後面 
What can we do? We do everything that you told us to do. ,我嚟到前台 佢問：「有乜可以幫你？」 
"When stopped by the police, we place both hands on the steering wheel at the 12 o'clock position. ",我話：「我想租一晚房間。」 
"If asked to get identification, we tell them, 'I am slowly reaching over into the glove compartment to get my I.D.' When pulled out of the car to be searched, when laid on the ground to be searched, when our trunks are opened to be searched, we don't push back, we don't challenge because we know, you've told us, 'Don't you challenge the police. ",佢話：「真係唔好意思， 最後一間啱啱租咗。 
"After it's over, call us and we'll be the ones to challenge."" ",聽日上晝至有房。」 
"He said, ""And this is the piece that really bugs me: Our white friends, our buddies, we kind of hang together. ",佢話：「如果你向前走 大概 45 到 60 分鐘， 會有一個露營車停車場。」 
"When they hear about these kinds of things happening to us, they say, 'Why do you take it? ",我話：「但係空房燈仲著住喎。」 
You need to push back. You need to challenge. ,佢話：「哎呀，我唔記得咗熄。」 
"You need to ask them for their identification.'"" And here's what the boys have been taught to tell them: ""We know that you can do that, but please do not do that while we're in the car because the consequences for you are significantly different than the consequences for us."" ",然後佢伸手熄咗佢 
"And so as a grandparent, what do I tell my grandsons? ",佢望一望我，我望一望佢 
How do I keep them safe? How do I keep them alive? ,大堂裡面仲有其他人 
"As a result of this, people have come to me and said, ""Jim, are you angry?"" ",佢望一望佢哋，冇人敢出聲 
"And my response to that is this: ""I don't have the luxury of being angry, and I also know the consequences of being enraged."" ",我明白意思 我離開汽車酒店，返到停車場 
"So therefore, the only thing that I can do is take my collective intellect and my energy and my ideas and my experiences and dedicate myself to challenge, at any point in time, anything that looks like it might be racist. ",我同我媽、太太同囡囡講︰ 睇嚟我哋要渣遠少少，先至有地方瞓 
"So the first thing I have to do is to educate, the second thing I have to do is to unveil racism, and the last thing I need to do is do everything within my power to eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary. ",我哋嗰晚渣到去遠啲嘅地方 但當我哋倒車準備要走嘅時候 估下發生乜嘢？ 
The second thing I do is this: I want to appeal to Americans. ,吉房嘅招牌光管竟然又著咗！ 
"I want to appeal to their humanity, to their dignity, to their civic pride and ownership to be able to not react to these heinous crimes in an adverse manner. ",依然著住「有空房，有空房，有空房」 
"But instead, to elevate your level of societal knowledge, your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness to then collectively come together, all of us come together, to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity, any kind of insanity that makes it okay to kill unarmed people, regardless of their ethnicity, regardless of their race, regardless of their diversity makeup. ",最後我哋搵到一個唔錯嘅地方 
We have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense. ,雖然唔係我哋想要嘅地方 但總算安全乾淨 
The only way I think we can do that is through a collective. ,我哋嗰晚瞓得好好 
"We need to have black and white and Asian and Hispanic just to step forward and say, ""We are not going to accept that kind of behavior anymore."" ",嗰次經歷嘅重點係 我哋無論喺愛達華州定係賓夕法尼亞州 都俾人酒店、汽車旅館同酒樓拒絕 
,但我哋最後仍然能夠嚟到賓夕法尼亞州 
"When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war. ",我哋成家人安定落嚟 大家都好高興見到細路 
"That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water. ",今次另一個故仔係當我坐飛機趕去 Labrador Goose Bay 嘅時候 唔係咩？ 
"When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel. ",（笑聲） 即係 53 年後嘅今日 我有九個孫，兩個曾孫 
Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. ,五個孫係男丁 
"Instead, it looks like this. ",有讀學士、碩士、博士，其中一個讀醫 
"If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. ",有幾個孫都幾時髦 
"Not missiles, but microbes. ",佢哋都好新潮， 但未係最入潮流嗰個 （笑聲） 我仲有一個孫讀咗八年嘅大專 
"Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. ",（笑聲） 佢仲未攞到學位 但因為佢諗住成為一位喜劇演員 
But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. ,所以我哋盡可能俾佢繼續留喺學校讀 
We're not ready for the next epidemic. ,因為喺屋企搞笑 唔代表出面可以做到一個喜劇演員 
Let's look at Ebola. ,啱唔啱？ （笑聲） 唔理點樣，佢哋都係好嘅細路嚟 佢哋冇吸毒、高中冇大肚、冇犯罪 
"I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges. ",呢個係我少少背景 噉有一日我喺度睇電視 電視播梗 Ferguson 同埋相關嘅騷動 
I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication. ,突然，一個新聞評論員話： 「喺過去三個月內， 有八名身上冇武器嘅非洲裔美國藉男性 俾警察、白人業主同白人市民殺害。」 
"And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we didn't have a system at all. ",唔知道做乜嘢，當時我呆咗 
"In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces. ",我話：「咩事？太癲啦。 
"We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread. ",點解仇恨可以令人做出噉樣嘅嘢？」 
The case reports came in on paper. ,跟著，我一個孫打俾我 
It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate. ,佢話：「爺爺，你有冇睇咗新聞？」 
We didn't have a medical team ready to go. ,我話有 
We didn't have a way of preparing people. ,佢話：「呢單嘢好困擾我。 
"Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers. ",我哋只係做緊自己嘅嘢。 但喺我哋黑人 無論開車、行路、抑或講嘢都好危險。 
"But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries. ",我哋可以做啲乜？ 你教我哋嘅嘢我哋都做咗。 
And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers. ,警察截停我哋嘅時候， 我哋將雙手放喺駄盤最高嘅地方。 
There was no one there to look at treatment approaches. ,如果佢哋要查身份證， 就話俾佢哋知， 我會慢慢喺我嘅儲物箱裏邊 攞我嘅身份證出嚟。 佢哋要我哋離開架車俾佢哋搜， 要我哋趴喺地下俾佢哋搜， 要我哋打開車尾箱俾佢哋睇， 我哋都唔反抗， 因為我哋記得你講過 『唔好挑戰警察。等一切結束， 
No one to look at the diagnostics. ,打俾我哋，等我哋同警察理論。』」 
No one to figure out what tools should be used. ,佢話：「呢件事令我好困擾。 我同白人朋友經常一齊。 
"As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them. ",佢哋聽到呢個消息嘅時候， 佢哋話『你仲點可以忍呢？ 
But that was never tried. ,你應該要反抗，你應該要理論， 
So there was a lot that was missing. ,你應該叫佢哋出示證件。』」 我嘅孫會用我教嗰套答返佢哋︰ 「我知道你可以噉樣做， 但係當我哋喺車裏邊嘅時候， 請唔好噉做。 因為我同你嘅後果會好唔一樣。」 
And these things are really a global failure. ,所以，身為爺爺 我應該點同啲孫講呢？ 
"The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about. ",我點先能夠保護佢哋嘅安全 俾佢哋繼續好好咁活著呢？ 
"Now, in the movies it's quite different. ",呢一則報導之後，好多人問我 「 Jim，乜你唔嬲嗎？」 
"There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood. ",我答返佢哋︰ 「我冇權去嬲， 因為我知道嬲係會後果嘅。」 
The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year. ,所以，我唯一可以做嘅係 用我嘅知識、精力、諗法、經驗 隨時貢獻自己嘅力量 去對抗任何潛在嘅種族歧視 
"About 10,000 people died, and nearly all were in the three West African countries. ",我首先要做嘅係教育 其次係向人帶出種族歧視嘅存在 最後係盡我一生人最大嘅力量 用盡一切辦法消除種族歧視 
There's three reasons why it didn't spread more. ,我要做嘅第二件事係︰ 我要呼籲所有美國人 
The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers. ,喚醒佢哋嘅人性同尊嚴 呼喚佢哋作為市民 為到市民嘅身份而自豪時 唔好消極咁面對呢啲醜惡嘅罪行 
They found the people and they prevented more infections. ,而係應該提升自己對社會嘅認識 增加對社會嘅觸覺同認知 然後大家一齊聯合起嚟 聲討同挑戰所有不公義嘅嘢 包括殺手無寸鐵嘅人 無論被殺嘅人係乜種族、係乜血統 無論文化上點咁唔同 
The second is the nature of the virus. ,我哋必須推翻呢啲唔合理嘅啲事 
Ebola does not spread through the air. ,只有我哋團結一致 至能夠達成呢一個目標 
"And by the time you're contagious, most people are so sick that they're bedridden. ",我哋需要黑人、白人、亞洲裔同拉丁裔 一齊講︰ 我哋唔能夠再接受同類事情繼續發生 
"Third, it didn't get into many urban areas. ",
And that was just luck. ,當我仲係一個細路仔 核戰係我哋最擔心嘅災難 
"If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas, the case numbers would have been much larger. ",於是我哋喺地下室擺咗一個桶 桶裡面裝住好多罐頭同埋水 
"So next time, we might not be so lucky. ",假如核戰爆發 我哋就落去地下室匿埋 然後靠果個桶維生 
You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. ,當今世上風險最大既災難 唔係呢個 
"The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism. ",而係呢個 
So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse. ,假如有樣野可以係喺未來幾十年 殺死超過一千萬人 最有可能嘅就係傳染性極高嘅病毒 而並非戰爭 
"In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918. ",唔係導彈，而係微生物 
"So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly. ",部分原因係因為我哋投入左 巨大嘅資源喺核武 
And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic. ,相比之下，我哋投放好少資源落去 一個預防疫情爆發嘅機制上 
So this is a serious problem. ,我哋仲未準備好應對 下一次嘅疫情 
We should be concerned. ,睇下伊波拉 
"But in fact, we can build a really good response system. ",我相信你哋所有人都喺報紙上面 睇過關於佢嘅報道 對付病毒嗰陣出現過好多好嚴峻嘅挑戰 
We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here. ,我曾經用一個用嚟追查 脊髓灰質炎根治情況嘅方法 去分析伊波拉疫情 
We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them. ,從事件嘅發展我哋睇度 問題唔係機制運作唔好 而係我哋根本冇一個機制去應對伊波拉 
We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving. ,事實上係有一啲幾明顯嘅漏洞 
We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen. ,我們冇一班隨時候命嘅流行病學家 喺傳染病爆發嗰陣去研究 個病毒本身屬性係點，傳播規模有幾大 
"So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system. ",病例報告雖然以書面形式發表 
And we need preparedness. ,但好耐之後佢哋先至放上網 啲報告仲要係好唔準確 
"The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared are again, what we do for war. ",我哋冇一班隨時候命嘅醫療隊伍 
"For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go. ",我哋冇辦法招募到人員 
We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers. ,無國界醫生喺組織志願者方面 貢獻咗好多 
NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly. ,即使係咁，我哋仍然比應有嘅步伐慢 我哋宜家喺呢啲有疫情嘅國家度 應該要有幾千個人員 
"NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained? ",當有大規模疫情嘅時候 更加需要幾十萬嘅人員 
Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies? ,冇人試過睇下治療方法 
So they are absolutely ready to go. ,冇人留意過診斷方式 
So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic. ,冇人試過探討用咩工具 
What are the key pieces? ,舉例，我哋可以抽取康復者嘅血液 處理過之後 將血清注入番佢哋度去保護佢哋 
"First, we need strong health systems in poor countries. ",但冇人試過咁做 
"That's where mothers can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines. ",所以，真係有好多地方做得不足 
"But, also where we'll see the outbreak very early on. ",呢啲就係全球既失敗 
"We need a medical reserve corps: lots of people who've got the training and background who are ready to go, with the expertise. ",世界衛生組織本身就係去監控疫情 但偏偏佢哋從來都冇做過 
And then we need to pair those medical people with the military. ,喺電影裡面，情況就唔一樣 
"taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics and secure areas. ",裡面有一班隨時準備就緒嘅流行病學家 佢哋介入，拯救咗全世界 不過呢啲只係電影情節 
"We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are. ",準備不足可以令下一個傳染病隨時爆發 傷害程度可能比伊波拉更大 睇下今年伊波拉疫情嘅演變 
"The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well. ",有大約一萬人死亡 幾乎全部都係黎自西非三個國家 
"So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0. ",疫情之所以冇進一步擴大 原因有三個 
"Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics. ",第一個原因係 有好多英勇既醫護人員喺度奮鬥 
"There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus, that could work very, very quickly. ",佢哋發現患者之後 就第一時間阻止疫情傳開 
"Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost, but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm. ",第二就係病毒本身嘅特性 
"The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic, global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths. ",伊波拉唔會經空氣傳播 
These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic. ,當你具備高傳染性嘅時候 大多數人因為病得好嚴重 要訓喺張床度 
"The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D, those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe. ",第三，病毒冇傳到去多個城市 
So I think this should absolutely be a priority. ,呢個只係好彩 
There's no need to panic. ,如果病毒擴散到更多城市 病例數目就會多好多 
We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement. ,下次我哋未必會咁好彩 
"But we need to get going, because time is not on our side. ",一個人可以帶住病毒但又冇事 只要呢個人上機或者去街市 都可以將病毒傳開去 
"In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready. ",病毒嘅源頭可以係自然既流行病 好似伊波拉咁 亦可以係黎自生物恐怖主義 
"If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic. ",所以，事情往往可以造成千倍更大嘅傷害 
Thank you. ,我地一齊黎睇一個 病毒經空氣傳播嘅模型 就好似 1918 年西班牙流感病毒咁 
(Applause) ,當時係嘅 嗰次流感喺世界傳播得非常之快 
,大約有三千萬死於呢場疫症 
"We're at a tipping point in human history, a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home. ",嗰次疫症真係好嚴重 
"Even in just the past few years, we've greatly expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe. ",我哋必須多加關注 
"NASA's Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars, indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy. ",不過，其實 我哋係可以建立一個完善嘅應變系統 
"Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them, blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us. ",科學同科技帶比大家嘅好處 我哋已經喺度講過 
Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes as well as their distance from their parent star. ,我哋都有手機 可以接收大眾資訊 亦可以向公眾發放訊息 
"Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky, like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System, and also how much light they receive from their parent sun. ",我哋可以透衛星地圖睇到 啲人嘅位置同佢哋行緊去邊 
"In turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not. ",人類喺生物學上取得嘅成果 應該可以俾人 有更多時間去尋找致病源 去研製藥物同疫苗黎對付致病源 
"Unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity. ",因此，我哋係有工具 但呢啲工具需要用喺全球衛生體系嗰度 
2014 was the hottest year on record. ,仲有一樣野，就係我哋需要準備 
Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades. ,我認為，所謂嘅準備好 其實就同打仗冇分別 
These planetary-scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course. ,士兵整束待發 
"But I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronomer. ",大批後備軍隊支援 
I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet. ,北約有一個可以迅速部署嘅部隊 
You could say that I look for choice alien real estate. ,北約舉行好多嘅演習 確保軍隊訓綀有素 
"Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet itself. ",例如佢哋熟唔熟悉燃料同行動 通訊用嘅頻率係唔係一樣 
Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best: those of our own Solar System. ,務求佢哋係準備就緒 
"Consider our neighbor, Mars. ",所以呢啲都係我哋應對疫情既問題 
"Mars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun, it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler. ",咁關鍵係嘜？ 
"Indeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past, and in part, this is why we study Mars so much. ",首先，貧窮國家需要有規模嘅衛生體系 
"Our rovers, like Curiosity, crawl across its surface, scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it. ",可以俾母親安全生產 細路可以接種疫苗 
"Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere, trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability. ",但係，喺我哋將會見到 最先出現疫情既地方 
Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars. ,我哋需要一支醫療嘅後備團隊 由大量從事醫療行業 受過相關訓綀 同時有經驗、可以隨時就緒嘅人擔當職務 
"But though these Martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world, places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers, compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live. ",跟住需要醫護人員同軍隊合作 
"Consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet, places that are lush by comparison with Mars. ",借助軍隊去快速應變 去支援成個行動，以及封鎖疫區 
"Even in the driest, highest places on Earth, the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests. ",我哋需要進行模擬運算 我指嘅係細菌模擬爆發嘅測試 而唔係軍事演習 咁樣先可以發現邊度有漏洞 
"I worry -- I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long, dark shadow: the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth. ",最近一次喺美國進行嘅細菌模擬爆發測試 係喺 2001 年 不過嗰次進行嘚得唔係好順利 
"As much as I love interplanetary exploration, I deeply disagree with this idea. ",嗰次，細菌同人類嘅比分係 1:0 
"There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars, but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats. ",最後，我哋喺疫苗同診斷方面需要有大量嘅研發 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. ,例如喺腺相關嘅病毒研究方面就有 一啲重大嘅突破 研究出黎嘅疫苗可以快速起到作用 
But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another. ,雖然我唔知確實既預算將會係幾多 但我可以好肯定咁話 相比於潛在危害，呢個開支係細好多 
"No, they're in fact two sides of the same goal: to understand, preserve and improve life into the future. ",世界銀行預測，假如全球流感大爆發 全球財富將會唔見三兆億美元 會有幾百萬人死亡 
The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas. ,健康科學嘅投資會帶黎好多好處 唔單止係預防疫情爆發 
They're just closer to home. ,基本醫療、研發 呢啲都會減低全球衛生嘅平等性 令世界變得更公平更安全 
"If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile, inhospitable spaces here on Earth, perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it. ",所以我認為呢樣野絕對係首要考慮既事情 
I leave you with a final thought experiment: Fermi's paradox. ,大家冇必要恐慌 
"Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it, we should have found evidence for alien life by now. ",我哋其實唔需要喺地下室 囤積好多意大利麵嘅罐頭 
So where are they? ,但係我哋要立即行動 因為時間唔到我哋控制 
"Well, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox is that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars, they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with. ",事實上，假如我哋要正面睇伊波拉疫情 就會知道伊波拉其實係一個警號 話俾人類知要未雨綢謬 
"It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together. ",如果大家從宜家就開始行動 我哋就可以準備好 迎接下一個可能發生嘅症情 
"If we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation, then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the Earth. ",多謝 
Thank you. ,（掌聲） 
(Applause) ,
,我哋而家喺人類歷史嘅轉捩點 人類處於得到新星球 同失去舊星球之間 失去嘅舊星球就係我哋稱為家嘅地球 
(Music) (Music) (Applause) (Applause) ,就算只係過去幾年 我哋對地球喺宇宙扮演 咩角色嘅知識都增長咗唔少 
,美國太空總處嘅開普勒任務 發現有成千上萬個類似地球嘅行星 圍繞住其他恆星運行 證明地球只係銀河系 數以千萬宜居行星嘅其中一個 
Blah blah blah blah blah. ,開普勒係一台太空望遠鏡 當星體喺恆星前面經過 會輕微阻擋恆星嘅光線 令恆星睇起嚟暗啲 開普勒就係量度呢啲稍為暗淡嘅光線 
"Blah blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah. ",開普勒嘅數據可以推算到星體嘅體積 同埋佢哋同母恆星之間嘅距離 
"Blah blah blah, blah. ",呢兩樣都有助我哋了解星體 係唔係好似太陽系類地行星咁 體積小而且佈滿岩石 以及佢哋從母恆星吸收幾多光 
So what the hell was that? ,縱合上述結果 我哋可以知道 呢啲星球到底適唔適宜住 
"Well, you don't know because you couldn't understand it. ",但好唔好彩 喺發現可能宜居嘅星球嘅同時 我哋地球因為人類而逐漸衰退 
It wasn't clear. ,2014 年係有紀錄以嚟最熱嘅一年 
"But hopefully, it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious. ",同我哋共處咗成千年嘅冰川同海冰 將會喺幾十年之內消失 
Clarity or mystery? ,呢種由我哋造成嘅地球環境改變 好快就超越我哋可以控制佢哋嘅步伐 
"I'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer, as well as my daily life as a New Yorker every day, and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me. ",不過我唔係氣候學家，我係天文學家 
Here's an example. ,我研究星體嘅宜居性 我希望可以喺地球以外嘅宇宙入面 搵到有生命嘅地方 
"Now, how many people know what this is? ",你可以話我搵緊外星級數嘅房地產 
Okay. Now how many people know what this is? ,作為一個沉迷搜索宇宙生命嘅人 我可以話你知 你越係想搵一個似地球嘅星球 你越會珍惜我哋嘅地球 
"Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M. Schulz, we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life, one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over 50 years. ",每次有新星球發現 我哋都會將新星球 同我哋最熟悉嘅星球比較 即我哋太陽系嘅行星 
"This is actually a cover of a book that I designed about the work of Schulz and his art, which will be coming out this fall, and that is the entire cover. ",試想一下我哋嘅鄰居，火星 細小而且滿佈岩石 
"There is no other typographic information or visual information on the front, and the name of the book is ""Only What's Necessary."" ",雖然佢距離太陽有啲遠 但如果火星被開普勒計劃呢類任務發現 佢可能被人分類做宜居星球 
"So this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day about the design that I'm perceiving, and the design I'm creating. ",其實以前，火星的確有可能宜居 呢個亦係我哋深入研究火星嘅原因 
So clarity. ,好似好奇號咁嘅火星探測器 喺火星表面行走 尋找已知生命之源嘅線索 
It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere. ,而好似 MAVEN 任務一樣嘅軌道探測器 就收集火星大氣層嘅樣本 畀我哋了解點解火星唔再宜居 
"We ask ourselves this. [""When should you be clear?""] Now, something like this, whether we can read it or not, needs to be really, really clear. ",私人太空旅行公司 依架唔只提供近太空旅行 亦可能喺將來提供火星移民服務 
Is it? ,但呢啲火星景色 只會令人聯想起地球嘅沙漠 一個我哋聯想只有開拓者同邊疆嘅地方 同地球相比，火星嘅環境係幾可怕 
"This is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love, mainly because I'm always late and I am always in a hurry. ",諗下我哋地球尚未殖民嘅沙漠 呢啲地方比起火星更加之宜居 
"So when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners, I was thrilled, because now I finally knew how many seconds I had to get across the street before I got run over by a car. ",就算地球最乾、最高嘅地方 嗰度嘅空氣都係由幾千里外嘅雨林製造 都係甜嘅，而且充滿住氧氣 
"Six? I can do that. (Laughter) So let's look at the yin to the clarity yang, and that is mystery. ",我擔心呢種殖民火星 同其他星球嘅熱潮 會引致長期唔好嘅後果 就係令某啲人相信 當我哋所知唯一宜居嘅星球 自我毀滅之後 火星就係我哋嘅救星 
Mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition. ,雖然我好鍾意星際探索 但我同時好唔贊同呢個諗法 
"Mystery demands to be decoded, and when it's done right, we really, really want to. ",我哋有無數個好理由去火星 但如果有人同你講 火星係人類嘅後備星球 就同鐵達尼號嘅船長同你講 陣間喺救生艇上面會搞派對一樣荒謬 
"[""When should you be mysterious?""] In World War II, the Germans really, really wanted to decode this, and they couldn't. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 多謝 
"Here's an example of a design that I've done recently for a novel by Haruki Murakami, who I've done design work for for over 20 years now, and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of a sudden, after their freshman year of college, completely cut him off with no explanation, and he is devastated. ",星際探索同星球保護並唔係矛盾嘅 
And the friends' names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color. ,佢哋係同一個銀仔嘅兩面︰ 都係去了解、保護同改善將來嘅生活 
"So there's Mr. Red, there's Mr. Blue, there's Ms. White, and Ms. Black. ",我哋呢個世界嘅極端環境 其實等如外星嘅美景 
"Tsukuru Tazaki, his name does not correspond to a color, so his nickname is Colorless, and as he's looking back on their friendship, he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand. ",佢哋甚至更加近我哋屋企 
"So I created this sort of abstract representation of this, but there's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story, and there's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket. ",如果我哋明白點樣可以 喺地球衝突、唔適宜人住嘅環境以外 創造同維持宜居空間 或者，我哋可以做到環境保護 同時又可以做到更加多 
"The four fingers are now four train lines in the Tokyo subway system, which has significance within the story. ",最後，我留俾大家思考費米悖論 
"And then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors, which basically he does later on in the story. ",好多年前，物理學家費米問︰ 宇宙已經存在咗好長時間 而我哋相信宇宙入面有好多星球 我哋依家應該搵到外星生物嘅證據 
He catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did. ,咁佢哋喺邊？ 
"And so this is the three-dimensional finished product sitting on my desk in my office, and what I was hoping for here is that you'll simply be allured by the mystery of what this looks like, and will want to read it to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does. ",其中一個可以解答費米悖論嘅答案係 喺外星生存嘅生物 佢哋嘅文明已經進步到 佢哋可以住喺星際之間 但佢哋睇唔到 以前一直住開、孕育佢哋文明嘅星球 有幾重要 
"[""The Visual Vernacular.""] This is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery. ",如果覺得星際殖民已經可以拯救到人類 咁樣實在係狂妄自大 但星體保護同星際探索 反而可以同時進行 
What does this mean? ,如果我哋可以將火星 呢個咁惡劣嘅星球變成宜居 咁保護我哋宜居嘅星球 應該係更加輕易至啱 
"This is what it means. [""Make it look like something else.""] The visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way. ",多謝 
"This is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris that had this title at the time. [""All the Beauty You Will Ever Need""] Now, the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing. ",（掌聲） 
It's not connected to any of the essays in the book. ,
It came to the author's boyfriend in a dream. ,（音樂） （音樂）（鼓掌） （鼓掌） 
"Thank you very much, so -- (Laughter) -- so usually, I am creating a design that is in some way based on the text, but this is all the text there is. ",
"So you've got this mysterious title that really doesn't mean anything, so I was trying to think: Where might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn't? ",吧啦吧啦吧啦吧啦吧啦 
"And sure enough, not long after, one evening after a Chinese meal, this arrived, and I thought, ""Ah, bing, ideagasm!"" (Laughter) I've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but when you think about them -- if you think about them -- they really don't. ",吧啦吧啦吧啦吧啦 吧啦吧啦，吧啦啦啦啦啦 
"This says, ""Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future."" ",吧啦啦，吧啦 
"Thank you. (Laughter) But we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr. Sedaris, and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don't even need the bits of the cookie anymore. ",講咩啊？ 
"We're just seeing this strange thing and we know we love David Sedaris, and so we're hoping that we're in for a good time. ",你唔知，因為你都冇聽明 
"[""'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff""] David Rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book ""Fraud"" because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do. ",把聲都唔清晰 
So he was this skinny little urban guy and GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River whitewater rafting to see if he would survive. ,但起碼，你已經 畀呢種神秘深深咁吸引咗 
"And then he would write about it, and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself. ",清晰定係神秘？ 
And so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself and then somehow show a reader reacting to it. ,我係做平面設計嘅 日日都要兼顧呢兩樣嘢 喺紐約生活就係要咁 每日都係 其中有兩種元素令我着迷 
This led me to graffiti. ,舉個例 
I'm fascinated by graffiti. ,有幾多人知道呢個係咩？ 
"I think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time, and there's all different sorts of it. ",宜家，又有幾多人？ 
This is a picture I took on the Lower East Side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it's been tagged like crazy. ,多謝 Charles M. Schulz 加咗 絕妙嘅兩筆 七條線就足夠展現成個感情生活 一張喺過去五十年裡邊 獲得億萬粉絲嘅面孔 
"Now whether you look at this and think, ""Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,"" or you look at it and say, ""That's illegal abuse of property,"" the one thing I think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it. ",其實，呢個係我設計嘅一本書嘅封面 介紹舒茲同佢嘅作品嘅 今年秋季出街 呢個就係成個封面 
Right? There is no clear message here. ,上邊冇其他文字或者視覺訊息 書名係《簡明至上》 
"There is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting, which I call editorial graffiti. ",呢個笑臉代表 我認知嘅設計 同埋我個人嘅設計 
"This is a picture I took recently in the subway, and sometimes you see lots of prurient, stupid stuff, but I thought this was interesting, and this is a poster that is saying rah-rah Airbnb, and someone has taken a Magic Marker and has editorialized about what they think about it. ",清清楚楚就係要點 
And it got my attention. ,就好似我畫出嚟咁 雖然粗爌，但感覺真 
"So I was thinking, how do we apply this to this book? ",我哋問自己：「幾時要清楚？」 呢本（飛機乘客手冊）就要—— 我哋讀唔讀都好 需要好清楚 
"So I get the book by this person, and I start reading it, and I'm thinking, this guy is not who he says he is; he's a fraud. ",噉佢清唔清楚？ 
"And I get out a red Magic Marker, and out of frustration just scribble this across the front. ",呢個係近期一個我好鍾意嘅 城市裡邊、增加咗訊息明確性嘅例子 主要係因為，我成日遲到，成日好趕 
"Design done. (Laughter) And they went for it! (Laughter) Author liked it, publisher liked it, and that is how the book went out into the world, and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you, and they all sort of looked like they were crazy. ",所以，幾年前 啲十字路口安裝咗計時器嗰時 我好激動，因為我終於可以知道 我仲有幾多秒過馬路 仲唔會被車撞親 
"(Laughter) [""'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy""] Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer, a good friend, I've worked with him for many years. ",六秒？我得（笑聲） 宜家，我哋嚟睇下同清晰相對嘅嘢 即係神秘 
"He is probably best known as the author of ""The Black Dahlia"" and ""L.A. Confidential."" ",神秘嘅定義好複雜 
"His most recent novel was called this, which is a very mysterious name that I'm sure a lot of people know what it means, but a lot of people don't. ",有神秘，就需要解開神秘 如果神秘表達得當 我哋真係會好想好想去解開佢 
And it's a story about a Japanese-American detective in Los Angeles in 1941 investigating a murder. ,「幾時應該神秘？」 喺第二次世界大戰時 德國人好想好想破解呢個密碼 但佢哋失敗咗 
"And then Pearl Harbor happens, and as if his life wasn't difficult enough, now the race relations have really ratcheted up, and then the Japanese-American internment camps are quickly created, and there's lots of tension and horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder. ",呢個係我最近 為村上春樹嘅小說做嘅設計 我幫佢做封面已經做咗廿幾年 呢本小說係講一個叫多崎造嘅後生仔 佢有四個老友 佢哋大學一年級之後突然全部同佢絕交 咩解釋都冇 多崎造大受打擊 
"And so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of all right, we'll take Pearl Harbor and we'll add it to Los Angeles and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city. ",每一個老友嘅日文名 都隱含住一種顏色 
"My editor in chief said, ""You know, it's interesting but I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler."" ",有紅色先生、藍色先生 白色先生同黑色先生 
"And so I went back to the drawing board, as I often do. ",多崎造嘅名冇對應嘅顏色 所以佢自己叫「無色」 當佢回憶佢哋嘅友情歲月時 佢覺得佢哋就好似一隻手嘅五隻手指 
"But also, being alive to my surroundings, I work in a high-rise in Midtown, and every night, before I leave the office, I have to push this button to get out, and the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator. ",於是，我用隻手做咗一個抽象嘅表達 小說裏面仲有好多故仔 同樣，封面背後都仲有好多嘢 
"And one night, all of a sudden, I looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn't really noticed it before. ",依家四條手指變成 東京地鐵嘅四條路線 呢個細節喺故事裡邊好重要 
"Big red circle, danger. ",呢條冇色嘅地鐵路線 同其他四條相交 就好似多崎造喺本書度 逐個朋友搵返 
"And I thought this was so obvious that it had to have been done a zillion times, and so I did a Google image search, and I couldn't find another book cover that looked quite like this, and so this is really what solved the problem, and graphically it's more interesting and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L.A. and America. ",問佢哋點解噉對佢 
"[""'Gulp' A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach.""] Mary Roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all; she makes them really fun. ",呢個就係棟喺我嘅辦公室嘅 立體嘅成品 我期望嘅封面效果係 佢有足夠嘅神秘感 吸引你去讀呢本書 同破解佢，明白設計嘅真正意圖 
"So in this particular case, it's about the human digestive system. ",「視覺白話」 係一種運用熟悉嘅神秘感手法 
So I'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be. ,咩意思？ 
This is a self-portrait. (Laughter) Every morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror to see if my tongue is black. ,即係整到佢似其他嘢 視覺白話 就係將我哋睇慣咗嘅一啲嘢 應用喺另一啲嘢 使我睇到唔同嘅嘢 
"And if it's not, I'm good to go. ",我將呢個方法用喺 David Sedaris 嘅散文集 書名係《你所需要嘅美麗》 難就難喺 個標題其實冇任何意思 
(Laughter) I recommend you all do this. ,又冇同書裡邊嘅任何一章有關係 
"But I also started thinking, here's our introduction. ",佢係作者嘅男朋友發夢諗出嚟嘅 
Right? Into the human digestive system. ,真係唔該曬（笑聲） 通常我以文字內容為基礎做設計 但係啲文字就係噉 
"But I think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths, at least based on this, are off-putting. (Laughter) So for the cover, then, I had this illustration done which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it's best to approach the digestive system from this end. ",個書名又其實咩都冇講 我就諗 有咩係又有神秘感 但係又冇意思？ 
(Laughter) I don't even have to complete the sentence. All right. ,果然，冇幾耐 有晚我去吃中餐之後，呢個出現咗 我諗：「啊，度橋度到有高潮！」 （笑聲） 我好鍾意幸運曲奇裡邊 又搞笑又神秘嘅短句 睇起嚟好似好有深度 但再諗下，其實冇深度 
"[""Unuseful mystery""] What happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up? ",呢個講：「冇人知道 忽視未來會帶嚟幾多好處。」 
And we see this all the time. ,唔該曬（笑聲） 如果我哋將視覺白話用喺 Sedaris 先生度 我哋好清楚幸運曲奇嘅外貌 清楚到睇到個字條，就知道係幸運曲奇 
This is what I call unuseful mystery. ,我哋睇到呢個奇怪嘅書名 我哋知道我哋好鍾意 David Sedaris 所以會好期待呢本書 
I go down into the subway -- I take the subway a lot -- and this piece of paper is taped to a girder. ,David Rakoff 係一個好好嘅作家 佢將佢嘅第一本書命名為《騙局》 因為雜誌社畀咗佢一個 佢根本勝任唔到嘅工怍 
"Right? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh, and the train's about to come and I'm trying to figure out what this means, and thanks a lot. ",之後佢一個瘦蜢蜢嘅城市人 俾《智族》雜誌派去科羅拉多河度漂流 睇下死唔死得 
"Part of the problem here is that they've compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful, and frankly, I don't think it is at all. ",之後，佢仲要返嚟寫報導 佢覺得自己做咗老千 佢覺得佢喺度寫緊同自己不乎嘅嘢 
So this is mystery we do not need. ,所以，我都要整一個 引起假象嘅封面 而個封面會印埋讀者嘅表情 
"What we need is useful clarity, so just for fun, I redesigned this. ",噉就令我諗起塗鴉 
This is using all the same elements. ,我對塗鴉好痴迷 
"(Applause) Thank you. I am still waiting for a call from the MTA. (Laughter) You know, I'm actually not even using more colors than they use. ",我諗任何一個城市人 都會經常見到各式各樣嘅塗鴉 
"They just didn't even bother to make the 4 and the 5 green, those idiots. (Laughter) So the first thing we see is that there is a service change, and then, in two complete sentences with a beginning, a middle and an end, it tells us what the change is and what's going to be happening. ",呢張係我喺紐約下東城區影嘅相 一個行人道上嘅變電箱 俾塗鴉畫到花曬 
"Call me crazy! (Laughter) [""Useful mystery""] All right. ",你可能會話：「佢喺街上幾好得意啊」 或者：「呢個係非法使用財產」 但我哋都同意 根本讀唔出講乜 
"Now, here is a piece of mystery that I love: packaging. ",係咪？讀唔到任何明確訊息 
This redesign of the Diet Coke can by Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art. ,另外一種塗鴉仲好玩 我稱佢為評論式塗鴉 
"But part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer is that he's taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke -- the typefaces, the colors, the silver background -- and he's reduced them to their most essential parts, so it's like going back to the Charlie Brown face. ",呢個係我最近喺地鐵拍嘅 有時你會睇到好多咸濕、白痴嘅嘢 但係我覺得呢個好有趣 有張海報 上面寫住：「嘩嘩 Airbnb」 有人用筆喺上邊加字 
"It's like, how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have about this thing? ",呢個引起我嘅注意 
"It looks great, and you would go into a delicatessen and all of a sudden see that on the shelf, and it's wonderful. ",於是我諗，點樣將佢用喺個封面度? 
"Which makes the next thing -- [""Unuseful clarity""] -- all the more disheartening, at least to me. ",我讀咗作者本書 我諗，呢個人唔係佢自己講嘅自己 佢係個老千 
"So okay, again, going back down into the subway, after this came out, these are pictures that I took. ",於是，我攞支紅筆 發憫憎噉喺封面上亂畫 
Times Square subway station: Coca-Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising. Okay? ,搞掂（笑聲） 上頭竟然批准咗！（笑聲） 作者鐘意，出版商鐘意 於是個封面就出咗世 見到有人喺地鐵讀呢本書 或者行嗰時攞住 我都覺得好搞笑 因為佢哋睇起嚟都好似癲癲哋咁 
And maybe some of you know where this is going. ,（笑聲） James Ellroy 係個好叻嘅犯罪小說作家 我同佢係好朋友，合作咗好多年 
Ahem. ,佢最出名嘅書係 《黑色大麗花》同《洛杉磯嘅秘密》 
"You moved to New York with the clothes on your back, the cash in your pocket, and your eyes on the prize. 
You're on Coke. (Laughter) ""You moved to New York with an MBA, one clean suit, and an extremely firm handshake. ",呢本係佢最新嘅作品，個名好神秘 肯定好多人知道佢嘅意思 但係好多人唔知 
"You're on Coke."" (Laughter) These are real! (Laughter) Not even the support beams were spared, except they switched into Yoda mode. (Laughter) ""Coke you're on."" (Laughter) [""Excuse me, I'm on WHAT??""] This campaign was a huge misstep. ",本書講一個日裔美籍偵探 喺 1941年 洛杉磯調查一單謀殺案 
"It was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash and all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web -- (Laughter) -- and also that dot next to ""You're on,"" that's not a period, that's a trademark. ",期間，珍珠港事件爆發 然後雪上加霜 種族關係變得好緊張 日裔美國人開始俾政府送去拘留營 形勢緊張，人心惶惶 但係佢繼續查案 
So thanks a lot. ,我一開始嗰陣，我齋從字面意思考慮 然後就將珍珠港嘅景搬到去洛杉磯 成個畫面就係末日嘅景像 
"So to me, this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably, clearly wrong. ",我嘅主編話： 「有意思， 不過我想你簡化啲。」 
It was just incredible to me. ,於是我同平時噉，返去用繪圖板畫 
"So I just hope that I've been able to share with you some of my insights on the uses of clarity and mystery in my work, and maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life, or maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over-sharing. ",但我留意到自己嘅工作環境 我嘅辦公室喺紐約市中城嘅高樓大廈 每晚，我離開辦公室之前 要㩒呢個掣 又大又重嘅玻璃門先會打開 我先入到𨋢 
"(Laughter) And if there's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk, I hope it's this: Blih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih. [""'Judge This,' Chip Kidd""] Blih blih blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. ",有一晚 我突然用一個全新嘅視角去睇部𨋢 
Blah blah. ,大紅點，危險 
(Applause) ,我就諗，佢噉明顯 肯定俾人用過好多次 於是我去谷歌查 竟然揾唔到有類似封面嘅書 於是乎，搞掂！ 圖像本身變得更加有趣 用喺洛杉磯乃至美國上空嚟表現日出 又顯得更加有張力 
,Mary Roach 嘅書《Gulp》 Mary Roach 係一個好好嘅作家 佢將沉悶嘅科學話題 變得好有趣 
"In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia, I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city. ",呢本書有關人體消化系統 
"At the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown, and it happened that the minaret was built in '94. ",我喺度諗，個封面要點設計 
"And for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey. ",呢個係我嘅自拍相 （笑聲） 日日朝早，我都會對住我藥櫃塊鏡 睇下我條脷係唔係黑色 
"When I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do, he was like, ""Thank God you finally came,"" and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. ",如果唔係 我就行得喇 
"The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything -- neither a sketch, or what I was going to write. ",（笑聲） 我建議你哋都噉做 
"In every work that I create, I write messages with my style of calligraffiti -- a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. ",同時我亦開始諗 呢個係我哋嘅「入口」 
I use quotes or poetry. ,係咪？人體消化系統嘅入口 
"For the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran, so I picked this verse: ""Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female, and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other."" ",我諗大家會同意 人體口腔嘅相 或者基於佢嘅作品 都係核突嘅（笑聲） 所以我同個封面畫咗個 更容易俾人接受嘅插圖 同時強調消化系統係從呢度開始 
"It was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media. ",（笑聲） 我都唔使講完句話你都明…… 
"I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting, and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. ",「冇用嘅神秘感」 當明確性同神秘感撈埋一齊 會發生咩？ 
"For the imam, it was not just the painting; it was really deeper than that. ",我哋隨時見得到 
"He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city, and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia. ",冇用嘅神秘感嘅例子 
"The universality of the message, the political context of Tunisia at this time, and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant. ",我行入地鐵，我經常搭地鐵 睇到個柱上有呢張紙 
It reunited the community. ,我就諗，死喇 班地鐵到喇 我仲未睇明個告示講咩 真係唔該曬 
"Bringing people, future generations, together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do. ",其中一個問題係 佢哋以為噉劃分訊息對我哋好有幫助 但老實講句，我覺得冇咩用 
Writing messages is the essence of my artwork. ,呢個就係我哋唔需要嘅神秘感 
"What is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing. ",我哋需要有用嘅明確性 於是乎，我貪玩噉重新設計佢 
You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece. ,用嘅元素一樣 
I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes. ,（掌聲） 多謝 我仲等緊地鐵公司嘅電話 你睇下，我都冇用多一種顏色 
There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate. ,佢哋甚至懶到冇將 4 同 5 變綠色 成班蠢人（笑聲） 宜家我哋睇到嘅第一條訊息係 車次有變動 然後有兩句完整嘅話， 有開始，有過程，有結尾 佢講清楚咩車次變咗，有咩後續安排 
"Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe; to you, to you, to you, to anybody, and then when you get the meaning, you feel connected to it. ",話我癲都係噉話（笑聲） 有用嘅神秘，好 
"I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting, but messages that have a universal dimension, so anybody around the world can connect to it. ",呢個係我鍾意嘅神秘： 包裝 
"I was born and raised in France, in Paris, and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18. ",呢款 Turner Duckworth 再版設計嘅 健怡可樂罐 對於我嚟講 係一件真正嘅藝術品，真係好靚 
Today I only write messages in Arabic. ,作為一個設計師，我欣賞佢嘅地方係 Turner 將健怡可樂嘅視覺白話︰ 招牌嘅字體、顏色，同銀色嘅背景 濃縮到最精華 所以，就好似卡通人物 查理．布朗塊面咁 
"One of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world. ",畀你嘅訊息啱啱好、冇多冇少 既會畀啲訊息你 又照顧到你已經知嘅部分 
"In Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa, who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela, and then I painted it on the rooftop. ",真係好正 當你行入個熟食店 貨架上嘅佢就會投射入你眼中 
"The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing, but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy, they thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece. ",真係好正 下一個，「冇用嘅清晰度」 起碼對我嚟講，更加令我心煩 
"In South Africa, in Cape Town, the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum. ",咁，我哋再返返去地鐵站 健怡可樂嘅設計出嚟之後 佢哋做咗海報 
"It was a school, and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela, saying, ""[in Arabic],"" which means, ""It seems impossible until it's done."" ",喺時代廣場地鐵站 可口可樂買曬全部廣告位 
"Then this guy came to me and said, ""Man, why you don't write in English?"" ",可能有人知道跟住會發生咩 
"and I replied to him, ""I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu."" ",嗯 
"In Paris, once, there was this event, and someone gave his wall to be painted. ",「你嚟紐約時就得件外套、幾蚊雞， 意住個獎，同埋吸緊毒。」（笑聲） 
"And when he saw I was painting in Arabic, he got so mad -- actually, hysterical -- and he asked for the wall to be erased. ",「你嚟紐約時就得 一個商科學位、一套西裝， 同一隻握手有力嘅手。 
I was mad and disappointed. ,你吸緊毒。」（笑聲） 全部都係真嘅！（笑聲） 連條柱都唔放過 不過換成尤達大師嘅風格（笑聲） 「毒，你吸咗。」（笑聲） 「唔好意思，我咩？」 呢個廣告活動嚴重失誤 
"But a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back, and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house. ",俾消費者強烈抗拒 幾乎一上架就落架 仲俾好多人喺網上惡搞 （笑聲） 仲有，「You're on」隔離嘅點 唔係句號， 係註冊商標 
"So, this guy -- (Laughter) like, was forced to see it every day. ",真係唔該曬 
"At the beginning, I was going to write, ""[In Arabic],"" which means, ""In your face,"" but -- (Laughter) I decided to be smarter and I wrote, ""[In Arabic],"" which means, ""Open your heart."" ",對我嚟講，真係好奇怪 點解佢哋嘅包裝做得噉神秘 噉精彩、噉完美 然後做文字嗰時就錯到 一塌糊塗、噉痛苦 
"I'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork. ",真係匪夷所思 
"And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know, with the beauty of Arabic script. ",所以，我希望你哋明白到 我嘅作品裡邊 明確性同神秘感嘅用法 然後或者你哋會決定 喺生活裡邊加多啲明確性 又或者加啲神秘感 但又唔好過量嘅資訊 
"Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. ",（笑聲） 如果我今次有一個主題 我希望係呢個： 嗶哩嗶哩嗶哩吧啦，吧啦吧啦嗶哩嗶哩 吧啦吧啦吧啦吧啦吧啦 吧啦吧啦吧啦 
"I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken, as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning, as you can enjoy any music from other countries. ",吧啦 
"Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door, but for me, it's more an invitation -- to my language, to my culture, and to my art. ",（掌聲） 
Thank you. ,
(Applause) ,2012 年 我响我家鄉，突尼斯嘅加貝斯 幫哈拉清真寺髹油嗰陣 從來都冇諗過 塗鴉可以令咁多人關注一個城市 
,我最初純粹想喺鄉下搵一幅牆 無意間得知 呢座尖塔自 1994 年起好之後 
"For more than 100 years, the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments. ",幅 57 米高嘅石屎牆 18 年嚟都冇粉飾過 
"For much of this time, this assistance was manual. ",我第一次同教長見面嗰時 我講佢知我嘅諗法 佢就話:「謝天謝地，你終於嚟喇！」 佢同我講 咁多年嚟，佢都希望有人粉飾幅牆 
Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand. ,最正嘅係 呢個教長冇問過我任何嘢 無論係畫乜，定係我想寫乜 
Calls were recorded to tape. ,每次我創作塗鴉 我都會用一種屬於我嘅風格 揉合咗書法同塗鴉 
"But as in so many other industries, computing has changed everything. ",我會引用一啲語錄或者詩句 
The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks. ,我諗既然係座寺廟 寫上可蘭經經文就最啱喇 所以我揀咗呢句 「眾人啊！ 我確已從一男一女創造你們， 我使你們成為許多民族和宗族， 以便你們互相認識。」 
I want that to sink in for a second: Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. ,呢句表達咗回教徒對世界大同嘅渴求 同傳媒所塑造嘅回教並唔一樣 
First and foremost. ,我好鼓舞，因為家鄉嘅人好鍾意幅塗鴉 而各地都有報導呢幅塗鴉 令到地方嘅人引以為傲 
"So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse, your children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone, someone could be listening. ",對教長嚟講，呢幅唔止係塗鴉 背後意義深遠得多 
"Now, that someone might be your own government; it could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service, or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system, that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies. ",教長希望尖塔可以 代表到呢個城市 吸引人到訪呢個 被遺忘嘅突尼斯小城 
"But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority, Silicon Valley companies have not. ",塗鴉所盛載嘅信念 突尼斯而家嘅局勢 同埋我嘅可蘭經塗鴉 全部都意義重大 
"And increasingly, over the last couple years, Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult. ",因為佢哋將人凝聚起嚟 
"For example, many of you might have an iPhone, and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone, those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped. ",我好想帶領群眾同下一代 一齊領略阿拉伯文嘅書法 
"And in fact, according to Apple, they're not able to even see the text messages themselves. ",文字訊息係我創作嘅精髓 
"Likewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones, that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped. ",有趣嘅係 連講阿拉伯話嘅人 都要花時間思考我寫嘅訊息 
And it's not just Apple. ,即使睇唔明，亦可以心領神會 
"WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, also has built strong encryption technology into its product, which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments, often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages. ",我諗阿拉伯文字就係未見其字 
"So, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call -- anytime, anywhere -- you might imagine that government officials are not very happy. ",就已經可以同我哋嘅靈魂接觸 當中嘅美麗，超越一切語言 
"And in fact, that's what's happening. ",阿拉伯嘅文字會向人說話 向你，向你，向你，向所有人 當你掌握到段文字嘅意思 你會馬上心領神會 
Government officials are extremely mad. ,我次次髹油都同自己講 寫嘅訊息要同個地方有關 但同時要關乎整個世界 以至全世界嘅人都有所共鳴 
And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available. ,我喺巴黎出世同長大 我 18 歲嗰年開始學阿拉伯文 
What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default. ,而家我只會用阿拉伯文創作 
It's the default piece that matters. ,呢種堅持之所以咁重要 係源於各地嘅人向我表達過嘅感受 
"In short, the tech companies have democratized encryption. ",喺里約熱內盧 我翻譯過一篇 詩人 Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa 嘅詩 詩歌頌揚貧民窟嘅人 然後我將呢首詩寫咗喺天棚 
"And so, government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron, they believe that all communications -- emails, texts, voice calls -- all of these should be available to governments, and encryption is making that difficult. ",當地人初初唔明我做緊乜 但當我解釋咗首詩畀佢哋聽 佢哋好感動 因為覺得有所共鳴 
"Now, look -- I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. ",喺南非開普敦嘅菲歷彼貧民窟 裡面唯一嘅石屎牆， 就係學校嘅外牆 
"We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world, and there really are bad people out there. ",我寫咗一句曼德拉嘅名言 就係「 [ 阿拉伯文 ] 」 意思係「人成功前，總認定會失敗」 
There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor. ,然係有個人走嚟問︰ 「做乜唔用英文寫啫？」 
But those surveillance features come at a cost. ,我就答佢：「我會聽你講嘅， 如果你係問我 點解唔用祖魯文寫嘅話。」 
"The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop, or a drug dealer's cell phone. ",巴黎曾經有一個活動 有個人想人哋為佢髹牆 
We all use the same communications devices. ,當佢見我喺牆上 用阿拉伯文字塗鴉嘅時候 佢成個人癲咗，失控咁滯 並且要求鏟走幅塗鴉 
"What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted, then so can the rest of ours, too. ",嗰刻我又嬲又失望 
And I think we really need to ask: Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly? ,過咗一個禮拜，統籌單位叫我返去 話我知嗰個人間屋係對住一幅牆 
So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described -- this is not imaginary. ,所以，呢個人… （笑聲） 就被逼日日對住幅塗鴉 
"In 2009, the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks -- the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police -- those systems were compromised by the Chinese government, because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring. ",起初，我喺幅牆度寫 [ 阿拉伯文 ] 即係解「就喺你面前」 （笑聲） 之後我靈機一觸 寫咗做「[ 阿拉伯文 ]」 解「打開心扉」 
"By the same token, in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece -- Greece's largest telephone company -- was compromised by an unknown entity, and that feature, the surveillance feature, was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet. ",我為我嘅文化而自豪 我希望用藝術去宣揚我嘅文化 
The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught. ,我希望借助美麗嘅阿拉伯文字 去打破大家嘅成見 
"And really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors. ",今日，我唔再喺牆上翻譯我嘅文字 
"When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it. ",我唔想破壞書法同詩歌嘅美 詩係藝術，唔需要言明，亦感悟得到 正如我哋會聽唔同語言嘅音樂一樣 
"You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys. ",有人認為咁樣係製造緊隔膜 但我反而覺得係一個邀請 邀請大家去體會我嘅母語、文化同創作 
"And so for that reason, I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible. ",多謝！ 
"Yes, this means that in the future, encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. ",（掌聲） 
It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys. ,
"But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies. ",過百年嚟 電話公司一直協助政府監聽 
And I don't want to live in that kind of world. ,好多時協助監聽嘅工作係靠人手 
"And so right now, you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets, you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are, or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are. ",監聽係以人手方式進行 線路係由人手接駁 
"And so, my message to you is this: We need to use these tools. ",線路裏面嘅通話會被錄到去錄音帶裡邊 
We need to secure our telephone calls. ,就好似其他好多嘅行業一樣 電腦改變咗所有嘢 
I want you to use these tools. ,電話公司喺佢哋網路嘅核心地方 設置咗監聽功能 
"I want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues: Use these encrypted communications tools. ",對於呢樣嘢我想停一停 原來喺我哋通話用嘅電話同網絡 首要考慮嘅嘢係監聽 
"Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure. ",係優先而且最重要 
Thank you. ,意思即係話當你同配偶 小朋友、同事、醫生喺度講電話時 有人可以聽到你哋嘅對話 
(Applause) ,嗰個人可能係你嘅政府 亦可以係外國政府、一間外國情報機構 駭客、犯案嘅人 跟蹤者或者監視者 抑或任何攻得入監聽系統嘅人 佢哋都可以入侵電話公司嘅監聽系統 
,但當電話公司以監聽為首要嘅時候 矽谷嘅科技公司就冇噉樣做 
"I was raised by lesbians in the mountains, and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back. ",而且喺過去幾年 矽谷嘅科技公司愈嚟愈 喺佢哋嘅通訊產品裏面 發展強大嘅加密技術 令到監聽非常之困難 
"(Laughter) Really messed with my head, but I'll get into that later. ",譬如話你哋好多人都用 iPhone 如果你用 iPhone 傳送短訊 俾其他用 iPhone 嘅人 嗰啲短訊無法輕易噉俾人截取到 
I'll start with when I was eight years old. ,而事實上跟據蘋果公司所講 佢哋自己都冇辦法睇到短訊內容 
"I took a wood box, and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado. ",同樣，如果你用 FaceTime 同你嘅朋友或者心愛嘅人 做音訊通話或者視像通話嘅話 同樣都係無法輕易俾人截取到嘅 
"And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas, maybe how we ate our spaghetti. ",而且唔只係蘋果 
I really didn't know. ,宜家由臉書擁有、全世界用戶有幾億嘅 Whatsapp 都已經喺佢嘅產品裡面 加咗強大嘅加密系統 呢樣亦代表咗聖公會南半球聯盟嘅人都 唔使喺佢哋政府 —— 通常係專制政府 截取佢哋嘅短訊嘅情況下輕易噉通訊 
"Anyway, this is kind of funny, because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes. ",經過一百年嚟 都可以任何時間同任何地方偷聽電話 你都想像到政府官員 對於唔可以再偷聽會非常唔高興 
"Now, at some point I was in Hawaii -- I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff, and I was making a collage for my ma. ",而且事實上 呢樣嘢係發生梗嘅 
"And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up, and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid, and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck. ",政府官員宜家好癲 
"Now, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them, so I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something. ",他哋之所以癲並唔係因為 呢啲加密工具出現咗 
"Instead, the opposite happened: It sort of created a magnification, like a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text. ",佢哋最嬲嘅 係科技公司已經將加密功能 擺喺佢哋產品裡面 而且透過預設將佢哋開著 
So what did I do? I built more boxes. ,預設至係重點 
"This time, I started putting electronics, frogs, strange bottles I'd find in the street -- anything I could find -- because I was always finding things my whole life, and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects. ",簡單嚟講 科技公司令加密技術體現咗民主 
"So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space! ",於是政府官員，好似英國首相卡梅倫噉 都認為所有通訊內容 無論係電郵、短訊、語音通話 都應該係可以俾政府獲取到嘅 而加密技術令到呢件事困難 
"I can make free-floating lines, like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene. ",我宜家對於佢哋嘅睇法超級同情 
"So I took the objects out, and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens. ",我哋唔單止活喺一個危險嘅時候 仲係活喺一個危險嘅世界 嗰度真係有壞人 
"First, botanical -- which you can kind of get a sense of. ",有恐怖分子同其他嚴重嘅國家安全威脅 我估我哋都想聯邦調查局 同國土安全部去監察著 
Then I made some weird insects and creatures. ,但係呢啲監控工作係有成本嘅 
It was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin. ,噉係因為嗰度冇一樣嘢叫 恐怖分子手提電腦 或者毒販手機 
"And it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff, I was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner, and like, go to Sizzler. ",我哋都用梗同一樣通訊設備 
"It was some good shit, man. ",意思係假如毒販嘅電話通話 或者恐怖份子嘅電話通話可以被截聽 我哋都一樣可以俾人截聽 
"(Laughter) At some point, I got up to the human form, life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers. ",我諗我哋真係需要去問 世界上十億嘅人應唔應該仲用 呢啲方便人哋監聽嘅設備呢？ 
"This was great, except for one thing: I was going to die. ",所以我頭先講嘅入侵監聽系統 並唔非係憑空想像嘅 
"I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me. ",喺 2009 年 谷歌同微軟喺佢哋網絡加設嘅監控系統 一個喺警方合法要求監聽嗰陣 佢哋會提供資料嘅系統 就俾中國政府所破解咗 因為中國政府想搵出 美國政府監察佢哋邊個特務 
And I went to bed every night thinking about it. ,另一宗破解發生喺2004 年 不明來歷嘅人攻入咗 希臘最大嘅電話公司 「 Vodafone 希臘」網絡裡面嘅監聽系統 個監聽系統就噉俾人 用嚟偷聽希臘總理嘅通話 同埋內閣成員嘅通話 
So I tried using glass. ,做呢單嘢嘅外國政府或者駭客 始終冇被搵到 
"I started drawing on the layers of glass, almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window, and another window, and you had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition. ",冇錯 監聽系統或者後門存在著好大問題 
"And this really worked, because I could stop using the resin. ",當你喺通訊網絡或者喺一件科技裏面 整一個後門 你無法子控制邊個會穿過呢個後門 
"So I did this for years, which culminated in a very large work, which I call ""The Triptych."" ",你冇辦法控制到底邊個會用呢道門 無論係你自己嘅人、人哋 好人抑或壞人 
"The Triptych was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's ""[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"" which is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain. ",所以呢個原因我認為 盡可能建立一個安全嘅網絡會比較好 
Do you guys know this painting? ,呢樣意味著將來 加密技術會令監聽更加困難 
"Good, it's a cool painting. ",意味著警察花喺拉人嘅時間會更艱巨 
"It's kind of ahead of its time, they say. ",但如果唔噉做嘅話 我哋就要活喺一個世界 任何人嘅通話、短訊都可以俾犯案嘅人 跟蹤者或者監視者 同埋外國情報機關監聽 
"So, ""The Triptych."" I'll walk you through this piece. ",而我唔想活喺噉樣嘅世界裡面 
"It weighs 24,000 pounds. ",所以宜家你可能會有工具阻止政府 喺你電話、喺你手機裡面 一早進行嘅好多唔同形式嘅監聽 你只係可能唔清楚啲工具 有幾強大、幾安全 或者調返轉你一直通訊嘅方式有幾渣 
"It's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition. ",所以我想帶出嘅訊息係 我哋需要用呢啲工具 
It's kind of weird. ,去保障我哋通話同短訊嘅保安 
"(Laughter) To the left, you have Jesus and the locusts. ",我希望你哋利用呢啲工具 
There's a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds. ,話俾你哋深愛嘅人、同事知 叫佢地用加密咗嘅通訊工具 
"They go from the representational world, to this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding. ",唔好因為平同易用就用佢哋 要因為有保安至好用佢哋 
"This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse, and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean. ",多謝 
The ocean is made up of thousands of elements. ,（掌聲） 
This is a bird god tied up to a battleship. ,
"(Laughter) Billy Graham is in the ocean; the Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter -- there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard, in the ocean. ",我細個喺美國山脈地區 由女同性戀者湊大 我最初嚟到紐約嗰陣 我就好似一個森林野人 
"Anyway, this is a lady creature. ",（笑聲） 嗰時頭腦超混亂 我一陣番轉頭再講 
"She's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand. ",我會由我八歲嗰時講起 
"Her hands are like scales, and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance. ",我喺科羅拉多嗰陣拎咗個木盒 放咗一蚊美金、一枝筆 同一隻叉喺個盒入面 
"So that's one side of ""The Triptych."" ",我諗 500 年後會有某種人猿類動物 或者外星人發現呢個盒 從中知道我哋呢個物種點樣交換諗法 或者知道我哋點樣食意粉 
It's a little narrative thing. ,其實我都唔係好清楚自己做乜 
That's her hand that she's spitting into. ,總言之，呢個諗法都幾得意 因為三十年後嘅我仲整緊呢嗰盒 
"And then, when you go to the other side, she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak, and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk. ",我之前喺夏威夷嘅時候 鍾意行山、滑浪等等奇怪嘅活動 我嗰時仲砌緊一幅嘢俾我阿媽 
"Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects ""The Triptych."" ",我撕爛咗本字典 將啲碎紙砌到好似 艾格尼絲 . 馬丁嘅網格噉 然後喺上面倒滿樹脂 點知有隻蜜蜂痴住咗喺上面 
"Anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano. ",因為我媽咪怕蜜蜂，而且會敏感 所以我唯有倒多啲樹脂落去 希望可以遮住隻蜜蜂 
(Laughter) I don't know why that happened. ,點知，事與願違 啲樹脂就好似放大鏡噉 將上面嘅野，包括蜜蜂，都放大咗 
"(Laughter) That happens, you know. ",噉我點收科？ 於是就整多幾個盒 
"Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball, made out of 1986 terrorist cards. ",今次，我將電子零件 青蛙、街上執番嚟嘅樽 任何我搵到嘅嘢擺入去 因為我嘅人生一直都喺度尋尋覓覓 嘗試令唔同嘅物件之間有一個關係 用呢啲物件去串連一個故仔 
Have you guys seen those? ,於是我開始對住啲嘢畫呀畫 然後我發現 咦喂！原來我可以凌空畫！ 
"They were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists. ",我可以畫出浮喺空中嘅線條 就好似喺案發現場圍住個屍體畫線噉 
Way ahead of their time. ,於是我拎件嘢出嚟 畫咗啲我想像出嚟嘅嘢 
(Laughter) That will bring you to my latest project. ,首先係植物 你應該睇得出似啲乜 
"I'm in the middle of two projects: One's called ""Psychogeographies."" ",然後又畫咗啲奇怪嘅昆蟲同生物 
It's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans. ,喺一層層嘅樹脂上面畫畫真係好好玩 
"Each one is an archive of our culture, through our ripped-up media and matter, whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines. ",而且仲好正添！ 因為我開始有表演接 我開始有收入 可以帶女朋友出街食晚飯 好似去 Sizzler 噉 
"But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time. ",正到要嗌出嚟啦！ 
"They're like cells -- they come together, they divide. ",（笑聲） 畫畫下，我開始畫咗個人形 畫咗個真人咁高嘅樹脂雕塑 裏邊仲有仔細嘅紋路 
And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years. ,呢樣嘢係好玩，但係有一個問題 我會就快死 
"Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside. ",我唔知點算好，因為樹脂會殺死我 
This one has a little cave in his chest. ,晚晚我瞓覺之前都喺度諗點樣先好 
"That's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning. ",於是我試下用玻璃 
"I'm going to go down the body for you: There's a waterfall coming out of his chest, covering his penis -- or not-penis, or whatever it is, a kind of androgynous thing. ",喺每一層玻璃上面畫畫 就好似你喺一塊窗上面畫完 再放另一塊窗喺上面繼續畫 然後再放另一塊，層層疊咁 形成一個立體嘅作品 
"I'll take you quickly through these works, because I can't explain them for too long. ",於是今次真係得咗 因為我可以唔駛再用樹脂 
"There are the layers, you can kind of see it. ",就係噉我畫窗玻璃畫咗幾年 加加埋埋成為咗一件大形作品 
That's a body getting split in half. ,我叫佢做「三聯畫」 三聯畫靈感主要嚟自 耶羅尼米斯 · 博斯嘅《人間樂園》 呢幅畫而家掛喺西班牙嘅 普拉多博物館入面 
"This one has two heads, and it's communicating between the two heads. ",你哋知唔知我講緊邊幅畫？ 
"You can see the pills coming out, going into one head from this weird statue. ",好畫。呢幅畫好嘢嚟！ 
There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity. ,啲人話嗰時嚟講好新潮架！ 
Can you see that? ,而家等我同你哋講解下 我呢個三聯畫作品 
"Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes, like the boxes we're in. ","佢有 24,000 磅重、18 呎長 "
"This box we're in, the solar system is a box. ",雙面嘅，所以其實係 36 呎長 
This brings you to my latest box. ,有啲騎呢嘅 呢個係血噴泉 
It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works. ,（笑聲） 左邊可以見到耶穌同蝗蟲 
"(Cheers) Inside of this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school, a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world; a garden. ",呢度有個山窿 俾呢啲個頭係動物頭嘅生物 穿梭於兩個世界之間 
"We shake this box up, and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles. ",佢哋會由表象世界 走到一個儀錶式嘅網狀地下世界匿埋 
And I think that's the way you change the world. ,呢啲生物係喺燈塔隔離 準備大規模跳海自殺 
You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in. ,個海有過千種唔同嘅完素 
"And you come together to realize that we're all in this together, that this delusion of difference -- this idea of countries, of borders, of religion -- doesn't work. ",呢隻鳥神被綁喺戰船上面 
"We're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box. ",（笑聲） 葛培理喺個海度 地平線嗰度係一達油污 仲有威利、仲有拉登嘅棲身之所 你肯俾心機去睇個海嘅話 你可以搵到好多騎呢嘅嘢 
"And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely, we're all going to die real soon. ",呢個係一隻雌性物物 
Thank you very much. ,佢由個海度出嚟 佢吐出啲油落一隻手度 另一隻手就有啲雲走出嚟 
(Applause) ,佢對手就好似天平噉 就好似神話描述噉平衡住地球同宇宙 
,所以幅畫嘅呢一面 
"In the year 1901, a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt. ",係比較有故事性 
Auguste was delusional and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life. ,佢吐油落隻手度 
Her doctor was called Alois. ,而當你去睇幅畫嘅另一面 佢有一個好似象鼻或者鳥咀噉嘅嘢 會吐出一舊舊雲 
"Alois didn't know how to help Auguste, but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906. ",佢仲有一條 18 尺長嘅蛇尾連住幅畫 
"After she died, Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain -- the likes of which he'd never seen before. ",但佢條尾俾火山燒著咗 
Now here's the even more striking thing. ,（笑聲） 我都唔係好知點解會係噉 
"If Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago. ",（笑聲） 但你知啦，都發生咗 
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer. ,佢條尾最後有一個旋風形嘅眼球 係由 1986 年恐怖分子遊戲卡所整成 
And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease. ,你哋有冇見過？ 
"Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly. ",八十年代嘅嘢嚟 就好似恐怖份子嘅棒球明星卡噉 
"We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV, statins for heart disease and much more. ",佢哋嗰時係新潮 （笑聲） 
But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease. ,而家帶你哋睇下我最新嘅作品 
I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade. ,我而家其實做緊兩個計劃 一個叫做「心靈地圖」 
So I think about this all the time. ,呢個計劃大約為期六年 我要整 100 個噉樣嘅人形 
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide. ,每個人形都紀錄住我哋嘅文化 人形由唔同出版刊物嘅紙碎砌成 可以係百科全書、字典或者雜誌 
"But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people -- which, by the way, will include many of you. ",每一件作品都砌成人形 去紀錄我哋嘅世界 啲作品係一組組噉去郁 有啲 20 個一組，亦有 4 個 或者 12 個一組 
"If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older, your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two. ",佢哋就好似細胞咁 會黐埋一齊，亦會分開 
"In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's. ",當你就噉行過喺佢哋 其實我就花用咗好多年時間 
"Already in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year. ","每一個基本上係 一個重 3,000 磅嘅顯微鏡片 裏面有一個人係度 "
One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's. ,呢個人心口度有一個窿 
"It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050, as the baby boomer generation ages. ",呢個係佢個頭，呢個係個胸 呢個就係開始時候你可以睇到嘅樣 
"It may surprise you that, put simply, Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation. ",而家等我俾你哋睇下佢身體落啲嘅地方 呢度有一個瀑布由佢心口流出嚟 遮住佢下體 或者唔係下體，或者是旦一度 因為佢係雌雄同體 
But we've done relatively little to address it. ,等我好快噉介紹一下其他作品 因為我唔可以花太多時間解釋 
"Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down. ",你可以睇得出佢哋都係一層層噉嘅 
We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it. ,呢個人形嘅身體斷開兩截 
The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer. ,呢個人有兩個頭 兩個頭喺度溝通緊 
The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause: a lack of awareness. ,你可以睇到有啲丸仔飛出嚟 飛到呢個奇怪人形嘅其中一個頭度 
"Because here's what few people know but everyone should: Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it. ",佢心口嗰度有個樹林 
"For most of the past 114 years, everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging. ",睇唔睇到呀？ 
We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old. ,呢個演講嘅主題就係呢啲盒 就好似我哋身處嘅盒一樣 
But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease. ,我哋身處喺太陽系其實都好似一個盒 
"As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal. ",等我介紹我最後一個盒 
Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain a century ago. ,呢個盒用磚砌成 叫做「先鋒者，做緊嘢」 
"For almost a century, we didn't know much about these. ",（歡呼聲） 呢個盒入面有一名物理學家 一名神經學家、一名畫家、一名音樂家 一名作家、一間電台、一座博物館 一間學校，同埋一間出版社 將我哋喺度做嘅嘢話俾盒外面嘅世界知 裏面仲有個花園 
Today we know they're made from protein molecules. ,我哋搖下個盒 將入面嘅人好似粒子咁撞嚟撞去 
You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami. ,我諗呢個就係改變世界嘅方法 
There are spots on the paper that are sticky. ,重新定義自己同埋 我哋係裏面生活梗嘅呢個盒 
"And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside. ",就會發現同明白到 我哋之間嘅差異只不過係錯誤嘅睇法 國家、國界、宗教都係冇意義嘅 
"But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside. ",我哋其實都係喺同一個盒入面 由同一種物質所造成 
"This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other, forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles. ",如果我哋唔肯好好聲氣噉 去互相交換我哋所擁有嘅嘢 我哋好快就會一齊死架嘞！ 
That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. ,好多謝大家！ 
We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works. ,（全場鼓掌） 
"There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex -- like defusing a bomb. ",
Cutting one wire might do nothing. ,喺1901年 有一個叫 Auguste 嘅女士 被送到法蘭克福嘅醫療精神病院 
Cutting others might make the bomb explore. ,Auguste 有幻覺 甚至記唔起最簡單嘅生活細節 
"We have to find the right step to block, and then create a drug that does it. ",佢嘅醫生係 Alois 
"Until recently, we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best. ",Alois 唔知道點樣幫助佢 但佢仍然照顧佢 直至佢不幸喺 1906 年逝世 
"But now we've got together a diverse group of people -- medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians. ",病人死後，Alois 進行解剖 發現 Auguste 腦部 有唔尋常嘅班塊同物質纏結 佢從未見過呢種情況 
"And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease. ",唔單止噉，更震撼嘅發現仲有 
Now let me show you some of our latest results. ,如果 Auguste 今日仍然在世 我哋同 114 年前 Alois 可以幫佢做嘅嘢一樣不多 
No one outside of our lab has seen these yet. ,Alois 就係 Alois Alzheimer醫生 
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms. ,Alzheimer 中文譯做阿茲海默 而 Auguste Deter 就係第一位病人 被診斷我哋宜家叫嘅「阿茲海默症」 
"So these are healthy worms, and you can see they're moving around normally. ",自從 1901 年以黎 醫學發展迅速 
"These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules sticking together inside them -- like humans with Alzheimer's. ",我哋發現咗抗生素同發明咗疫苗 去預防傳染病 仲有好多抗癌療法 令愛滋病病毒喺抗病毒藥物 醫治心臟病嘅降膽固醇藥等等 
And you can see they're clearly sick. ,但係對於治療阿茲海默症 總係停滯不前 
"But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan. ",我係一班科學家裏面嘅其中一個 我過去十年一直搵一種 治療呢個病嘅方法 
"This is just an initial positive result, but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure. ",所以我成日都諗住呢樣嘢 
"After 114 years of waiting, there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years. ",阿茲海默症宜家影響全球四千萬人 
"But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help. ",到咗 2050 年 呢個病會影響 1.5 億人 在座好多人都會係其中一個 
This isn't about scientists like me -- it's about you. ,如果你諗著活到 85 歲或以上 你患阿茲海默症嘅機會幾乎係二分一 
"We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try, we can beat it. ",換言之，你一係喺你嘅黃金歲月 患上阿茲海默症 一係就照顧患呢個病嘅朋友或至親 
"In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and regulators. ",單喺美國每年就已經 花費咗二千億美元去照顧呢類病人 
That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s. ,聯邦醫療保險裏面每五蚊嘅支出 就有一蚊用咗喺阿茲海默症度 
"Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer. ",呢個病係當今最貴嘅病 隨著戰後嬰兒潮嘅人踏入老年 預計到 2050 年 成本會增加五倍 
But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves. ,你可能會覺得驚訝，簡單嚟講 呢個病係我哋呢一代 喺醫療同社會方面 遇到嘅其中一個最大挑戰 
"And their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day, are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change. ",但我哋做咗唔係好多去應付呢個問題 
"So, it really is down to you. ",今時今日全世界最多人死亡嘅十個原因 只有阿茲海默症係唔能夠預防 醫好或者推遲惡化 
"Alzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease. ",我哋對呢個病嘅認識比其他病少 因為相對其他病嘅研究 我哋投資咗少啲嘅時間同埋金錢落去 
Everyone with a brain is at risk. ,美國政府每一年花費喺癌症嘅研究 都比喺阿茲海默症高出十倍 即使阿茲海默症嘅醫療費用較高 而且毎年嘅死亡數字同癌症相若 
"Today, there are 40 million patients like Auguste, who can't create the change they need for themselves. ",呢個病之所以冇資源去研究，主要原因係 啲人仲未去關注呢個病 
"Help speak up for them, and help demand a cure. ",因為只係得少數人知道一樣嘢 但其實我哋每個人都需要知道呢樣嘢 就係阿茲海默症係一種病 而且係可以醫好嘅 
Thank you. ,喺過去114 年嘅大部分時間 所有人，包括科學家 都誤以為阿茲海默症係同年紀有關 
(Applause) ,我哋以前認為變得衰老 係老咗正常同無法避免嘅事 
,但只要睇下呢一幅圖 一個健康人嘅腦部 同阿茲海默症病人嘅腦部 可以睇到呢個病所做成嘅身體傷害 
"Interpreter: Piano, ""p,"" is my favorite musical symbol. ",仲會引致記憶同埋心理嚴重喪失 阿茲海默症對病人腦部造成損害 大大縮短病人夀命 而且往往係致命嘅 
It means to play softly. ,仲記得一個世紀前 Alois 喺 Auguste個 腦部 發現異常嘅斑塊同物質纏結 
"If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a ""p"" in the score, you need to play softer. ",過咗差唔多一個世紀 我哋仍然知道唔多 
Two p's -- even softer. ,今日我哋知道佢係用蛋白質分子構成 
Four p's -- extremely soft. ,你可以將蛋白質分子諗成係一張紙 用黎摺紙 
"This is my drawing of a p-tree, which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be, you'll never reach complete silence. ",紙面佈滿黐粒粒嘅點 
That's my current definition of silence: a very obscure sound. ,如果摺得正確，啲點會喺紙嘅入邊 
"I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language, ASL, plus a bit of my own background. ",但有時摺錯，啲點就會喺出面 
"French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s, and as time went by, mixed with local signs, it evolved into the language we know today as ASL. ",噉樣令到蛋白質分子 黐埋一齊，變成一舊 最後變咗斑塊同一團纒結嘅嘢 
So it has a history of about 200 years. ,阿茲海默病人嘅腦部就係咁樣 
"I was born deaf, and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life. ",我哋喺劍橋大學花咗十年 去了解呢種病變嘅原理 
And I believed it to be true. ,但係裏邊有好多個步驟 要搵出邊一步去停止成個運作 係好複雜嘅嘢 好似喺拆彈一樣 
"Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all. ",剪一條電線可能拆唔到彈 
"Sound was very much a part of my life, really, on my mind every day. ",但係剪多一條，又可能會爆炸 
"As a Deaf person living in a world of sound, it's as if I was living in a foreign country, blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms without ever questioning them. ",我哋必須搵到啱嘅一步去停咗去 然後研發一種藥可以噉樣一步到位打擊 
So how is it that I understand sound? ,直到最近，我哋將大部分時間 花喺阻止蛋白質演變嘅過程嗰度 希望得到好嘅結果 
"Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound. ",但係宜家我哋聯合不同界別嘅人士 有醫生、生物學家丶遺傳學家 化學家、物理學家、工程師同數學家 
"You people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound. ",大家一齊搵出嗰個關鍵嘅步驟 宜家我哋試梗一種新藥 針對阻止關鍵嘅嗰一步 令到個病可以消失 
I learn and mirror that behavior. ,宜家就由我帶你哋睇下 一啲最新嘅研發結果 
"At the same time, I've learned that I create sound, and I've seen how people respond to me. ",實驗室出面嘅人都從來未睇過 
"Thus I've learned, for example ... ",宜家俾大家睇嘅片段 係我哋用蟲去測試新藥嗰陣發生嘅嘢 
Don't slam the door! ,呢啲係健康嘅蟲 你可以睇到佢哋正常咁周圍行 
Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag! ,但呢批蟲 體內嘅蛋白質分子卻係黐埋一齊 就好似有阿茲海默症嘅人一樣 
"(Laughter) ""Don't burp, and when you're eating, make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate."" ",好清楚睇到佢哋係病咗 
"All of these things I term ""sound etiquette."" ",但如果我哋喺呢啲蟲病發初期， 俾啲新藥佢食，佢哋就會好返 可以健康生存到一般蟲嘅預期壽命 
Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does. ,呢啲支持嘅數據只係初步嘅結果 不過類似嘅研究證明咗 我哋係可以了解阿茲海默症 
I'm hyper-vigilant around sound. ,個病仲可以醫得到 等咗 114 年 終於有望喺以後嘅十至廿年 人類戰勝阿茲海默症 
"And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound, about what's to come next. ",為咗繼續燃點呢個希望 為咗最終能夠擊敗呢個病 
"Hence, this drawing. ",我哋需要幫手 唔係需要好似我噉嘅科學家 而係需要你 
"TBD, to be decided. ",你需要知道阿茲海默症係一種疾病 如果我哋肯嘗試，我哋可以打敗佢 
"TBC, to be continued. ",至於其他病 病人同家人已經一早帶頭推動更多嘅研究 向政府丶藥劑業、科學家同監管機構 施加壓力 
"TBA, to be announced. ",呢樣對於八十年代後期 HIV 治療嘅進步係非常重要嘅 
And you notice the staff -- there are no notes contained in the lines. ,今日見到同樣一股動力去對抗癌症 
That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears. ,但阿茲海默症病人就唔能夠 表達自己嘅意見 
"In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound. ",當病人家屬，亦係隱形嘅受害人 日以繼夜照顧佢哋至親 到要出嚟推動改革嘅時候 佢哋通常都已經好疲倦 
"This is a sign for ""staff"" in ASL. ",所以宜家真係靠你哋 
A typical staff contains five lines. ,阿茲海默症對大多數人嚟講 都唔係一個遺傳病 
"Yet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural. ",每個人都有病發可能 
"That's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper. ",今時今日有將近四千萬嘅人 好似 Auguste 一樣 當佢哋唔能夠為自己帶嚟改變嘅時候 
"In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artist residency there. ",噉就請你哋幫佢哋發聲 要求獲得治療 
"Prior to this time, I had been working as a painter. ",多謝 
"During this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces, and as I went from one place to the next, I noticed there was no visual art there. ",（掌聲) 
"At that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ... ",
"there was no visual art, everything was auditory. ",口譯員︰英文單詞「鋼琴」 入邊個「p」係我最鍾意嘅樂符 
Now sound has come into my art territory. ,佢嘅意思係輕輕演奏 
Is it going to further distance me from art? ,如果你演奏緊一種樂器 同埋睇到一個「p」符 咁你就需要輕輕咁去演奏個音 
I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all. ,如果係兩個「p」咁就要更加之輕柔 
I actually know sound. ,如果係四個，咁就要極度輕柔 
I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears. ,呢個係我畫嘅「p 樹圖」 呢幅圖展示咗 無論圖入邊有幾多個 p 你永遠都唔會做到絕對安靜 
"It could be felt tactually, or experienced as a visual, or even as an idea. ",呢個就係而家我對安靜嘅定義︰ 「一個非常之模糊嘅音」 
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice. ,我想同大家分享一啲 關於美國手語（ASL）嘅歷史 同埋我個人嘅經歷 
"And everything that I had been taught regarding sound, I decided to do away with and unlearn. ",喺十九世紀早期 法國手語第一次傳到美國 隨著時間，佢慢慢同當地手語融合 跟住慢慢演化成 我哋而家熟悉嘅美國手語 
I started creating a new body of work. ,所以佢有將近兩百年嘅歷史 
"And when I presented this to the art community, I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received. ",我天生失聰 其他人一直同我講 聲音唔屬於我生活一部分 
"I realized: sound is like money, power, control -- social currency. ",所以我都相信係真嘅 
"In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing, a hearing person's thing. ",但係而家我意識到其實事實並唔係咁 
"And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork, or it could empower me. ",聲音其實係我生活嘅一部分 講真，佢日日都喺我腦海中浮現 
I chose to be empowered. ,作為一個失聰嘅人 生活喺有聲音嘅世界裏邊 就好似我生活喺外國一樣 只有遵守當地規距、習慣、行為同標準 而從來都冇懷疑過 
There's a massive culture around spoken language. ,咁我點樣可以理解聲音？ 
"And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all. ",我其實係通過觀察人哋對聲音嘅反應 
So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice. ,你哋就好似我嘅揚聲器一樣擴大聲音 
"And that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today. ",我就學到同呼應你哋嘅反應 
"So at school, at work and institutions, I work with many different ASL interpreters. ",同時，我知道我發出咗聲音 同埋我睇到你哋點樣對我嘅聲音有反應 
And their voice becomes my voice and identity. ,所以我就學到好多嘢，譬如話 
They help me to be heard. ,唔好大力關門 
And their voices hold value and currency. ,你食薯條嗰陣唔好俾個袋製造太多噪音 
"Ironically, by borrowing out their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency, kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate. ",（笑聲） 唔好打嗝 仲有食飯果陣 唔好用餐具去刮個碟 
"If I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency. ",所有呢啲嘢 我都叫佢哋做「聲音儀態」 
"So with sound as my new art medium, I delved into the world of music. ",或者我會比正常人更加留意聲音儀態 
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL. ,我對聲音超級敏感 
"For example, a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper. ",我成日好惊，會成日準備聲音出現 惊有乜嘢會發生 
And the same holds true for a concept in ASL. ,所以呢，一齊嚟睇下呢幅畫 
They're both highly spatial and highly inflected -- meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds. ,TBD 嘅意思係留待決定 
"I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor, to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works. ",TBC 嘅意思係留待繼續 
"So, envision a piano. ",TBA 嘅意思係留待宣布 
ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters. ,你都可以睇得到 喺呢三行入邊，係冇音符嘅 
"If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano -- such as facial expression, body movement, speed, hand shape and so on, as you play the piano -- English is a linear language, as if one key is being pressed at a time. ",原因係呢三行其實通過化開咗嘅鉛筆痕 就已經包括埋聲音架啦 
"However, ASL is more like a chord -- all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL. ",喺聾人嘅世界入邊，動作同聲音係一樣 
"If just one of those keys were to change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning. ",呢個係「staff」嘅美國手語 
"The same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume. ",一個典型嘅「staff」有五行 
"In ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters, you can express different ideas. ",不過我如果用手指做成咁嘅樣 就會好唔自然 
"For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT. ",呢個就係點解我會喺紙上畫四行 
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT. ,2008 年，我有機會 以藝術家嘅身份定居柏林 
I'm looking at you. ,之前呢，我就有一段時間做過做過畫家 
Staring at you. ,暑假期間 我參觀咗唔同嘅博物館同畫廊 當我喺唔同嘅地方參觀嗰陣 我發覺呢啲地方都冇視覺藝術 
(Laughter) (Laughter) Oh -- busted. ,果時，聲音係主流 
(Laughter) Uh-oh. ,但我令我好託異嘅係 冇一樣嘢係視覺藝術 所有嘢都係聽覺 
What are you looking at? ,咁而家聲音嚟到我嘅藝術世界裏面啦 
"Aw, stop. ",但佢係唔係會令我遠離藝術呢？ 
"(Laughter) I then started thinking, ""What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?"" ",我意識到根本就唔係 
"If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over, it could become like a piece of visual music. ",其實我可以聽到聲音 
"For example, this is the sign for ""day,"" as the sun rises and sets. ",我係非常了解聲音嘅 因為我知道聲音唔剩係經耳仔感受得到 
"This is ""all day."" ",仲可以通過觸摸去感受佢 可以通過雙眼去睇佢 或者甚至通過諗法去感受佢 
"If I was to repeat it and slow it down, visually it looks like a piece of music. ",所以我決定重新擁有聲音 並且將佢融入到我嘅藝術創作當中 
All ... day. ,其他人教過我有關聲音嘅嘢 我決定揼曬佢哋，將佢哋忘記 
"I feel the same holds true for ""all night."" ",我決定做一個同聲音有關嘅工作 
All night. ,當我將呢個工作介紹俾藝術社群嘅時候 見到咁多人支持同專心聽，我非常感動 
"This is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing. ",我意識到 聲音就好似錢、權力、控制咁 呢啲嘅社會話語權 
"And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights: ""last night,"" ""overnight,"" (Sings) ""all night long."" ",喺我腦海裏邊，我一直覺得聲音 係屬於你哋可以聽到聲音嘅人嘅物品 
(Laughter) I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two. ,聲音嘅力量好大 佢可以令我同我嘅藝術黯然失色 同時佢都可以令到我更加有力量 
(Laughter) This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time. ,我選擇變得更加有力量 
"For example, 1H is one hand, 2H is two hand, present tense happens closest and in front of the body, future is in front of the body and the past is to your back. ",口語當中包含大量文化 
"So, the first example is ""a long time ago."" ",而因為我唔會用我把聲去講嘢 喺社會眼中，就好似我冇得發言一樣 
"Then ""past,"" ""used to"" and the last one, which is my favorite, with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it, ""once upon a time."" ",所以我需要同可以平等看待我嘅人 共事、幫我發聲 
"(Laughter) ""Common time"" is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure. ",通過呢種方式 我可以喺社會裏面繼續發揮影響 
"Yet when I see the word ""common time,"" what automatically comes to mind for me is ""at the same time."" ",所以喺學校同返工嗰陣時 我同好多唔同嘅美國手語傳譯員共事 
"So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand. ",佢哋把聲就係我嘅把聲音同我嘅身份 
We have the staff across the head and the chest. ,佢哋幫我，令其他人可以聽到我 
"[Head: RH, Flash claw] [Common time] [Chest: LH, Flash claw] I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the ""flash claw."" ",佢哋把聲蘊含價值同社會話語權 
Can you please follow along with me? ,諷刺嘅係，通過借用佢哋嘅聲音 我可以暫時擁有呢啲話語權 好啲似借高利貸咁 
"Everybody, hands up. ",如果我停止呢個實踐 我就會覺得我會消失咗咁 跟住我嘅話語權就會隨之而消失 
"Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest, kind of like ""common time"" or at the same time. ",所以當聲音成為我新嘅藝術媒介時 我沈醉咗喺音樂世界裏面 
"Yes, got it. ",令我訝異嘅係 音樂同美國手語竟然有好多相似之處 
"That means ""to fall in love"" in International [Sign]. ",譬如話一個音符 係冇辦法完全咁用紙紀錄低 
"(Laughter) International [Sign], as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world. ",美國手語嘅一個概念都係咁 
The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this -- please follow along with me again. ,佢哋都係立體嘅 同埋字嘅結構會隨著意思唔同 而有所變化 意思就係一啲細小嘅變化 都可以改變手語同言語成個意義 
And now this. ,我想同你哋分享一個有關鋼琴嘅比喻 咁你哋就可以了解美國手語係點樣 
"This is ""colonization"" in ASL. ",我哋係腦海中想像一個鋼琴 
(Laughter) Now the third -- please follow along again. ,美國手語可以分解成唔同嘅語法參數 
And again. ,如果你將唔同嘅語法參數 分配俾彈鋼琴嘅每隻手指 譬如話︰面部表情、身體動作 速度、手形 當你演奏鋼琴陣時… 因為英文係線型語言 就好似每次只可以表達一種音符 好似獨唱咁 
"This is ""enlightenment"" in ASL. ",但係美國手語就更加似合唱 十個手指都需要同時演奏 去表達一個清晰嘅美國手語符號 
So let's do all three together. ,如果其中一個音符改變咗 咁成個意思都會唔同 
"Fall in love, ""colonization"" and ""enlightenment."" ",音樂嘅音調、音色同音量都係同一道理 
"Good job, everyone. ",喺美國手語當中 通過運用呢啲唔同嘅語法參數 你就可以表達唔同嘅意思 
"(Laughter) Notice how all three signs are very similar, they all happen at the head and the chest, but they convey quite different meanings. ",譬如話用手語表達「睇」呢個意思 
"So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving, just like music is. ",係咁樣表示嘅 
"However, in this day and age, we live in a very audio-centric world. ",我睇緊你 
"And just because ASL has no sound to it, it automatically holds no social currency. ",盯實你 
We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency -- without sound. ,（笑聲） （笑聲） 噢，冇啦 
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society. ,（笑聲） 嗯，哦 
"And maybe people will understand that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL, nor do you have to be hearing to learn music. ",你睇緊乜？ 
ASL is such a rich treasure that I'd like you to have the same experience. ,噢！停低 
"And I'd like to invite you to open your ears, to open your eyes, take part in our culture and experience our visual language. ",（笑聲） 跟住我開始諗 如果我從音樂角度 分析美國手語會係點？ 
"And you never know, you might just fall in love with us. ",如果我發明一個手語 跟住重複做個手語 咁個動作就會係一首視覺嘅音樂 
(Applause) Thank you. ,譬如話呢個係「一日」嘅符號 代表日出到日落 
"Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me. ",呢個就係「成日」嘅意思 
(Applause) ,如果我重複呢個動作，跟住放慢速度 睇上去就好似係一首歌咁 
,成…日 
"When I was a kid, my parents would tell me, ""You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself."" ",我覺得如果表達「成晚」都啱 
So freedom came with responsibility. ,「成晚」 
"But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible. ",幅畫裏面就有「成晚」嘅意思 
"So I grew up in a bubble of innocence -- or a bubble of ignorance, I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth. ",跟住我就唸 「夜晚」三個唔同表達嘅方式 「琴晚」 「通宵」 （手語）「成晚咁長」 
"And growing up, I found out that adults make a mess, and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves. ",（笑聲） 我覺得第三個手語比之前兩種 更加有音樂性 
"Fast forward, I am an adult now, and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School. ",（笑聲） 呢個就係點樣用美國手語表達時間 你隻手同身體嘅距離 可以反映到時間嘅變化 
And it doesn't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash. ,舉個例子 1H 就係一隻手，2H 就係兩隻手 表達現在式時，隻手係最靠近身體 表達未來時，隻手喺身體前面 過去式，隻手就擺喺身後面 
"So as good citizens, we clean up the beaches -- and no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him. ",所以第一個例子就係「好耐之前」 
"(Laughter) And so it's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them. ",跟住係「以前」 同「習慣」 最後一個係我最鍾意嘅 因為佢俾人一種好浪漫、好戲劇嘅感覺 「曾經」 
It's a horrifying fact. ,（笑聲） 「普通拍子」 係一個音樂術語 係話一個特定時間之內打四次拍子 
"And in past decades, we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets, and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope, and we sort them, and then we put this data onto a map. ",而家我睇到「普通拍子」呢個字 我腦海中自動會出現個字「同一時間」 
"But that takes forever, it's very expensive, and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out. ",跟著落嚟，我哋會用左手同右手 
"So with my students, ages six to 15, we've been dreaming of inventing a better way. ",我哋可以喺頭同胸嘅位置做手語 
So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop. ,( 頭部︰右手，手成一個爪型 ) ( 同一時間 ) ( 心口︰左手，手成一個爪型 ) 而家我來展示一下 「flash claw」嘅手語 
"And so we started building this small workbench, with different heights, so even really short kids can participate. ",大家可以一齊跟我做嗎？ 
"And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe. ",大家一齊舉起手 
(Laughter) Not really. ,而家我哋將手喺頭同胸嘅位置咁樣擺住 同時擺住 
"And so, back to plastic. ",啱啦 
"We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small because it breaks down. ",呢個就係國際手語裏面「愛上」嘅意思 
And so this is how we work. ,（笑聲） 國際手語就好似一個音符 係一種用嚟交流嘅視覺工具 令唔同文化同用唔同手語嘅人 都可以溝通到 
I let the imaginations of my students run wild. ,第二個動作我想咁樣做 唔該各位再跟我做多一次 
And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work. ,係咁樣 
"And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits, we are going to collect only the data. ",呢個係美國手語「殖民」嘅意思 
"So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot -- so robots, kids get very excited. ",（笑聲） 而家係第三個手語 請大家跟住我做多一次 
"And the next thing we do -- we do what we call ""rapid prototyping."" ",再嚟一次 
We are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it. ,呢個係「啟蒙」嘅意思 
"(Laughter) And we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there -- and this is the image that we get in the robot. ",而家我哋將三個連埋一齊 
"So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor, and the computer on board will process this image, and measure the size of each particle, so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water. ",「愛上」 「殖民」 同埋「啟蒙」 
"So we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called Instructables, in the hope that somebody would make it even better. ",大家都做得非常好 
"What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem, and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it. ",（笑聲） 可以注意到呢三個手語係非常之相似 佢哋都喺頭同胸嘅位置做出來 但係佢哋嘅意思又唔同 
[I can investigate my local problem] But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids. ,所以見到美國手語嘅出現同壯大 係一件好令人感動嘅事 就好似音樂一樣 
"And they watch the news, they watch the Internet, and they came across this image. ",喺今時今日 我哋生活喺一個聲音嘅世界裏面 
"This was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed, in the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh. ",因為美國手語喺呢個時間無得發聲 所以佢唔會有社會話語權 
"So they were very shocked, because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in, this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live. ",關於社會話語權 我哋需要仔細考慮佢嘅意思 從而幫助美國手語喺冇聲嘅情況下 都可以擁有屬於自己嘅社會話語權 
"And also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown, so when everything is mixed up, it's really hard to see what's in the water. ",如果可以做到呢一點 我哋嘅社會應該會更加包容 
"But, there's a technology that's rather simple, that's called spectrometry, that allows you see what's in the water. ",甚至其他人可以明白到 就算唔係聾啞人，亦可以學習手語 就好似失聰嘅人都可以學習聲樂一樣 
"So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer, and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums, so that can help you identify what's in the water. ",美國手語好似一筆巨大財富咁 所以我想你哋都可以體會到當中 
"So we packed this prototype of a sensor, and we shipped it to Bangladesh. ",我想邀請你哋去打開自己雙耳 睜開自己雙眼，融入我哋嘅文化 體驗我哋嘅視覺語言 
"So what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help, remotely, other kids. ",你永遠唔會知道 你會唔會下一刻就即刻愛上咗我哋 
"[I can investigate a remote problem] So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments, and I wanted to take it even further -- maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart. ",（掌聲） 多謝 
"So I'm half Japanese and half French, and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan. ",Denise Kahler-Braaten: 大家好，我就係 Christie 嘅翻譯員 
It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves -- they are called tsunami -- and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan. ,（掌聲） 
"More than 14,000 people died in an instant. ",
"Also, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, the nuclear power plant just by the water. ",當我仲係一個細路嘅時候 我父母同我講 ︰ 「你可以將地方搞亂， 但你要執返好佢。」 
"And today, I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. ",所以，自由嘅代價係責任 
And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137. ,我嘅想像力會將我帶到 所有呢啲咁美好嘅地方 呢啲地方乜嘢都有可能 
"If you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere. ",所以我係天真咁長大 或者無知咁長大 因為大人總係會講大話 唔話俾我知羞陋嘅真相 
"But if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the Japanese coast, and most of it is now -- it looks like it's safe, it's blue. ",當我長大，我發現大人都會將啲嘢搞亂 但佢哋唔係好識得收拾亂局 
"Well, reality is a bit more complicated than this. ",我宜家已經係一個成年人 我喺香港港灣小學教平民科學同發明課 
"So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident, and I measure independently and with other scientists, on land, in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids. ",冇幾耐 我嘅學生就喺沙灘度跆到好多垃圾 
"So of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen. ",作為好公民，我哋清理沙灘上嘅垃圾 呀唔係，佢唔係喺度飲酒 就算係，我都唔俾佢飲 
"(Laughter) But every night we would report to ""Mission Control"" -- different masks they're wearing. ",（笑聲） 雖然講出嚟有啲悲哀 但確實今日超過八成嘅海洋 都有塑膠垃圾 
"It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life. ",呢個係好可怕嘅事實 
"And so what we did with them is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day, and talk about where we should be going next -- strategy, itinerary, etc... ",喺過去幾十年 我哋開船，用大嘅網 撈起海裡面嘅塑膠 跟住將佢哋擺喺顯微鏡下觀察 我哋將佢哋分類 然後將所得資料以地圖形式表達 
"And to do this, we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant. ",但呢樣需要非常多嘅時間，成本都好高 所以用呢啲船好冒險 
"And so we built the elevation map, we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity, and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall. ",我同我嘅學生，由六歲到十五歲不等 我哋一直諗住發明一個 更好嘅方法嚟處理垃圾 
"And with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system, and leaking into the ocean. ",所以我哋將呢個細細嘅課室 變成一個工作室 
So it was a rough estimate. ,我哋開始起呢個細嘅工作檯 高度係可以調較 咁樣冇咁高嘅學生都可以用張檯 
"But with this in mind, we organized this expedition, which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant. ",等我話你知 細路用工具其實好勁同好安全 
"We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant, and with the help of the local fisherman, we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built. ",（笑聲） 啱啱講笑 
"We pack the sediment into small bags, we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities, and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity, especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce, and I will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi. ",所以，返到去塑膠呢個主題 
(Laughter) You can see a progression here -- we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem. ,我哋收集塑膠 將佢磨到海上塑膠垃圾嘅大小 即係磨到非常之細 因為海上面嘅塑膠分解咗 
"And it's been super exciting to work at these different scales, with also very simple, open-source technologies. ",呢個就係我哋做嘅方式 
"But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done. ",我俾學生自由發揮想像 
We haven't even started to try to solve the problems. ,我嘅工作就係由集合 佢哋每一個最好嘅諗法 整成一個行得通嘅方法 
And so I wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things. ,所以我哋決定唔收海面垃圾 改為收集相關數據 
"And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small, so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong, and we turned it into the largest mega-space focused on social and environmental impact. ",我哋會用機械人去影塑膠垃圾 一提到機械人，小朋友就好雀躍 
"It's in central Hong Kong, and it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a bit of biology, a bit of optics, basically you can build pretty much everything there. ",下一步我哋好快咁做一個模型出嚟 
And its a place where adults and kids can play together. ,我哋做模型做得超快 午餐啲飯仲喺個飯盒度就切好曬啲嘢 
"It's a place where kids' dreams can come true, with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again. ",（笑聲） 我哋將枱燈同網路攝錄機 安裝到水管系統上面 然後將佢裝落去一個可以 喺水面垃圾之中 慢慢移動嘅機械人 由我哋收集到嘅塑膠垃圾影像 呢張係機械人影到嘅嘢 
Student: Acceleration! Acceleration! ,我哋見到一啲塑膠慢慢流過個感應器 機械人上面嘅電腦會分析影像 計算出每件塑膠嘅大細 所以我哋可以粗略估算 水裡邊有幾多塑膠 
"Cesar Harada: We're asking questions such as, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy? ",我哋將呢個發明全部紀錄低 放上一專為發明者而設嘅網站 Instructables 度 希望有人可以改良佢 
"Or, can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool, electric vehicles? ",呢個項目有趣在於 學生見到一個本地問題 然後佢哋就即刻解決佢 
"So plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies, but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies. ",（我可以研究本地嘅問題） 但我香港嘅學生好識得用網絡 
We can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions. ,佢哋會睇新聞、 上網 然後佢哋搵到呢張相 
"So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers -- we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people, and that can actually do something about it. ",一個大概十歲樓下嘅細路 喺孟加拉孫德爾本斯 全世界最大嘅紅樹林 徒手清理油污 
Thank you. ,我嘅學生都非常震訝 因為呢度嘅水都係 當地居民飲用、洗澡用嘅水 佢哋都喺呢個水域捕魚 呢度就係佢哋住嘅地方 
(Applause) ,你可以見到水、泥土同油污都係啡色 所以當所有嘢都被油覆蓋時 好難望到水裡面有咩 
,不過有一種幾簡單嘅科技 叫做光譜測量 可以俾你望到水裡面有咩嘢 
"For much of the past century, architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine. ",所以我哋做咗個 未算好準確嘅光譜測量儀 你可以用光照唔同嘅物質 然後就可以得出唔同嘅光吸收譜 咁樣就可以幫你分辨出水裡面有咩物質 
"Form follows function had become modernity's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket, as it liberated architecture from the decorative, but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose. ",我哋將呢個測量儀包好 寄去孟加拉 
"Of course, architecture is about function, but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi, and I want to propose a completely different quality. ",呢個項目有趣在 佢唔只係解決一個本地問題 或者研究一個本地問題 我嘅學生用佢哋嘅同理心同創意 去幫助遠方嘅其他小朋友 
"If form follows fiction, we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories -- stories of the people that live there, of the people that work in these buildings. ",（我可以研究一個喺好遠地方嘅問題） 所以做完第二個實驗之後 我得到好多動力 我想將更推進一步 可能係解決更複雜嘅問題 都係我想做嘅事情 
And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create. ,我係日法混血兒 你可能會記得 2011 年 日本嗰場好強嘅地震 
"In this sense, I'm interested in fiction not as the implausible but as the real, as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it. ",嚴重到引發咗好幾波巨浪 就係海嘯 海嘯摧毀咗日本東邊好多沿岸城市 
"Our buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different, and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today. ","超過 14,000 人喺一瞬那喪生 "
Our buildings are real; they're being built. ,海嘯亦都令座落喺海邊嘅 福島核電廠損毀 
They're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility. ,今日我睇報告話 大約 300 噸核污水 由核電廠流到太平洋 
I think of our architecture as organizational structures. ,所以今日成個太平洋 都有微量嘅銫 -137 元素 
"At their core is indeed structural thinking, like a system: How can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way? ",如果你去美國西岸 周圍都可以量度到嚟自福島嘅輻射 
How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives? ,但當你睇返地圖，似乎大部分嘅核輻射 都被海水沖離日本海岸 好似宜家大部分輻射都安全 
"And how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture, while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time? ",但其實情況係比較複雜嘅 
"And here comes the second term into play, what I call ""narrative hybrids"" -- structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create. ",核災以嚟我每年都會到福島一次 我同其他科學家一齊進行獨立調查 喺土地上，喺河流裡面 今次我哋想帶埋細路 
"So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships, both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way. ",當然我哋冇帶小朋友去 父母都唔肯俾佢哋去 
"This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster, which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA. ",（笑聲） 但每晚我哋會報告俾「行動總部」知 佢哋戴唔同面具 
"When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image: a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district, except at that time, only a handful of them existed. ",睇起上嚟佢哋唔係好認真工作 但其實佢哋係好認真 因為佢哋成世人都要面對輻射 
"So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about, except one thing: it would all be about verticality. ",所以我哋同佢哋 討論當日收集到嘅數據 思考我哋接住落嚟要做啲咩 策略、行程等等⋯ 
"Of course, the skyscraper is vertical -- it's a profoundly hierarchical structure, the top always the best, the bottom the worst, and the taller you are, the better, so it seems. ",為咗做呢啲 我哋繪製咗個好簡單嘅地形圖 顯示核電廠周圍嘅地方 
"And we wanted to ask ourselves, could a building be about a completely different quality? ",之後我哋整埋個立視圖 灑上顏料，反映輻射嘅實時數據 我哋灑上水嚟模擬落雨 
"Could it undo this hierarchy, and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration, rather than isolation? ",咁樣我哋就可以見到輻射塵埃 由山上沖到落河裡面 然後流到大海 
"So we took this needle and bent it back into itself, into a loop of interconnected activities. ",呢個係一個粗略估算 
"Our idea was to bring all aspects of television-making into one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting, research and training, administration -- all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration. ",有咗呢個概念之後 我哋組織咗一次探索行動 呢次係平民最接近核電廠嘅一次 
I still very much like this image. ,我哋喺距離核電廠 1.5 公里嘅海面上面 因為有漁民幫手 我哋先至收集到海床上面嘅沉積物 用我哋發明嘅沉積物採集器 
"It reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school. ",我哋將沉澱物放入細膠袋 然後再擺入幾百個袋 送去唔同嘅大學 然後我哋做咗個海床輻射地圖 特別針對魚類繁殖嘅河口 我希望我哋嘅工作 能夠令本地漁民 同你鍾意嘅壽司都安全啲 
"And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance, but as an organism, as a life form. ",（笑聲） 你可以見到一個發展歷程 我哋由本地問題開始 到偏遠地方嘅問題，再到全球問題 
"And as you start to dissect this organism, you can identify a series of primary technical clusters -- program production, broadcasting center and news. ",喺不同規模度做令人非常之興奮 興奮亦都在於用嘅科技都係簡單同開放 
"Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters: meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas -- informal spaces for people to meet and exchange. ",但係同時愈嚟愈令人覺得挫折 因為我哋只係啱啱開始量度 我哋過去造成傷害 
"So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social, the human and the performative. ",我哋仲未開始解決問題 
"And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system, to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity. ",所以我諗，或者我哋嚟一個進步 發明更加好嘅嘢解決曬所有問題 
"With 473,000 square meters, it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world. ",諗好之後我哋發覺課室唔夠大 我哋喺香港搵咗一個工廠大廈嘅單位 將佢改成最大空間 專注於社會同環境影響方面嘅工作 
"It has a population of over 10,000 people, and of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture. ",佢喺香港嘅市區 一個我哋可以做木工、金工 化學、生物、光學嘅地方 基本上你可以喺呢度整到任何嘢 
"So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model, just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant. ",呢個係一個大人同細路 可以一齊玩嘅地方 
"But of course, it's not a number, it is the people, it is a community that inhabits the building, and in order to both comprehend this, but also script this architecture, we identified five characters, hypothetical characters, and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building, thought of where they would meet, what they would experience. ",一個大人幫小朋友實現夢想 令細路夢想可以成真嘅地方 大人都可以喺度重新體驗做細路嘅感覺 
"So it was a way to script and design the building, but of course, also to communicate its experiences. ",學生：加速！加速！ 
This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing. ,講者︰我哋問梗一啲問題，例如 我哋可唔可以用再生能源 創造未來行路嘅工具嗎？ 
"This is the main broadcast control room, a technical installation so large, it can broadcast over 200 channels simultaneously. ",或者我哋可唔可以幫老化緊嘅人口 將輪椅改裝成電動車？ 
And this is how the building stands in Beijing today. ,塑膠、石油同輻射 都係人類留低好可怕嘅嘢 但都未算最壞 最壞嘅係對細路講大話 
"Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics 2012, after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics. ",我哋唔能夠再對細路仔隱瞞核突嘅真相 因為我哋需要佢哋嘅想像力 去整一啲解決方案出嚟 
"And you can see at the very tip of this 75-meter cantilever, those three little circles. ",所以，平民科學家、生產者、夢想家 我哋一定要培育好下個世代 令佢哋關心環境同人類 咁樣佢哋先能夠做出真正改變 
And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building. ,多謝 
They're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion. ,（掌聲） 
The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing. ,
It is there. ,喺過去好幾個世紀 建築行業受一條著名理論魔咒所左右 
It has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography. ,「型式追隨功能」呢個理論 一度成為當代最雄心勃勃嘅理念 同時又係個帶有不良影響嘅緊箍咒 呢句話雖然令建築唔再使講求裝飾功能 但同時令建築走向 純功能同有限用途嘅方向 
(Laughter) But its most important moment is maybe sill this one. ,當然，建築係講功能性 但我想重新演譯 Bernard Tschumi 呢句話嘅意思 
"That's Beijing is similar to ""Time Out,"" a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week, and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter, but actually as an urban actor, as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city. ",如果「型隨小說」 我哋可以理解建築設計同建築物 為一個空間嘅故事 有關居住果度嘅人嘅故事 同埋裡面做嘢嘅人嘅故事 
"So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player, of something that writes stories and performs stories. ",我哋可以想像 我哋建築物留低俾人嘅印象 
And I think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in. ,因為噉樣，我對小說感興趣嘅原因 唔係因為佢夠虛幻，而係因為真實 就好似建築對住喺裡面嘅居民 嚟講嘅意義一樣 
"But of course, there's another story to this building. ",我哋嘅建築物都 可以話係一啲雛形、諗法 話俾人聽我哋生活空間 或者工作空間可以唔同 以至文化、媒體空間 喺現今世代可以係點嘅樣 
"It is the story of the people that made it -- 400 engineers and architects that I was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building, in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in China. ",我哋嘅建築物係真嘅 佢哋係起出嚟 
"This is a residential development in Singapore, large scale. ",佢哋係實物同想法 
"If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world, of course, it is dominated by the tower, a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness, and I wanted to ask, how could we think about living, not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment, but in an idea of a collective? ",我會將我哋嘅建築物諗成係組織嘅結構 
How could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own? ,佢哋核心係結構思想 就好似一個系統咁 我哋點樣令啲嘢 同時具有功能同實驗用途？ 
"The typical answer to the question -- we had to design 1,040 apartments -- would have looked like this: 24-story height limit given by the planning authorities, 12 towers with nothing but residual in between -- a very tight system that, although the tower isolates you, it doesn't even give you privacy, because you're so close to the next one, that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be. ",我哋點樣可以令到結構 帶出一系列關係同故事呢？ 
"So I proposed to topple the towers, throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up, and what looks a bit random from the side, if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter, you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid, in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up to create huge outdoor courtyards -- central spaces for the community, programmed with a variety of amenities and functions. ",而喺建築物裡面嘅居民 同用戶似小說一樣嘅故事 可以點樣幫棟建築物加添一啲嘅描述？ 同時建築物可以影響返呢啲故事？ 
And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces. ,第二個字係我叫做嘅「故事混合體」 好多個同時進行嘅故事 喺我哋嘅建築物展開 
"They're open, permeable; they're interconnected. ",所以我哋可以想像建築物 喺程式上、功能上 實驗上、情緒性或者社會上 係一個複雜嘅關係嚟 
"We called the project ""The Interlace,"" thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike. ",呢個係中國中央電視台嘅總部 呢棟建築物係我同 Rem Koolhaas 喺 大都會建築事務嗰陣一齊設計 
And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants. ,2002 年當我第一次到北京果陣 城市規劃員向我哋展示一張城市藍圖︰ 過百棟高樓大廈將會出現喺中央商業區 但當時只有為數唔多嘅大樓喺度 
"And, in fact, it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces, stacked to more and more individual and private spaces. ",所以喺幾乎咩都唔知嘅情況下設計 我哋只係知道，座建築會係垂直嘅 
So we would open up a spectrum between the collective and the individual. ,當然，高樓大廈都係垂直嘅 垂直式係其中一種嘅大廈類型 頂部永遠係最好 底部永遠係最差 似乎係，你起得越高就越好 
"A little piece of math: if we count all the green that we left on the ground, minus the footprint of the buildings, and we would add back the green of all the terraces, we have 112 percent green space, so more nature than not having built a building. ",我哋問自己 一棟建築物可唔可以 有一個完全唔同嘅特性？ 
And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there. ,佢可唔可以擺脫以往思維 佢可唔可以係黏埋一齊 而並非一支嘢孤零零呢？ 
"This is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces. ",所以我哋將呢支針拗彎 形成一個空間互通嘅環 
"So you see new datum planes, new grounds planes for social activity. ",我哋想將電視製作嘅所有環節 融合到同一個結構裡面： 新聞、節目製作、廣播 資料搜集、訓練、行政 全部活動可以係呢個圈入面進行 個個可以係度見面、交流同合作 
We paid a lot of attention to sustainability. ,我仍然好鐘意呢幅圖 
"In the tropics, the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to, and, in fact, it is seeking protection from the sun. ",佢令我諗返起生物堂 如果你仲記得人體構造 各種器官同循環系統就好似一座建築咁 
We first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight through the year. ,突然你會覺得建築物 唔單單係建築材料堆成嘅嘢 佢更加似一個生命體 
We then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades to minimize the energy consumption of the building. ,而當你開始剖析呢個生命體 你分辨到一系列嘅基本嘅技術部門 節目製作部、廣播中心、新聞部 
"But most importantly, we could prove that through the geometry of the building design, the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards so that those would be usable throughout the entire year. ",佢哋同社交設施 例如會議室、餐廳、交談區 係一齊、唔可以分開 亦都係非正式場合俾人見面交流 
"We further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors, so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates that, again, would enhance the quality of those spaces available for the inhabitants. ",所以呢個建築物嘅組織結構係種混合體 集技術、社交、人同表演於一身 
"And it was the idea of creating this variety of choices, of freedom to think where you would want to be, where you would want to escape, maybe, within the own complexity of the complex in which you live. ",我哋利用環形嘅特點串聯每一樣嘢 令訪客同員工都可以 喺呢個建築裡面體驗唔同用途 
"But coming from Asia to Europe: a building for a German media company based in Berlin, transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media. ","473,000 平方米嘅建築面積 令佢成為全世界數一數二大嘅建築物 "
"And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions: Why would anyone today still want to go to the office, because you can actually work anywhere? ",裡面可以容納一萬人 冇錯，咁嘅規模超出咗我哋 對一般建築物嘅理解範圍 
And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building? ,所以我們停工過一排 然後坐低，剪出一萬張貼紙仔 將佢哋貼係一個模型上面 只係單純咁想挑戰我哋自己 對數字真正嘅理解 
"We created not only an object, but at the center of this object we created a giant space, and this space was about the experience of a collective, the experience of collaboration and of togetherness. ",但當然啦，最重要嘅唔係數字 而係人，生活喺呢棟大樓裡面嘅社群 為咗理解班人兼為建築物寫藍本 我哋創造咗五個虛擬人物 然後用一日時間睇下佢哋喺 呢棟大樓嘅生活動態 睇下佢哋會喺邊度見其他人 佢哋會經歷乜嘢 
"Communication, interaction as the center of a space that in itself would float, like what we call the collaborative cloud, in the middle of the building, surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices. ",呢個係描繪同設計建築嘅方法 咁當然，都係一種體會佢嘅方式 
"So with only a few steps from your quiet work desk, you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space. ",呢個係同現代美術館 喺北京同紐約搞嘅展覧 
"Finally, we come to London, a project commissioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation of the Mayor of London. ",呢度係廣播控制室 安裝要求相當大 呢度可以同時播二百個頻道 
We were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in Stratford in the Olympic Park. ,呢個係佢依家喺北京嘅外貌 
"In the 19th century, Prince Albert had created Albertopolis. ",佢做嘅第一次直播係 2012 年倫敦奧運會 嗰次之前，佢已經試過喺外面 完成北京奧運嘅轉播 
And Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis. ,你可以喺 75 米懸臂嗰頂睇風景 呢三個細圓圈就係 
"The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions, some international ones, and to create a new system of synergies. ",貫穿整棟大樓嘅開放迴廊嘅一部分 
"Prince Albert, as yet, created Albertopolis in the 19th century, thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind, bringing arts and science closer together. ",佢哋用玻璃做 你可以企喺上面俯瞰你腳下 成個城市慢慢運作 
"And he built Exhibition Road, a linear sequence of those institutions. ",呢棟建築已經係北京生活嘅一部分 
"But of course, today's society has moved on from there. ",佢就係果度 
We no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other. ,佢亦將變成咗北京 一個相當受歡迎嘅婚禮攝影場地 
"We live in a world in which boundaries start to blur between the different domains, and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important than keeping separations. ",（笑聲） 但最重要嘅時刻可能係 當呢本《城市漫步》嘅週刊 
"So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine, a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains, but allow them to interact and collaborate. ",一本似倫敦《Time Out》嘅週刊 描述嗰個星期城市發生咗咩事 突然間你會發現 呢棟大樓唔單止只係一棟大樓 佢仲同時扮演梗城市嘅一員 決定咗呢個城市嘅生活 
"At the base of it is a very simple module, a ring module. ",建築設計突然間有咗人嘅特徵 好似作家咁寫故事、表達故事 
"It can function as a double-loaded corridor, has daylight, has ventilation. ",而我認為呢樣可以成為 其中一個我哋相信嘅建築嘅基本意義 
It can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space. ,呢棟大樓仲有另一個故事 
"These modules were stacked together with the idea that almost any function could, over time, occupy any of these modules. ",就係建造佢嘅人嘅故事 四百個由我帶領幾乎超過十年 嘅工程師同建築師 我們一齊起呢棟大樓 想像佢成真 到最後終於喺中國內地將佢起好 
"So institutions could shrink or contract, as, of course, the future of culture is, in a way, the most uncertain of all. ",呢個係一個係新加坡嘅大型住宅項目 
"This is how the building sits, adjacent to the Aquatics Centre, opposite the Olympic Stadium. ",如果我哋睇下新加坡 佢同亞洲多數地方 同全世界好多地方一樣 都係以高樓大廈為主 一種普遍現象係 呢類型嘅大廈營造咗疏離感 而唔係聯繫感 而我想問 我哋可以點樣唔單止將住宅睇成係 自己既私隱、個人同住所 以至係一種集體嘅嘢 ? 
And you can see how its cantilevering volumes project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside. ,我哋要諗下點創造 一個促進社區交流嘅環境 令你樂意同人分享自己嘅嘢 ? 
"The idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity, in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume. ","典型嘅解答係 我哋要設計出 1,040 間公寓 外型就好似咁︰ 當地政府法例限制樓宇只可以有 24 層高 12 棟大樓咩都冇 之間只有用剩嘅土地 相當緊密的格局 雖然住樓可以將你同其他人分隔開 但根本俾唔到你私隱 因為你離隔籬鄰居係好近 亦令人非常質疑住樓嘅質素 "
Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris. ,所以，我建議推淋晒大廈 將垂直設計改做水平設計 將佢哋堆砌起嚟 從側面睇係不規則嘅 如果你搭直升機睇落去 你可以睇到佢嘅組織結構 水平建築物擺埋一齊會形成六邊形 務求中間有一個大嘅花園 有著好多設施同功能 
"It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project, but also the difference: here, it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure, in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity. ",呢啲花園並唔係密閉空間 
"And it was this thought: to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted -- for those in the educational parts that create and think culture; for those that present the visual arts, the dance; and for the public to be admitted into all of this with a series of possible trajectories, to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience. ",佢哋係開放、通透、互通嘅 
"And I want to end on a project that is very small, in a way, very different: a floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand. ",我們叫呢個項目做「交錯」 好似我哋將人連埋一齊 空間都係一樣 
"Friends of mine had founded a film festival, and I thought, if we think of the stories and narratives of movies, we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them. ",我們設計嘅每樣細節都係想活化空間 還居民空間 
"So I designed a small modular floating platform, based on the techniques of local fishermen, how they built their lobster and fish farms. ",事實上，呢個系統裏面 我哋既會強調公共空間 又會重視私人空間 
"We collaborated with the local community and built, out of recycled materials of their own, this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the British film archive, [1903] ""Alice in Wonderland,"" for example. ",所以，我哋帶出咗 大眾同個人嘅概念 
The most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies. ,有一個小小嘅數學題 : 如果我哋將所有 喺地面上嘅綠色植物面積 扣除掉建築物佔地面積 然後加上所有有綠色植物嘅露台面積 我哋會得出 112% 嘅綠色覆蓋率 比起唔起樓仲要有更多嘅自然空間 
"So I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter, of the built environment, but is really about how we want to live our lives, how we script our own stories and those of others. ",當然，呢個小小嘅數學題說明咗 我哋將有人住嘅空間都乘埋入去 
Thank you. ,呢度係其中一棟樓嘅 13 樓 
(Applause) ,你會見到為社交活動而設嘅 新基準平面、新地平面 
,我哋好注重可持續發展 
"Late in January 1975, a 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House. ",喺熱帶地區，太陽係最必須留意嘅嘢 而遮蔽陽光係建築需要做嘅嘢 
The auditorium was empty. ,我哋首先會確認所有公寓大樓 一年內有足夠嘅太陽 
"It was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign. ",然後我們優化外牆嘅玻璃 減少建築物嘅能源消耗 
This was the most exciting day of Vera's life. ,但最重要，我哋可以透過大廈嘅座向 證明真係做到能源效益 建築物本身提供足夠嘅遮陰俾中庭花園 所以花園成年都可以開放俾人 
"She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany, and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House to host a late-night concert of jazz from the American musician, Keith Jarrett. ",我哋沿著主風廊設置咗水槽 水蒸發可以冷卻環境 仲會形成一個微型氣候 噉就可以改善居民居住嘅質素 
"1,400 people were coming. ",呢款樓令你有得揀 喺建築物之內想去邊都得 
"And in just a few hours, Jarrett would walk out on the same stage, he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music, he would begin to play. ",宜家離開亞洲，去到歐洲 我哋見到一座建築 佢係屬於一間位於柏林 啱啱由傳統印刷媒體轉型到 數碼媒體嘅德國公司 
"But right now, Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question, and it wasn't going well. ",公司執行董事問咗幾個好中肯嘅問題 點解依家每個人仍然會去寫字樓番工 即使佢地其實可以喺任何地方做嘢 ? 
"Jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily, played a few notes, walked around it, played a few more notes, muttered something to his producer. ",一個公司嘅數碼形象 可以點樣喺建築物上面表現出嚟 ? 
Then the producer came over to Vera and said ... ,我哋創作嘅唔只係一件物件 我哋仲喺物件嘅中間整咗個大空間 呢個空間係關於集體嘅經驗 合作同一齊嘅經歷 
"If you don't get a new piano, Keith can't play. ",溝通、互動係空間嘅核心 溝通、互動會自動喺中間 就好似係我哋所講嘅 「合作雲端」喺建築物中間 被好多個標準模組嘅辦公室包圍 
There'd been a mistake. ,只要由你安靜嘅辦公枱行幾步 你就可以喺核心空間入面 經歷好多共同嘅事 
The opera house had provided the wrong instrument. ,最後，我哋嚟到倫敦 一個由倫敦市長委任開發公司嘅項目 
"This one had this harsh, tinny upper register, because all the felt had worn away. ",佢哋要求我哋研究 Stratford 奧運公園嘅土地開發潛力 
"The black notes were sticking, the white notes were out of tune, the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small. ",十九世紀，Albert 王子建立咗 Albert 城 
It wouldn't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House. ,而 Boris Johnson 就想建立奧林匹克城 
So Keith Jarrett left. ,個想法係將一啲英國最大既機構 同一啲國際機構擺埋一齊 創造一個新嘅協同效益系統 
"He went and sat outside in his car, leaving Vera Brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano. ",當時十九世紀 Albert 王子建立 Albert 城 係想展示人類嘅成就 同埋想將藝術同科學放埋一齊 
"Now she got a piano tuner, but she couldn't get a new piano. ",佢仲起咗一條路叫展覧路 機構按次序進駐條路 
"And so she went outside and she stood there in the rain, talking to Keith Jarrett, begging him not to cancel the concert. ",當然，依家社會已經比當時進步咗好多 
"And he looked out of his car at this bedraggled, rain-drenched German teenager, took pity on her, and said, ""Never forget ... only for you."" ",我哋唔再係活喺一個 每樣嘢都界定清楚嘅世界 
"And so a few hours later, Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house, he sat down at the unplayable piano and began. ",我哋生活係一個 領域分類開始模糊嘅世界 一個合作同互動遠比保持分開 更加緊要嘅世界 
(Music) Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening. ,所以我哋想建立一個大型嘅文化機器 即係一座會協調並賦予 唔同領域生命嘅建築物 但建築物同時又容許 領域之間互動同合作 
"Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers, he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard, which gave the piece a soothing, ambient quality. ",而建築物底部係一個非常簡單嘅模組 一個環形模組 
"But also, because the piano was so quiet, he had to set up these rumbling, repetitive riffs in the bass. ",佢有一條內廊式走廊，有日照同通風 
"And he stood up twisting, pounding down on the keys, desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row. ",佢係通透嘅 噉就可以變成一個大型展覽表演嘅空間 
It's an electrifying performance. ,呢啲模組堆砌埋一齊 大部分活動都可以 用任何一個呢啲嘅模組 
"It somehow has this peaceful quality, and at the same time it's full of energy, it's dynamic. ",機構就可以咁而縮細規模 因為喺未來，文化某種程度嚟講 係最無法預測嘅一樣嘢 
And the audience loved it. ,呢棟建築將坐落水上運動中心隔嚟 喺奧運會場對面 
Audiences continue to love it because the recording of the Köln Concert is the best-selling piano album in history and the best-selling solo jazz album in history. ,你可以睇到佢嘅懸臂式空間係點 伸延同融入咗公眾空間 同佢嘅中庭係點帶俾公眾娛樂 
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess. ,個諗法係創造一個複雜嘅系統 俾裡面嘅機構可以維持佢哋嘅形象 但又唔會被當係建築物 大空間嘅一小部分 
"He had embraced that mess, and it soared. ",呢個係同法國巴黎 龐畢藝術中心嘅比例對照圖 
But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct. ,顯示出呢個項目嘅龐大規模同潛力 但都有唔一樣嘅地方 佢係一個多重合成建築物 裡面唔同嘅機構可以互動 而又同時不失佢哋嘅形象 
He didn't want to play. ,個諗法係咁嘅：創造一個組織結構 可以令唔同故事都可以描述出嚟 包括從事教育同創造文化嘅人 表演視覺藝術、舞蹈嘅人 以及公眾，俾佢哋用唔同方式欣賞呢啲嘢 然後由呢幾批人闡述佢哋 對呢啲故事嘅理解同本身嘅經歷 
"Of course, I think any of us, in any remotely similar situation, would feel the same way, we'd have the same instinct. ",我想講一個計劃嚟做總結 呢個計劃其實又細又同其他計劃好唔同 個計劃係一個泰國嘅水上電影院 
We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools. ,我有朋友搵到一個電影節 我諗如果我哋思考電影嘅故事同讀白 我哋應該都可以思考 睇呢部戲嘅觀眾佢哋自己嘅讀白 
We don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles. ,所以我設計咗一個小型模組式水上平台 用嚟自當地漁民嘅技術整出嚟 用佢哋起龍蝦田同魚田嘅技術 
"But Jarrett's instinct was wrong, and thank goodness he changed his mind. ",我哋同當地社區合作 起咗呢個由佢哋回收返嚟嘅物料 製成嘅迷人水上平台 我哋一路睇英國電影檔案館嘅戲 好似 1904 年嘅「愛麗絲夢遊仙境」 我哋一路慢慢移個平台去海度 
And I think our instinct is also wrong. ,我哋仲發現原來本地人嘅經歷 同電影嘅情節相同 
I think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess. ,所以我相信，建築設計超越物質同建築 而真係同我哋想點生活 點樣闡述我哋同人哋嘅故事息息相關 
"So let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology, from complexity science, from social psychology, and of course, rock 'n' roll. ",多謝 
So cognitive psychology first. ,（掌聲） 
"We've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty, certain kinds of obstacle, can actually improve our performance. ",
"For example, the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer, a few years ago, teamed up with high school teachers. ",喺 1975 年 1 月 一個 17 歲叫 Vera Brandes 嘅德國女仔 走上科隆歌劇院嘅舞台 
And he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were giving to some of their classes. ,嗰時觀眾席無人 
"So the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward, such as Helvetica or Times New Roman. ",歌劇院內 只有緊急出口牌綠色微弱嘅燈光 
"But half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted in something sort of intense, like Haettenschweiler, or something with a zesty bounce, like Comic Sans italicized. ",但嗰日係 Vera 人生裏面最興奮嘅一日 
"Now, these are really ugly fonts, and they're difficult fonts to read. ",佢係德國最年輕嘅音樂會籌辦人 佢成功說服科隆歌劇院 舉辨一場美國音樂人 Keith Jarrett 嘅 深夜爵士音樂會 
"But at the end of the semester, students were given exams, and the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts, had actually done better on their exams, in a variety of subjects. ","音樂會有 1,400 個觀眾出席 "
"And the reason is, the difficult font had slowed them down, forced them to work a bit harder, to think a bit more about what they were reading, to interpret it ... ",喺幾個鐘頭之後 Keith 走上同一個台 坐低喺鋼琴前面 喺冇採排或者樂譜嘅情況下 佢開始演奏 
and so they learned more. ,但喺宜家 Vera 預備俾 Keith 用嘅鋼琴原來有問題 而且情況並唔順利 
Another example. ,Keith 小心咁睇個鋼琴 彈咗幾個音 圍著鋼琴行咗一圈 又再彈咗幾個音 然後向佢嘅監製細聲講咗幾句 
The psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates for the quality of their attentional filters. ,嗰個監製走過去同 Vera 講︰ 
What do I mean by that? ,「如果你唔換個新鋼琴，Keith 表演唔到。」 
"What I mean is, imagine you're in a restaurant, you're having a conversation, there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant, you want to filter them out, you want to focus on what's important to you. ",科隆歌劇院搞錯咗 
Can you do that? ,歌劇院俾咗錯嘅樂器 
But some people really struggle with that. ,鋼琴特別高音 係因為鋼琴一條條吸音毛頭經已損耗 
Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that. ,嗰啲黑鍵彈唔返上嚟 白鍵走曬音 腳踏又用唔到 而且鋼琴太細啦 
"They had weak filters, they had porous filters -- let a lot of external information in. ",彈出嚟嘅音細聲得制 尤其是喺咁大嘅空間 唔會所有人都聽得到 
And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them. ,所以 Keith 走咗 
"If there was a television on while they were doing their essays, they couldn't screen it out. ",佢出去，坐喺佢架車裡面 留低 Vera 自己一個 打電話去搵另一個琴返嚟 
"Now, you would think that that was a disadvantage ... ",Vera 成功搵咗個鋼琴師傅 但佢搵唔到一個新嘅鋼琴 
but no. ,於是佢出去外面 喺大雨之下企 同 Keith 話 請求佢唔好取消音樂會 
"When Carson looked at what these students had achieved, the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some real creative milestone in their lives, to have published their first novel, to have released their first album. ",Keith 望著呢個狼狽 淋濕曬嘅德國青年 因為同情佢 所以 Keith 話 「唔好忘記呢件事…今次只係為你。」 
These distractions were actually grists to their creative mill. ,幾個鐘頭之後 Keith 走上歌劇院嘅台 佢坐低喺嗰個彈唔到嘅鋼琴 開始演奏 
They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes. ,（音樂） 但神奇嘅嘢發生咗 
Let's talk about complexity science. ,Keith 避開高音 佢反而彈中間嘅音 令到呢首歌有撫慰同平靜嘅效果 
So how do you solve a really complex -- the world's full of complicated problems -- how do you solve a really complicated problem? ,因為鋼琴本身嘅音量唔大 Keith 唔單止要重複彈低音 
"There are lots and lots of different variables, the operating temperature, the materials, all the different dimensions, the shape. ",仲要企起身用力襟啲鍵 確保後排聽眾都可以聽到琴聲 
"You can't solve that kind of problem all in one go, it's too hard. ",呢場表演令人興奮 
So what do you do? ,呢個表演雖然有平靜嘅特質 但同時又充滿活力 
"Well, one thing you can do is try to solve it step-by-step. ",聽眾唔但之鍾意 
"So you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it, you test it, you improve it. ",而且繼續鍾意 因為呢次科隆音樂會嘅鋼琴專輯 係史上最暢銷嘅鋼琴專輯 亦係最暢銷嘅獨奏爵士樂專輯 
"You tweak it, you test it, you improve it. ",雖然 Keith 嘅表演開始前唔順利 
"Now, this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine. ",但佢接受咗，仲將佢搞好 
And it's been quite widely implemented in the world. ,等我哋諗一諗 Keith 最初嘅反應 
"So you'll hear about it, for example, in high performance cycling, web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages, they're looking for these step-by-step gains. ",佢唔想演奏 
That's a good way to solve a complicated problem. ,將心比己 如果任何一個喺類似嘅情況 我哋都會有一樣嘅感受 我哋都一樣唔想演奏 
But you know what would make it a better way? ,我哋都唔希望人哋叫我哋 用差嘅工具做好一件事 
A dash of mess. ,我哋都想避免不必要嘅障礙 
"You add randomness, early on in the process, you make crazy moves, you try stupid things that shouldn't work, and that will tend to make the problem-solving work better. ",但我哋都知道 Keith 最初嘅反應係錯嘅 好彩佢改變諗法 
"And the reason for that is the trouble with the step-by-step process, the marginal gains, is they can walk you gradually down a dead end. ",我認為我哋嘅判斷都係錯嘅 
"And if you start with the randomness, that becomes less likely, and your problem-solving becomes more robust. ",我認為我哋應該反而感激 因為解決麻煩而獲得意想不到嘅好處 
Let's talk about social psychology. ,所以等我由認知心理學 複雜性科學 社會心理學 以及搖滾樂裏面 講一啲例子 
"So the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues, recently gave murder mystery problems to some students, and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime -- alibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects. ",我哋由認知心理學開始 
"And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it, who committed the crime. ",實際上我哋已經知道咗有一段時間 一啲難度同一啲障礙 可以提高表現 
And there were two treatments in this experiment. ,例如 喺幾年前 心理學家 Daniel Oppenheimer 曾經同中學老師合作 
"In some cases these were four friends, they all knew each other well. ",要求佢哋重新編寫 派俾其中某幾班嘅筆記 
"In other cases, three friends and a stranger. ",一般筆記嘅字體都係大路， 譬如 Helvetica 同 Times New Roman 
And you can see where I'm going with this. ,但另一班收到嘅筆記嘅字體係比較強烈 例如︰ Haettenschweiler 字體 又或係一啲比較跳躍嘅字體 例如斜體嘅 Comic Sans 字體 
"Obviously I'm going to say that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively, which is true, they did. ",呢啲都係核突嘅字體 而且佢哋好難閱讀 
"So the groups of four friends, they only had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right. ",等學期結束時 學生要考試 嗰啲獲發難睇字體筆記嘅學生 喺考試入面唔同科目 表現都較好 
"Which is actually not that great -- in multiple choice, for three answers? 50-50's not good. ",原因係 難睇嘅字體減慢佢哋閱讀速度 令佢哋要落多啲苦功 要花多啲時間諗下佢哋到底寫乜嘢 要多啲時間去理解 
"(Laughter) The three friends and the stranger, even though the stranger didn't have any extra information, even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness, the three friends and the stranger, they had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer. ",所以佢哋學得更加多 
That's quite a big leap in performance. ,另外一個例子 
"But I think what's really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job, but how they felt about it. ",心理學家 Shelley Carson 一直喺度測試哈佛本科生 佢哋過濾事物嘅能力 
"So when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends, they had a nice time, they also thought they'd done a good job. ",咁到底係咩意思呢？ 
They were complacent. ,我嘅意思係，想像你喺一間食肆裡面 你同人傾緊偈 食肆裏邊仲有其他人傾緊 你想將佢哋把聲都篩走 集中你目前嘅對話 
"When she spoke to the three friends and the stranger, they had not had a nice time -- it's actually rather difficult, it's rather awkward ... ",你做到嗎？ 如果可以，你嘅過濾做得唔錯 
and they were full of doubt. ,但有啲人比較吃力 
They didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had. ,一啲 Shelley 嘅本科生比較吃力 
And I think that really exemplifies the challenge that we're dealing with here. ,佢哋嘅過濾好弱，佢哋嘅過濾有問題 好多無關重要嘅訊息 進入咗佢哋嘅腦裡邊 
"Because, yeah -- the ugly font, the awkward stranger, the random move ... ",意思係佢哋會不斷 被外界嘅影像同聲音干擾 
"these disruptions help us solve problems, they help us become more creative. ",如果佢哋做論文嘅時候，電視開著嘅話 佢哋無法子專心喺論文度 
But we don't feel that they're helping us. ,你可能會話呢樣係缺點… 
We feel that they're getting in the way ... ,但，唔係 
and so we resist. ,當 Shelley 睇返呢啲學生所做到嘅嘢 佢發現嗰啲過濾比較弱嘅學生 佢哋係更加有可能 喺佢哋嘅生命裡面成就一啲嘢 出版佢哋第一部小說 發行咗佢哋第一張專輯 
And that's why the last example is really important. ,分心實際上係佢哋創意嘅來源 
So I want to talk about somebody from the background of the world of rock 'n' roll. ,佢哋突破原有思維 因為佢哋唔會鎖死自己 
"And you may know him, he's actually a TED-ster. ",我哋嚟講下複雜性科學 
His name is Brian Eno. ,你點樣解決一個非常複雜嘅… 我哋世界充滿複雜嘅問題 你點能夠解決一個非常複雜嘅問題？ 例如，你想整一個飛機引擎 
He is an ambient composer -- rather brilliant. ,呢度有好多、好多唔同嘅嘢要考慮 包括運行時嘅溫度、材料 尺寸、形狀 
He's also a kind of catalyst behind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years. ,你唔能夠一次過解決所有問題 因為太難啦 
"He's worked with David Bowie on ""Heroes,"" he worked with U2 on ""Achtung Baby"" and ""The Joshua Tree,"" he's worked with DEVO, he's worked with Coldplay, he's worked with everybody. ",咁你會點做？ 
And what does he do to make these great rock bands better? ,好啦，你可以一步一步咁解決呢啲疑難 
"Well, he makes a mess. ",然後你有原型 你調整一下佢、測試佢、改良佢 
He disrupts their creative processes. ,再調整一下佢、測試佢、改良佢 
It's his role to be the awkward stranger. ,呢種逐步改良嘅方法 最終會令你整到一個好嘅引擎 
It's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano. ,而且呢種方法全世界都廣泛應用 
"And one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through this remarkable deck of cards -- I have my signed copy here -- thank you, Brian. ",你會聽到，例如 喺高水平嘅單車運動裏面都會有 而網頁設計師會講 佢哋逐步優化佢哋網頁 
"They're called The Oblique Strategies, he developed them with a friend of his. ",呢個係解決複雜問題嘅好辦法 
"And when they're stuck in the studio, Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards. ",但你知道個辦法其實係點樣？ 
"He'll draw one at random, and he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card. ",就係要亂七八糟 
So this one ... ,又要一開始時隨意咁做嘢 你做出瘋狂嘅嘢 你嘗試一啲一定唔會成功嘅愚蠢嘢 呢啲都會令問題解決得更加好 
Change instrument roles. ,原因係 逐步做嘅問題 幾乎冇嘅收益嘅情兄 可以令你慢慢行入死路一條 
"Yeah, everyone swap instruments -- Drummer on the piano -- Brilliant, brilliant idea. ",如果你一開始時係亂咁做 行入掘頭路嘅機會都低啲 你嘅解難能力就會勁啲 
Look closely at the most embarrassing details. Amplify them. ,講下社會心理學 
"Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action. Incorporate. ",心理學家凱瑟琳 ‧ 菲利普斯 同一啲同事 俾學生一啲謀殺謎團去解答 學生四個人一組 佢哋有一叠關於罪案嘅資料文件 不在場證據、證人嘅供詞同三名嫌疑犯 
These cards are disruptive. ,佢哋要搵出係邊個做 邊個犯法 
"Now, they've proved their worth in album after album. ",呢個實驗有兩種情況 
The musicians hate them. ,一係一組人都係識得嘅朋友 
(Laughter) So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album. ,第二種就係三個朋友加一個唔識嘅 
He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio. ,你可以估到我要講啲咩 
"Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist, working with Eno on David Bowie's ""Lodger"" album, and at one point he turns to Brian and says, ""Brian, this experiment is stupid."" ",好明顯 第二種情況嘅組別更有效解決問題 咁事實上真係，佢哋係更加有效率 
"But the thing is it was a pretty good album, but also, Carlos Alomar, 35 years later, now uses The Oblique Strategies. ",喺第一種情況嘅組別裏面 佢哋只有一半機會答啱 
And he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies because he's realized something. ,佢哋唔係做得好好 當選擇題有三個選擇 得一半答啱確實唔係好好 
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you. ,（笑聲) 第二情況嘅組別 即使個陌生人冇俾任何額外嘅訊息 雖然呢個情況只係話 點樣令交談冇咁尷尬 第二個情況嘅組別 有 75％ 機會搵到正確答案 
"The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally, they were just a list -- list on the recording studio wall. ",個結果係好大嘅進步 
A checklist of things you might try if you got stuck. ,而我認為真正吸引嘅 唔係呢三個朋友同陌生人做得更加好 而係佢哋對件事嘅感覺 
The list didn't work. ,所以當凱瑟琳採訪咗第一種組別嘅時候 佢哋都認為佢哋有愉快嘅時光 都認為佢哋做得好好 
Know why? ,佢哋好滿足 
Not messy enough. ,當佢採訪第二種組別嘅時候 佢哋都認佢哋冇一個惀快嘅時光 佢實際上相處得好困難、又尷尬 
"Your eye would go down the list and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive, the least troublesome, which of course misses the point entirely. ",佢哋中間都有好多疑難 
"And what Brian Eno came to realize was, yes, we need to run the stupid experiments, we need to deal with the awkward strangers, we need to try to read the ugly fonts. ",佢哋冇諗過會做得咁好 
These things help us. ,我認為，呢個測試嘅結果可以用喺 我哋面對梗嘅嘢 
"They help us solve problems, they help us be more creative. ",例如︰ 核突嘅字體 尷尬嘅陌生人 隨機嘅做法… 
But also ... ,呢啲干擾其實幫梗我哋解決問題 幫我哋更有創意 
we really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this. ,但我哋從來並唔覺得係咁 
So however we do it ... ,我哋覺得佢哋係窒礙我哋 
"whether it's sheer willpower, whether it's the flip of a card or whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager, all of us, from time to time, need to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano. ",所以我哋抗拒佢 
Thank you. ,所以就係話點解最後呢個例子係好重要 
(Applause) ,我諗講一個人 佢背景係搖滾音樂 
,你可能認得佢，佢係一個 TEDster 
I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. ,佢叫布萊恩 ‧ 伊諾 
I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. ,佢係一個出色、有實力嘅作曲家 
But I know that it's there. ,喺過去40年，佢都係 一啲好嘅搖滾音樂專輯嘅幕後推手 
And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it. ,佢曾經同 David Bowie 喺作品 Heroes 裏面合作 佢亦曾經同 U2 喺 Achtung baby 同 The Joshua Tree 裏面合作過 佢曾經同 DEVO 一齊工作 佢同 Coldplay 合作過 佢同每一個人都合作過 
"On our planet, where there's water, there's life. ",佢做過乜令呢啲出色嘅 搖滾樂隊更加好？ 
So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. ,佢整爛攤子 
"At this distance, shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures, planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. ",佢干擾佢哋嘅創作過程 
Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. ,佢嘅角色就係頭先講過嘅陌生人 
What I do picks up where their job ends. ,佢就係要話俾佢哋聽 佢哋要彈嗰個彈唔到嘅鋼琴 
I model the possible climates of exoplanets. ,佢整呢啲亂攤子嘅其中一個方法係 係用呢款啤牌 呢度有我親筆簽名嘅啤牌 多謝你，布萊恩 
And here's why that's important: there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life. ,佢哋被稱為 Oblique Strategies 佢同佢朋友設計嘅 
Take the planet Venus. ,而當佢哋喺工作室毫無頭緒嘅時候 布萊恩攞其中一張卡 
"It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky. ",佢隨機抽一張 佢會叫樂隊按照卡上嘅說話做 
But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. ,所以呢個… 
"The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius. ",「更改樂隊成員嘅崗位」 
That's hot enough to melt lead. ,每個人都要換一換位置 鼓手去彈鋼琴 唔錯嘅諗法 
"Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason. ",「仔細睇令人尷尬嘅細節，放大佢哋」 
"It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids, trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. ",「做一個突然、破壞性、 不可預測嘅行動。 合拼入去首歌裏面」 
The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. ,呢啲卡係有破壞冇建設性嘅 
"From these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. ",透過一張又一張嘅專輯 我哋見到卡嘅價值 
We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. ,但樂手好憎佢哋 
"For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away. ",（笑聲） 菲爾 ‧ 柯林斯喺早期 布賴恩嘅專輯裏面打鼓 
So that's more than 100 trillion miles. ,佢開始沮喪，佢開始喺工作室扔啤酒罐 
Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. ,Carlos Alomar，傑出嘅搖滾吉他手 曾經同布萊恩喺 David Bowie 嘅專輯 Lodger 裏面合作 一次，佢同布賴恩話： 「布賴恩，呢個實驗係蠢嘅。」 
It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. ,但事實上，個專輯相當唔錯 而且卡洛斯喺 35 年後嘅今日 都用梗 Oblique Strategies 
"OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away, and you want to know the precise color of that fly. ",佢叫佢嘅學生都用 Oblique Strategies 因為佢意識到 
So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life. ,你唔鍾意佢，唔代表佢幫唔到你 
"Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f, with the Earth for reference. ",實際上，Oblique Strategies 並非一副啤牌 佢只係一個表 喺錄音室牆上嘅一個表 
"It's 1,200 light years away, and just 40 percent larger than Earth. ",當你卡住咗，你可以試下用嘅一個表 
Our NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit. ,但個表冇用 
So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life. ,知道點解嗎？ 
Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate. ,唔夠亂 
"Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light, and reflects shorter, bluer light. ",你隻眼睛會掃落個表度 然後會停喺破壞性最小嘅一樣嘢 最少麻煩嘅一樣嘢 咁樣當然係完全冇意思啦 
That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue. ,布萊恩覺得 我哋需要運行做愚蠢嘅實驗 我哋需要面對尷尬嘅陌生人 我哋要讀核突嘅字體 
The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice. ,呢啲嘢幫我哋 
Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom. ,解決問題 幫我哋更加有創意 
Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice. ,而且… 
My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars. ,如果我哋要做以上嘅嘢 我哋首先要說服自己 
"There's another contradiction -- that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars, and that light, that energy, heats the ice. ",所以，無論我哋點做… 
Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere. ,無論係純粹意志力 無論係一張卡 定係 Vera 俾個彈唔到嘅琴你 我哋所有人都應該定時 坐低，彈嗰個彈唔到嘅琴 
And it's no surprise that this is my specialty. ,多謝 
"I'm an African-American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines, so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature -- (Laughter) (Applause) ... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists. ",（掌聲） 
"My organization, Rising Stargirls, teaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color, using theater, writing and visual art. ",
"That's another contradiction -- science and art don't often go together, but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn, and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions, and use their backgrounds to discover, once and for all, that we are truly not alone in the universe. ",我喺度搵緊其他有生命存在嘅星球 
Thank you. ,雖然我唔能夠用肉眼睇到呢啲星球 就算用埋最先進嘅望遠鏡 
(Applause) ,但我知道佢就喺嗰度 
,而且掌握大自然本身嘅矛盾 可以幫到我哋搵到呢個星球 
"A few years ago, I got one of those spam emails. ",響我哋嘅星球 邊度有水，邊度就有生命 
And it managed to get through my spam filter. ,所以我哋尋找嗰啲 同恒星保持合適運行距離嘅星球 
"I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox, and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh. ",呢個表入面 藍色係代表咗唔同恒星嘅適居帶 而呢種距離暖到 可以令水喺星球嘅表面流動 形成咗湖同海 而生命就有可能響呢啲地方出現 
(Laughter) I know. ,一啲天文學家集中精神 尋找位於適居帶嘅星球 
"(Laughter) It went like this: it said, ""Hello James Veitch, I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon."" ",我嘅任務就係接手佢哋嘅工作 
"Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right? ",我要推算出系外行星嘅氣候 
"I was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this. ",下面我會講解點解呢樣會咁重要 除咗距離之外 仲有好多其他因素 決定一個星球有生命嘅存在 
Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do. ,就攞金星做例子 
"(Laughter) And I said, ""Solomon, Your email intrigues me."" ",佢嘅名代表咗羅馬人 一個象徵愛同美麗嘅女神 正因為佢喺天空 以美善、輕飄嘅姿態出現 
(Laughter) (Applause) And the game was afoot. ,但探測器做出嘅測量欲唔係想像中咁靚 
"He said, ""Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."" ",金星表面嘅溫度高達華氏 900度 亦即攝氏500度 
"(Laughter) ""You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."" ",佢嘅溫度足夠融咗鉛 
(Laughter) So I knew I was dealing with a professional. ,佢厚厚嘅大氣層 而唔係佢同太陽嘅距離 
"(Laughter) I said, ""How much is it worth?"" ",令大氣層出現溫室效應 太陽嘅熱力被大氣層鎖住 熱力留返喺度，將星球表面加熱 
"He said, ""We will start with smaller quantity,"" -- I was like, aww -- and then he said, ""of 25 kgs. ",現實同我哋最初對金星嘅想像係倒返轉 
"(Laughter) The worth should be about $2.5 million."" ",從太陽系學到，一個星球嘅大氣 對星球嘅氣候以至生命嘅孕育 係非常之重要 
"I said, ""Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big. ",我哋唔知道呢啲系外行星嘅大氣係點樣 因為呢啲星球相比起佢哋嘅恒星 實在太細啦，兼且離我哋太遠啦 
"(Applause) I can handle it. How much gold do you have?"" ",例如，其中一個 最接近我哋又可以維持地表水嘅星球 叫做 Gliese 667 Cc 真係一個有魅力嘅名 好似個電話號碼咁 佢距離我哋有 23 光年咁遠 
"(Laughter) He said, ""It is not a matter of how much gold I have, what matters is your capability of handling. ",超過一兆英里 
"We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."" ",要響系外行星經過佢哋恒星嗰時 量度佢哋嘅大氣組成 
"I said, ""50 kgs? ",係非常艱難嘅 就好似嘗試望住隻果蠅 飛過一架車嘅前燈 
"There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton."" ",好，你可以想像嗰架車離你一兆英里 而你只想知嗰隻果蠅嘅顏色 
"(Laughter) (Applause) He said, ""What do you do for a living?"" ",所以我利用一個電腦模擬程式 去計算星球需要乜嘢大氣層 先至會有合適嘅氣候提供水同孕育生命 
"(Laughter) I said, ""I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."" ",呢度係畫家對開普勒-62f 概念嘅理解 用地球做參照 
"(Laughter) This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend, no no no. ","佢有 1,200 光年咁遠 比地球大 40% "
Then I started to panic. ,我哋 NSF 資助嘅項目發現 無論佢嘅大氣同運行軌道嘅方向係咩 佢都夠暖俾到水出現 
"I was like, ""Where are you based?"" ",所以，我想未來嘅望遠鏡 可以追蹤呢個星球 去搵出星球上面嘅生命線索 
"I don't know about you, but I think if we're going via the postal service, it ought to be signed for. ",星球表面嘅冰 係另一種決定氣候嘅重要因素 
"He said, ""It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment."" ",冰吸收長波，偏紅嘅光 反射短波嘅藍光 
"I said, ""Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one. ",呢個就係點解呢幅圖嘅冰咁藍 
I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting. ,嚟自太陽嘅紅光通過冰塊時就被吸收 
"Hold tight."" ",剩低藍光穿過底部出返嚟 
(Laughter) This is what I sent Solomon. ,之後藍光反射到我哋嘅眼 所以我哋見到藍色嘅冰 
"(Laughter) (Applause) I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house, but there's definitely something going on. ",我嘅模型推算出 星球圍繞溫度較低嘅恒星時 佢嘅溫度 會比圍繞較熱嘅恒星嘅星球更高 
"(Laughter) I said, ""Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart. ",下面係第二個矛盾︰ 冰吸收嚟自溫度較低嘅恒星 波長較長嘅光 光，或者能量，令冰嘅溫度上升 
I've had one of my assistants run the numbers. ,探索呢啲矛盾嘅嘢點樣影響星球氣候 對於尋找外星生命 係非常重要嘅 
"(Laughter) We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."" ",絕對唔係意外，呢個係我鑽研方向 
"There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings, and this was it for Solomon. ",我係非裔女性美國天文學家 亦係一個受過真正訓練嘅演員 鍾意化妝，睇時尚雜誌 所以我好欣賞大自然存在嘅矛盾 （笑聲） （掌聲） 呢啲矛盾引領我哋研究 將我哋帶到下一個有生命存在嘅星球 
"He said, ""I will be so much happy if the deal goes well, because I'm going to get a very good commission as well."" ",我嘅組織， Rising Stargirls 通過戲劇表演、寫作同視覺藝術 教授天文學俾唔同膚色嘅中學女生 
"And I said, ""That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?"" ",呢個又係另一個矛盾 科學同藝術好多時唔能夠喺埋一齊 但係將佢哋擺埋一齊 可以令佢哋明白佢哋學嘅嘢 或者有一日 佢哋會加入天文學家嘅行列 呢個充滿矛盾發現嘅職業 利用佢哋嘅背景 探索到我哋唔係宇宙中唯一嘅生物 
"And he said, ""On RealEstate, what about you?"" ",多謝 
I thought about it for a long time. ,（掌聲） 
"And I said, ""One word; Hummus."" ",
"(Laughter) ""It's going places. ",幾年前，我收到一封垃圾電郵 
(Laughter) I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties. ,佢過到個垃圾郵件過濾 
"Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them. ",我唔係好知點解 總之就出現喺我收件匣 寄件人係叫 Solomon Odonkoh 
"Have you ever done that, Solomon?"" ",（笑聲） 我知 
"(Laughter) He said, ""I have to go bed now."" ",（笑聲） 封郵件係咁寫： 「你好，James Veitch， 我有一個好有趣嘅商業計劃 想邀請你參與，Solomon 上。」 
"(Laughter) (Applause) ""Till morrow. ",呢個時候，我隻手指已經準備㩒刪除鍵 
"Have sweet dream."" ",我諗大家都係咁 我望住部電話 
I didn't know what to say! ,心諗我可以就咁刪除封郵件 或者，可以做啲大家都想做嘅事 
"I said, ""Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."" ","（笑聲） 於是我話︰「Solomon, 我對你嘅計劃好有興趣。」 "
"(Laughter) Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks, albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life, but I had to knock it on the head. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 個遊戲，正式開始 
It was getting a bit out of hand. ,"佢話：「親愛嘅 James Veitch, 我哋想寄黃金畀你。」 "
"Friends were saying, ""James, do you want to come for a drink?"" ",（笑聲） 「你賣得出嘅話， 你可以分到一成佣。」 
"I was like, ""I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."" ",（笑聲） 我知我遇著騙徒老手 
So I figured I had to knock it on the head. ,（笑聲） 我問︰「值幾錢呀？」 
I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion. ,佢話︰「我哋可以由小量開始。」 我就，呃… 然後佢話︰「25 公斤。」 
So I concocted a plan. ,（笑聲） 「值大概 250 萬美金。」 
"When we email each other, we need to use a code."" ",我話︰「Solomon，係嘅話， 我哋不如做大佢啦！」 
And he agreed. ,（掌聲） 「我搞得掂喎，你有幾多金呀？」 
"(Laughter) I said, ""Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence: Lawyer: Gummy Bear. ",（笑聲） 佢話︰「幾多金唔係問題， 係睇你搞得掂幾多， 
Bank: Cream Egg. ,我哋可以由 50 公斤開始。」 
Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim: Peanut M&amp;Ms. ,我話︰「50 公斤？ 
Documents: Jelly Beans. ,咁冇咩綽頭喎， 至少都運一噸啦。」 
"(Laughter) I knew these were all words they use, right? ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 佢話︰「你做邊行㗎？」 
"I said, ""Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."" ",（笑聲） 我話︰ 「我係銀行對沖基金執行經理。」 
"(Laughter) I didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far. ",（笑聲） 「老友呀，我已經唔係第一次運金條。 完全唔係。」 
I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little. ,於是我開始扮騰雞 
"I said, ""Solomon, Is the deal still on? ",我問︰「你哋公司喺邊？ 我同你又三唔識七。 
"KitKat."" ",如果我哋用郵寄方式運金嘅話， 要簽收喎，咁多黃金。」 
(Laughter) Because you have to be consistent. ,佢答︰「要說服我公司 做咁大筆生意唔容易。」 
Then I did get an email back from him. ,我話︰「Solomon， 我完全明白你嘅憂慮。 
"He said, ""The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."" ",我陣間過張圖表畀你， 方便你喺董事會上講清楚。 
"I said, ""Dude, you have to use the code!"" ",你等我一陣。」 
What followed is the greatest email I've ever received. ,（笑聲） 呢個係我寄畀 Solomon 
"(Laughter) I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox. ",（笑聲） （橫軸：財富；縱軸：金嘅數量） （掌聲） 我唔肯定在座有冇統計學家 但我之後同佢有下文 
This was a good day. ,（笑聲） 我話︰「Solomon，附件有張 對你有幫助嘅圖表。 
"The business is on. 
I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear -- (Laughter) so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg, for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start. 
(Laughter) Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard. ",我請我嘅助手試算過。」 
"(Applause) And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could? ",（笑聲） 我哋已經準備好， 運得越多黃金越好！」 
And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf. ,有啲時候我哋會俾一啲嘢感動 呢一刻嘅 Solomon 都係 佢話︰「如果成交嘅話我會好開心， 
(Laughter) (Applause) Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails. ,因為我都會有一筆可觀嘅回佣。」 
"It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it. ",我話︰「冇得彈呀， 你會點用筆錢呀？」 
I don't think what I'm doing is mean. ,然後佢話︰「買樓呀，你呢？」 
There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers. ,我諗咗好耐 
All I'm doing is wasting their time. ,我話︰「一樣嘢︰ 鷹嘴豆泥。」 
"And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings, right? ",（笑聲） 實掂 
And if you're going to do this -- and I highly recommend you do -- get yourself a pseudonymous email address. ,（笑聲） 我有一日喺 Sainsbury's 見到超過 30 種口味 
Don't use your own email address. ,你仲可以切啲紅蘿蔔 點落鷹嘴豆泥添！ 
That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare. ,你有冇試過呀 Solomon？ 
"I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements, only one of which was a legitimate response -- (Laughter) to a medical question I had. ",（笑聲） 佢話︰「我要瞓喇。」 
"But I'll tell you what, though, guys, I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this: (Laughter) ""I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."" ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 「聽日見！ 
"I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela. ",發個好夢！」 
(Laughter) I know so many. ,我唔知點答佢呀！ 
I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION. ,我話︰「早唞喇，金條，早唞。」 
Let that sink in. ,（笑聲） 各位，你要知道 呢件事持續咗幾個禮拜 雖然到目前為止 呢個係我人生中最正嗰幾個禮拜 但我唔想玩喇 佢有啲失控 
"She sent me this, which is hysterical. ",朋友問我︰ 「James，飲唔飲返杯呀？」 
(Laughter) And this. ,我話︰「唔得呀， 我等緊封關於黃金嘅電郵。」 
"And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization. ",所以我覺得要停喇 
"But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape! ",我要令到件事去到一個荒謬嘅地步 
"(Laughter) I said, ""Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this. ",於是我諗到一個計劃 
"Given that Nelson died three months ago, I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."" ",我話︰「Solomon， 我好擔心安全問題， 
"(Laughter) That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive. ",我哋通信嘅時候用代號呀。」 
"She said, ""KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS. ",佢應承咗 
"ONE LOVE."" ",（笑聲） 我話︰「Solomon， 我用咗成晚諗啲代號， 以後通信都用代號溝通啦。 律師：小熊軟糖； 
"(Laughter) I said, ""Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."" ",銀行：奶油蛋； 
"(Laughter) (Applause) She said, ""MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE."" ",法律：可樂樽； 聲明：花生； 
"(Laughter) I said, ""no problemo. ",文件：啫喱豆； 西聯匯款：一隻巨型橡皮蜥蜴。」 
"I SHOT THE SHERIFF."" ",（笑聲） 我知呢啲都係佢哋用嘅代號，係咪？ 
[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ] (Laughter) Thank you. ,我話︰「以後就叫我 Kitkat 啦。」 
(Applause) ,（笑聲） 我以為自己過咗火 所以冇再收到回覆 
,於是我收念返少少 
Democracy. ,我話︰「Solomon， 我哋交易仲繼續㗎呵？ 
"In the West, we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted. ",KitKat 上。」 
"We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is, but we see it as part of our society's furniture. ",（笑聲） 因為我之前講明用代號嘛！ 
We tend to think of it as an intransigent given. ,終於我收到一封回覆 
We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. ,佢話︰「個交易仲進行緊㗎， 我嘗試去點點點…」 
It doesn't. ,我話︰「老友， 你要用啲代號先得㗎！」 
"Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism, spectacular growth, while politics remains democracy-free. ",於是，我收到一封神回覆 
"Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods, here in Europe. ",（笑聲） 我唔係講笑，我真係收到封咁嘅回覆 
"Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process -- our elections -- could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. ",嗰日零舍開心 
"At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything. ",「交易仲進行緊㗎， 
"Tonight, here, I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy. ",我嘗試緊為小熊軟糖增加結餘。」 （笑聲） 「咁佢先可以提交 所有需要嘅可樂樽啫喱豆 畀奶油蛋， 從而開始進行花生。」 
"I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy -- that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy. ","（笑聲） 麻煩經一隻巨型橡皮蜥蜴 匯 1,500 鎊畀我 "
"And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted. ",（掌聲） 係咪好好玩呢！ 於是我喺度諗： 如果我將大部分時間 都盡量去覆呢啲詐騙郵件會點呢？ 
"Speaking of waste, allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. ",冇錯，呢三年我就係 代表各位回覆詐騙集團 
I call it the twin peaks paradox. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 當你開始覆詐騙郵件嘅時候 瘋狂嘅事情就會發生 
"One peak you understand -- you know it, you recognize it -- is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world. ",雖然覆電郵係好困難 但我好建議大家一齊做 
We all recognize the mountain of debts. ,我唔覺得自己咁做好衰 
But few people discern its twin. ,大把人對詐騙集團做衰嘢 
"A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs, like green energy. ",我做嘅只係浪費佢哋嘅時間 
Now let me give you two numbers. ,而且我覺得每當佢哋嘥時間喺我身上 就會冇咗時間去呃其他 容易上當嘅人㗎啦，係咪？ 
"Over the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods -- things like industrial plants, machinery, office blocks, schools, roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth. ",不過如果你要咁做 我強烈建議你開返一個匿名嘅電郵 
"$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries, in our financial institutions, doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices. ",唔好用自己嘅電郵 
"So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets. ",我一開始就係咁 嗰時直頭係惡夢 
"The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe out of work. ",我當時一起身收到過千封郵件 全部都係關於壯陽藥 當中只有其中一封唔係詐騙嘅 （笑聲） 因為佢真係答返我 一條醫學問題 
"And consequently, low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors, who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing -- exactly like Oedipus' father, who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him, unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him. ",但各位，我話畀大家知： 每一日你都會收到電郵 如果你收到一封電郵個開頭係咁： （笑聲） 「我係 Winnie Mandela， 前南非總統曼德拉第二個老婆」 
This is my quarrel with capitalism. ,我當時係，噢！ 嗰個 Winnie Mandela！ 
"Its gross wastefulness, all this idle cash, should be energized to improve lives, to develop human talents, and indeed to finance all these technologies, green technologies, which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth. ",（笑聲） 我識好多個 Winnie Mandela 㗎嘛 
Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer? ,"「我需要滙 4,500 萬美金到國外， 因為我先生曼德拉嘅健康狀況。」 "
"I believe so, but before we move on, what do we mean by democracy? ",睇下點先啦 
"Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government. ",佢仲畀咗呢樣嘢我，勁搞笑 
"Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many. ",（笑聲） 仲有呢個添 
"Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves. ",咁望落去好合情合理呀 呢封係一封授權信 
But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded. ,但係你望清楚啲！冇字㗎！ 印章只係得個樣！ 
"What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy, was the inclusion of the working poor, who not only acquired the right to free speech, but more importantly, crucially, they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state. ",（笑聲） 我話︰「Winnie 呀， 聽到咁嘅事情發生 真係好唔好意思， 
"Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long. ",畢竟曼德拉過咗身三個月， 佢嘅病情真係幾嚴重。」 
"Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly. ",（笑聲） 一個人最差嘅健康狀況就係死亡 
"And indeed, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens. ",佢話︰「麻煩你遵照我銀行家嘅指示。 
"They have their roots in the Magna Carta, in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, indeed in the American constitution. ",唯一嘅愛上。」 
"Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor, our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition, which was, after all, a charter for masters. ",（笑聲） 我話︰「冇問題。 女人總係需要男人嘅金錢。」 
"And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere, so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere, leaving the economic sphere -- the corporate world, if you want -- as a democracy-free zone. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 佢話︰「我嘅銀行家要先收到 三千美金嘅滙款。 
"Now, in our democracies today, this separation of the economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two, with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power. ",唯一嘅愛上。」 （笑聲） 我話︰「冇問題， 
Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? ,我幫你搞掂咗個呀頭啦。」 
It's not because their DNA has degenerated. ,（不過冇殺到佢副手囉） （笑聲） 多謝 
"(Laughter) It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate. ",（掌聲） 
"Indeed, I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism. ",
"If you think about it, it is a little bit like a population of predators, that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on, that in the end they starve. ",民主 
"Similarly, the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself, causing economic crisis. ",活喺西方社會嘅我哋犯咗個好大嘅錯 就係視民主理所當然 
"Corporate power is increasing, political goods are devaluing, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations. ",雖然民主係一朵最脆弱嘅花 但我哋冇將民主視為一朵最脆弱嘅花 我哋反而視佢為社會嘅擺設品 
"So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth. ",我哋往往覺得佢係必然嘅 
"Clearly, if this is right, we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control, like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants. ",我哋以為資本主義會帶嚟民主 
"Now, this is not an original idea. ",但唔係 
"The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well, did it? ",新加坡前總理李光耀 同埋北京一班好似佢咁嘅人 說服到人 繁華嘅資本市場同顯著嘅增長 係絕對可以出現喺極權政體裏面 
"The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered, as they were in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste. ",事實上，民主喺歐洲一帶倒退緊 
But there is a solution: eliminate the working poor. ,今年初，我代表希臘 代表當時啱啱新選出嘅希臘政府 以財長身份出席歐元集團會議 我被清楚告知 希臘嘅民主進程、我哋嘅選舉 唔可以干預 希臘即將被落實嘅經濟政策 
"Capitalism's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots. ",當時我覺得李光耀或者中國共產黨 都唔會有更加好嘅辯護藉口 而且有幾個固執嘅朋友不斷同我講 如果民主真係可以改變任何嘢 民主就會被打壓 
"The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate, automation makes the twin peaks taller, the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper, including -- soon, I believe -- in places like China. ",今晚喺度，我想同你哋講 一個真正民主社會底下嘅經濟情況 
"So we need to reconfigure, we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres, but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere, lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary. ",我想請大家同我一齊再次睇清楚 李光耀、中國共產黨同埋歐元集團 以為我哋可以分配民主 但我哋真正要嘅 係一個真正、多人參與嘅民主 
(Laughter) So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning. ,冇咗民主，我哋社會會唔掂 未來會暗淡，新科技亦都會浪費 
"The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society, where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora. ",講起浪費 等我指出一個好有趣 會要脅我哋經濟嘅悖論 
I think we can afford to be optimistic. ,我叫佢做「雙峰悖論」 
"But what would it take, what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia? ",第一個峰你哋知道嘅 就係喺美國，歐洲，以至全球 債台高築構成長期陰霾 
"In practical terms, allow me to share just briefly, a couple of examples. ",我哋知道有好多債務 
"At the level of the enterprise, imagine a capital market, where you earn capital as you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company -- whichever one you happen to work at at that time -- is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment. ",但好少人意識到佢有個孖生兄弟 
"Then all income stems from capital, from profits, and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete. ",一座由有錢人同大機構嘅閑置資金 砌出嚟嘅山峰 佢哋唔夠膽投資佢哋嘅存款 去一啲製造營利嘅生產活動度 呢啲生產活動其實可以償還債務 仲可以製造人類急需要用嘅嘢 例如可再生能源 
"No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor; no great gap between investment and saving; indeed, no towering twin peaks. ",依家，我想講兩個數字 
"At the level of the global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate, with a universal, global, digital currency, one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, on behalf of all humanity. ",喺過去三個月入面 我哋喺美國，英國同歐元區 各種可以製造財富嘅商品 總共投資咗 3.4 萬億美元 好似有工廠、機械廠、寫字樓 學校、道路、鐵路、機械等 
"And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency -- let's call it ""the cosmos,"" in units of cosmos -- with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit, or indeed to a country's trade surplus. ",3.4 萬億美元聽落好似好多錢 直至你攞佢同 5.1 萬億美元比較 呢一筆 5.1 萬億嘅資金 喺同一批國家嘅金融機構裏面 除咗加劇股票市場通脹 令房價上升之外 喺同一期間就再冇發揮過任何作用 
"And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce. ",所以呢，一座債務嘅山 同一座閑置現金嘅山 形成兩座山峰 兩者都冇通過正常市場運作抵消對方 
This is not a new idea. ,結果造成薪酬停滯 喺美國，日本同歐洲 就有超過四分之一 介乎 25 至 54 歲嘅人冇工做 
"It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference. ",跟住，經濟總需求就會 進入永無止境嘅減退周期 令投資者對前景更悲觀 投資者怕咗低需求量 於是唔再投資 就好似伊底帕斯王嘅老竇 被神預言佢個仔大個之後會殺死佢 佢好驚 但佢亦無意中營造咗被殺嘅條件出嚟 令佢個仔伊底帕斯王真係殺咗佢 
"The problem is that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it. ",呢個就係我對資本主義嘅爭論 
"Now we do, especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere. ",資本主義造成浪費 資本主義之下閑置嘅錢早就應該 用嚟提高人類生活水平、發展人才 同埋資助開發可再生能源科技 呢啲科技對保護地球好重要 
"The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it prioritizes empowered individuals, Marxist, since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor, and Keynesian, global Keynesian. ",咁民主可唔可以扭轉呢一切？ 
"But above all else, it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy. ",我相信得 但行動之前，我哋要知究竟咩係民主 
Will such a world dawn? ,亞里士多德定義民主做︰ 當自由嘅人同窮人 佔體制大多數控制政府 
Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia? ,當然，雅典時代嘅民主 將太多人排除在外 
The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively. ,當中包括女人、移民、奴隸 
"It is our choice, and we'd better make it democratically. ",但係，如果因為呢啲被排除嘅人 而忽視古雅典民主嘅成功之處 咁係錯嘅 
Thank you. ,雅典民主裏邊更值得肯定嘅係 而且就算時至今日仍然值得肯定嘅係 佢囊括埋勞動階級 令佢哋唔單止有言論自由嘅權利 更重要、更重要嘅係 佢哋有權批評政治 而且佢哋嘅意見 對國家決策係同等重要 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Yanis ... ,古雅典民主持續咗唔係好耐 
It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist. ,就好似一枝好光嘅蠟燭好快就燒完 
What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today? ,的而且確 現今嘅自由民主唔係嚟自古雅典 
"Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant. ",佢哋源自 1688 年 光榮革命時期嘅美國憲法 或者嚟自大憲章 
"Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is -- if we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation. ",而雅典民主關注嘅係普通平民 授權予貧苦勞動階級 我哋嘅自由民主 建立喺大憲章嘅傳統上面 但點都好，大憲章都係有錢人嘅憲章 
"With this crisis migrating from one part of the world, as it is now, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy. ",當政治領域同經濟領域分開 而民主進程受制於政治領域裏面時 經濟領域，或者商業世界 就會變成一個冇民主成份嘅地方 咁樣，自由民主先會出現 
"So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant. ",我哋今時今日嘅民主 將經濟由政治領域分出嚟 呢一切開始發生嘅時候 亦同時引發兩者之間 無可避免嘅長期戰爭 經濟領域殖民統治政治領域 經濟領域將政治領域嘅權利吞噬 
"But so is Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and so is Keynes, so that's why I'm totally confused. ",你哋有冇諗過點解 宜家嘅政治家同以前嘅佢哋唔同？ 
"(Laughter) BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now. ",唔係因為佢哋 DNA 變咗 
"(Laughter) (Applause) YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK? ",（笑聲） 而係因為依家 喺政府做嘢嘅人已經冇權力 因為權力已經從政治領域轉移到 同政治領域無關嘅經濟領域 
"BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say -- YV: That was Einstein, actually -- BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speaker dinner, you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China. ",講真，以上就係我憎資本主義嘅地方 
Would you like to share that? ,你諗下，好似一班肉食動物 殺死咗大量佢哋懶以生存嘅獵物 最後唯有自己挨餓 
"YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy. ",同樣道理 經濟領域殖民同吞食咗政治領域 喺呢種情況下佢其實削弱嘅係自己 令自己面臨經濟危機 
"In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy. ",企業勢力崛起緊，但政治勢力減緊 唔平等嘅問題加劇緊 總需求又下跌梗 企業總裁怕投資自己公司啲錢去第度 
"It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk, democracy to the political sphere, while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy-free zone. ",資本主義越係將人從民主裏面剔除 兩座負債同閑錢嘅山峰就會越嚟越高 人力資源同人類財富亦會越嚟越浪費 
"In a sense, if I am allowed to be provocative, China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century. ",好明顯，如果咁樣嘅推測係啱嘅話 我哋就必須要合返埋政治同經濟領域 最好可以畀人民控制大局 就好似古雅典一樣 但奴隸、女人同移民唔包括在內 
"Because remember, we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically. ",呢樣嘢並唔係咩新概念 
"Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill. ",馬克思主義者一百年前就有咁嘅諗法 但佢哋嘅諗法唔係發展得好好 
John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process. ,我哋從蘇聯解體學到 只有奇蹟先可以 令勞動階層重新獲得權力 就好似古代雅典冇帶嚟 新形式嘅暴行同浪費咁 
"So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second. ",但有一個解决辦法：消滅勞動階層 
"And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy. ",資本主義正係做緊呢樣嘢 佢通過自動程式、安卓系統、機械人 取代低薪嘅勞動力 
BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year. ,問題係只要經濟同政治領域一直分離 自動化過程會令 兩座負債同閑錢嘅山峰更加高 加劇浪費，同埋加深社會矛盾 我相信中國呢類地方會好快發生咁嘅事 
YV: I knew this was coming. ,因此我哋要改造 我哋要將經濟領域同政治領域拉返埋 方法就係將兩個領域民主化 以免我哋最終生活喺 一個監控狂、超專制嘅制度下 如果唔係《駭客任務》電影 就好容易變成紀錄片 
BG: Yes. ,（笑聲） 問題唔係資本主義可以承受 自己帶嚟嘅科技創新 
"BG: Six months after, how do you look back at the first half of the year? ",最令我感興趣嘅係 資本主義會唔會畀《駭客任務》 入面嘅敵托邦取代 又或者好似《星際迷航》嘅社會取代 《星際迷航》裏面，機械服務人類 而人類就擴張能量，探索星際 同埋喺一啲類似 古雅典嘅高科技集會度 喋喋不休咁討論人生意義 
"YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone. ",我覺得我哋可以樂觀啲睇 
"Not just Greece, the Eurozone. ",但要擁有《星際迷航》嘅烏托邦 或者《駭客任務》嘅敵托邦 我哋要做啲咩呢？ 
"To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive -- and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone, which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process. ",等我略略講下幾個例子 
"We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program -- which by the way, was the first program to manifest that denial -- to put it right. ",企業層面上，你可以想像一個資金市場 喺嗰度，你只要工作就可以賺取資金 即使你轉工、轉公司 你賺嘅資金都會跟住你 而每間公司都係由嗰度做嘢嘅人持有 
"And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial. ",所有收入嚟自資本同利潤 僱傭概念最後會過時 
But you know what happens. ,唔會再有人擁有但冇為公司工作 或者冇擁有公司但為公司工作 唔會再有資本階級 同勞動階級之間嘅鬥爭 投資、儲蓄之間再唔會有大嘅差距 亦再冇兩座高聳入雲嘅賃務同閑錢嘅山 
This is the experience of the Soviet Union. ,至於全球政治型經濟層面 可以想像一下 我哋國家貨幣同一個 由國際貨幣基金組織同 G20 峰會 代表全人類發行嘅全球性數碼貨幣 有自由浮動匯率 
"When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive, through political will and through authoritarianism, you may succeed in prolonging it, but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically. ",再想像下 所有國際貿易都用呢隻貨幣進行 我哋就稱佢為「宇宙幣」 每個政府都會根據自己國家 貿易逆差或者順差 向一個共同基金按比例投入宇宙幣 
BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing? ,想像呢個基金用嚟投資 全世界可再生能源科技 尤其投資到世界上資金唔到嘅地方 
"YV: Well, there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, the Eurozone has no future. ",呢個唔係新構思 
BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister? ,實際上，佢係由凱恩斯 1944 年 喺布列敦森林會議上提出嘅 
YV: Every day. ,問題係當時佢哋冇科技實現呢個理念 
"BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back -- (Applause) No, but seriously. ",但依家我哋有啦 尤其當政治同經濟領域重新走埋一齊 
"If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter, who tells you after six months in a job, especially in such a stressful situation, that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people. ",我描述梗嘅呢個世界同時係自由嘅 佢將被賜權力嘅人 同馬克思主義者擺喺首位 因為咁樣 資本同勞動階層之間嘅分別 同埋凱恩斯主義 會消失喺歷史長河裏面 
Of course I made mistakes. ,但總言之 呢個係一個我哋能夠 想像到真正民主嘅世界 
The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February. ,咁嘅世界會唔會出現呢？ 
I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground. ,或者我哋會淪落到好似 《黑客帝國》咁嘅反烏德邦？ 
And there wasn't. ,答案就喺我哋大家 要做嘅政治決擇入面 
"They were simply interested in crushing our government, just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone. ",呢個係我哋嘅選擇 而我哋最好用民主方式決定 
And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece. ,多謝 
We lost one-third of our nominal GDP. ,（掌聲） 主持︰瓦魯法基斯⋯ 
This is worse than the Great Depression. ,你喺自我介紹入面叫自己做 自由派馬克思主義者 
"And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say, ""This was a colossal mistake."" ",咁分析馬克思主義 同現今世界有咩關係呢？ 
"BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion, you seem to be remaining quite pro-European. ",講者：如果我投先講嘅内容 有相關嘅地方 咁馬克思主義就係有參考價值 
YV: Absolutely. ,因為重新連起政治 同經濟領域嘅重點係 如果我哋唔做 咁科技創新就會導致總需求大幅下跌 亦即係 Larry Summers 所講嘅經濟長期停滯 
"Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe. ",隨住危機由世界某一度向外擴散 就好似而家咁 佢唔單止令我哋嘅民主制度唔穩定 仲會沖擊唔係特别歡迎 自由民主嘅發展中國家 
My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive. ,如果呢個論述成立嘅話 咁馬克思主義絕對係相關嘅 
"Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic, and they will destroy the European Union. ",而哈耶克論述都係 呢樣就係點解我係 自由派馬克思主義者 凱恩斯都係 所以我自己都係矇查查 
And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy. ,（笑聲） 主持：確實係 但可能我哋依家都係咁添 
We are probably the largest economy in the world. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 講者︰如果你冇覺得困惑嘅話 即係代表你冇喺度思考。得唔得？ 
"And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, which seems to me to be what we are doing, then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike. ",主持︰真係好希臘哲學家嘅講法 講者：應該係愛因斯坦至真 主持：你提到新加坡同中國 仲有琴晚喺演講嘉賓晚宴 你對西方點樣看待中國一事上 表達咗強烈嘅觀點 
BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point. ,你想唔想同我哋講下？ 
"Yanis, thank you for coming to TED. ",講者：嗯，偽善嘅面孔有好多 
YV: Thank you. ,而喺我哋自由民主制度之下 我哋有虛有其表嘅民主 
,因為正如我剛才所講 我哋框死咗民主喺政治領域裏面 以致當去到經濟領域時 所有動作都係唔民主嘅 
"I'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer with National Geographic, but I want to share a secret. ",可以咁講 激進啲咁講 中國今時今日就好似 19 世紀嘅英國 
"This image is totally incorrect, totally incorrect. ",因為記得當時 我哋將自由主義同民主唥埋一齊 但呢個係歷史上嘅錯誤 
I see a couple of people crying in the back that I've blown their idea of mermaids. ,自由主義就好似 John Stuart Mill 所諗 
"All right, the mermaid is indeed real, but anyone who's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this. ",John Stuart Mill 對民主進程特別懷疑 
"It's because the ocean is this massive filter, and as soon as you start going underwater, you're going to lose your colors, and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly. ",宜家你見到嘅中國 同工業革命時期嘅英國— 尤其是由第一次到第二次 工業革命過渡期嘅英國 有一個非常相似嘅過程 
But we're humans -- we're terrestrial mammals. ,用西方社會 19 世紀 做過嘅事嚟斥責中國 實在太虚偽啦 
"And we've got trichromatic vision, so we see in red, green and blue, and we're just complete color addicts. ",主持：我相信在座好多人都對你今年初 出任希臘財政部長嘅經歷好奇 
"We love eye-popping color, and we try to bring this eye-popping color underwater with us. ",講者：我都知你會問呢個問題 
"So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater, and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin, who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph. ",主持：冇錯 
"And they're in there with old-school scuba suits, where you're pumping air down to them, and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder, and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus, and -- boom! -- a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish. ",咁六個月之後，你點睇頭半年嘅經歷？ 
"I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real. ",講者：就我個人嚟講，係非常興奮 亦非常失望 因為我哋有機會重振歐元區 
They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color. ,不單只希臘，而係歐元區 
"And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us, that we've been looking at the blue ocean, and it's a crucible of blue, and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors. ",令成個區走出自滿 同唔再拒絕承認… 宜家有一條結構性嘅裂痕 横跨成個歐元區 威脅到歐盟發展 
And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like. ,我哋曾經喺希臘項目裏面 有咁嘅機會做好去 呢個希臘項目係第一個計劃 解决呢啲拒認嘅問題 
It's like an underwater light show. ,不幸嘅係 歐元區嘅權勢 歐元集團嘅權勢 仍然選擇繼續否認問題存在 
"(Music) Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image. ",但你知道有嘢會發生 
These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light. ,蘇聯嘅經驗已經講咗畀我哋知 
"So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet, and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters. ",如果你想令根本生存唔到嘅經濟系统 通過政治意願或者 威權主義嘅方式繼續生存 你可能成功將佢延長壽命 但係當改變來臨時 事情就會好突然，而且災難性 
"As we go down underwater, after about 10 meters, all the red is gone. ",主持︰你希望見到咩變化？ 
"So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red, it's an animal transforming and creating its own red. ",講者：嗯，無容置疑 如果我哋唔改變歐元區嘅架構 歐元區係唔會有將來 
This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet. ,主持：當你做希臘財長嗰時 你有冇做過錯誤嘅决定？ 
And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals. ,講者：日日都有 
And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are. ,主持：例如？ 講者：任何人面對過去… （掌聲） 唔係，認真咁講 
"One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats, is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, fluorescent molecules. ",如果有一位財政部長 或者其他部長同你講 佢哋工作咗六個月之後 尤其喺咁大壓力嘅情況底下 佢哋冇做錯過事嘅話 呢種人其實好危險 
"And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass -- could be this fluorescent protein. ",當然，我有犯過錯 我最大錯誤就係喺二月尾 
"So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it, so it's likely doing something that has a functional role. ",簽咗申請延長債務協議嘅申請書 
"And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me, because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science, and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves. ",當時我以為債權方 真係有興趣去搵一個共同利益 
"So, how do I study this? ",但事實唔係咁 
"In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night. ",佢哋嘅興趣係想打壓我哋嘅政府 原因係佢哋唔想處理 歐元區嗰條結構裂痕 
"And when I started out, I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals. ",同埋佢哋唔想承認 佢哋過去五年對希臘 實施咗惡夢嘅計劃 
"We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History, and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef, and something happened that just blew me away: this. ",我哋喺失去咗三分一嘅名義 GDP 
It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter. ,情況比起大蕭條時更加差 
"And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters, thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera, but the eel was real. ",喺嗰班實施呢啲政策嘅債權人之中 無人可以置身事外到去講 「呢個係巨大嘅錯誤」 
"It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found, and this just changed my trajectory completely. ",主持︰除咗上述 除咗呢啲進取嘅言論 你似乎都同意歐洲一體化 
"So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist, John Sparks, and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is. ",講者：絕對係 
"And fish are much more interesting than corals, because they have really advanced vision, and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it, they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence. ",我之所以對歐盟同歐元區嘅批評 係因為我係一個歐洲人 
So I wanted to seek this out further. ,我最大嘅恐懼係 歐元區無法生存落去 
"So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world, looking for fluorescent life. ",因為如果歐元區唔可以繼續走落去 咁離心力就會被解放出嚟 就好似魔鬼咁解放 最終會摧毀整個歐盟 
"And it's a bit like ""E.T. phone home."" ",咁嘅惡果唔只對歐洲 對全球經濟都會產生嚴重影響 
"We're out there swimming with this blue light, and we're looking for a response, for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us. ",我哋可能係世界上最大嘅經濟體 
"And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel. ",如果我哋容許自己 走返 30 年代嘅舊路 雖然我覺得 我哋依家就行緊咁嘅路 咁對歐洲人嘅未來 同埋歐洲以外嘅人嘅未來 都係不利嘅 
"It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about. ",主持：我哋真係好希望 呢點上面你係錯嘅 
"They're only about the size of my finger, and they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock. ",瓦魯法基斯，多謝你嚟到 TED 
"But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights, and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue. ",講者：多謝 （掌聲） 
"Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other, quickly find each other, mate, go back into their hole for the next long stint of time. ",
"But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life, like this green fluorescent bream, with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape, and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there. ",我係海洋生物學家 同樣係攝影探險家 亦都同國家地理雜誌合作做嘢 我想分享一個秘密 
"After this fish, we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock. ",呢幅圖完全係錯嘅 全部錯哂 
"The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral. ",我睇倒後面有幾個人喺度喊 因為我破壞曬美人魚喺佢哋嘅形象 
"Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish. ",係嘅，呢個美人魚唔係假嘅 但潛過水嘅人都會知道海洋似咁樣多啲 
"These lizardfish come in many varieties, and they look almost exactly alike under white light. ",因為我哋嘅海洋係一個好大嘅濾鏡 只要你進入水底，你睇嘢就會無咗顏色 所有嘢會變成黑色或者藍色 
"But if you look at them under fluorescent light, you see lots of patterns, you can really see the differences among them. ",但係我哋人類係陸地生物 
And in total -- we just reported this last year -- we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish. ,我哋擁有三原色嘅視覺 我哋可以睇到紅、綠、藍 我哋鍾意睇到各種顏色 
One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlevé. ,我哋鍾意鮮艷奪目嘅顏色 我嘗試將呢啲鮮艷奪目嘅顏色帶到水底 
"He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology. ",早喺 88 年前就有 一段漫長又令人沮喪嘅歷史 Bill Longley 同 Charles Martin 嘗試拍低第一張水底彩色相片 
"He would design his own gear, make his own cameras, and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth. ",佢哋著住舊款潛水衣同水肺潛水 有人揼氣畀佢哋 佢哋有一隻浮筒裝住超易爆炸嘅鎂粉 而喺海面嘅人唔知佢哋幾時對焦好 亦都唔知幾時拉繩 個構思係，當鎂粉爆炸 爆炸嘅光就可以去到水底 得到好似呢條咁靚嘅魚嘅相 
So this is the male seahorse. ,但我會話呢張相冇真實呈現到大自然 
They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head. ,佢哋只係營造咗一個人工環境 嚟滿足人類對顏色嘅癡迷 
"The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures. ",我哋覺得人唔應該將顏色帶到水底 喺我哋觀察呢個藍色嘅海洋嘅當中 我哋發現海洋好比藍色嘅水缸 生活喺海洋裏面已經幾百萬年嘅生物 進化出好多方法去吸收呢種藍光 同釋放其他顏色 
So he stayed awake for days. ,呢度只係呢個神秘世界嘅一個角落 
"He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him, so he could capture this moment. ",呢個好似海底燈光表演咁 
"Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying. ",（音樂） 我哋睇緊嘅係藍光照射到珊瑚蟲 
And here's our footage. ,呢啲動物吸收緊藍光之後 即刻改變呢種光 
(Music) They're the most cryptic fish. ,你諗下，海洋佔地球面積 71% 藍光可以傳到海裏面大約一千米嘅地方 
You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse. ,當我哋落水，落到十米左右 紅光會消失 
"They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red, but they've got great vision, and they go through this long mating ritual, and perhaps they're using it in that effect. ",如果你喺水底十米以下睇到紅色嘅嘢 係點嘅一回事？ 呢啲紅光由生物自己轉化同創造嘅 
"But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray, because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class, which includes ... ",呢個係地球上最大嘅純藍色環境 
"So I'm, like, a coral biologist. ",我硏究呢個專題可以由珊瑚蟲講起 
Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent. ,我仲想成個演講都喺度介紹珊瑚蟲 因為佢哋實在太過不可思議！ 
And there I am. ,佢哋之所以不可思議係因為 佢哋產生好多 呢啲熒光蛋白質、熒光分子 
"(Laughter) And I was like, ""Maybe I should go back to corals."" ",雖然呢啲熒光蛋白質 佔珊瑚蟲體重 14% 但我相信呢啲蛋白質都係有功能嘅 
(Laughter) It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent. ,正如你唔會製造多 14% 肌肉 而又唔用佢咁 
And then we found it. ,過去十至十五年 呢隻分子對我嚟講真係好特別 因為呢啲分子喺生物醫學方面 成為咗一種最革命性嘅工具 佢令我哋更加認識自己 
"In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California, we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, right underneath all the surfers. ",我係點樣研究呢啲分子嘅呢？ 
Here it is. ,我哋係喺夜晚游水 
They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark. ,開始嘅時候 我哋只係用啲藍色濾光膠布 放喺我哋嘅眼罩度 確保我哋睇到嘅藍光 係經動物轉變過嚟 
"And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened, they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, about twice their size, and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator. ",我哋喺自然歷史博物館開咗個展覽 想話畀人知珊瑚礁上嘅 熒光珊瑚蟲有幾犀利 但係有啲嘢令我好煩惱 圈住呢個、喺珊瑚蟲中間 有一條綠色熒光嘅魚 
And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks. ,今次係我哋第一次發現綠色熒光魚 或者第一個有脊椎嘅熒光動物 
"Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent, but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark. ",我哋唔知係自己眼花定係個濾鏡有問題 以為有人故意喺我地嘅相機做手腳 但係呢條鰻係真嘅 
But this is all beautiful to see. ,佢仲係我哋搵到嘅第一條綠色熒光鰻 呢個徹底咁改變咗我嘅研究思路 
"I was like, this is gorgeous. ",我暫時放低珊瑚蟲 同魚類專家 John Sparks 開始全球調查 去睇下魚類熒光嘅現象有幾普遍 
But what does it mean to the shark? ,魚要比珊瑚蟲更加有趣 因為佢哋嘅視力非常之好 當我拍攝嗰陣 有啲魚嘅眼裏面有透鏡放大熒光嘅效果 
Can they see this? ,所以我想響哩個領域研究落去 
"And we looked in the literature, and nothing was known about this shark's vision. ",我哋設計咗一系列新嘅工具 去搵世界各地嘅珊瑚礁嘅熒光生物 
"So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University, and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue-green interface, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark, but they only see blue-green. ",呢個有啲似句對白 「外星人打電話返屋企」 
"So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue, creating green. ",我哋游水嗰陣，開著埋藍色嘅光 睇吓有冇生物吸收咗藍光之後 返射畀我哋 
It's creating contrast that they can indeed see. ,最後我哋搵到呢隻學名 叫 Kaupichphys eel 嘅鰻 
"So we have a model, showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns. ",呢條鰻好怕羞、隱蔽，我哋未曾見過 
"And males and females also have, we're finding, distinct patterns among them. ",佢大概有我隻手指咁長 佢有 99.9% 嘅時間匿埋喺舊石下邊 
"But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now, in the Solomon Islands. ",但佢會喺月圓嘅時候出嚟交配 月光將水底變成藍色 
"Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle. ",或者佢哋就係用呢種方法 拿拿冧搵異性交配 佢哋之後會返返去自己個穴度 等下一次滿月 
"So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles, which, again, this is only one month old, but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision. ",我哋仲揾到其他熒光海洋生物 好似呢種綠色熒光鯿魚 佢嘅頸同頭都有熒光條紋 佢之所以可以僞裝 係因為佢發光嘅強度 同發光珊瑚礁差唔多 
And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn. ,介紹完呢種熒光魚 我哋要介紹呢種紅色熒光鮋 佢將自己隱藏喺石後邊 
"And here in the Solomon Islands, there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left, and this is one of the hotspots for them. ",我哋唯一一次見過佢嗰陣 佢喺紅色熒光藻類 或者紅色熒光珊瑚上面 
"So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here, and understand them. ",跟住我哋揾到隱秘嘅綠色熒光蜥蜴魚 
"In thinking about biofluorescence, I wanted to know, how deep does it go? ",雖然呢種蜥蜴魚可以細分做幾種 但係佢哋喺白光之下好似樣 
Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean? ,如果你用熒光望佢哋 你會見到佢哋身上有好多圖案 而且會發現佢哋之間好唔同 
"So we started using submarines, and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here. ",總計嚟講，我哋舊年搵咗 超過兩百種熒光魚 
"And we dropped down, and we noticed one important thing -- that as we get down to 1,000 meters, it drops off. ",我其中一個靈感來源嚟自法國藝術家 兼生物學家 Jean Painleve 
"There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters -- almost nothing, it's just darkness. ",佢灌注咗呢啲創造嘅精神落生物學度 
So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon. ,佢會自己設計裝置，製作相機 又對 Hippocampus erectus 海馬 情有獨鍾 佢係第一個拍攝海馬生育過程嘅人 
"And below 1,000 meters, we encountered the bioluminescent zone, where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking. ",呢隻係雄性海馬 
"As I try to get deeper, this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit -- some people call this my ""Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen"" moment. ",海馬係最早一批會打棟個身游水嘅魚類 佢哋嘅大腦喺頭部對上 
"(Laughter) But as we explore down here, I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately? ",海馬特別在，雄性負責生育 
"Because we're entering a new age of exploration, where we have to take great care, and we have to set examples how we explore. ",因為 Jean Painleve 幾日都唔瞓覺 
"So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University, and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers, so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there. ",因為佢喺自己嘅頭裝一個 可以電到自己嘅電擊裝置 所以佢成功錄低咗呢個畫面 
"The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military, who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle. ",宜家我想畀 Jean Painleve 睇到 我哋發現嘅熒光海馬 同佢以前研究嘅屬同一品種 
"Some corals could be 1,000 years old. ",呢度係我哋影低嘅片段 
So my dream is something like this. ,（音樂） 熒光海馬係一種最隱秘嘅生物 
"At night, I'm in a submarine, I have force-feedback gloves, and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine, where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars, and we can conduct our research. ",你會響佢地頭頂游過但又發現唔到佢 
Back to the powerful applied applications. ,佢哋會隱藏喺紅色熒光嘅藻類入面 佢哋嘅視力好好 佢哋喺漫長嘅交配過程入邊 或者會用到發光效果 
"Here, you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures, this one from jellyfish and corals, to illuminate the living brain and see its connections. ",我想分享我一個有趣嘅經歷︰ 當我哋喺刺魟魚羣搵到綠色熒光刺魟 因為魟魚屬於板鰓類動物 板鰓類動物仲包括鯊魚 
"It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition, so we can see our brains better. ",所以我好似個珊瑚科學家咁… 
"And even more mind-blowing, is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale, who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage. ",畢竟總要有人落水研究鯊魚係咪熒光 
So he could see when a single neuron fires. ,而我就係呢個人 
You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures. ,（笑聲） 我心諗 ：我應該返去研究珊瑚 
So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship. ,（笑聲） 最終我哋發現鯊魚唔係熒光 
"From deep space, our universe looks like a human brain cell, and then here we are in the deep ocean, and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind. ",跟著我哋發現到一隻生物 
"And it's my hope that with illuminated minds, we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life, and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy. ",喺離加州嘅海岸線 一個好深好黑嘅海底洪溝裏面 我哋第一條搵到熒光頭鮫 就喺全部潛水員嘅下邊 
Thank you. ,就係佢喇 
(Applause) ,佢哋只有一米長 人哋叫佢做膨脹鯊 
,係因為當佢哋受驚嗰陣，佢哋會吸水 然後好似水管一樣發脹 膨脹到佢哋身體體積嘅兩倍 然後攝喺岩石下底，避過獵食者 
We hear about calories all the time. ,呢度係我哋第一次影熒光頭鮫嘅片 
How many calories are in this cookie? ,實在太勁啦 佢哋有獨特嘅圖案 有啲地方熒光，有啲地方無熒光 佢哋身上有好多閃爍嘅點 比佢哋身上其他部分都光好多 
"How many are burned by 100 jumping jacks, or long distance running, or fidgeting? ",呢啲圖案好靚 
"But what is a calorie, really, and how many of them do we actually need? ",靚到令人讚歎 
Calories are a way of keeping track of the body's energy budget. ,但光點對鯊魚有乜嘢特別意義呢？ 
A healthy balance occurs when we put in about as much energy as we lose. ,佢哋可唔可以睇到自己嘅光點呢？ 
"If we consistently put more energy into our bodies than we burn, the excess will gradually be stored as fat in our cells, and we'll gain weight. ",當我哋翻查文獻嗰時 發現無記載到鯊魚嘅視力 
"If we burn off more energy than we replenish, we'll lose weight. ",所以我將鯊魚帶到康奈爾大學 眼科專家 Ellis Loew 嗰度 我哋發現鯊魚視力 對於藍色同綠色好敏銳 比人喺黑暗裏面對呢兩隻顏色 仲好一百倍左右 但係佢哋只係睇到藍色同綠色 
"So we have to be able to measure the energy we consume and use, and we do so with a unit called the calorie. ",呢啲頭鮫要做嘅就係 響呢個藍色嘅世界 吸收藍光，發出綠光 
"One calorie, the kind we measure in food, also called a large calorie, is defined as the amount of energy it would take to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. ",造成對比，令佢哋可以睇到嘢 
"Everything we consume has a calorie count, a measure of how much energy the item stores in its chemical bonds. ",所以我哋有呢個模型 證明熒光物令鯊魚可以睇到 所有以上嘅圖案 
"The average pizza slice has 272 calories, there are about 78 in a piece of bread, and an apple has about 52. ",我哋仲發現雄性同雌性嘅 圖案係唔一樣嘅 
"That energy is released during digestion, and stored in other molecules that can be broken down to provide energy when the body needs it. ",我哋最後一次發現係 喺距離我哋當時幾公里嘅所羅門群島 
"It's used in three ways: about 10% enables digestion, about 20% fuels physical activity, and the biggest chunk, around 70%, supports the basic functions of our organs and tissues. ",我遊夜水嗰時，發現第一隻熒光海龜 
"That third usage corresponds to your basal metabolic rate, a number of calories you would need to survive if you weren't eating or moving around. ",所以話，由魚類，到鯊魚，再到爬行類 都有熒光動物嘅蹤影 呢隻海龜只有一個月大 但其實反映緊 我哋對鷹嘴海龜視力嘅一無所知 
"Add in some physical activity and digestion, and you arrive at the official guidelines for how many calories the average person requires each day: 2000 for women and 2500 for men. ",隻海龜令我知道咩叫「學海無涯」 
"Those estimates are based on factors like average weight, physical activity and muscle mass. ",喺所羅門群島呢度 呢種雌性海龜只剩低幾千隻 呢度係其中一個佢地聚集嘅熱門地點 
So does that mean everyone should shoot for around 2000 calories? ,我哋真係好需要保護同埋認識佢哋 
Not necessarily. ,喺研究生物熒光性嗰陣 我想知道，佢哋會游到海底幾深？ 
"If you're doing an energy guzzling activity, like cycling the Tour de France, your body could use up to 9000 calories per day. ",佢哋係咪一直游到海底呢？ 
"Pregnancy requires slightly more calories than usual, and elderly people typically have a slower metabolic rate, energy is burned more gradually, so less is needed. ",所以我哋開始用潛水艇 仲喺前面裝咗藍色嘅燈 
Here's something else you should know before you start counting calories. ,當我哋下潛，我哋注意到一件重要嘅嘢 當去到海底一公里嗰陣 我哋見唔到熒光生物 
"The calorie counts on nutrition labels measure how much energy the food contains, not how much energy you can actually get out of it. ",一公里以下係無螢光生物 差不多乜嘢都無，剩係潻黑一片 
"Fibrous foods like celery and whole wheat take more energy to digest, so you'd actually wind up with less energy from a 100 calorie serving of celery than a 100 calorie serving of potato chips. ",所以熒光生物嘅現象 主要喺淺層海洋發生 
"Not to mention the fact that some foods offer nutrients like protein and vitamins, while others provide far less nutritional value. ",喺一公里以下，我哋發現生物發光區 九成嘅動物都會發光，同埋喺度閃爍 
Eating too many of those foods could leave you overweight and malnourished. ,我嘗試去更深嘅地方 呢個係單人潛水器 有啲人話呢個係潛水家庫斯托 . 賈可 同喜劇家活地艾倫相會嘅一刻 
"And even with the exact same food, different people might not get the same number of calories. ",（笑聲） 當我哋繼續深潛 我諗緊點樣小心接觸生物 
"Variations in things like enzyme levels, gut bacteria, and even intestine length, means that every individual's ability to extract energy from food is a little different. ",因為我哋進入探索新時代 我哋要特別小心謹慎 我哋要做好探險嘅榜樣 
"So a calorie is a useful energy measure, but to work out exactly how many of them each of us requires we need to factor in things like exercise, food type, and our body's ability to process energy. ",所以我同哈佛大學嘅機器人專家 Rob Wood 一齊 喺度設計軟熟嘅水底機械手 令我哋可以小心就住咁接觸動物 
Good luck finding all of that on a nutrition label. ,大多數探索深海嘅技術 都嚟自油公司同軍隊 但佢哋都唔會在意 啲設備對動物係咪溫柔 
,你唔想用鏟撞埋上千年嘅珊瑚度 
"This may look like a neatly arranged stack of numbers, but it's actually a mathematical treasure trove. ",我嘅夢想係好似咁樣︰ 
Indian mathematicians called it the Staircase of Mount Meru. ,深夜我喺潛艇裡邊 我有一對力傳感手套 我可以喺潛水艇前邊劃出一個實驗室 柔軟嘅機械手指就喺嗰度 將樣本放入罐裡邊，用嚟做研究 
"In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle. ",再嚟睇睇呢啲犀利嘅應用技術 
"And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle. ",你而家睇到嘅係一個活生生嘅大腦 利用熒光海洋生物嘅 DNA ——呢度用咗水母同珊瑚蟲嘅 DNA 去照亮大腦，睇到裏邊嘅神經連接 
"To much of the Western world, it's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair since he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute. ",有趣嘅係，我哋用紅綠藍三原色 去滿足人類對顏色嘅觀感 令我哋可以更清䠂睇到我哋嘅大腦 
So what is it about this that has so intrigued mathematicians the world over? ,更加震撼嘅係 我同事 Vincent Pieribone 喺耶魯大學 設計咗一種對電壓有反應嘅熒光蛋白 
"In short, it's full of patterns and secrets. ",所以佢可以透過蛋白 睇到神經元發出信息 
"First and foremost, there's the pattern that generates it. ",成件事就等如 你用海洋生物創造出嚟嘅嘢 去睇人類嘅意識 
Start with one and imagine invisible zeros on either side of it. ,呢樣嘢帶返我去一啲觀念同關係嘅學問 
"Add them together in pairs, and you'll generate the next row. ",喺宇宙深處 我哋嘅太空好似一個腦細胞 宜家我哋身處深海當中 探索緊可以透視人類思想嘅 海底生物同細胞 
"Now, do that again and again. ",我一直有個願望︰透過發光嘅大腦 我哋可以了解生命點樣有關連 同埋喺保持海洋健康嘅前提下 探索仲有幾多生物隱藏咗 
"Keep going and you'll wind up with something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle goes on infinitely. ",多謝 
"Now, each row corresponds to what's called the coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero. ",（掌聲） 
"So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2). ",
"The coefficients, or numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row of Pascal's Triangle. ",我哋成日聽到「卡路里」 
"You'll see the same thing with n=3, which expands to this. ",一塊餅乾有幾多卡路里？ 
So the triangle is a quick and easy way to look up all of these coefficients. ,100 次「星星跳」可以消耗 幾多卡路里？ 長跑又消耗幾多呢？ 咁細嘅動作呢？ 
But there's much more. ,但係卡路里到底係咩意思？ 仲有我哋需要幾多卡路里？ 
"For example, add up the numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. ",卡路里其實係我哋掌握 身體嘅能量攝取同消耗嘅一個工具 
"Or in a given row, treat each number as part of a decimal expansion. ",如果能量嘅攝取同消耗可以一樣 係最健康嘅狀態 
"In other words, row two is (1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100). ",如果我地攝取嘅能量多過身體所需 過量嘅部分就會被轉化成脂肪 儲存喺細胞裏面 然後我哋體重就會增加 
"You get 121, which is 11^2. ",相反，如果消耗嘅能量超過攝取量 我哋體重下降 
And take a look at what happens when you do the same thing to row six. ,所以我哋需要計算到我哋 身體嘅能量攝取同消耗 於是我哋就用卡路里呢個單位去計 
"It adds up to 1,771,561, which is 11^6, and so on. ",我哋所量度食物當中嘅 1 卡路里 亦可以叫做 1 大卡路里 佢嘅定義係 1 公斤嘅水 溫度升高攝氏 1 度嘅時候 所需要吸收嘅熱量 
There are also geometric applications. ,每一種食物都有一個卡路里數值 用黎計食物入邊嘅化學鍵嘅能量 
Look at the diagonals. ,一件普通披薩有 272 卡 一塊麵包大概有 78 卡 一個蘋果就大約 52 卡 
"The first two aren't very interesting: all ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers. ",呢啲能量喺消化過程當中會被釋放出黎 然後儲存喺其他分子當中 呢啲分子可以降解 為身體需要嘅地方提供能量 
"But the numbers in the next diagonal are called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them into equilateral triangles. ",呢啲能量會喺三個情況下使用 大概 10% 會用喺消化過程當中 20% 用喺身體活動度 最大嘅 70% 左右 用黎支持器官同組織嘅基本運作 
"The next diagonal has the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack that many spheres into tetrahedra. ",第三個用途其實就係 同我哋身體嘅基礎代謝率有關 當你唔吃飯唔郁嘅時候都好 你都需要一啲卡路里去維持生命 
Or how about this: shade in all of the odd numbers. ,如果加埋消化同身體活動 你就會到達指引裏邊嘅數值 就係一個人一日需要幾多卡路里 女性 2000 卡，男性 2500 卡 
"It doesn't look like much when the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal known as Sierpinski's Triangle. ",呢啲估算係基於一啲因素 好似平均體重、運動量同肌肉水平 
This triangle isn't just a mathematical work of art. ,咁係咪每個人嘅目標都係 2000 卡？ 
"It's also quite useful, especially when it comes to probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics. ",其實唔一定 
"Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family of three girls and two boys. ",如果你做一次劇烈嘅體能活動 譬如話環法單車賽 你身體每日就會消耗最多 9000 卡 
"In the binomial expansion, that corresponds to girl plus boy to the fifth power. ",比起未懷孕個陣 孕婦需要多少少嘅卡路里 而老年人身體代謝率通常比較慢 能量會消耗得比較慢 所以身體需要較少嘅卡路里 
"So we look at the row five, where the first number corresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. ",以下亦都係一啲你開始計卡路里之前 需要知道嘅嘢 
The third number is what we're looking for. ,食物標籤上面標註嘅卡路里數值 係指食物中含有嘅熱量總數 唔等於你可以從中攝取嘅熱量 
Ten out of the sum of all the possibilities in the row. ,芹菜同埋全麥食品呢類纖維食物 消化嘅時候需要更多嘅能量 所以如果芹菜同埋薯片都含有 100 卡 食完芹菜之後會比食薯片獲得更少熱量 
"so 10/32, or 31.25%. ",唔單止噉 當一啲食物提供咗蛋白質、維他命 其他就提供唔到咁多嘅營養 
"Or, if you're randomly picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups of five are there? ",如果食太多低營養嘅食物 有可能導致體重超標或者營養不良 
"In combinatoric terms, this problem would be phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer. ",就算係兩份完全相同嘅食物 唔同嘅人食落去都會獲得唔同嘅熱量 
The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly interwoven fabric of mathematics. ,因為人體內消化酵素嘅數目 腸道細菌 甚至係腸嘅長短 都會影響人喺食物中 攝取卡路里嘅能力 
And it's still revealing fresh secrets to this day. ,所以，就算卡路里係有效量度熱量 但係要計每個人具體需要幾多卡 我哋需要同時考慮唔同因素 好似運動量 食物種類 同埋我哋身體消化吸收嘅能力 
"For example, mathematicians recently discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials. ",祝你哋以後搵食物標纖嗰陣好運 
What might we find next? ,
"Well, that's up to you. ",呢啲睇落可能只係一堆排列整齊既數字 但事實上佢係數學嘅寶藏 
,印度數學家稱為「梅魯火山之梯」 
"All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food? ",喺伊朗，佢係「海亞姆三角」 
(Laughter) And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them? ,而喺中國，佢係「楊輝三角」 
"(Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in ""My Fair Lady"": Stick to the weather and your health. ",喺大部份嘅西方國家 佢係「帕斯卡三角」 以法國數學家布萊茲 ‧ 帕斯卡嚟命名 咁嘅名命睇落有啲唔公平 因為帕斯卡係後期嘅人 去研究呢款三角形 但佢嘅貢獻都唔少 
"But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- (Laughter) are not safe either. ",咁到底係咩 令到世界嘅數學家都咁著迷呢？ 
"So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal. ",簡單啲嚟講 係因為佢充滿咗唔同嘅規律同秘密 
"Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. ",首先講下畫呢個三角形嘅方法 
"We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other. ",由 1 開始 想像兩邊各有一個見唔到嘅 0 
"And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. ",將佢哋兩個兩個咁相加 你就會得到下一行 
"Again, that means we're not listening to each other. ",重覆咁做 繼續做，你就會得到呢個三角形 
"A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance. ",但其實，帕斯卡三角係無限延伸 
"Now, part of that is due to technology. ",而家，每一行嘅數字 就係喺二項式 (x+y)^n 展開嘅系數 而 n 就係行數 由 0 開始數 
The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. ,如果 n=2 ，你代入佢 你會得到 x^2 + 2xy + y^2 
"According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. ",系數，即係變數前嘅數字 同帕斯卡三角嗰行嘅數字一樣 
"And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. ",當 n=3 展開之後，你會見到相同嘅情況 
There's this great piece in The Atlantic. ,所以呢個三角形係一個 快捷而且簡單嘅方法去搵呢啲系數 
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. ,不過，秘密仲有好多 
And he gave his kids a communication project. ,例如，將同一行嘅數字加起嚟 你會得到 2 嘅 n 次方 
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. ,或者喺指定嘅一行 當每個數字都係十進制展開嘅一部份 
"And he said this: ""I came to realize..."" ",即係話 第三行係 (1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100) 
"(Laughter) ""I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. ",等於 121，即係 11^2 
"Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills. ",睇下如果喺第六行做相同嘅嘢會點？ 
"It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"" ","一共係 1,771,561，亦即係 11^6 "
"Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. ",之後嘅都係咁 呢三角形仲有唔同嘅幾何應用 
I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like. ,睇下啲對角線 
I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. ,第一同第二條對角線並唔係好有趣 全部都係 1 ，同埋正整數 亦即係自然數 
But I still have a great conversation with them. ,而喺下一條對角數嘅數字 我哋稱為三角數 因為當你將咁多點排列 你可以排出一個等邊三角形 
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. ,喺跟住落嚟嘅對角線上嘅係三角錐體數 同樣，你可以將呢啲數目砌成三角錐體 
"Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. ",或者咁，遮住所有單數 
So I want you to forget all of that. ,當個三角形仲細嘅時候 你睇唔出係啲咩 但當你加上成千上萬咁多行之後 你就會得到一個碎形 亦即係謝爾賓斯三角形 
It is crap. ,呢個三角形唔單只係數學嘅藝術 
(Laughter) There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. ,佢都幾有用 特別係計概率同埋組合數學 
"(Laughter) (Applause) Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. ",例如你想要 5 個小朋友 而且想知道 有 3 個女仔同 2 個男仔 呢個理想家庭嘅概率 
"So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. ",喺二項式入面 呢個即係女仔加男仔嘅 5 次方 
"Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody. ",咁我哋睇下第五行 第一個數字代表 5 個女仔 而最尾嗰個代表 5 個男仔 
We've all had really great conversations. ,第三個數字就係我哋搵緊嗰個 
We've had them before. We know what it's like. ,呢一行所有可能嘅總和分之 10 
"The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. ",即係 10/32 ，或者 31.25% 
There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that. ,或者，你隨機喺 12 個朋友入面 揀出一隊 5 人籃球隊 可以有幾多種組合呢？ 
"So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations. ",喺組合數學嚟講 呢個問題可以睇成 12 揀 5 而且可以用呢條式去計 或者你可以喺呢個三角形入面 搵第十二行第六個數字，就會得到答案 
Number one: Don't multitask. ,帕斯卡三角形嘅規律 展現數學優雅交織嘅一面 
And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. ,我哋至今仍然繼續發現佢新嘅秘密 
"I mean, be present. ",例如 數學家最近發現咗 展開呢種多項式嘅方法 
Be in that moment. ,跟住落嚟我哋會發現啲咩？ 
Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. ,咁就睇你啦 
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. ,
"If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it. ",有幾多人曾經因為好友 喺政治、宗教育兒、糧食議題上 講咗冒犯嘅嘢而喺臉書刪除佢哋？ 請舉手 
Number two: Don't pontificate. ,（笑聲） 有幾多人有最少一位朋友 因為你唔想同佢傾偈而逃避架？ 
"If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog. ",（笑聲） 我哋以前如果想有禮貌咁傾計 我哋就會聽《窈窕淑女》入面 亨利希金斯嘅話 只講天氣同健康 
"(Laughter) Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. ",但宜家因為氣候轉變、反疫苗嘅討論 （笑聲） 天氣同健康嘅話題都唔再安全嘞 
"If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. ",我哋身處嘅呢個世界係唔正常 任何傾偈都有可能演變成爭執 而政客，會無法同其他政客溝通 連最微不足道嘅事 都有人激烈地支持同反對 
"If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. ",皮尤研究中心研究咗一萬名美國成人 發現今時今日嘅人 係歷史上最極端、最分化嘅人 
Totally predictable. ,我哋唔再輕易妥協 即係話我哋唔再聆聽對方 
And you don't want to be like that. ,我哋選擇居所、伴侶，甚至朋友時 只係按個人已有嘅信念 
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. ,即係話我哋唔再聆聽對方 
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. ,雖然傾偈需要平衡講同聽 但逐漸地，我哋失去咗呢種平衝 
And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. ,當中部分原因係因為科技 
"He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. ",因為你手上面或者 擺喺附近嘅智能電話 
"Again, assume that you have something to learn. ",根據皮尤研究 三分一美國青年每日傳過百則短訊 
"Bill Nye: ""Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."" ",當中大多數，幾乎全部，寧願傳短訊 都唔同朋友面對面傾偈 
I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something. ,《大西洋月刊》曾經有篇佳作 
Number three: Use open-ended questions. ,作者係一名高中老師叫保羅班韋 
"In this case, take a cue from journalists. ",佢畀佢小朋友做一份溝通習作 
"Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how. ",教佢哋點樣唔靠筆記去傾特定話題 
"If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out. ",佢話：「我發現…」 
"If I ask you, ""Were you terrified?"" ",（笑聲） 「我發現說話能力 可能係教育裡面最常被忽視嘅技能。 
"you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is ""terrified,"" and the answer is ""Yes, I was"" or ""No, I wasn't."" ",小朋友每日花幾個鐘透過螢幕 獲取意念同交換想法， 但鮮有機會磨練人際溝通能力。 
"Were you angry? ""Yes, I was very angry."" ",我哋要問自己一條睇落好笑嘅問題︰ 廿一世紀到底有無一種技能 比起說話有條理、有自信更緊要？」 
Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. ,我宜家靠同人傾偈搵食 客人有諾貝爾獎得主、貨車司機 億萬富豪、幼兒園老師 國家元首、水管工人 
"Try asking them things like, ""What was that like?"" ",鍾意嘅同唔鍾意嘅人我都會同佢哋傾 
"Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response. ",我同一啲我個人嚟講 好唔認同嘅人傾偈 
Number four: Go with the flow. ,但我哋之間嘅對話始終好開心 
That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. ,我想用接著落嚟十分鐘 教你哋說話同聆聽 
"We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered. ",你哋好多人都聽過唔少建議 例如保持眼神交流 預先諗好有趣嘅話題去講 用眼神、點頭同微笑 表示你係留心對話嘅 以及講返或者總結你啱啱聽到嘅 
"That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that. ",但我想你哋通通忘記呢啲建議 
And we do the exact same thing. ,呢啲建議太垃圾喇 
"We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. ",（笑聲） 如果你真係有留心聽人哋講嘢 根本唔洗學點樣表現你專心 
(Laughter) And we stop listening. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 我平時用嘅技巧 同我做專業面試官時嘅一樣 
Stories and ideas are going to come to you. ,所以我會教你哋點樣訪問人 令你哋交談裏面更善辭令 
You need to let them come and let them go. ,首先要學識唔好畀對話 浪費你嘅時間同令你覺得悶 更重要係唔好冒犯到人 
"Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know. ",我哋都試過傾得好暢快 
"Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. ",即係話我哋知道好嘅交談係點嘅樣 
Do that. Err on the side of caution. ,就好似你傾完之後覺得 真係有參與到討論同獲得啓發 又或者傾完之後你覺得同人關係密切 或者人哋完全明白你 
Talk should not be cheap. ,大部分嘅交談都唔應該有原因 做唔到上面嘅嘢 
Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs. ,所以我定咗十項基本規則 我會同你哋講解下 但講真，只要熟練其中一項 你就已經可以傾得更加好 
"If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. ",第一：唔好同時做多過一樣嘢 
"If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job. ",我意思係唔止放低電話 平板、車匙或者手頭上嘅嘢 
All experiences are individual. ,我指嘅係，你嘅靈魂要喺度 
"And, more importantly, it is not about you. ",要留心嗰陣時嘅嘢 
You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. ,唔好諗之前同上司嘅爭執 
"Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, ""I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."" ",唔好諗今晚食乜 
(Laughter) Conversations are not a promotional opportunity. ,如果唔想同人傾偈，不如就唔傾好過 唔好勉強撐落去，又心不在焉咁 
Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. ,第二：唔好霸住嚟講 
"It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. ",如果你只抒己見 又唔回應、拗、反駁或引伸 咁去寫網誌啦 
"Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. ",（笑聲） 我之所以唔邀請學者上節目 有一個好好嘅理由 就係佢哋太無聊喇 
Don't do that. ,如果係保守派 佢哋一定憎奧巴馬、糧票同墮胎 
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. ,如果係自由派 就一定憎大銀行、油公司同迪克切尼 
"Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. ",完全估計得到 
They don't care. What they care about is you. ,但你唔想傾偈變成咁樣 
"They care about what you're like, what you have in common. ",每次傾偈，你都要當你會學到啲嘢 
So forget the details. Leave them out. ,知名精神科醫生派克話 真正嘅聆聽需要放下自己 
"Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one. ",所以要放下己見 
Listen. ,佢話，說話者認同呢段說話嘅話 內心就會愈嚟愈堅強 愈係會對聽者開放內心嘅深處 
"I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop. ",同樣地，假設你會從傾偈裏面學到嘢 
"Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, ""If your mouth is open, you're not learning."" ",比爾奈話：你遇到嘅每一個人 都識一啲你唔識得嘅嘢 
"And Calvin Coolidge said, ""No man ever listened his way out of a job."" ",對於呢番話，我會演譯為︰ 每個人都係某方面嘅專家 
(Laughter) Why do we not listen to each other? ,第三：善用開放式問題 
"Number one, we'd rather talk. ",呢方面可以學學記者 
"When I'm talking, I'm in control. ",以「何時、何地、何人 何物、為何、如何」開始發問 
I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in. ,如果你問複雜嘅問題 你只會得到簡單嘅答案 
I'm the center of attention. ,如果我問你：你當時驚唔驚？ 
I can bolster my own identity. ,你會按句子最有力嘅字眼去答 即係「驚」呢個字 所以答案會係「係」或「唔係」 
But there's another reason: We get distracted. ,－你嬲唔嬲？ －係，好嬲 
"The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute. ",由佢哋描述，佢哋先係體會嘅一方 
So our minds are filling in those other 275 words. ,嘗試問：當時係點㗎？有咩感覺？ 
"And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation. ",因為佢哋或者會停低思考 所以你就會有機會得到更有趣嘅答案 
You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place. ,第四：順其自然 
(Laughter) You have to listen to one another. ,意思係有一啲諗法突然間會有 但你需要忘記啲諗法 
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. ,因為我哋都有睇過一啲訪問 啲嘉賓講咗幾分鐘嘢 然之後主持問返問題 但啲問題可能無關或者已經討論過 
"He said, ""Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. ",咁就反映咗主持頭先嗰兩分鐘無聽到 主持以為條問題好聰明，佢一定要問到 
"We listen with the intent to reply."" ",但其實我哋同個主持都一樣 
"One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief. ",當我哋坐低同人傾偈時 我哋竟然會諗返嗰日 喺咖啡室撞到明星 Hugh Jackman 
"[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister] (Laughter) (Applause) All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people. ",（笑聲） 於是我哋就無再聽 
"You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home. ",事情同想法必然會喺你腦海閃過 
"People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, ""Do you know who that was? ",但你要學識唔好分心諗咗去其他嘢度 
She was the runner-up to Miss America. ,第五：唔識就話唔識 
He was the mayor of Sacramento. ,電台，尤其是公共廣播電台上嘅人 佢哋清楚知道自己係開梗咪 所以佢哋好小心喺咩事情上 稱自己做專家 同埋好小心咁講佢哋肯定知道嘅嘢 
"She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer."" ",你都應該咁，小心駛得萬年船 
"And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. ",而且一言千金 
"And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host. ",第六：唔好騎劫人哋嘅經歷 
"I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. ",例如人哋講梗親人過身 你就唔好講你親戚去世個陣嘅嘢 
You do the same thing. ,當人哋講梗工作窘境 就唔好反過嚟抱怨自己份工 你同人哋嘅經歷唔同，從來都唔會一樣 
"Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed. ",經歷係好個人嘅 
Thanks. ,而且人哋嘅經歷唔屬於你 
(Applause) ,唔好喺人哋分享梗嗰陣 同人講自己有幾勁幾慘 
,有人問霍金佢智商幾高 佢話：「唔知。 自誇智商嘅都係傻瓜。」 
"In 1956, during a diplomatic reception in Moscow, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev told Western Bloc ambassadors, ""My vas pokhoronim!"" ",（笑聲） 傾偈唔係攞嚟推廣自己 
"His interpreter rendered that into English as, ""We will bury you!"" ",第七：唔好重複說話 
"This statement sent shockwaves through the Western world, heightening the tension between the Soviet Union and the US who were in the thick of the Cold War. ",咁樣畀人感覺高傲又乏味 但我哋偏偏成日都咁做 
Some believe this incident alone set East/West relations back a decade. ,尤其同同事、小朋友講嘢個陣 我哋為咗表明諗法，不斷講同一番說話 
"As it turns out, Khrushchev's remark was translated a bit too literally. ",唔好咁樣做 
"Given the context, his words should have been rendered as, ""We will live to see you buried,"" meaning that Communism would outlast Capitalism, a less threatening comment. ",第八：唔需要講細節 
"Though the intended meaning was eventually clarified, the initial impact of Khrushchev's apparent words put the world on a path that could have led to nuclear armageddon. ",講真，人哋根本唔在意 年份、名、日期等嘅細節 就算你就好努力去記都好 
"So now, given the complexities of language and cultural exchange, how does this sort of thing not happen all the time? ",人哋都唔在意，佢哋關心嘅係你 
Much of the answer lies with the skill and training of interpreters to overcome language barriers. ,想知你係點樣嘅人 同你有咩共同之處 
"For most of history, interpretation was mainly done consecutively, with speakers and interpreters making pauses to allow each other to speak. ",忘記啲瑣碎細節啦 傾偈嗰陣唔好講細節 
"But after the advent of radio technology, a new simultaneous interpretations system was developed in the wake of World War II. ",第九： 呢點雖然唔係壓軸 但係係最關鍵嘅一項 
In the simultaneous mode interpreters instantaneously translate a speaker's words into a microphone while he speaks. ,聆聽 
"Without pauses, those in the audience can choose the language in which they want to follow. ",我數唔清有幾多重要人物曾經講過 聆聽係最重要嘅技能 仲係可以培養嘅技能 
"On the surface, it all looks seamless, but behind the scenes, human interpreters work incessantly to ensure every idea gets across as intended. ",佛陀話過，我喺度引述返︰ 「開口時非學習時」 
And that is no easy task. ,前美國總統卡爾文話： 無人會因為多聽而失業 
It takes about two years of training for already fluent bilingual professionals to expand their vocabulary and master the skills necessary to become a conference interpreter. ,（笑聲） 點解我哋唔聆聽人哋？ 
"To get used to the unnatural task of speaking while they listen, students shadow speakers and repeat their every word exactly as heard in the same language. ",第一，我哋寧願講嘢 
"In time, they begin to paraphrase what is said, making stylistic adjustments as they go. ",當我講梗嘢，我就控制個局 
"At some point, a second language is introduced. ",我唔洗聽冇興趣嘅嘢 
"Practicing in this way creates new neural pathways in the interpreter's brain, and the constant effort of reformulation gradually becomes second nature. ",我就係大家目光嘅焦點 
"Over time and through much hard work, the interpreter masters a vast array of tricks to keep up with speed, deal with challenging terminology, and handle a multitude of foreign accents. ",我可以藉著講嘢嚟強化自己身份 
"They may resort to acronyms to shorten long names, choose generic terms over specific, or refer to slides and other visual aides. ",仲有一個原因：我哋會分心 
"They can even leave a term in the original language, while they search for the most accurate equivalent. ",常人每分鐘講到大概 225 個字 但每分鐘就聽到最多 500 字 
Interpreters are also skilled at keeping aplomb in the face of chaos. ,於是我哋個腦喺人哋講嘢嗰陣 就用剩低 275 字諗其他嘢 
"Remember, they have no control over who is going to say what, or how articulate the speaker will sound. ",我知道要認真聽人哋講嘢 係要花費精神同心機 但如果無留心就唔係傾緊偈 
A curveball can be thrown at any time. ,因為你哋只係喺同一笪地方 對喊梗冇乜相關嘅嘢 
"Also, they often perform to thousands of people and in very intimidating settings, like the UN General Assembly. ",（笑聲） 你要聆聽人哋 
"To keep their emotions in check, they carefully prepare for an assignment, building glossaries in advance, reading voraciously about the subject matter, and reviewing previous talks on the topic. ",史蒂芬 · 柯維講得好好 
"Finally, interpreters work in pairs. ",佢話：大多數人聆聽唔係因為想理解 
"While one colleague is busy translating incoming speeches in real time, the other gives support by locating documents, looking up words, and tracking down pertinent information. ",而係想回應 
"Because simultaneous interpretation requires intense concentration, every 30 minutes, the pair switches roles. ",最後，第十：簡短 
Success is heavily dependent on skillful collaboration. ,<i>「好嘅交談就好似迷你裙咁，</i> <i>短到可以引人入勝，</i> <i>但亦都長到覆蓋到重點。」 呢句係我家姐講嘅</i> （笑聲） （掌聲） 以上所有都可以濃縮成一個基本概念︰ 你要展示你係有興趣聆聽 
"Language is complex, and when abstract or nuanced concepts get lost in translation, the consequences may be catastrophic. ",我公公好出名，我嘅成長少唔去公公 屋企有個習俗 
"As Margaret Atwood famously noted, ""War is what happens when language fails."" ",人哋會走嚟同我公公婆婆傾偈 佢哋走咗之後，我阿媽走過嚟問我哋︰ 「知唔知佢哋係邊個？ 
Conference interpreters of all people are aware of that and work diligently behind the scenes to make sure it never does. ,呢個係美國選美亞軍。 
,嗰個係沙加緬度市長。 
I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata. ,呢嗰個贏過普立茲獎。 而呢個係俄羅斯巷蕾舞者。」 
It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale. ,所以我成長裏邊一直覺得 每人都隱藏住好犀利嘅特質 
And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff. ,講真，咁樣至令我成為更優秀主持 
And he buys a piece of art that I made. ,我盡量唔講嘢，用開放態度睇事情 同埋成日準備受驚喜嘅心 而我係從未失望過 
"And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps. ",你跟住我做，出去同人傾偈，聆聽佢哋 
So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world. ,最重要係要有被驚喜嘅準備 
"Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired. ",多謝 
"As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, ""So where are you staying tonight?"" ",（掌聲） 
"And he makes it worse by saying, ""Actually, I don't have a place."" ",
"And I'm thinking, ""Oh, man!"" ",喺 1956 年莫斯科嘅一個外交接待上 蘇聯領袖赫魯曉夫 對西方集團嘅大使講︰ 「Мы вас похороним!」 
"We've all been there, right? ",佢嘅傳譯員咁樣翻譯成英文︰ 「我哋會將你哋埋葬！」 
Do I offer to host this guy? ,呢句話喺西方世界引起軒然大波 而且當時蘇聯同美國處於冷戰狀態 呢句說話加劇咗兩國嘅緊張局勢 
"But, I just met him -- I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata. ",有人相信單係呢次翻譯錯誤 令東、西方關係倒退咗十年 
"So then I hear myself saying, ""Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."" ",之後，赫魯曉夫嘅傳譯 被指太過照字面翻譯 
"And the voice in my head goes, ""Wait, what?"" ",按照內容，佢嘅說話應該翻譯成 溫和啲嘅講法︰ 「我哋會親眼睇住你哋被埋葬」 意思係共產主義會比資本主資更長久 
"That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, ""Oh my god, what have I done? ",雖然最後原本嘅意思釐清返 但係赫魯曉夫傳譯員嘅錯誤 就足以引發核戰 
There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room. ,既然語言同文化交流係咁複雜 點解錯譯唔咪成日發生呢？ 
"What if he's psychotic?"" ",答案就係靠傳譯員嘅技巧同訓練去避免 
"My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door. ",以往傳譯嗰陣，講者同傳譯員 會輪流停低畀對方講 令到傳譯斷斷續續咁進行 
It turns out he was not psychotic. ,但係第二次世界大戰之後 無線電科技進步嘞 發明咗新嘅即時傳譯系統 
We've kept in touch ever since. ,喺即時傳譯入面 傳譯員會喺演講者講嘢同時 透過一支咪即時翻譯 
And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now. ,觀眾可以揀咩語言嚟聽 
"This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective. ",聽起上嚟，成件事好完美咁 但係喺背後，傳譯員不停工作 確保每一個意思都準確傳譯 
Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered. ,但呢項工作並唔容易 
"The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me. ",就算本身流利講兩種語言嘅人 都需要接受訓練兩年 去豐富詞彚同精通需要嘅技巧 然後至可以做會議傳譯員 
So now it's two years later. ,而且，為咗習慣邊講邊聽 學生會用同一種語言 重複講者講過嘅每一隻字 
"I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up. ",之後，佢哋會用第二啲句子 去複述返同一句嘢 兼且會改埋原本講者嘅說話風格 
"And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out. ",到一個位，佢哋就會開始 用第二種語言講同一句說話 
And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity. ,咁樣嘅練習令傳譯員個腦 發展出一條新嘅神經路徑 同時，複述做得多會變成一種本能 
"So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: ""Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning. ",所以經過一段時間嘅努力之後 傳譯員會掌握到大量嘅技巧 而務求保持傳譯速度、處理艱難嘅術語 同埋應付不同嘅外國口音 
We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born. ,傳譯員可能只取 頭一個字母去代替長嘅名 選擇通用而非專業嘅用語 或者參考投影片同其他視覺輔助工具 
Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor. ,喺佢哋搵緊最準確嘅翻譯之前 佢哋甚至可以用返原本個字 
"But they loved it, and so did we. ",傳譯員亦都訓練到識得 喺混亂中沉著應戰 
"I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests. ",記住，佢哋控制唔到邊個講啲咩 控制唔到講者會點樣發音 
"We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other. ",變幻隨時都會出現 
Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent? ,傳譯員通常喺幾千人面前翻譯 而且環境好嚇人 譬如話聯合國大會咁 
The wheels had started to turn. ,傳譯員為咗情緒要保持平靜 佢哋會喺工作之前做好準備 例如準備詞彙表 讀大量嘅相關資料 同埋回顧之前相同題材嘅演講 
"My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder. ",最後，傳譯員要一對咁工作 
And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business. ,當一個同事忙於即時傳譯 另一個就要做支援 負責搵文件、查字、搵相關資料 
"Here's what we pitched investors: ""We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over. ",因為即時傳譯要高度集中 所以每三十分鐘就會互換角色 
"And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes. ",成功好靠熟練嘅合作 
"It's going to be huge!"" ",語言係複雜嘅 當抽象或微妙嘅概念冇被翻譯 後果可以係好嚴重嘅 
"(Laughter) We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off. ",就好似 Margaret Atwood 嘅一句名言 「戰爭就喺語言失效嘅時候發生」 
It did not. ,會議傳譯員都意識到呢個道理 所以佢哋喺背後都好努力工作 確保呢種事唔會發生 
No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes. ,
Why? ,我想同大家講 我差點被綁架喺 馬自達 Miata 嘅車尾箱嘅故事 
"Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger. ",嗰陣我喺設計學院畢業之後第一日 我正喺後院拍賣 
"Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design. ",呢個時候有個男人渣住架 紅色 Mazda，停咗喺度 喺度摷我嘅拍賣品 
"In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience. ",佢買咗我做嘅一件作品 
"We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met. ",原來佢要返去和平護衛隊 但自己一個穿州過省 仲要留喺個鎮過夜 
Could design make that happen? ,所以我請佢一齊飲酒 佢同我講佢想令世界唔一樣 
Is it possible to design for trust? ,呢個時候開始夜啦 我都好累啦 
I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve. ,當我示意埋單時 我唔小心問佢 「你今晚住邊呀？」 
I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone. ,但情況更加壞，因為佢話 「其實，我冇地方瞓。」 
"If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up. ",我就心諗， 「吓！唔係掛！你做咩架？」 
"OK, I need you to take out your phones. ",我哋都經歷過呢類情型，係嗎？ 
"Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone. ",我應唔應該招待呢個男人？ 
Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left. ,但係，我至係啱啱識佢 但佢話佢要返去和平護衛隊 但係我唔知佢係咪 真係返去和平護衛隊 我又唔想被綁架喺車尾箱 仲要係一個細嘅車尾箱！ 
(Laughter) That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now -- (Laughter) is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home. ,然後，我聽到自己講 「喂，我有一個充氣床， 你可以喺我客廳瞓。」 
Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home. ,跟住，我腦入邊有把聲講 「等陣，你講咩哇？」 
"People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet. ",嗰晚，我瞓喺床上望住天花喺度諗 「天呀，我做咗乜嘢？ 
"Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone? ",客廳瞓咗個完全唔識嘅陌生人 
Most of us feel really responsible. ,萬一佢係精神病咁點？」 
That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home. ,我嘅焦慮越嚟越勁 我彈起身，趷高腳行到門口鎖咗房門 
And it's because of this that our company can even exist. ,好彩佢唔係精神病 
"By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone? ",自此之後我哋一直保持聯絡 
(Laughter) Would you tell Twitter he's running for President? ,嗰幅佢係我後院買到嘅畫 掛咗喺佢課室裏面 佢宜家係一名老師 
"(Laughter) (Applause) OK, you can hand your phones back now. ",呢個就係我第一次招待嘅經驗 呢次經歷完全改變我嘅看法 
"So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way. ",或者童年我所學到嘅陌生人 其實係等待我去認識嘅新朋友 
What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment? ,接待人嚟屋企嘅氣墊床瞓 對我嚟講越嚟越普通 當我搬到三藩市，我帶埋充氣床喺身邊 
"What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog? ",兩年之後，我失業，幾乎破產 
"Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, ""They're great at holding unlocked phones!"" ",我嘅室友搬走咗，跟住又加租 
(Laughter) Now how would you feel about handing your phone over? ,嗰陣我知道有一個設計會議會舉行 所有酒店房間都訂咗 
"It turns out, a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust. ",而我成日認為將恐懼轉化為樂趣 係創作嘅恩物 
And we didn't actually get it right the first time. ,所以，我就向我嘅好朋友 兼新嘅室友布莱恩 · 切斯基講 「布萊恩，我諗到一個賺錢嘅方法， 就係將我哋屋企變成 『設計師民宿兼包早餐』， 畀年輕設計師嚟到城市之後 有一個過夜嘅地方， 包無線上網、一張細書枱、 一張睡墊同每朝早餐。哈哈！」 
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews. ,我哋整咗簡單網站 Airbnb 就咁樣誕生咗 
"Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them. ",有三位幸運嘅客人嚟住 佢哋瞓喺硬木地板上面 價值 20 美元嘅氣墊床 
"Now, here's a discovery we made just last week. ",不過佢哋好滿意，我哋都係 
"We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography. ",我發誓，我哋煮嘅瑞士芝士蛋餅 味道零舍唔同 因為我哋親自為客人而做 
"The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us. ",我哋帶佢哋遊覽城市 當我哋同最後一位客人 講再見，閂咗門之後 布萊恩同我互望 
"The more different somebody is, the less we trust them. ",我哋發現咗一種既可以交朋友 又可以收租嘅方法 
"Now, that's a natural social bias. ",於是一切開始啦 
"But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews. ",我嘅舊室友內森 ‧ 布萊卡斯亞克 加入我哋公司成為技術創辦人 
"Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes. ",我哋認真了解下 我哋可唔可以 將呢樣嘢變成一門生意 
"But if you've got more than 10, everything changes. ",我哋同投資者講 「我哋想建立一個網站， 等大家可以將佢哋 最私人嘅空間嘅相 發佈到網站上， 例如睡房、洗手間， 嗰啲人哋嚟到 你唔想畀人睇到嘅房。 
High reputation beats high similarity. ,然後，透過網絡， 佢哋可以邀請陌生人到屋企留宿。 
The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases. ,呢樣一定有錢賺呀！」 
Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure. ,（笑聲） 我哋坐低，之後 就等我哋嘅事業蓬勃發展 
This is what happens when a guest first messages a host. ,但係事業仍然停滯不前 
"If you share too little, like, ""Yo,"" acceptance rates go down. ",無人願意投資一種 畀陌生人到自己屋企過夜嘅服務 
"And if you share too much, like, ""I'm having issues with my mother,"" (Laughter) acceptance rates also go down. ",點解？ 
"But there's a zone that's just right, like, ""Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family."" ",因為我哋自細就被教話 陌生人等於危險 
So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure? ,當你遇到問題時 你會用已知嘅嘢去解決問題 嗰陣我哋淨係識得設計 
"We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing. ",喺藝術學校，你學到 設計比物件嘅外表同觸感重要得多 因為係關乎整體經歷 
"We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias. ",我哋對物件會識咁樣做 但係宜家我哋嘅目標係 點樣令兩個素未謀面嘅人彼此信任 
What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside. ,設計可否令此會發生呢？ 
This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption. ,究竟有冇可能設計出「信任」呢？ 
There's three things happening here. ,我想畀你哋感受下 我哋想追求嘅「信任」 
"The first, an unbelievable amount of luck. ",我會進行一個三十秒嘅實驗 令你哋走出安樂窩 
The second is the efforts of our team. ,如果你願意參加，請豎起你嘅手指公！ 
And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need. ,好，我需要各位拎出手機 
"Now, things have been going pretty well. ",擺出之後 請解鎖手機 
"Obviously, there are times when things don't work out. ",然後將手機交畀你隔籬嘅人 
Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes. ,（笑聲） 宜家你感覺到嘅驚慌 （笑聲） 就好似第一次打開家門 向客人提供住宿嘅宿主 
Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain. ,因為唯一比自己手機更私人嘅 就係你屋企 
"In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone. ",人哋唔只睇到你嘅信息 仲睇到你嘅睡房 廚房同洗手間 
I was at the front lines of trust breaking. ,宜家攞住人哋解鎖咗嘅手機 感覺如何？ 
"And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them. ",我哋大多數都突然有一種責任感 
"And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving. ",呢個就係大部分房客住宿時嘅感覺 
"Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic. ",因此客人都有呢種責任心 我哋公司先會生存到宜家 
"Turns out, people are justified in their trust. ",順便一提，邊位攞住 Al Gore 嘅手機？ 
"And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical. ",（笑聲） 你會唔會同 Twitter 講佢要競逐總統？ 
"We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 好啦，你依家可以攞返你嘅手機 
The host rushed him to the hospital. ,所以，啱啱各位體驗過 我們曾經面對嘅信任問題 我亦都想分享我哋 喺途中見到嘅嘢 
They donated their own blood for his operation. ,如果我哋喺實驗裏邊 做小小設計嘅變動會點呢？ 
Let me read you his review. ,如果坐喺你隔離嘅人 首先介紹自己嘅名 邊度嚟、佢哋嘅仔女或者家企隻狗？ 
"(Laughter) ""Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions. ",想像下佢哋獲得 150 個他人評價 話「佢哋搾得人哋 解鎖嘅手機好好！」 
(Laughter) The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals. ,（笑聲） 宜家你交出手機時 會有點嘅感覺？ 
(Laughter) Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you. ,結果證明 一個設計完善嘅評分系統 係建立信任嘅關鍵 
They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass. ,我哋最初其實並唔成功 
"They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read. ",大眾難以留低劣評 
And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you. ,結果我哋知道 要等客人同民宿主人 各自寫好評語之後 我哋至可以公開佢哋嘅評語 
"Highly recommended!"" ",就係上星期我哋又學到新嘢 
"(Applause) Of course, not every stay is like that. ",我們同史丹佛大學做咗一個研究 觀察啲人有幾因為人哋年齡、居住地 同地理環境相似而相信人哋 
But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for. ,如之前所料，硏究結果顯示 我哋傾向鍾意類似嘅人 
"Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up. ",愈係同我哋唔似嘅人 我哋就愈唔信 
How do sharing and transactions go together? ,呢個係自然嘅社會偏見現象 
So let's be clear; it is about commerce. ,但當你加入咗評分系統之後 有趣事情就發生啦 以評價為例 
"But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete. ",若然係你有三個人評價你 無變化 
The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection. ,但如果你得到超過十個評價 就會發生改變 
"People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything. ",信譽會排喺相似度之前 
"You know how most travel today is, like, I think of it like fast food -- it's efficient and consistent, at the cost of local and authentic. ",啱嘅設計可以消除根深蒂固嘅偏見 
What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences? ,我們同時發現，要建立適度嘅信任 就需要公開適量嘅私人資料 
"What if anywhere you visited, there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed. ",跟住落嚟就係房客第一次 畀房東發訊息時嘅情況 
Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant? ,如果你透露得太少，例如「呦」 咁接受嘅機率會降低 
"Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation. ",如果你透露得太多，例如： 「我同阿媽鬧交。」 （笑聲） 咁接受機率同樣會下降 
What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up? ,但係如果表達得啱啱好，例如： 「我鍾意你屋企嘅藝術品， 想同家人嚟渡假。」 
What would that look like? ,咁，我哋要點樣設計 至做到適量公開資料呢？ 
What if cities embraced a culture of sharing? ,我哋利用空格欄位嘅尺寸 提示資料應有嘅長短 並且有文字引導佢哋分享 
I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation. ,我哋將全公司 押在呢個好嘅設計上 透過好設計 令人願意克服對陌生人恐懼嘅偏見 
"In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this. ",但我哋唔知 有幾多人準備好將偏見放下 
They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents. ,呢幅係我哋服務使用量嘅表 
They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms. ,呢張圖講明三件事 
And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups. ,第一，租房數目簡直係難以置信 
"Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs. ",第二，係我哋團隊努力嘅成果 
"Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught. ",第三，之前客戶嘅不滿仍然存在 
We didn't invent anything new. ,依家業務發展得唔錯 
Hospitality has been around forever. ,當然有時，會出現問題 
There's been many other websites like ours. ,例如客人未經主人同意開派對 同埋將屋企搞到亂塔塔 
"So, why did ours eventually take off? ",仲有，房東由得房客畀雨淋都唔理 
"Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that. ",創業初期，我負責顧客服務 客戶電話會直達我手機 
Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias. ,我係喺信任破裂嘅最前線 
And that's amazing to me. ,無嘢比聽到呢啲電話慘 剩係諗起電話都覺得心痛 
It blows my mind. ,聽見電話裏邊失望嘅聲音 老實講 係我哋不停改進嘅動力 
I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by. ,謝天謝地，喺我哋接待過 1.23 億個夜晚之後 少過 1% 嘅客人有問題 
"Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems. ",證明咗人有信任 
"But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next? ",而當信任上咗軌道之後 神奇嘅嘢可以發生！ 
Thank you. ,我哋曾經有一個房客喺烏拉圭住宿時 突然心臟病發 
(Applause) ,房東將佢送入醫院搶救 
,仲捐血幫佢做手術 
Deep inside Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library lies the only copy of a 240-page tome. ,等我同各位讀下嗰位客人嘅評價： 
"Recently carbon dated to around 1420, its vellum pages features looping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly stolen from a dream. ",（笑聲） 「對平時冇做運動、 容易心肌梗塞嘅遊客， 呢間屋確實好好。」 
"Real and imaginary plants, floating castles, bathing women, astrology diagrams, zodiac rings, and suns and moons with faces accompany the text. ",（笑聲） 「呢個區環境優美， 仲有一條直通最好醫院嘅路。 
"This 24x16 centimeter book is called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest unsolved mysteries. ",（笑聲） Javier 同 Alejandra 就算唔識你，都會即刻救你一命。 
The reason why? ,當你就快唔得嘅時候， 佢哋會立即開車送你去醫院。 醫生幫你做搭橋手術時， 佢哋會喺等候室守候住你。 
No one can figure out what it says. ,佢哋唔想你孤獨， 所以佢哋會帶書畀你睇。 
"The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. ",之後佢哋仲會畀你瞓多幾晚 而唔收你錢。 
He was puzzled. ,極力推薦！」 
Who wrote it? ,（掌聲） 當然，唔係每次住宿都係咁樣 
Where was it made? ,但係，呢種超越交易的友情 就係「分享經濟」要達到嘅目標 
What do these bizarre words and vibrant drawings represent? ,當我聽到呢個術語嘅時候 我承認，我仲未搞清楚 
What secrets do its pages contain? ,分享同交易點樣並存？ 
"He purchased the manuscript from the cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle over it for more than a century. ",所以等我哋嚟講解一下 呢樣係關於商業嘅事 
"Cryptologists say the writing has all the characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before. ",但係，如果你剩係將呢樣嘢 叫做「房租經濟」 咁就唔完整啦 
"What makes it seem real is that in actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear with consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find from a random letter generator. ",「分享經濟」指人有接觸嘅商業行為 
"Other than that, we know little more than what we can see. ",人分享佢哋自己嘅一部分 呢樣嘢足以改變一切 
The letters are varied in style and height. ,你知道今日旅行似咩呀？ 我覺得似快餐 高效而且千篇一律 但失去咗當地風土人情 
"Some are borrowed from other scripts, but many are unique. ",如果旅遊令你 盡情體驗本地嘅嘢會點？ 
The taller letters have been named gallows characters. ,如果每個你遊覽過嘅地方 都有一個本地中央市集 而你未聽過 可以喺嗰度嘅酒吧飲個暢快？ 
The manuscript is highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments. ,又或者可以向五星級飯店 嘅廚師拜藝？ 
"It appears to be written by two or more hands, with the painting done by yet another party. ",今日屋企嘅設計概念 嚟自私隱同分隔 
"Over the years, three main theories about the manuscript's text have emerged. ",如果屋企嘅設計概念從一開始 就係分享會點樣呢？ 
"The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed to hide secret meaning. ",外觀會係點？ 
The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money off a gullible buyer. ,如果城市都接受分享嘅文化呢？ 
Some speculate the author was a medieval con man. ,我見到未來嘅城市都係分享型 都會有社區同埋連繫到人嘅 而唔係孤立同分離 
"Others, that it was Voynich himself. ",喺首爾 韓國人其實已經開始做緊分享經濟 
"The third theory is that the manuscript is written in an actual language, but in an unknown script. ",佢哋將數以百計政府嘅停車位 分享畀居民使用 
Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken but not yet written. ,佢哋將需要住宿嘅學生 同有空房嘅房東配對 
"In that case, the Voynich manuscript might be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture that made it collapsed. ",佢哋仲設立資金孵化器 為下一代「分享經濟」嘅 初創公司提供資金支持 
"Though no one can read the Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing what it might say. ","今晚，我哋嘅民宿會涉及 785,000人 191 個國家 佢哋一係住喺陌生人屋企嘅房客 一係準備歡迎陌生人嚟屋企住嘅屋東 "
Those who believe the manuscript was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge of the culture that produced it. ,好明顯，陌生人並唔似 我哋細個被教育咁瘋狂 
"Others believe it was written by the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand the universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the Elizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination. ",我哋並無發明新嘅嘢 
"More fringe theories that the book was written by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians. ",好客之道呢句話由來已久 
"After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little light on the mystery. ",全世界亦有好多好似我哋咁嘅網站 
The first breakthrough was the carbon dating. ,但係點解我哋最後成功？ 
"Also, contemporary historians have traced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague to as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius. ",除了運氣同時機之外 我認識到信任 然後融合喺設計裏面 
"In addition to these historical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed the provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words. ",設計消除我陌生人等於危險嘅觀念 呢個根深蒂固的偏見 
"Could the letters beside these seven stars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven stars called the Pleiades? ",呢種偏見令我吃驚 
Could this word be Centaurun for the Centaurea plant in the picture? ,完全同我諗法有出入 
"Perhaps, but progress is slow. ",每次見到紅色 Miata 經過 我都會諗起呢種偏見 
"If we can crack its code, what might we find? ",我知道設計唔能夠解決 世界所有問題 
The dream journal of a 15th-century illustrator? ,但如果佢能夠 解決住宿嘅問題 如果佢能夠做到少少成果 我會不期然地諗 我哋下次可以設計啲咩出嚟呢？ 
A bunch of nonsense? ,多謝 
Or the lost knowledge of a forgotten culture? ,（掌聲） 
What do you think it is? ,
,喺耶魯大學嘅 拜內克古籍缮本圖書館度 有本 240 頁嘅孤本書 
"Behold the human brain, it's lumpy landscape visibly split into a left and right side. ",經碳年代測定法鑑定為 大概 1420 年嘅書 佢嘅牛皮頁上有圈形嘅字跡 有好似夢境嘅圖案 
"This structure has inspired one of the most pervasive ideas about the brain, that the left side controls logic and the right, creativity. ",有真嘅同想像出來嘅植物 有空中漂浮嘅城堡 喺度沖涼嘅女人 占星術圖 星座戒指 同有人面嘅日月 
"And yet, this is a myth unsupported by scientific evidence. ",呢個長 24 厘米，寬 16 厘米 嘅書叫做伏尼契手稿 係歷史上最大嘅未解之謎之一 
"So how did this misleading idea come about, and what does it get wrong? ",點解呢？ 
It's true that the brain has a right and a left side. ,因為冇人知道呢本書講咩 
"This is most apparent with the outer layer, or the cortex. ",書名來自一個叫 威爾弗雷德．伏尼契嘅人 佢係個波蘭嘅書商 喺 1912 年喺意大利嘅 一個耶穌會學校度撞啱見到呢本書 
"Internal regions, like the striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brain stem appear to be made from continuous tissue, but in fact, they're also organized with left and right sides. ",呢本書使佢困惑 
"The left and the right sides of the brain do control different body functions, such as movement and sight. ",邊個寫咗呢本書嚟？ 
The brain's right side controls the motion of the left arm and leg and vice versa. ,喺邊度寫嘅？ 
The visual system is even more complex. ,呢哋古怪嘅文字同充滿活力嘅圖案代表咩？ 
Each eye has a left and right visual field. ,書裡邊到底有咩秘密？ 
"Both left visual fields are sent to the right side of the brain, and both right fields are sent to the left side. ",教會學校手頭緊， 於是賣咗個手稿畀佢 之後佢带咗手稿去美國 喺美国， 专家繼續被本書所困惑 
So the brain uses both sides to make a complete image of the world. ,密碼學家話 書裡文字有一個真正語言含有嘅全部特徵 只不過從來冇人見過呢個語言 
Scientists don't know for sure why we have that crossing over. ,點解噉講嚟？ 因為喺真實嘅語言裡邊 文字或者特定嘅文字組合 會以一定嘅頻率出現 伏尼契手稿裡邊嘅語言含有嘅特徵 唔可能係隨機生成 
One theory is it began soon after animals developed more complex nervous systems because it gave the survival advantage of quicker reflexes. ,除咗呢啲，其他就唔清楚喇 
"If an animal sees a predator coming from its left side, it's best off escaping to the right. ",字母嘅風格同高矮各有唔同 
"So we can say that vision and movement control are two systems that rely on this left-right structure, but problems arise when we over-extend that idea to logic and creativity. ",有啲字母係抄自其他語言 但係好多字母係獨一無二嘅 
"This misconception began in the mid-1800s when two neurologists, Broca and Wernicke, examined patients who had problems communicating due to injuries. ",高一啲嘅字母被稱為 「托架抄本」 
"The researchers found damage to the patients' left temporal lobes, so they suggested that language is controlled by the left side of the brain. ",呢部手稿從頭到尾 都有漩渦形嘅裝飾圖案 
That captured the popular imagination. ,佢好似有兩個人以上嘅筆跡 而畫畫就係另外一班人 
Author Robert Louis Stevenson then introduced the idea of a logical left hemisphere competing with an emotional right hemisphere represented by his characters Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. ,噉多年以来， 關於呢本書有三種推測 
But this idea didn't hold up when doctors and scientists examined patients who were missing a hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated. ,第一种，呢本書用密文 專登掩蓋某啲秘密 
"These patients showed a complete range of behaviors, both logical and creative. ",第二种，呢本書就係 整出來呃人錢財嘅局 
Later research showed that one side of the brain is more active than the other for some functions. ,有人認為啲作者就係個中世紀嘅老千 
Language is more localized to the left and attention to the right. ,有人認為係伏尼契自己設局 
"So one side of the brain may do more work, but this varies by system rather than by person. ",第三种推测係 呢個手稿確實係一種特殊語言寫嘅 只不過冇人明 
"There isn't any evidence to suggest that individuals have dominant sides of the brain, or to support the idea of a left-right split between logic and creativity. ",又或者，寫呢本書嘅人係 一群嘗試為一種口頭語言 建立字母嘅中世紀學者 
"Some people may be particularly logical or creative, but that has nothing to do with the sides of their brains. ",如果係噉，伏尼契手稿就可能 好似復活島嘅朗格朗格手稿 因為當年嘅文明已經消失 宜家就冇人睇得明 
And even the idea of logic and creativity being at odds with each other doesn't hold up well. ,儘管冇人明白伏尼契手稿 但係有好多人仲喺度估佢講咩 
Solving complex math problems requires inspired creativity and many vibrant works of art have intricate logical frameworks. ,有人認為佢喺度創造 一種新嘅書面語言 伏尼契手稿又可能係個 創造呢種語言嘅文化嘅百科全書 
Almost every feat of creativity and logic carries the mark of the whole brain functioning as one. ,仲有人諗伏尼契手稿嘅作者 係 13 世紀哲學家羅傑培根 培根曾經嘗試理解 所有語言共有嘅語法法則 手稿嘅作者又可能係 16 世紀 伊麗莎白時代嘅神秘主義者尊迪 尊迪曾經研究過煉藥術同占卜術 
,更加邊緣嘅理論認為 作者係一班意大利嘅巫婆 甚至有人諗作者係火星人 
"Thousands of years from now, we'll look back at the first century of computing as a fascinating but very peculiar time -- the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2D space, interacting with technology as if we were machines; a singular, 100-year period in the vastness of time where humans communicated, were entertained and managed their lives from behind a screen. ",度橋度咗成百年後 啲科學家終於有咗啲頭緒 
"Today, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens. ",第一個突破就係用碳素測年法 
What happened to interacting with each other? ,測到呢份手稿嘅起源 大概喺 1612 年嘅羅馬或者布拉格 佢可能係神聖羅馬帝國皇帝魯道夫二世 轉手畀佢嘅醫生 雅各布斯．希納皮亞斯 
"I don't know about you, but I feel limited inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels. ",除咗呢哋突破 啲語言學家啱啱 暫定識別咗手稿裡邊嘅幾個文字 
And it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator. ,呢度七粒星隔离嘅文字 會唔會係 Tauran 既係 Taurus（金牛座）嘅别称 一個包含昴宿星團嘅星座？ 
"Put simply: I want to create a new reality, a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other, a reality where people, not devices, are the center of everything. ",呢個字會唔會係 Centaurun 即係圖裡邊嘅 Centaurea（矢車菊）？ 
"I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel; a reality where technology no longer gets in our way, but instead embraces who we are. ",有可能嘅， 不過進展就好慢 
I dream of technology on a human path. ,如果我哋破解咗密碼， 我哋會發現咩？ 
"We have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people, products that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics. ",一個 15 世纪插圖家嘅夢記？ 
This is the next step in the evolution. ,一堆胡言亂語？ 
"This is Microsoft HoloLens, the first fully untethered holographic computer. ",仲係一個被遺忘嘅文明嘅 失傳嘅知識？ 
"Devices like this will bring 3D holographic content right into our world, enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions. ",你點睇嚟？ 
"Now, I'm not thinking about a distant future. ",
"We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with HoloLens; universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn; and my personal favorite, NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically. ",我地睇到人類嘅腦 係分成左右兩塊嘅 
"Now, this is important. ",呢個結構令人都產生 一個非常普遍嘅觀點 左腦控制人嘅邏輯思維 右腦就控制人嘅創意 
"By bringing holograms into our world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer. ",但其實呢個理論並無科學嘅依據 
I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines of traditional computing. ,咁點解會有呢個錯誤理論產生 佢又錯係邊度呢？ 
"Put it this way: temporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms. ",人腦的確分成左右兩部分 
We've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave. ,從外層同皮質就可以睇到 
"Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day. ",內部結構 例如紋狀體 下丘腦 丘腦 同腦幹 睇上去好似由連續組織構成 但事實上 佢哋同時都受左右腦組織 
"And now for the next few minutes, I invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us. ",左右腦都控制唔同嘅身體功能 例如運動同視力 
"Now, as I put this HoloLens on, let me explain the setup a little bit. ",右腦控制左手左腳嘅運動 反過來都係咁 
"It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage with HoloLens, and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED. ",視覺系統就更加複雜 
"Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage, just as clearly as I can see all of you. ",每隻眼都分成左右兩個視野 
"Now at the same time, we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors. ",兩隻眼嘅左視野都係右腦負責 兩隻眼嘅右視野就係左腦負責 
So let's start our journey. ,左右腦一齊運作先可以 睇到完整嘅畫面 
"And what better place to begin our journey, than in the computer cave of 2D. ",科學家都唔知點解 人嘅左右腦會有交換分工 
"Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens, and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective. ",其中一個理論係 交換分工令動物可以有更快嘅反應 所以喺動物發展神經系統之後無幾耐 就有呢個現象了 
The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive. ,如果一個動物睇到捕食者從左邊過來 佢最好從右邊逃走 
"As developers, we dream the different causes and then we program the different effects. ",所以視覺同運動其實係由 左右腦兩個系統控制嘅 但就唔可以過度理解成 左右腦分別負責邏輯同創意 
"Double click on an icon, that's a cause. ",呢個誤解來源於 18 世紀中 當 Broca 同 Wernicke 兩個神經學家研究 因創傷有溝通問題嘅病人嘅時候 
"Open an application, that's an effect. ",佢哋發現病人嘅左顳葉有創傷 所以推測語言能力係左腦控制嘅 
"Now when we compare this to our physical universe, it is overly constraining, because our universe is not digital. ",呢個推論好快傳播開來 
Our universe is analog. ,作家 Robert Louis Stevenson 曾經通過佢筆下嘅角色 Jekyll 博士和 Hyde 先生 引出理性嘅左腦 同感性嘅右腦對抗嘅諗法 
"Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one, true or false, or black or white. ",但當醫生同科學家研究 缺少一個大腦半球 或者兩個大腦半球分割嘅病人 
"We exist in a world governed by quantum physics, a universe of zero and one both at the same time, a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray. ",嘅時候發現 呢個理論係錯誤的 呢啲病人表現出一系列嘅行為 
You can see how these two worlds collide. ,既有邏輯性嘅亦有創意性嘅 之後研究發現 當大腦運行某些功能時 
So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life? ,其一側會比另外一側更活躍 語言功能更加依賴左腦 而注意力更加依賴右腦 
"We see screens from the moment we wake up, to the moment we fall asleep. ",所以一側嘅大腦可能會負責更多嘅工作 但呢個就取決於唔同系統嘅運作 而唔係個人 
Why? ,無任何證據證明 一個人會由一邊腦來主導 左右腦分別控制 邏輯和創意力 有啲人會特別有邏輯或者有創意 
I think it's because computers give us superpowers. ,但同佢哋嘅左右腦並無關係 甚至「邏輯同創意相互矛盾」嘅觀點 
"Within the digital universe, we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time. ",都係錯嘅 解決複雜嘅數學問題需要有創意 
"It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment, productivity or communication. ",而好多充滿活力嘅藝術作品 都有復雜嘅邏輯框架 
Think of it this way: let's all go home tonight and watch our favorite show on television. ,幾乎每一個創造力同邏輯嘅壯舉 都係依靠左右腦一齊運作嘅功勞 
This is theater -- time and space displaced. ,
"As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk, I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle. ",幾千年後 當我哋睇返電腦誕生嗰時 會覺得係一個令人著迷、好奇嘅時代 係歷史上唯一一個 人類活喺二維空間嘅時代 人類好似機械咁同科技共處 亦都係時間長河裏邊嘅一個世紀 人類喺屏幕面前通訊、娛樂、生活 
That's displacement of space. ,如今，我哋大部分時間都睇同襟螢幕 
"Now, these are such great superpowers that we put up with the two-dimensional limitations of our current digital world. ",但係，人與人之間嘅交流發生咩問題？ 
But what if we didn't have to? ,我唔知你點諗，但我覺得有限制 感覺自己限制喺 只有螢幕同像素嘅二維世界裏邊 
What if we could have these same digital powers in our world? ,就係咁樣嘅限制 同埋我想同人交流嘅想法 令我成爲創作人 
"You can already see glimmers of this, but I believe our children's children will grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology. ",即係話，我想整一個全新嘅現實 科技可以無限拉近人與人之間距離 係以人爲本 而唔係以電子產品爲本 
"It's remarkable to dream of this world, a world where technology truly understands us -- where we live, work and communicate -- with tools that enhance the human experience, not machines that limit our humanity. ",我想見到一個環境 科技會感受到 人嘅所見所聞、所感覺嘅嘢 但科技又唔會阻住我哋生活 而係能夠令人類鍾意自己 
So how do we get there? ,我用人類發展嘅過程去諗呢種科技 
"For me, the answer required looking at the problem from a different perspective. ",我哋所有人都用過 一啲令人更加似返人嘅科技 一啲令人做到自然交流 聲控同埋生物統計嘅產品 
It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine. ,但係科技發展嘅下一步係 微軟公司嘅全息眼鏡 
"If you're a machine trying to sense our world, how would you actually break the problem down? ",同埋第一個無線全息圖電腦 
"You'd probably try to classify things as a human, an environment or an object. ",呢類電子產品可以將三維全息影像 帶到嚟你眼前 係前所未有咁感知世界 有助我哋感受生活 
But how would that machine then interact with reality? ,我講緊嘅唔係好遠嘅將來，而係現實 
And I can think of three ways. ,汽車製造商沃爾沃 已經用緊全息眼鏡設計汽車 凱斯西儲大學嘅醫科生 用緊全息眼鏡學習 我最鍾意嘅美國太空總署 已經採用全息眼鏡 等科學家可以探索星球 
"First, as a machine, I would observe or I would input reality. ",更加重要係 
Speech recognition and biometric authentication are great examples of a machine interacting with humans from an input perspective. ,全息眼鏡唔剩係一款新產品 或者更高級嘅電腦 
"Secondly, as a machine, I could place digital information, or output information, into reality. ",透過將全息圖帶到我哋日常生活當中 全息眼鏡能夠將人 喺傳統二維空間裏面解放出嚟 
Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective. ,打個比喻 我哋就好似原始人 
"Finally, as a machine, I could exchange energy with the world via haptics. ",我哋啱啱搵到一嚿木炭 然後開始喺洞穴裏邊 畫第一幅線條圖畫 
"Now, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object, or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram and having it push you back with equal force. ",宜家，等我話畀你聽 我每日做嘢嘅情景 
"With this perspective, we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix. ",接住落嚟嘅時間 我邀請你哋一齊感受一下明日嘅科技 
"Now here's a secret: as an engineer, I get really excited anytime I can reduce something to the matrix. ",宜家，就等我戴上全息眼鏡 等我解釋一下裝置問題 
"From self-driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head, machines are becoming capable of understanding our world. ",我之前喺台上做過好多次全息眼鏡示範 但今次可能係最危險嘅一次 但我諗唔到比 TED 更加適合做示範嘅場所 
And they are starting to interact with us in significantly more personal ways. ,好快，我會喺台上面見到全息圖影像 影像清楚到同台下嘅你哋一樣 
"Now, imagine having granular control over everything in the world. ",期間，會有攝影機 通過大屏幕播放我睇到嘅影像 等大家可以同我一齊感受 
"Move the dial one way, and you get reality. ",咁宜家開始啦 
"Move the dial the other way, and you get virtual reality. ",呢樣嘢比起二維影像更加適合我哋 
"Now, imagine dialing your entire environment between virtual and real worlds. ",等我哋用新器材探索我哋周圍嘅世界 同埋用全新角度了解電腦世界 
I love it down here. ,電腦世界既不可思議、原始 又係基於因果定律 
"Now, imagine if I could look at all of you and dial from real humans into elves. ",作爲開發者 我哋要考慮唔同輸入嘅情況 然後設計出對應嘅畫面反應 
"When technology truly understands our world, it will again transform the ways we interact, the ways we work and the ways we play. ",好似襟圖案兩下，就係輸入 
"Less than half a century ago, two courageous men landed on the moon, using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets. ",打開一個程式，就係畫面輸出 
"Six hundred million humans watched them on grainy, black-and-white televisions. ",當我哋將呢啲嘢同現實世界比嘅話 就會顯示出現實世界嘅局限 因爲現實世界 唔似數碼世界嘅數字斷斷續續 
And the world? ,而係好似指針一樣連續進行嘅 
The world was mesmerized. ,現實世界唔會用 0 或者 1 啱定錯、黑或白嘅方法去諗嘢 
Now imagine how our children and their children will experience the continued exploration of space with technology that understands this world. ,但量子物理控制咗我哋嘅世界 我哋嘅世界會同時出現 0 同 1 令世界有灰色地帶 同無窮無盡嘅可能性 
We already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist. ,你可以見到現實 同數碼兩個世界點樣有衝突 
"And I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence in our near future. ",咁點解螢幕喺我哋 連貫嘅生活裏面咁普遍呢？ 
"In fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far, let's try doing something else even more crazy. ",我哋一起身睇嘅嘢就係螢幕 瞓覺前睇嘅又係螢幕 
"I invite you to experience, for the first time anywhere in the world, here on the TED stage, a real-life holographic teleportation, between me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ",點解會咁呢？ 
"Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff. ",我諗係因爲電腦畀我哋好多力量 
"Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex. ",喺數碼世界裏邊 我哋有能力將空間替換，將時間替換 
"Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked. How are you doing today, Jeff? ",無論你將科技用喺娛樂用途 工作上，抑或通訊上 
(Applause) JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week. ,想像下 我哋今晚一齊返屋企 睇我哋最鐘意嘅電視節目 
"AK: So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are? ",喺呢間戲院入面，時間同空間改變咗 
"JN: Well, I'm actually in three places. ",當我好快完咗呢場 TED 演講之後 我會即刻打畀我西雅圖嘅家人 
"I'm standing in a room across the street, while I'm standing on this stage with you, while I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away. ",呢個時候，空間改變咗 
"AK: Wow, a hundred million miles away. This is crazy! ",可以睇到影響好大 我哋仲可以將影響 同當今數碼世界嘅二維限制結合起黎 
Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from Mars is coming from? ,但係，如果我哋無需要咁做呢？ 
JN: Absolutely. ,如果我哋嘅數碼世界有同樣嘅影響呢？ 
"This is a precise holographic replica of Mars, built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover, that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth. ",其實你已經睇到少少個影響 但我深信二維科技會喺兩代之後消失 
Humans are natural explorers. ,到時將會係一個更加非凡嘅世界 當科技真真正正明白人類時 無論生活、工作定係通訊方面 我哋都會有工具提升體驗 唔會再有機械阻礙人類體驗事物 
"We can instantly understand an environment, just by being present in it. ",咁我哋點先可以提升體驗？ 
We've built tools like our Mars Rover to extend our vision and lengthen our reach. ,對我嚟講 首先要從第二個角度搵出問題 
"But for decades, we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards. ",呢個需要我哋從機械角度 去睇呢個世界 
"Now, we're leaping over all of that, over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there. ",如果你係一部機器睇世界 你會點樣拆解問題？ 
"Today, a group of scientists on our mission are seeing Mars as never before -- an alien world made a little more familiar, because they're finally exploring it as humans should. ",你可能將事物分為人類、環境同物件 
But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there. ,但咁樣嘅機器 又點樣同現實世界互動呢？ 
"When we dial this real world to the virtual, we can do magical things. ",我諗到三種方式 
We can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain. ,第一，機器會觀察 或者將現實世界嘅資料輸入 
"Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it. ",從輸入嘅角度睇，聲音辨認同生物認證 就係機器同人類交流嘅好例子 
We're taking the first steps. ,第二，機器可以將電子訊息 或者輸出訊息帶到現實世界 
"But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next, because this is not a journey for a few, but for all of us. ",從輸出角度睇 全息眼鏡係機器同環境交流嘅例子 
"AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing. ",最後，機械可以通過 觸覺同世界交換能量 
Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today. ,想像下，你可以感受虛擬物件嘅溫度 或者可以推開一個虛擬圖像 然後虛擬圖像用同樣嘅力推開你 
"(Applause) JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye. ",從呢個角度睇 我哋可以將現實世界 拆散爲一個簡單模組 
"AK: Bye, Jeff. ",同你講個秘密 作爲一個程式員，令我興奮嘅 係當我發現某樣嘢 可以簡化爲一個模組 
(Applause) I dream about this future every single day. ,無論係自動駕駛汽車、智能手機 定係我戴緊嘅全息圖電腦 機器已經越嚟越了解我哋現實世界 
I take inspiration from our ancestors. ,而且，佢哋已經開始 用更加人性化嘅方式同我哋交流 
"We used to live in tribes where we interacted, communicated and worked together. ",想像一下用粒子形式 操控世上所有事物 
"We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today -- technology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels, and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our 3D world. ",只要轉動一下轉盤 現實世界就出現喺你面前 
It's a phenomenal time to be human. ,如果轉個轉盤第二個方向 虛擬世界就會出現喺你面前 
Thank you. ,宜家想像一下 你游走於虛擬同現實世界 
(Applause) Helen Walters: Thanks so much. I have some questions. ,我太鍾意呢個景色啦 
AK: OK. ,再想像下，我見到台下嘅你哋 只要我郁動轉盤，你哋就會變成精靈 
HW: So there's been some talk in the press. ,當科技真正了解我哋嘅世界時 人嘅交流、工作、娛樂方式都會有變化 
"And I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer. ",喺唔夠半個世紀之前 有兩位勇敢嘅人登陸月球 當時電腦嘅性能比我哋嘅智能手機仲差 
There's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product. ,六億人透過黑白電視見證住歷史一刻 
Talk about this field of view issue. ,咁個世界呢？ 
Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get? ,當時世界被深深咁吸引住 
"AK: It's a great question, Or, said better, this is a question we've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year. ",想像一下我哋嘅後代會點利用 呢啲了解世界嘅科技繼續探索太空 
"If you do your research, I haven't answered that question. ",今時今日嘅世界已經有即時空間轉換器 
"I've purposely ignored it, because ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask. ",不久嘅將來就會有全息圖遙遠控制事物 
"That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time, and you then saying, ""What's the size of your television?"" ",好彩今次演範都好順利 咁不如再試其他更癲嘅嘢 
The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant. ,我邀請大家見證TED 舞臺上 全世界第一次做嘅即時全息圖影像傳輸 同我一位朋友 嚟自 NASA 噴射推進實驗室嘅 Jeffrey Norris 博士傾計 
"What we should be talking about is the density of lights, or radiance, that shows up. ",（手緊握）喂，Jeff！ 
"Better said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see. ",Jeff Norris︰喂 Alex 
"So from that perspective, what you saw -- you know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens. ",講者︰（鬆一口氣） 成功咗，今日點樣呀，Jeff？ 
"So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't. ",（掌聲） Jeff Norris︰ 好好呀我，過去個禮拜都唔錯 
HW: But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right? ,講者︰可唔可以同我哋 講下你宜家喺邊？ 
AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it. ,Jeff Norris︰好 我宜家同時身處三個唔同嘅地方 
It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is. ,我企緊喺街對面嘅一個房 同時又喺 TED 講台同你一齊 同時又喺幾億里外嘅火星 
"So if you think about the points of light that show up radially from the vision of the camera, which is the thing that matters: how many points of light can I get in a given volume? ",講者︰哇，幾億里距離，太勁啦 
That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one. ,你可唔可以詳細講下 點樣收集到火星嘅數據？ 
"Now, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right? ",Jeff Norris︰冇問題 
HW: Jesus Christ! ,呢幅係精確嘅火星全息圖 基於 Curiosity-Mars-Rover 探測器 收集返嚟嘅數據 有咗呢幅全息圖 身在地球都可以探索火星 
(Laughter) AK: He did show up! I told you he'd show up. ,人類天生本來就係探險家 
Come this way. ,通過模擬處身喺個環境 我哋可以即時了解嗰度環境 
"(Laughter) HW: Oh, shit. ",我哋已經設計出類似 Mars Rover 嘅工具 擴大我哋對火星嘅認識 
AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris. ,幾十年嚟，我哋一直都透過 屏幕同鍵盤探索 
"HW: I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what. ",宜家，我哋可以唔受上述嘅嘢限制 唔受巨型天綫同人造衛星限制 並且克服世界嘅距離 虛擬咁第一次登陸火星 
"AK: So in short: to be super crisp, the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye. ",今時今日，我哋任務裏邊嘅一班科學家 以前所未有嘅方式觀察火星 因爲探索 令我哋走近呢個仲有好多未知嘅星球 
"But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see, the points of light per unit of area, are actually the same. ",但係，我哋嘅夢想 未因為做到模擬身處火星而完結 
"HW: So you spent -- Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute -- so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage -- AK: That's right. ",當我哋將現實世界虛擬化之後 我哋做到好多神奇嘅嘢 
"HW: So help me out here: if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home, I don't need to map my apartment, right? ",我哋可以睇到肉眼睇唔到嘅光 或者一瞬間上到某個山頂 
"AK: The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second, with this technology that we call spatial mapping. ",可能有朝一日 我哋可以觸摸到石頭入面嘅礦物質 
"So in your home, as soon as you put it on, holograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them and they'll start learning your home. ",我哋宜家就係行緊第一步 
"In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head to communicate with something over there with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down, we don't take the risk of trying to do this live. ",但我希望全世界可以 同我哋一齊踏出下一步 因爲呢個唔剩係幾個人嘅事 而係關乎全人類 
"So what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second with the same spatial-mapping technology that you'll use with the product at home, and then we store it, so that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this, between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head, we don't have things disappear. ",多謝 Jeff！太震撼啦！ 
"Because ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens, and that one is just viewing the HoloLens. ",多謝你同我哋傾計 
"So if I lose connectivity, you would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen. ",（掌聲） Jeff Norris︰多謝你，Alex，拜拜 
HW: And it was beautiful. ,講者︰拜拜 Jeff 
JN: Yes? ,（掌聲） 我每日都幻想緊呢一日會嚟 
HW: Hi. ,我嘅啟發都係喺祖先度嚟 
AK: I'll take a step back. ,我哋嘅祖先都係圍埋一個部落 大家有交流、溝通，會一齊工作 
"HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars, you were here, you were in a room across the street. ",而我哋，就喺度開發緊科技 令我哋可以回到 當初、成就今日我哋嘅時間 我哋唔再活喺 只有屏幕同像素嘅二維空間裏邊 我哋會得到返三維空間嘅感覺 
"Tell me more about the fact that, with holograms, you have sight but you don't have touch, you don't have smell. ",呢個將會係人類重要嘅轉捩點 
Is this scientifically useful now? ,多謝 
That's my question for a hologram. ,（掌聲） Helen Walters︰ 真係唔該曬。我有問題想問 
JN: Thanks for the question. ,講者︰好 
"Absolutely, I believe that these technologies are scientifically useful right now, and that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA. ",Helen Walters︰傳媒裏邊有啲問題 
So we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars. ,我不妨直接問你，咁我哋有直接嘅答案 
We're also using it for our astronauts on the space station. ,我哋討論過示範裝置 同真正產品有咩唔同 
We're even using it now to design the next generation of our spacecraft. ,咁樣問題係 
"HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. Thank you very much. ",買咗呢件產品嘅人 係咪就可以有頭先嘅體驗？ 
"(Laughter) Alex, really, that was amazing. Thank you so much. ",講者︰問得好 舊年開始 就有好多傳媒朋友 都有問過呢個問題 
AK: Thank you. ,如果你有睇返 你會發覺，我未曾答呢條問題 
HW: Thank you. Thank you. ,我係有心唔答 因爲我覺得問題本身係錯嘅 
(Applause) ,就好似我第一次向某個人 展示全息圖之後 嗰個人問我「你屋企電視有幾大」 
,問題同件產品本身完全無關 
People returning to work after a career break: I call them relaunchers. ,我哋應該討論嘅係光嘅密度 或者發出嚟嘅光度 
"These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care, for childcare reasons, pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue. ",即係話，物件嘅角分辨率係幾多 
"Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds: veterans, military spouses, retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats. ",咁樣諗嘅話… 你應該留意到攝影機裝咗全息眼鏡 
Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers. ,所以我想出古惑都唔得 
"Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high-risk proposition, and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers, especially if they've been out for a long time. ",Helen Walters︰但攝影機嘅鏡頭 同你眼睛嘅晶體係唔同嘅 
This disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve. ,講者︰攝影機有魚眼鏡頭 
"Now, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field. ",攝影機嘅視角比人更加廣 
This is Sami Kafala. ,所以如果你諗下攝影機睇到嘅光 係會從四方八面射出嚟嘅話 就會嚟到一個重點 我可以喺一個特定空間裏面 得到幾多光點？ 
He's a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children. ,答案係我喺全息眼鏡得到嘅光點 同攝影機嘅一樣 
The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks. ,咁攝影機可以睇到 更加廣嘅角度，係咪？ 
"And speaking of long career breaks, this is Mimi Kahn. ",Helen Walters︰嚇死我！ 
"She's a social worker in Orange County, California, who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break. ",（笑聲） 講者︰佢頭先真係有出現，我已經講咗 
That's the longest career break that I'm aware of. ,過嚟呢邊 
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took a five-year career break early in her career. ,（笑聲） Helen Walters︰（粗口）！ 
"And this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break. ",講者︰呢個就係 Jeff Norris 嘅全息圖 
Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it. ,Helen Walters︰我頭先知道有嘢發生 但我唔肯定係咩 
"Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home, but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work, plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working. ",講者︰簡單嚟講 你見到嘅攝影機影像 有人眼視角更加廣嘅視角 
Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search. ,但係，全息圖角分辨率 即係每個面積嘅物體光點都係一樣嘅 
"She was looking for a finance or accounting role, and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results. ",Helen Walters︰所以你… Jeff 我陣間會再同你講 所以你用咗好多時間去圖像繪製個台？ 講者︰冇錯 
"I met Tracy in June of 2011, when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around. ",Helen Walters︰咁請問 如果我買咗個全息眼鏡，然後喺屋企用 我唔需要特登圖像繪製 我間屋，係咪？ 
The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house. ,講者︰全息眼鏡用上空間繪製技術 圖像繪製速度大概係每秒五張 
I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work. ,所以喺屋企，只要戴上全息眼鏡 全息圖就會出現 然後你可以開始控制物件 全息眼鏡開始學習屋企環境 
"I also told her, ""You are going to have a lot of conversations that don't go anywhere. ",至於台上面 雖然戴上全息眼鏡可以遠距離同人通訊 但當要用到可能拖冧會議嘅無線連接 我哋就唔想冒險用無線連接 
"Expect that, and don't be discouraged by it. ",所以我哋事先以每秒五張相嘅速度 圖像繪製咗成個舞臺 用嘅就係空間繪製技術 同你屋企用到嘅一樣 然之後就儲存資料 所以，萬一無線出現咗咩問題 攝影機同我頭上嘅全息眼鏡 都唔會有圖像消失 
"There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity."" ",因爲講到底，全息圖都係嚟自全息眼鏡 攝影機上面嘅只係用嚟播放畫面 
"I'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit, but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce. ",如果連接斷咗 屏幕上面嘅畫面就會消失 
"And that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time. ",Helen Walters︰太犀利啦。Jeff？ 
"What I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past, the people with whom you worked or went to school, they are going to remember you as you were before your career break. ",Jeff Norris︰係 
"And that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time, as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities. ",Helen Walters︰喂 
"So for example, you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this. ",講者︰我褪後先 
"This is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan. ",Helen Walters︰咁 Jeff 你頭先喺火星 同時你又喺 TED 台上 又喺對面街一間房 
Or here I am in the kitchen. ,同我哋講下 如果你全息圖裏面嘅嘢睇得到 但聞唔到，又摸唔到 
"But those people from the past, they don't know about any of this. ",咁全息圖係咪對科學真係有用架？ 
"They only remember you as you were, and it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work. ",呢點係我對全息圖嘅疑慮 
There's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break. ,Jeff Norris︰多謝你嘅問題 
And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news. ,我絕對相信呢種科技對科學係好有用 亦都係點解我哋用全息眼鏡完成 部分美國太空總署嘅任務 
"My background is in finance, and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children. ",全息眼鏡幫我哋探索火星 
So I was afraid I'd go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore. ,我哋嘅太空站嘅人員都會用到佢 
So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again. ,我哋甚至用緊佢設計下一代飛船 
"I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce, and here's why. ",Helen Walters︰太勁啦 Jeff，你宜家可以收線啦，唔該曬！ 
"Think about our life stage: for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons, we have fewer or no maternity leaves. ",（笑聲） Alex，冇錯，真係犀利，唔該曬！ 
We did that already. ,講者︰唔該你 
We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations. ,Helen Walters︰唔該你 
We're in a more settled time of life. ,（掌聲） 
We have great work experience. ,
We have a more mature perspective. ,無做嘢一排、又再出返嚟工作嘅人 我叫佢哋做重新工作嘅人 
We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense. ,佢哋暫時無做嘢 係為咗要照顧老人家 照顧小孩、追求自己嘅興趣 又或者係健康問題 
"Plus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we've been away from it for a while. ",呢啲重新工作嘅人唔同行業都有： 老兵、軍人嘅家眷、剛剛退休嘅人士 又或者係旅居完返國嘅僑胞 
"On the flip side, I speak with employers, and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers. ",佢哋冇做嘢咁耐，要重新工作好難 因為僱主同重新工作者 嘅關係已經斷咗 
"The first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete. ",僱主會見到佢哋嘅 履歷有一欄空白 認為請佢哋係好大風險 呢啲求職者都懷疑自己 重返職場嘅能力 尤其佢哋已經好耐無做嘢 
"Now, I can tell you, having been technologically obsolete myself at one point, that it's a temporary condition. ",我就係想幫佢哋解決 僱主同前員工關係冇咗嘅問題 
I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3. ,宜家各行各業都有人 成功重返職場 
"I don't know if anyone can even remember back that far, but I had to relearn it on Excel. ",呢個係 Sami Kafala 
It actually wasn't that hard. A lot of the commands are the same. ,佢係英國核子物理學家 佢無做嘢五年，返咗屋企湊五個細路 
"I found PowerPoint much more challenging, but now I use PowerPoint all the time. ",新加坡新聞最近講 一啲護士離開職場好耐之後再度工作 
I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software. ,講起長期離膱 呢個係 Mimi Kahn 
"And if they're not up to speed, then it's their responsibility to get there. ",佢喺加州橘郡做社工 佢冇做嘢 25 年之後 返返去社會服務機構工作 
And they do. ,以我所知，呢個係最長嘅離職期 
The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do. ,高等法院法官 Sandra Day O'Connor 佢工作生涯早期曾經離職五年 
I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break. ,呢個係 Tracy Shapiro 佢離職 13 年 
That's not the employer's job. ,Tracy 回應 Today Show 觀眾寄嚟嘅信 觀眾話想出嚟工作 但覺得困難重重 
It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value. ,Tracy 回信話佢係一個媽媽 有五個細路，熱愛家庭生活 但佢離咗婚，需要返返職場 而且佢想生活裏邊有返工作 因為佢鍾意做嘢 
Back in 2010 I started noticing something. ,Tracy 以前就好似我哋好多人咁 覺得用咗一日時間搵工就係好好 
"I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008, and in 2010, I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity, whether it was called an internship or not, but an internship-like experience, as a way for professionals to return to work. ",佢想搵一份金融或者會計嘅工作 佢好努力花咗九個月上網搵工 但都係無結果 
I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs. ,我係 2011 年 6 月認識 Tracy 嗰時 Today Show 問我 可唔可以同佢一齊幫佢扭轉劣勢 
"I saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate, apply for an entry-level internship program in the military, and then get a permanent job afterward. ",我第一件事就叫佢行出屋企 
I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs. ,講畀大家知佢要揾工 同埋話自己有興趣再做嘢 
"So I wrote a report about what I was seeing, and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called ""The 40-Year-Old Intern."" ",我又話畀佢聽： 「你要同好多人講你搵工， 但人哋多數都唔會幫你轉達。 
"I have to thank the editors there for that title, and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns. ",你要預咗咁樣，但唔好氣餒 
"And then, courtesy of Fox Business News, they called the concept ""The 50-Year-Old Intern."" ",可能就係有幾個幫你轉達， 令你有工做。」 
(Laughter) So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals. ,我會講少少 Tracy 後來發生嘅事 但我想先同你哋講下 我經過 11 年離開全職工作 返到工作崗位嘅發現 
"And at this point, hundreds of people have participated. ",就係人哋對你嘅印象會停留喺舊時 
"These internships are paid, and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries. ",即係話你再聯絡返啲人 聯絡返以前認識嘅人 嗰啲同你工作過或者一齊返學嘅人 佢哋只會記得你離職前嘅嘢 
"And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers. ",就算你隨著時間而覺得自己冇咗意義 就好似我哋好多專業人士咁 太耐唔做嘢都會咁樣 
"Now, why are companies embracing the reentry internship? ",例如你或者會諗自己 好似咁樣嘅人 
"Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews, and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over. ",呢個係我嚟，揸咗成日車 人都儍咗 
"This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers, and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires. ",或者我喺廚房入面 
Think about how far we have come. ,但係以前識得嘅人完全唔知我呢啲嘢 
"Before this, most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all. ",佢哋只會記得以前嘅你 當你再同返佢哋聯絡 同埋當佢哋好想聽你返嚟嘅故仔 你嘅信心就會返曬嚟 
"But now, not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind, but you can't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résumé. ",仲有一樣嘢 我離職期間好記得 
"This is the mark of real change, of true institutional shift, because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers, we can solve it for other career transitioners too. ",就係我好難追返財經新聞 
"In fact, an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program. ",我擁有金融背景 但係當我喺屋企睇住四個細路時 好難跟得上任何新聞 
And there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program. ,所以我好驚面試嗰陣 講咗間已經唔存在嘅公司 
"Different pool, same concept. ",於是我重新訂閱華爾街日報 我每份報紙每個報導都有睇 一睇就睇咗六個月 直至我覺得可以掌握返市場脈搏 
So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro. ,我相信重新工作者都係優秀人才 原因係咁樣 
Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work. ,諗一諗我哋嘅人生階段： 嗰啲因為照顧小孩而離職嘅人 佢哋會少啲或者冇得放產假 
"Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy, and it was an accounting job in a finance department. ",因為我哋以前已經放咗產假 
But it was a temp job. ,而且我哋伴侶轉工冇咁多 
"The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more, but no guarantees. ",我哋生活比較安定 
This was in the fall of 2011. ,我哋有豐富工作經驗 
"Tracy loved this company, and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house. ",思想比較成熟 
"So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role, she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best. ",我哋唔會有咗份工，先嚟尋找真我 
"Well, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations, and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012, but they made it even more interesting and challenging, because they knew what Tracy could handle. ",再加上因為我哋已經好耐無做嘢 我哋充滿幹勁，熱衷於返返崗位 
"Fast forward to 2015, Tracy's been promoted. ",我想講講僱主嗰方面 僱主想招請重新工作者時 有兩樣憂慮 
They've paid for her to get her MBA at night. ,第一樣係擔心重新工作者 嘅科技知識落伍 
She's even hired another relauncher to work for her. ,宜家我可以話俾你聼 我曾經有一段時間 科技知識落後 但係只係嗰個時候 
"Tracy's temp job was a tryout, just like an internship, and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer. ",我好耐以前係用 Lotus 1-2-3 做財務分析 
"Now, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers. ",唔知道仲有無人記得 但後來我要學用 Excel 做財務分析 
"But in the meantime, if you are returning to work after a career break, don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program. ",其實唔係好難 因為好多指令都係一樣 
"Be their first success story, and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come. ",我嗰陣覺得 PowerPoint 比較難學 但而家已經冇問題 我仲成日用 PowerPoint 
Thank you. ,我話畀再做嘢嘅人知 僱主期望佢哋 有基本嘅電腦文書知識 
(Applause) ,如果佢哋仲未跟得上 佢哋就有責任學識佢 
,佢哋做到喎 
Periods. ,第二樣令僱主擔心嘅嘢 係重新工作者唔知道自己想做乜 
Blood. ,我叫佢哋一定要 睇清楚究竟喺離職期間 自己嘅興趣同技術有無改到 
Menstruation. ,所以呢樣唔係僱主嘅工作 
Gross. ,而係重回工作者嘅責任 佢哋要證明畀僱主睇 佢哋可以為公司貢獻最多價值 
Secret. ,早喺 2010 年，我發覺一啲嘢 
Hidden. ,由 2008 年開始 我不斷跟進重回工作嘅計劃 喺 2010年，我注意到 市場有短期有薪工作嘅機會 無論係咪叫實習都好 但係呢啲類似實習嘅嘢 可以係專業人士返去職場嘅一個方法 
Why? ,我見到高盛同 Sara Lee 開始咗再次實習計劃 
A natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month for about half of her life. ,我見過一位重投工作嘅工程師 佢係一個突破傳統嘅人嚟 佢申請軍方嘅入門實習計劃 跟住得到一份長工 
A phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it. ,我見過兩間大學將實習 加入到業界行政人員職業教育計劃 
Yet we consider it a taboo. ,於是我寫咗一篇報告 記錄我見到嘅嘢 咁就變成咗哈佛商業評論嘅文章 叫做「40 歲的實習生」 
We feel awkward and shameful talking about it. ,我要多謝嗰度嘅編輯度呢個標題 仲有呢個插圖 見到有個 40 歲嘅實習生 企喺一班大專實習生裡面 
"When I got my first periods, I was told to keep it a secret from others -- even from my father and brother. ",霍士財經新聞叫呢個概念做 「50 歲嘅實習生」 
"Later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks, our biology teacher skipped the subject. ",（笑聲） 又有五間大型財務公司 舉辦咗呢啲再入行實習計劃 畀嗰啲想重回職場嘅金融專業人士 
(Laughter) You know what I learned from it? ,有數以百計嘅人參加咗呢啲計劃 
I learned that it is really shameful to talk about it. ,個計劃係有薪實習 呢啲人後來得到長工 仲有唔錯嘅薪酬 
I learned to be ashamed of my body. ,而家有七間大型工程公司 由婦女工程師協會牽頭 試行同類實習計劃 畀重返職場嘅工程師 
I learned to stay unaware of periods in order to stay decent. ,點解啲公司支持再實習呢？ 
Research in various parts of India shows that three out of every 10 girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods. ,因為實習可以畀僱主 根據實際嘅工作表現決定請人 而唔係靠一連串面試 僱主可以等到佢哋實習期完畢 先決定請唔請佢哋做長工 
And in some parts of Rajasthan this number is as high as nine out of 10 girls being unaware of it. ,試用期可以避免 經理誤判受聘嘅人會為公司帶嚟風險 而且仲可以吸引優秀嘅求職者 呢班人最後仲變成公司出色嘅員工！ 
"You'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that I have spoken to, who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they're going to die soon. ",諗下我哋推動咗幾多！ 
Menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections. ,實行呢啲計劃前 多數僱主都無興趣招聘重新工作者 
"But in India, only 12 percent of girls and women have access to hygienic ways of managing their periods. ",但係而家呢啲計劃已經發展到係 好重視重新求職者 而且佢哋要求你嘅覆歷有空白 否則你就申請唔到呢個計劃 
"If you do the math, 88 percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods. ",咁樣見到機構已經唔同咗 標誌住真正嘅改變 因為如果我哋可以解決職場者嘅問題 亦都可以解決其他職業過渡嘅問題 
I was one of them. ,有僱主啱啱同我講 佢有啲經驗豐富嘅人 因為再次實習計劃 返到工作崗位 
"I grew up in a small town called Garhwa, in Jharkhand, where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful. ",所以我會話無理由 唔搞退休人士實習計劃 
"So when I started getting my periods, I began with using rags. ",雖然類型唔同，但係概念一樣 
After every use I would wash and reuse them. ,跟住等我話俾你哋聽 Tracy Shapiro 發生咗咩事 
"But to store them, I would hide and keep it in a dark, damp place so that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating. ",仲記得佢講畀每個認識嘅人 佢有興趣出返嚟做工作 
"Due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse, and I would often get rashes and infections using them. ",就係有一次同同區家長傾計 帶咗 Tracy 一個工作機會 嗰份係財政部門嘅會計工作 
I wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town. ,但只係臨時工 
Another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions that are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods. ,公司同佢講佢可能有機會 轉到更好嘅工作 但唔擔保一定有 
"I think you all must be aware of it, but I'll still list it for the few who don't. ",去到 2011 年秋天 
I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles. ,Tracy 好鍾意佢間公司同埋同事 而且公司離佢屋企只係十分鐘 
I was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed. ,雖然第二間公司開出一份長工協議 但佢決定揀呢次實習嘅機會 並希望一切順利 
"I had to wash my bed sheet after every period, even if it was not stained. ",最後佢超乎公司嘅預期 喺 2012 年頭 公司不但請佢做長工 仲畀 Tracy 做 更有趣味同有挑戰嘅工作 因為公司知道佢應付得到 
I was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance. ,去到 2015 年 Tracy 已經升職 
You'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women. ,公司仲畀錢佢夜晚讀工商管理 
"Ironically, most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family. ",Tracy 佢自己仲請咗 第二個重回工作者為佢做嘢 
"After all, they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms. ",Tracy 開頭嘅臨時工係試用嚟 就好似實習咁 咁最後對 Tracy 同僱主嚟講都係雙贏 
"And in the absence of any intervention, it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation. ",宜家我嘅目標係 向更多僱主推銷呢個實習概念 
"During my years of work in this field, I have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately. ",但係呢段時間 如果你離職後，想出返嚟工作 唔好猶豫向嗰啲 無呢啲實習計劃嘅公司 提議佢哋安排一個咁嘅實習計劃 
"They're not allowed to take baths during periods, and in some households they are even secluded from other family members. ",你可以成為佢哋第一個成功故事 你可以係鼓勵更多人 重回職場嘅最佳例子 
About 85 percent of girls and women in India would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month. ,多謝 
Can you imagine what this does to the self-esteem and self-confidence of a young girl? ,（掌聲） 
"The psychological trauma that this inflicts, affecting her personality, her academic performance and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years? ",
"I religiously followed all these restrictive customs for 13 years, until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin, changed my perception about menstruation forever. ",經期 
"In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design. ",血 
We fell in love with each other and I was at ease discussing periods with him. ,月經 
Tuhin knew little about periods. ,核突 
(Laughter) He was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month. ,秘密 
(Laughter) Yeah. ,遮遮掩掩 
He was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society. ,點解？ 
"In order to help me with my cramps, he would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation. ",呢個係每個女仔同女人 半世人每個月都會經歷嘅 自然生理過程 
"When he shared his findings with me, I realized how little I knew about menstruation myself. ",呢個現象好緊要 因為關乎人類生存同繁殖後代 
And many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths. ,但是我哋覺得呢啲係禁忌 
"That's when we wondered: if we, being so well educated, were so ill-informed about menstruation, there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill-informed, too. ",講呢樣嗰時又尷尬又覺得羞恥 
"To study -- to understand the problem better, I undertook a year-long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it. ",當我嚟咗第一次經期時 有人叫我唔好話俾人聽 連兄弟同爸爸，都唔好講 
"While it is generally believed that menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon, during my research, I found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well. ",無幾耐，當我嘅敎科書講到呢樣嘢 我嘅生物科老師竟然跳過呢個課題 
"And it exists with the educated urban class, also. ",（笑聲） 你知我從中學到乜嘢？ 
"While talking to many parents and teachers, I found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods before they have started getting their menstrual cycle. ",就係學識講呢樣嘢係好羞恥 
And -- but they lacked the proper means themselves. ,對自己嘅身體感到難為情 
"And since it is a taboo, they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it. ",學識點樣唔覺經期嚟咗 咁樣就可以好莊重 
"Girls nowadays get their periods in classes six and seven, but our educational curriculum teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine. ",有研究顯示印度各地方 每十個女孩就有三個 第一次嚟經都唔知道咩係月經 
"And since it is a taboo, teachers still skip the subject altogether. ",拉賈欺坦有啲地方 每十個女仔有多到九個都唔識 
"So school does not teach girls about periods, parents don't talk about it. ",你哋會好出奇 我同好多女仔傾過 佢哋竟然唔知第一次經期就係月經 仲以為係患咗血癌 以為要死 
Where do the girls go? ,經期嘅衛生係 生殖系統感染嘅最主要病因 
Two decades ago and now -- nothing has changed. ,印度淨係得 12％ 婦女 知道點喺經期保持衛生 
I shared these finding with Tuhin and we wondered: What if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own -- something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls? ,如果你計下數 就知有 88％ 婦女經期處理得唔衛生 
"During my research, I was collecting a lot of stories. ",我就係其中一個 
These stories would make girls curious and interested in talking about menstruation in their close circle. ,我係加爾克漢德省加爾赫瓦小城長大 聽到啲人連去買衛生巾 我都覺得好瘀 
That's what we wanted. ,初初我有經期嗰時，我用啲碎布 
We wanted something that would make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it. ,每次用完都會洗乾淨再用過 
We wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods. ,但係收拾嗰時 就要收埋係又黑又濕嘅地方 咁樣就無人知道我月經嚟咗 
"So we decided to create a comic book, where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way. ",由於重覆清洗，碎布已經粗糙 我用咗之後，成日出疹或者感染病 
"To represent girls in their different phases of puberty, we have three characters. ",我用咗足足五年 直到我搬離呢個城市 
"Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet, Jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book and Mira who has already been getting her period. ",經期對我嘅生活帶嚟另外一個問題 就係嗰啲強加於 月經來潮嘅婦女嘅社會限制 
"There is a fourth character, Priya Didi. ",我諗你哋一定好清楚 但我仲係列曬出嚟 講俾唔知嘅人聽 
"Through her, girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management. ",唔准掂同食醃菜 
"While making the book, we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive. ",唔准坐梳化或者屋企人嘅床上 
"During our prototype testing, we found that the girls loved the book. ",每次經期完咗要洗床單 就算床單無汚糟到 
They were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about periods on their own. ,他們認為我唔純潔 禁止我參拜或者掂一啲聖物 
"Parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book, and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it. ",你會發現寺廟出面有牌路牌 禁止正在嚟緊經期嘅婦女進入 
(Laughter) (Applause) The comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo. ,真係諷刺 好多時上咗年紀嘅女人 將咁樣嘅限制對付屋企嘅細路女 
Many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India. ,雖然咁樣，佢哋大個咗之後 將限制當作常規 
And one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in Ladakh. ,由於冇人阻止 呢啲鬼話同誤解一代一代咁傳落去 
"We made the final version of the book, called ""Menstrupedia Comic"" and launched in September last year. ",我係呢個領域工作嗰時 曾經聽過有啲傳說 話嚟咗經期嘅女仔 要分開洗自己用過嘅碗碟 
"And so far, more than 4,000 girls have been educated by using the book in India and -- (Applause) Thank you. ",又唔准冲涼 有啲家庭甚至將佢哋同屋企人隔離 
(Applause) And 10 different countries. ,大約有 85％ 印度婦女喺月經來潮時 要遵守一個或以上嘅風俗規限 
We are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with local organizations to make this book available in different countries. ,你想像得到咁樣對女仔嘅自尊同自信 有乜嘢影響？ 
15 schools in different parts of India have made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about menstruation. ,佢哋遭受呢啲心理創傷會影響早年成長 包括個性、學業成績 同長大期間嘅每個環節 
"(Applause) I am amazed to see how volunteers, individuals, parents, teachers, school principals, have come together and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities, have made sure that the girls learn about periods at the right age and helped in breaking this taboo. ",我虔誠遵守呢啲風俗約束已經 13 年 直到我跟自己嘅伴侶 Tuhin 討論過 至永遠改變對月經嘅睇法 
"I dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse, not a disease, but a welcoming change in a girl's life. ",2009年，我同佢攻讀設計學研究 
And I would -- (Applause) And I would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here. ,我哋共墮愛河 我好輕鬆同佢討論月經的事情 
"Dear parents, if you would be ashamed of periods, your daughters would be, too. ",佢知道少少 
So please be period positive. ,（笑聲） 佢對於我哋每月都出血 同腹部絞痛，感到驚訝 
(Laughter) Thank you. ,（笑聲） 係囉 
(Applause) ,佢好震驚 知道呢啲加喺經期婦女嘅規限 居然係嚟自自己社會同屋企人 
,佢為咗幫我解決腹絞痛嘅問題 佢上網學習更多月經知識 
"As a conceptual artist, I'm constantly looking for creative ways to spark challenging conversations. ",當佢俾我睇佢搵到嘅資料時 我先至發覺自己對月經嘅認識好皮毛 
"I do this though painting, sculpture, video and performance. ",好多我哋嘅傳統睇法其實都係鬼話 
"But regardless of the format, two of my favorite materials are history and dialogue. ",我哋於是諗： 如果我哋接受咗高等敎育 對月經都有誤解 咁樣嗰啲數以百萬嘅女仔都會一樣 
"In 2007, I created ""Lotus,"" a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter, 600-pound glass depiction of a lotus blossom. ",為咗加深了解呢個問題 我入讀咗一年碩士課程 研究人民對月經缺乏認識 同埋背後嘅原因 
"In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol for transcendence and for purity of mind and spirit. ",通常啲人相信 鄉村嘅地方至會有呢啲現象 但我硏究期間 發現原來市區都係一樣 
But a closer look at this lotus reveals each petal to be the cross-section of a slave ship. ,而且出現喺受過教育嘅階層 
This iconic diagram was taken from a British slaving manual and later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery. ,我同過好多家長、老師傾過 發現佢地多數都想喺女仔月經開始前 敎佢哋月經嘅知識 
"In America, we don't like to talk about slavery, nor do we look at it as a global industry. ",唔⋯ 但係家長同敎師都冇啱嘅方法 
"But by using this Buddhist symbol, I hope to universalize and transcend the history and trauma of black America and encourage discussions about our shared past. ",因為月經係社會禁忌 佢哋講呢樣嘢嘅時候 覺得拘謹同好羞恥 
"To create ""Lotus,"" we carved over 6,000 figures. ",而家嘅女仔六、七年班開始有經期 但我哋嘅教育課程到八、九年班先教 
"And this later led to a commission by the City of New York to create a 28-foot version in steel as a permanent installation at the Eagle Academy for Young Men, a school for black and latino students, the two groups most affected by this history. ",由於呢啲係禁忌 教師仍然跳過呢個課題 
"The same two groups are very affected by a more recent phenomenon, but let me digress. ",於是學校唔講 父母唔講 
I've been collecting wooden African figures from tourist shops and flea markets around the world. ,咁啲女仔點算？ 
"The authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable, but people believe these to be imbued with power, or even magic. ",由廿年前至到宜家 無嘢改過 
Only recently have I figured out how to use this in my own work. ,我將自己嘅發現話俾 Tuhin 聽 我哋於是諗，不如我哋諗啲嘢 幫啲女仔自己去了解月經 又幫啲家長同老師 舒服咁同啲女仔講下經期呢？ 
"(Gun shots) Since 2012, the world has witnessed the killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice and literally countless other unarmed black citizens at the hands of the police, who frequently walk away with no punishment at all. ",我做硏究期間 收集好多關於 女仔月經來潮經歷嘅故仔 
"In consideration of these victims and the several times that even I, a law-abiding, Ivy League professor, have been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police. ",呢啲故仔會令到女仔好奇同有意 喺自己嘅小圈子講呢樣嘢 
"I created this body of work simply entitled ""BAM."" ",呢個就係我哋嘅目的 
"It was important to erase the identity of each of these figures, to make them all look the same and easier to disregard. ",我哋想有啲嘢令到女仔好奇 然後令佢哋走去了解月經 
"To do this, I dip them in a thick, brown wax before taking them to a shooting range where I re-sculpted them using bullets. ",我哋想用呢啲故事去敎佢哋 
"And it was fun, playing with big guns and high-speed video cameras. ",於是決定創作一本漫畫書 書中嘅卡通人物會扮演呢啲故事 用有趣同搞笑的方法敎識佢哋 
"But my reverence for these figures kept me from actually pulling the trigger, somehow feeling as if I would be shooting myself. ",我哋有三個人物 代表女仔青春期嘅唔同階段 
"Finally, my cameraman, Raul, fired the shots. ",Pinki 還未有經期嚟 Jiya 剛剛經期嚟到 Mira 已經嚟過經期 
"I then took the fragments of these and created molds, and cast them first in wax, and finally in bronze like the image you see here, which bears the marks of its violent creation like battle wounds or scars. ",第四個人物係 Priya Didi 
"When I showed this work recently in Miami, a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul. ",因為佢，啲女仔知道成長嘅各種嘢 同點樣保持經期衛生 
But she also felt that these artworks memorialized the victims of these killings as well as other victims of racial violence throughout US history. ,我哋好有心機創作呢本書 漫畫插圖唔會惹人反感 但文化題材有啲敏感 
"But ""Lotus"" and ""BAM"" are larger than just US history. ",我哋做樣本測試時 發現啲女仔好鍾意本書 
"While showing in Berlin last year, a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings. ",佢哋好想睇呢本書 等自己知道多啲經期嘅知識 
I showed him a photo of a lynching postcard from the early 1900s and reminded him that these killings have been going on for over 500 years. ,家長同老師可以好輕鬆咁利用呢本書 同啲細路女討論經期 有時連男仔都有興趣睇下呢本書 
But it's only through questions like his and more thoughtful dialogue about history and race can we evolve as individuals and society. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 呢本漫畫書營做咗一個環境 令月經唔再係禁忌 
I hope my artwork creates a safe space for this type of honest exchange and an opportunity for people to engage one another in real and necessary conversation. ,好多義工帶呢本樣本書 去印度五個地方敎啲女仔 仲舉行埋認識經期嘅工作坊 
Thank you. ,有一個義工帶咗本書去教年輕僧人 仲帶本書到去 Ladakh 嘅修道院 
(Applause) ,我哋訂咗書最後嘅版本 叫做 Menstrupedia Comic 而且喺舊年九月發行 
,到目前為止 已經有多過四千個印度 同其他十個國家嘅女仔讀過本書 （掌聲） 多謝 
"By raising your hand, how many of you know at least one person on the screen? ",（掌聲） 好多女仔讀過本書 
"Wow, it's almost a full house. ",我哋一直將本書翻譯成唔同語言 仲同本地機構合作 等呢本書係唔同國家都見到 
"It's true, they are very famous in their fields. ",15 間嚟自印度唔同地方嘅學校 已經將呢本書加入學校嘅課程 敎女仔月經嘅知識 
They all died of pancreatic cancer. ,（掌聲） 我好驚訝見到義工、父母、老師 校長同其他人走埋一齊 已經將呢種認知帶到自己嘅社區 令到啲女仔係適當嘅年齡了解經期 幫助打破經期嘅禁忌 
"However, although it's very, very sad this news, it's also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be. ",我夢想將來月經唔會係一種咀咒 亦唔係一種病 而係女仔歡迎嘅人生改變 
"It's become the third cause of cancer deaths, and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years. ",我仲會.... （掌聲） 結束今日嘅演講之前 我想向在座嘅所有父母有一個小要求 
"That's a very tiny number, especially if you compare it with breast cancer, where the survival rate is almost 90 percent. ",各位爸爸媽媽 如果你對經期覺得羞恥 咁你哋個女都會一樣 
So it doesn't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death sentence. ,請你哋對經期抱著積極的態度 
"What's shocking, though, is that in the last 40 years, this number hasn't changed a bit, while much more progress has been made with other types of tumors. ",（笑聲） 多謝 
So how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective? ,（掌聲） 
"As a biomedical entrepreneur, I like to work on problems that seem impossible, understanding their limitations and trying to find new, innovative solutions that can change their outcome. ",
"The first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly, literally. ",作為一個概念派藝術家 我一直搵緊創意嘅方式 去引起激烈嘅對話 
It's depicted in orange on the screen. ,於是我通過畫畫、雕塑、視頻 同表演完成呢件事 
But you can barely see it until I remove all the other organs in front. ,但唔計形式 我最鍾意嘅兩種材料係歷史同對話 
"It's also surrounded by many other vital organs, like the liver, the stomach, the bile duct. ",2007 年，我創作咗「蓮」 一個直徑七呎半 重 600 磅嘅玻璃蓮花 
And the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs is the reason why pancreatic cancer is one of the most painful tumor types. ,喺佛教裡邊，蓮花係超脫 同內心純潔嘅象徵 
"The hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor from surgically removing it, as is routinely done for breast cancer, for example. ",但係我哋行進啲睇呢朵蓮花 就會發現每個花瓣都係一艘 運奴船嘅切面 
So all of these reasons leave chemotherapy as the only option for the pancreatic cancer patient. ,敢諷刺嘅畫面黎自一本英國奴隸手冊 佢之後仲俾廢奴主義者拎黎 做證明奴隸主暴行嘅證據 
This brings us to the second piece of bad news. ,喺美國，我哋唔鍾意講關於奴隸嘅嘢 我哋亦都唔鍾意將佢睇成係 一個全球性嘅產業 
Pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels. ,但係通過呢個佛教嘅標誌 我希望等更加多嘅人 知道美國黑人呢段歷史同創傷 再激發關於我哋歷史嘅討論 
Why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor? ,為咗創作「蓮」，我雕咗六千幾幅人仔 
Let's think for a second how chemotherapy works. ,呢幅作品之後，等紐約嘅一個委員會 用鐵再整咗個二十八呎大嘅版本 作為老鷹男子學校嘅永久雕塑 佢係一間專門俾黑人同拉丁裔 即係受呢段歷史影響最大嘅 兩個種族嘅學校 
The drug is injected in the vein and it navigates throughout the body until it reaches the tumor site. ,呢兩個種族宜家俾一個 正在發生嘅現象影響緊 但係先等我講下其他嘢 
"It's like driving on a highway, trying to reach a destination. ",我一直收藏緊非洲嘅木雕 從旅遊商店又好，從世界 各地嘅舊貨市場又好 
But what if your destination doesn't have an exit on the highway? ,好多人拗緊佢哋係咪堅嘢 同埋佢哋嘅起源 但係啲人相信佢哋充滿咗力量 甚至係魔法 
You will never get there. ,呢排我先知我要點將呢啲 用系我嘅作品裡面 
And that's exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer. ,（槍聲） 從 2012 年開始，美國就發生咗 特雷沃馬丁事件 米高布朗、艾力加納、 山島布蘭德、蒂米爾萊斯事件 同埋真係數唔清嘅 謀攻擊力嘅黑人公民俾警察誤傷嘅事件 但係呢啲警察經常唔會受到任何懲罰 
The drugs navigate throughout all of your body. ,諗到呢啲受害者 同埋好幾次我 呢個守法嘅常春藤教授 都好幾次俾警察盤問過、同用支槍指住 
"They will reach healthy organs, resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall, but very little will go to the tumor. ",所以我創造咗呢套叫做「BAM」嘅作品 
"Therefore, the efficacy is very limited. ",重要嘅係要抹走每個人仔嘅特徵 等佢哋都睇起來一樣，唔容易俾人拎清 
"To me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment to target a specific organ. ",所以我將佢哋擺起好濃嘅棕色嘅臘裡邊 再將佢哋攞去靶場 用子彈打佢哋黎重新造型 
"However, in the last 40 years, a lot of money, research and effort have gone towards finding new, powerful drugs to treat pancreatic cancer, but nothing has been done in changing the way we deliver them to the patient. ",敢樣 用槍同高速攝像頭創作，其實好好玩嘅 
"So after two pieces of bad news, I'm going to give you good news, hopefully. ",但係我對呢啲人仔嘅尊敬 等我唔敢真係開槍 因為我有時覺得我系度打緊自己 
"With a collaborator at MIT and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer by making localized drug delivery a reality. ",最後係我嘅攝像師 Raul 開嘅槍 
"We are basically parachuting you on top of your destination, avoiding your having to drive all around the highway. ",我再攞果啲碎片去做模 先用臘整出初稿 最後用銅整出定稿 就好似你哋宜家睇島嘅 帶住受過暴力對待嘅痕跡 就好似戰鬥過嘅傷口或者疤痕 
We have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one. ,我嘅作品呢排喺邁阿密展出 有個女人同我講佢覺得 每一槍都打系佢嘅心口 
"They are flexible enough that they can be folded to fit into the catheter, so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery. ",但係姖又覺得呢啲作品 紀念緊各種事件中喪生嘅受害者 同埋美國歷史裡頭受過 種族暴力嘅其他受害者 
"But they are solid enough that once they are positioned on top of the tumor, they will act as a cage. ",但係「蓮」同「BAM」反映嘅 唔止係美國歷史 
"They will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs, controlling the metastasis. ",舊年喺柏林展出嗰陣 一個哲學系嘅學生問我 係咩嘢激發最近嘅事件 
The devices are also biodegradable. ,我俾佢睇咗一張 20 世紀早期對黑人 執行死刑嘅明信片 再提醒佢，呢啲殺戮已經 進行咗五百幾年 
"That means that once in the body, they start dissolving, delivering the drug only locally, slowly and more effectively than what is done with the current whole-body treatment. ",但係淨得通過好似佢呢啲問題 同埋更加多深入嘅 關於歷史同種族嘅討論 我哋先可以進化為真正嘅個人同社會 
"In pre-clinical study, we have demonstrated that this localized approach is able to improve by 12 times the response to treatment. ",我希望我嘅作品可以 為咁樣嘅坦承交流創造一個安全嘅空間 為大家互相進行真實必要嘅對話 提供一個機會 
"So we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it's needed the most, we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful, reducing the systemic toxic effect. ",多謝 
We are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level. ,（掌聲） 
We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval for clinical trials. ,
"Currently, the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer. ",在座各位識得至少一個屏幕上面嘅人 請舉手 
"We are hoping that one day, we can reduce their pain, extend their life and potentially make pancreatic cancer a curable disease. ",哇，基本上每個人都舉咗 
"By rethinking the way we deliver the drug, we don't only make it more powerful and less toxic, we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions for almost all other impossible problems in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond. ",佢哋喺自己嘅領域都好出名 你哋知唔知佢哋有咩共同點？ 
Thank you very much. ,佢哋都係死於胰腺癌 
(Applause) ,雖然係一件好唔好嘅事 但係都要多謝人哋報導佢哋嘅故仔 畀我哋注意到胰腺癌可以有幾致命 
,胰臟癌排喺癌症死因嘅第三位 只有百分之八嘅病人有超過五年夀命 
So this is James Risen. ,相比乳癌生存率接近百分之九十 呢個係一個好細嘅數字 
You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times. ,所以當病人畀醫生診斷爲胰腺癌之後 病人一啲都唔感到意外 因為差唔多畀人判咗死刑 
"Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name, Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans. ",得人驚嘅係過去四十年 呢個數字冇咩嘢變化 但係其他腫瘤嘅治療 已經有好大嘅進展 
But it's another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact. ,所以我哋點樣更有效咁治療胰腺癌？ 
"In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to Iran. ",身為一個生物醫學嘅企業家 我鍾意解決嗰啲好似解決唔到嘅問題 通過了解佢哋嘅局限 嘗試搵出創新嘅方法，改寫個結局 
"If that sounds crazy, go read it. ",第一件關於胰腺癌嘅壞消息 就係你嘅胰腺直情喺你腹部中間 
It's an incredible story. ,它喺屏幕上嘅橙色位置 
But you know who didn't like that chapter? ,但係你幾乎睇唔到佢 除非我將前面其他器官拎走 
The US government. ,但佢又畀好多重要嘅器官包圍住 例如肝、胃、膽管 
"For nearly a decade afterwards, Risen was the subject of a US government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources. ",而且腫瘤可以生係呢啲器官 所以點解胰腺癌係 病人其中一個最痛苦嘅腫瘤 
"And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists. ",佢嘅位置難以接近 亦令醫生好難用手術移除佢 醫生成日為其他 好似乳癌咁嘅腫瘤做手術 
"You see, under the First Amendment, the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest. ",因為呢啲原因 胰腺癌病人只可以揀化療 
But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them. ,跟住講第二個壞消息 
"So when the government came knocking, Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him: he refused and said he'd rather go to jail. ",胰腺癌腫瘤有好少血管 
"So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison. ",點解我哋要關心一個腫瘤嘅血管？ 
"That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened. ",等我哋嚟諗下化療係點樣做嘢嘅 
"Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case, the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether. ",藥物被注射入靜脈之後 藥物流過我哋嘅身體直至去到腫瘤嗰度 
"It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance, there are very few places reporters and sources can hide. ",好似喺高速公路開車，努力駛去目的地 
"And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify, they could have his digital trail testify against him instead. ",但係如果公路冇出口去你嘅目的地呢？ 
"So completely in secret and without his consent, prosecutors got Risen's phone records. ",你永遠都去唔到 
"They got his email records, his financial and banking information, his credit reports, even travel records with a list of flights he had taken. ",醫生處理化療同胰腺癌 就正正面對相同嘅問題 
"And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower. ",藥物流過你嘅身體 
"Sadly, this is only one case of many. ",佢哋會到達一啲健康嘅器官 令病人整體上出現高度中毒反應 但係藥物好少會去到腫瘤嗰度 
"President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers, and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined. ",所以療效好有限 
"Now, you can see how this could be a problem, especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret. ",我覺得為咗一個器官而要全身治療 好似違反常理咁 
"Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist. ",但係過去嘅四十年 我哋洗咗好多錢、做研究 同努力咁去搵 新嘅、強效嘅藥物去醫胰腺癌 但我哋將藥物 送入病人身體嘅方法冇改過 
So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the First Amendment is supposed to protect because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone. ,聽咗兩個壞消息之後 我會話你知好消息 
"But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent reporters' rights, the press can also use technology to protect their sources even better than before. ",我哋同麻省理工大學 同埋波士頓嘅麻省總醫院合作 徹底改變治療癌症嘅方法 實現藥物局部輸送 
"And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them, rather than on the witness stand after the fact. ",我哋基本上將你空降到你要嘅目的地 而唔使你行成條高速公路 
"Communications software now exists that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book, and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls. ",我哋將藥物注入咗類似呢啲裝置入面 
"For example, one such tool is SecureDrop, an open-source whistleblower submission system that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz, and is now developed at the non-profit where I work, Freedom of the Press Foundation. ",佢哋靈活到可以摺疊 適合伸入導管裡面 所以醫生可以直接將裝置 植入到腫瘤上面 然後做最輕微嘅入侵性手術 
"Instead of sending an email, you go to a news organization's website, like this one here on The Washington Post. ",但係佢哋一旦畀人植入腫瘤上面 就會好堅固，而且會好似雀籠咁 
"From there, you can upload a document or send information much like you would on any other contact form. ",其實佢哋生理上 係防止腫瘤入侵其他器官 控制腫瘤轉移 
It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the news organization has access to. ,呢啲裝置仲係生物分解 
"So the government can no longer secretly demand the information, and much of the information they would demand wouldn't be available in the first place. ",即是佢哋一旦擺喺身體入面 佢哋就會開始被分解 比起現時全身治療 藥物更加局部、慢慢、有效咁輸送 
"SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century. ",我哋喺臨牀前嘅研究已經證實 呢個局部性方式 有效提高治療效果十二倍 
"Unfortunately, governments all over the world are constantly developing new spying techniques that put us all at risk. ",所以我哋用一隻已知嘅藥物 只係將佢放係最需要佢嘅地方 我哋有咗十二倍嘅療效 仲減少身體中毒反應 
"And it's up to us going forward to make sure that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers, like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing. ",我哋好努力咁將呢項技術 帶入下一階段 
"It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower alerting us to overcrowded hospitals, or the next environmental worker sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water, or a Wall Street insider warning us of the next financial crisis. ",我哋就嚟做完臨牀前試驗同動物試驗 做咗呢兩個先可以向美國藥物管理局 申請做臨牀試驗 
"After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women who expose crimes, but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution. ",宜家大多數胰腺癌病人都冇得醫 
Thank you. ,我哋希望將來有一日 可以減輕佢哋嘅痛苦，延長佢哋嘅生命 而且希望胰腺癌 將來變成可以亦醫返好嘅病 
(Applause) ,我哋因為反思輸送藥物嘅方式 我哋唔單止令治療更有效同少啲毒性 仲同時為胰腺癌同其他癌症 幾乎所有唔可能解決嘅問題 打開通往創新療法嘅大門 
,多謝大家 
I consider it my life's mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work. ,（掌聲） 
"I've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt, and south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas. ",
"Most recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland and the low-lying islands of the Maldives, connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet. ",呢個係 James Risen 
"My drawings explore moments of transition, turbulence and tranquility in the landscape, allowing viewers to emotionally connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit. ",佢係紐約時報嘅記者 佢榮獲普立茲獎而為人熟悉 
I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation. ,喺大家仲未聽過 斯諾登呢個名字之前 James Risen 因為寫咗本 揭露美國國家安全局 非法竊聽美國民衆通話嘅書 
"If you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes, perhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them. ",而備受矚目 但本書嘅另一章 可能有更加深遠嘅影響 
Behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else. ,裏邊佢描述咗美國情報部門 一次慘烈後果嘅行動 上面講咗中情局將核彈嘅設計圖 交咗畀伊朗 
And studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report. ,如果你覺得太瘋狂，你可以去讀下 
Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers as early as 2020. ,內裏真係難以置信 
And sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet by century's end. ,你估咩人會唔鍾意嗰一章？ 
"I have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium, one that moves us in a way that statistics may not. ",美國政府 
My process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change. ,差唔多往後嗰十年 James 都係美國政府調查嘅對象 調查嘅官員亦會要求佢 指證佢聲稱嘅消息來源 
"On-site, I take thousands of photographs. ",佢變成咗美國政府 最近一系列起訴泄密者 同監察記者行動嘅代表人物 
"Back in the studio, I work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs to create very large-scale compositions, sometimes over 10 feet wide. ",喺第一修正案之下，為咗公眾利益 新聞界有權報道各種秘密消息 
"I draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors. ",但係如果媒體冇辦法收集消息 冇辦法保護呢班無畏無懼嘅線人 就冇辦法行使呢個嘅權利 
I consider my work drawings but others call them painting. ,所以當政府人員搵上門 James 好似以前好多嘅記者咁 佢拒絕提供任何消息 佢寧願坐監 
"I cringe, though, when I'm referred to as a ""finger painter."" ",2007 年至到 2015 年 James 响監視下 開始佢喺聯邦監獄嘅生活 
(Laughter) But I don't use any tools and I have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the pigment on the paper. ,就喺審判前幾日，有樣奇怪事發生咗 
Drawing is a form of meditation for me. ,政府喺堅持 James 係 本案關鍵嘅幾年之後 政府突然放棄咗對 James 嘅所有要求 
It quiets my mind. ,喺電子監控年代 記者同線人根本冇地方匿 
I don't perceive what I'm drawing as ice or water. ,與其一次又一次被 James 拒絕舉證 政府可以用佢嘅電子記錄 嚟指證 Jeffrey Sterling 
"Instead, the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape. ",於是喺完全機密而且未經同意嘅情況下 控方攞到 James 嘅電話紀錄 
"Once the piece is complete, I can finally experience the composition as a whole, as an iceberg floating through glassy water, or a wave cresting with foam. ",郵箱紀錄、理財同銀行資料、信用報告 甚至佢坐過嘅航班紀錄 
"On average, a piece this size takes me about, as you can see, 10 seconds. ",控方喺呢啲紀綠當中搵到證據 起訴 Jeffrey Sterling Jeffrey 就係 James 聲稱嘅消息來源 同埋中情局嘅泄密者 
"(Laughter) (Applause) Really, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size. ",好遺憾，呢一類嘅事成千上萬 
"But I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, really. ",奧巴馬總統應承過保護泄密者 但係相反 佢嘅司法部門拉嘅告密者 比其他部門加起嚟仲多 
"My mom was an artist, and growing up, we always had art supplies all over the house. ",所以依個係好大嘅問題 尤其當政府對佢哋嘅祕密咁敏感嘅時候 
"My mother's love of photography propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth, and my family and I were fortunate enough to join and support her on these adventures. ",9.11 之後，基本上所有 關於國家安全嘅重大新聞 都係由告密者提供畀記者嘅 
We rode camels in Northern Africa and mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole. ,正因爲政府監視住所有人 新聞界好難行使 第一修正案賦予佢哋嘅權利 
"In August of 2012, I led my first expedition, taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland. ",不過正如科技幫政府 監視記者嘅一舉一動 新聞界都可以 以其人之道還治其人之身 利用科技保護佢哋嘅線人 
My mother was originally supposed to lead this trip. ,保護仲可以從第一次對話就已經開始 而唔使喺佢哋被審嘅時候先嚟保護 
"She and I were in the early stages of planning, as we had intended to go together, when she fell victim to a brain tumor. ",宜家好多通訊軟件 喺 James 出書嘅時候冇嘅 而且反監視能力 比一般電郵同電話好好多 
"The cancer quickly took over her body and mind, and she passed away six months later. ",例如有一款叫 SecureDrop 嘅軟件 依個係一款開放原始碼嘅告密系統 由亞倫 · 斯沃茨 一位過咗身嘅互聯網大師開發嘅 喺我做嘢嘅地方，新聞自由基金會 繼續開發緊 
"During the months of her illness, though, her dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise to carry out her final journey. ",與其傳送電郵 你可以去某個新聞機構嘅網站 譬如依度華盛頓郵報 
"My mother's passion for the Arctic echoed through my experience in Greenland, and I felt the power and the fragility of the landscape. ",喺依度你可以上載檔案或者傳送訊息 就好似其他網上嘅聯絡表格咁 
The sheer size of the icebergs is humbling. ,資料會被加密喺伺服器入面 得新聞機構嘅人可以睇 
The ice fields are alive with movement and sound in a way that I never expected. ,所以政府冇得再祕密追蹤依啲信息 就算追蹤到 都好大機會唔會係一手資料 
I expanded the scale of my compositions to give you that same sense of awe that I experienced. ,SecureDrop 只係 21 世紀 保護新聞自由嘅一個小小工具 
"Yet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident, so, too, is its vulnerability. ",不過世界各地嘅政府 時時刻刻都開發新嘅監視技術 令我哋更加危險 
"From our boat, I could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun. ",所以我哋只能夠繼續努力 唔單止保護善於科技嘅告密者 好似斯諾登咁 有自己嘅渠道揭發政府惡行 
We had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland that now face huge challenges. ,仲要保護嗰啲 透過揭發退伍老兵醫療問題 提醒我哋醫院擠迫問題嘅告密者 保護嗰啲帶出費林特市污水 隱患嘅環衛工人 保護警惕我哋 下次金融危機來臨嘅華爾街中人 
The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no longer freezing over as they once did. ,所以，依啲工具唔係爲咗 保護敢於揭發罪行嘅線人 而係爲咗保障憲法下 所有人得到應有嘅權利 
"And without ice, their hunting and harvesting grounds are severely diminished, threatening their way of life and survival. ",多謝 
"The melting glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels, which have already begun to drown some of our world's lowest-lying islands. ",（掌聲） 
"One year after my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives, the lowest and flattest country in the entire world. ",
"While I was there, I collected images and inspiration for a new body of work: drawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this century. ",我將一件事當成我一生嘅使命 就係用我作品傳達氣候變化嘅急切性 
Devastating events happen every day on scales both global and personal. ,我去北極 搜集一啲不為人知 關於北極融化嘅故事 又去赤道記錄 因融化而升咗嘅海平面 
"When I was in Greenland, I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice. ",最近，我走訪格陵蘭嘅結冰海岸 以及馬爾代夫嘅低窪島嶼 連起兩個看似毫不相關 但同樣喺我哋地球瀕臨消失嘅地方 
"Now she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much, even as it, too, passes and takes on new form. ",我嘅畫探索風景嘅轉變、狂風怒號 以及安寧 令觀眾同呢個或者成世都唔會去嘅地方 產生情感上嘅接觸 
"Among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive, rather than the negative. ",我選擇要傳達美感，而唔係破壞 
My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose. ,如果你能夠體會到呢啲景色嘅美 或者你會受啟發去保護佢哋 
"I hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux, documenting the transition and inspiring our global community to take action for the future. ",行為心理學話 我哋採取行動或者做決定 係以情感行先 
Thank you. ,研究顯示 藝術比一則恐怖嘅新聞 更有效影響我哋情緒 
(Applause) ,專家預測北極 最快 2020 年出現無冰嘅夏天 
,海平面會喺世紀末上漲二至十呎 
"Have you ever been asked by your Chinese friend, ""What is your zodiac sign?"" ",我成個職業生涯 就喺度用一個大家接觸得到嘅媒介 提醒人呢啲預測 同統計唔同，個媒介可以觸動到人 
Don't think they are making small talk. ,我開始嘅時候 去一啲首當其衝 氣候變化問題嘅地方旅行 
"If you say, ""I'm a Monkey,"" they immediately know you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old. ",喺嗰啲地方，我影咗幾千張相 
(Laughter) Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age. ,返到工作室之後 我利用我回憶裏面嘅經歷同埋相片 整咗好大規模嘅作品 有時會超過十呎闊 
"By revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated. ",我用似碳一樣硬、但有顏色嘅 軟粉彩畫畫 
"Judgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune, your personality, career prospects and how you will do in a given year. ",對於我嘅畫，我認為只係圖畫 但其他人就覺得係畫作 
"If you share you and your partner's animal signs, they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life. ",但當人哋話我係「手指畫家」 我就唔敢當 
Maybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac. ,（笑聲） 但我唔用工具 我成日用手指同手掌 去調啱紙上面嘅顏料 
"As a quarter of the world population is influenced by it, you'd be wise to do something about that. ",對我嚟說，畫畫係冥想嘅一種形式 
"So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly? ",令我思緒安靜落黎 
"Most Westerners think of Greco-Roman zodiac, the signs divided into 12 months. ",我唔認為我畫嘅係冰或者水 
The Chinese zodiac is different. ,相反，圖像會還原返做 最基本嘅顏色同形狀 
"It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals, starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig, and has no association with constellations. ",當作品完成時 我就可以睇到一幅完整嘅作品 睇到一座冰山浮於玻璃般嘅水面 或者夾雜泡沫嘅海浪 
"For example, if you were born in 1975, you are a Rabbit. ",平均嚟講，一幅咁大嘅作品花我 好似你睇到咁，10 秒 
Can you see your zodiac sign there? ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 認真，呢種尺寸大概花我 200 至 250 個鐘 
"Our Chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework based on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals. ",但我從我拎得起蠟筆開始 我就一路畫梗畫 
"Over thousands of years, this popular culture has affected people's major decisions, such as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other. ",我媽媽係藝術家 喺我成長裏面 我哋總係成屋擺滿美術用品 
And some of the implications are quite amazing. ,我母親對攝影鍾意到 要去地球最偏遠嘅地區 我同我家人非常好彩 能夠支持同同佢一齊參加呢啲冒險 
The Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others. ,我哋喺北非騎駱駝 又喺近北極嘅地方駕狗拉嘅雪橇 
"So parents choose specific years to give birth to babies, because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families. ",2012 年 8 月，我第一次帶人 帶住一班藝術家同學者 去格陵蘭西北嘅海岸 
We even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations. ,呢次行程原本由我母親帶 
"I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits. ",行程計劃嘅初期，佢同我都喺個團度 我哋仲打算一齊去 但佢患上咗腦瘤 
Chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies. ,癌症迅速擴散，影響到佢嘅身體同個腦 半年後佢就去世 
"As a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake. ",不過，喺佢病緊嘅幾個月裡面 佢為遠征隊所付出嘅從來無動搖過 我亦承諾要幫佢完成最後一程 
Raise your hand if you are a Snake. ,我母親對北極嘅熱情 喺格陵蘭嘅經驗裏面不斷重現 我感受到風景嘅脆弱同力量 
Let's have a chat later. ,以及冰山規模之大點樣震撼人心 
"(Laughter) We believe some animals are luckier than the others, such as the Dragon. ",冰原有生命 佢會移動同發出聲音 係我從來無想像過嘅 
"Unlike the Western tradition, the Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth. ",我之後擴大我嘅創作規模 令你哋都可以感受我經過嘅震撼 
It's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby. ,雖然冰高貴嘅特質顯而易見 但同時冰好脆弱 
Jack Ma's parents must have been very proud. ,喺船上面 我見到冰喺異常溫暖嘅陽光下出汗 
And they are not the only ones. ,我哋睇到格陵蘭島好多因紐特人嘅社區 正面臨著巨大嘅挑戰 
"In 2012, the Year of the Dragon, the birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan increased by five percent. ",當地人同我講大範圍嘅海冰 已經唔再好似以前咁結冰 
That means another one million more babies. ,冇咗冰，獵物或者農作物收成 都大大減少 威脅住啲人嘅生活同生存空間 
"With a traditional preference to baby boys, the boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100. ",格陵蘭島融化梗嘅冰川 係其中一個大因素令海平面上升 海平面上升已經開始淹沒 世界上面一啲地勢低嘅島嶼 
"When those Dragon boys grow up, they will face much more severe competition in love and job markets. ",我去完格陵蘭島一年之後 我去咗馬爾代夫 一個世界上最低同最平坦嘅國家 
"According to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release, January 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections. ",我喺嗰度為我嘅新作品收集圖片同靈感 作品講述海浪拍打一個國家嘅海岸 一個可能喺本世紀末被水淹沒嘅國家 
Why? ,傷害性嘅嘢，不論喺全球同個人層面 每日都發生 
That was the last month for the Year of the Horse. ,當我喺格陵蘭島 我將母親嘅骨灰撒喺一片融化嘅冰上面 
"It's not because they like horses so much, it's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies. ",宜家，佢成為咗佢最喜愛嘅 景色嘅一部分 就算景色會變都好 
"(Laughter) If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad. ",喺媽媽畀我嘅咁多份禮物裡面 我最鍾意嘅係媽媽 教識我睇嘢要睇正面 唔好睇負面 
Those are Goat babies. ,而我嘅畫，都會讚頌 我哋大家都會失去嘅美 
They don't look like losers to me. ,我希望我嘅作品可以記錄 變幻中嘅壯美景觀 記錄環境變化 同啟發我哋全世界人為未來採取行動 
"(Laughter) Tiger is another undesirable animal, due to its volatile temperament. ",多謝 
Many Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate during those years. ,（掌聲） 
"Perhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse, as those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition. ",
Maybe they are the lucky ones. ,各位有無試過畀你嘅中國朋友問 「你係乜嘢生肖？」 
"I went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world, and it's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger, are at the top of the chart, even higher than the Dragon. ",唔好以為佢哋同你傾閒計 
"So maybe we should consider, maybe it's much better to have less competition. ",如果你話：「我係屬𤠣。」 佢哋即刻知道 你嘅年齡一定係 24、36、48 或者 60 歲 
One last but interesting point: many Chinese people make their investment decisions based on the zodiac sign index. ,（笑聲） 問人屬乜嘢生肖係問人年齡嘅禮貌方法 
"Although the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign has been over thousands of years, the trend of using it in making major decisions did not really happen until the past few decades. ",你講咗自己嘅生肖，人哋就會幫你算命 
"Our ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought, famine, riot, disease and civil war. ",佢哋算下你會行好運定係唔好運 你嘅性格、事業前程 同你會喺某一年點樣過 
"And finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology to create an ideal life they've always wanted. ",如果你將自己同伴侶嘅生肖話畀人聽 佢哋嘅腦海就有咗你私生活嘅畫面 
"The collective decision made by 1.3 billion people has caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything, from health care and education to property and consumer goods. ",或者你唔信中國生肖運程 
"As China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics, the decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world. ",但佢影響全世界嘅四分一人口 你最好認識下佢比較好 
Are there any Monkeys here? ,到底乜嘢係中國生肖呢？ 
2016 is the Year of the Monkey. ,多數西方人都會諗起希臘羅馬嘅星座 佢哋將星座分為十二個月 
"Monkeys are clever, curious, creative and mischievous. ",中國嘅十二生肖就唔同 
Thank you. ,佢係用動物命名，每十二年一個循環 排頭位嘅係老鼠，最尾嘅係豬 呢啲運程同星座無關 
(Applause) ,例如你係 1975 年出世，咁你屬兔 
,你見唔見嗰度有屬於你嘅生肖？ 
Today 40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy. ,我哋嘅祖先根據陰陽五行同十二生肖 做咗一個好複雜嘅理論架構 
"Too poor to pay their way through college, they now owe lenders more than one trillion US dollars. ",經過幾千年以嚟 呢啲通俗文化已經影響人民做重大決定 譬如改名、結婚、生仔同人際關係 
They do find what jobs they can get to pay off a debt that is secured on their person. ,有時會出現啲出人意表嘅結果 
"In America, even a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance. ",中國人相信有啲生肖比其他生肖匹配 
But it is nearly impossible for an American to get discharged their student loan debts. ,於是夫婦會揀特定嘅年份生仔 因為佢哋相信大家生肖配合 群策群力可以為家族帶來繁榮 
"Once upon a time in America, going to college did not mean graduating with debt. ",我哋搵伴侶都要睇下生肖運程 
My friend Paul's father graduated from Colorado State University on the GI Bill. ,我屬豬，咁同老虎、羊仲有兔都會好夾 
"For his generation, higher education was free or almost free, because it was thought of as a public good. ",中國人相信有啲動物天生相沖 
Not anymore. ,"我屬豬, 所以要小心屬蛇嘅朋友 "
"When Paul also graduated from Colorado State University, he paid for his English degree by working part-time. ",在座邊個係屬蛇嘅，唔該舉舉手 
"30 years ago, higher education tuition was affordable, reasonable, and what debts you accumulated, you paid off by graduation date. ",我哋遲啲傾吓 
Not anymore. ,（笑聲） 我哋相信有啲動物比其他動物好運 譬如龍 
"Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps, but with one difference: when she graduated five years ago, it was with a whopping debt. ",唔似西方嘅傳統習慣 中國嘅龍象徵權力同財富 
Students like Kate have to take on a loan because the cost of higher education has become unaffordable for many if not most American families. ,所以每個人都夢想生個龍仔龍女 
But so what? ,馬雲嘅父母一定為佢覺得驕傲 
Getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it. ,佢哋唔會係唯一孤獨嘅父母 
But that's where the rubber meets the road. ,2012 年係龍年 中國、香港同台灣嘅出生率 增加咗 5% 
Even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013. ,即係代表比平時多咗一百萬有多嘅嬰兒 
So ... ,由於中國傳統偏愛男嬰 男仔同女仔喺呢一年係 120 :100 
"tuition costs up, public funding down, family incomes diminished, personal incomes weak. ",當呢啲龍仔大個之後 喺戀愛同搵工都會競爭得好犀利 
Is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must cannot make their student loan payments? ,根據 BBC 同中國政府嘅新聞發布 2015 年 1 月係剖腹生產手術嘅高峰 
"The worst of times can be the best of times, because certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignore. ",點解？ 
I want to speak of three of them today. ,因為呢個係馬年嘅最後一個月 
1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can buy. ,佢哋唔係特別鍾意馬年 而係唔想生個唔好運嘅羊仔 
"All of us talk about education just as the economists do now, as an investment that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work. ",（笑聲） 如果你屬羊，唔好唔開心 
As an investment you make to sort and classify people so that employers can hire them more easily. ,呢啲人都係羊仔羊女 
The U.S. News &amp; World Report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines. ,佢哋睇嚟都唔似輸家 
The language is peppered with barbarisms. ,（笑聲） 老虎係另一隻唔受歡迎嘅動物 因為老虎性格變幻無常 
"Teachers are called ""service providers,"" students are called ""consumers."" ",好多中國地區喺呢啲生肖年份 都見到出生率急劇下降 
"Sociology and Shakespeare and soccer and science, all of these are ""content."" ",或者我哋應該反過嚟睇 呢啲虎年同羊年嘅嬰兒面對少啲競爭 
Student debt is profitable. ,可能佢哋係幸運兒 
Only not on you. ,我喺福布斯查過世界頭三百個有錢人 發現一件有趣嘅嘢 就係大家最唔想做嘅老虎 同羊呢兩個生肖 竟然名列榜首 甚至高過龍 
Your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry. ,咁樣我哋或者要諗下 面對少啲競爭可能仲好 
The two 800-pound gorillas of which -- Sallie Mae and Navient -- posted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars. ,最後一點但係喺最有趣嘅一點 好多中國人根據生肖運程 嚟做投資決定 
"And just like home mortgages, student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and diced, and sold on Wall Street. ",雖然人民信賴生肖嘅傳統 已經超過幾千年 但係人民利用生肖做重大嘅決定 直到呢幾十年，呢種熱潮先真正出現 
And colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans profit twice. ,以前我哋嘅祖先為咗生計奔波 要抵受貧窮飢荒 乾旱、疾病同內戰暴亂 
"Once from your tuition, and then again from the interest on debt. ",最後中國人多咗時間，財富同科技 去創造自己一直希望嘅理想生活 
"With all that money to be made, are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising, in bait and switch ... ",十三億人集體做嘅決定 已經令到經濟波動，佢哋每樣嘢都需要 由醫療服務，教育到房屋同消費品 
in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate? ,中國喺世界經濟同地緣政治都好重要 佢哋根據生肖同其他中國傳統做決定 最後會影響到全世界每一個人 
Third: diplomas are a brand. ,呢度有無猴年出世嘅人 
"Many years ago my teacher wrote, ""When students are treated as consumers, they're made prisoners of addiction and envy."" ",2016 係猴年 
"Just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone, so also people can be sold more and more education. ",猴子生性聰明、好奇、多計同頑皮 
"College is the new high school, we already say that. ",多謝 
But why stop there? ,（掌聲） 
"People can be upsold on certifications and recertifications, master's degrees, doctoral degrees. ",
Higher education is also marketed as a status object. ,今時今日，有四千萬個美國人 孭住一筆讀書債投身社會 
"Buy a degree, much like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag, to distinguish yourself from others. ",佢哋屋企窮，要借錢讀大學 而家夾埋嘅債務有成一兆美金咁多 
So you can be the object of envy of others. ,呢班畢業生乜嘢工都要試 為求還得清自己筆債 
Diplomas are a brand. ,喺美國 連一個破咗產嘅爛賭二都翻身有望 
But these truths are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch. ,但完全唔使指意 一個畢業生可以還清筆債 
"There is not a day that goes by without some policy guy on television telling us, ""A college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escalator to a middle-class life."" ",以前响美國 讀大學唔等於要負債纍纍咁畢業 
And the usual evidence offered is the college premium: a college grad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad. ,我朋友阿 Paul 佢爸爸喺科羅拉多州立大學畢業 當年有退伍軍人法保障 
"Let's look at that number more carefully, because on the face of it, it seems to belie the stories we all hear about college grads working as baristas and cashiers. ",嗰個年代 大學學費全免，又或者近乎零 因為政府覺得大專學歷對社會有益 
"Of 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education, 45 do not complete it in a timely fashion, for a number of reasons, including financial. ",但好景不常 
"Of the 55 that do graduate, two will remain unemployed, and another 18 are underemployed. ",輪到阿 Paul 喺同一間大學畢業嗰陣 英文系畢業嘅佢，要做住兼職嚟還債 
"So, college grads earn more than high school grads, but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college? ",卅年前 多數人都畀得起大學學費 你爭落嘅錢，畢業之前就可以還晒 
Now even economists admit going to college pays off for only those who complete it. ,但好景不常 
"But that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone, for decades now. ",輪到阿 Paul 個囡同樣步佢後塵 唯一唔同嘅係 五年前佢畢業嗰陣 孭住成身債 
"For decades, workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced. ",阿 Kate 同埋其他大學生都要借錢 因為大學學費經已貴到 好多美國家庭都負擔唔起 
"And had they received as they should have, then going to college would have been a bad investment for many. ",咁又點啫？ 
College premium? ,借筆錢嚟投資一個貴價學位 只要第日還到錢，就唔成問題啦 有大學學歷，起碼有得賺多啲嘛 
I think it's a high school discount. ,但問題嘅癥結就响呢度 
Two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job. ,連一個 2001 年畢業嘅人所賺嘅錢 比起 2013 年畢業嘅 Kate 仲要多出 10% 
"And the future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising -- in fact, it's downright bleak. ",所以… 
And it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt. ,學費飆升 津貼少咗 家庭收入又縮咗水 個人收入微薄 
"And it is they, curiously and sadly, who are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing. ",唔怪得有多過四分一嘅畢業生 連要還債都還唔到 
"That's not just cynical marketing, that's cruel. ",不過，最壞嘅時刻亦係最好嘅時刻 因為啲事實就攞喺响你面前，唔理唔得 
So what do we do? ,今日我想講其中三個事實 
What if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product? ,1.2 兆美金嘅學債 明顯反映咗 大學教育經已淪為一種消費品 
Everybody else seems to. ,我哋講起教育就好似班資本家咁 將教育當係投資，愛嚟增強人力資本 訓練啲人出嚟做嘢 
"Then, like any other consumer product, you would demand to know what you're paying for. ",愛嚟將啲學生按等級分類 等啲僱主請人嗰陣容易啲 
"When you buy medicines, you get a list of side effects. ",《美國新聞與世界報導》 公布大學排名嘅方式 十足啲消費報告評估啲洗衣機咁款 
"When you buy a higher educational product, you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose, make informed choices. ",份報告用詞粗暴到極 
"When you buy a car, it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect. ",叫啲老師做「服務提供者」 叫啲學生做「消費者」 
"Who knows what to expect from a degree say, in Canadian Studies. ",社會學呀，莎士比亞呀 足球同埋科學呀 呢啲冚唪唥叫做「服務內容」 
"There is such a thing, by the way. ",學業借貸好好賺 
What if there was an app for that? ,不過賺嗰個唔會係你 
One that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income. ,你嘅債務甚至養肥咗 成個學生借貸行業 
Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT. ,呢個行頭其中兩條巨龍 Sallie Mae 同埋 Navient 公布上年總盈利一共有 12 億美金 
One of you make this. ,學生貸款正正同樓宇按揭一樣 可以係捆綁式、套餐式同拆件式 响華爾街出售 
(Laughter) Discover your reality. ,啲大專院校 投資呢啲證券貸款嘅時候 頭尾賺兩轉 
"(Laughter) There are three advantages, three benefits to Income-Based Tuition. ",首先賺你筆學費 跟住賺你啲息口 
Any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and major. ,睇見盤生意咁好賺 大家仲會奇怪嗰啲高等教育辦學團體 點解會用啲失實嘅宣傳手段 嚟推銷利誘 
"Such informed users are unlikely to fall victim to the huckster's ploy, to the sales pitch. ",藉教育嚟剝削緊乜都唔知嘅學生嗎？ 
But also to choose wisely. ,第三： 學位經已淪為品牌 
"Why would anybody pay more for college than let's say, 15 percent of the additional income they earn? ",當年我有個老師寫話： 「當學生變成一班消費者， 佢哋就會喺度盲追學位，鬥生鬥死。」 
There's a second benefit to Income-Based Tuition. ,正如蘋果不斷向人推銷新款 iPhone 做教育嘅亦可以不斷向人推銷學位 
"By tying the cost to the income, college administrators would be forced to manage costs better, to find innovative ways to do so. ",昨日嘅中學，變成今日嘅大學 一早有人咁講過 
"For instance, all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major. ",但點解要停喺呢一步？ 
"That is manifestly unfair, and should change. ",大學可以不斷招攬人讀文憑，讀完再讀 再讀碩士學位、博士學位 
An engineering student uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student. ,佢哋仲推銷專上教育係地位嘅象徵 
"But the philosophy student, as a consequence, is subsidizing the engineering student. ",買學位 同你買架凌志、買個 LV 一樣 係買嚟抬高身價 
"Who then, by the way, goes on and earns more money. ",靠佢，你可以招人妒忌 
"Why should two people buy the same product, pay the same, but one person receive half or a third of the service. ",學位已經淪為品牌 
"In fact, college grads, some majors, pay 25 percent of their income servicing their student debt, while others pay five percent. ",但係呢啲真相成日畀一片叫賣聲掩埋 
That kind if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly. ,日日硬係有班政客 喺個公仔箱度同我哋講： 「大學學位好重要， 有佢先可以扶搖直上、做到中產。」 
"Now of course, all this data -- and one of you is going to do this, right? ",通常理據就係專上學歷競爭力高： 大專畢業比起高中畢業平均賺多 56% 
"All this data has to be well designed, maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies. ",我哋再細心啲解讀個數字 因為驟眼睇 個數字好似喺度推翻緊嗰啲 「大學畢業做收銀沖咖啡」 之類嘅新聞咁 
"We know about statistics, right? ",响 100 個有專上學歷嘅人裏面 45 個冇順利畢業 原因好多，財政困難係其一 
"But be that as it may, the third and biggest benefit of Income-Based Tuition, is it would free Americans from the fear and the fact of financial ruin because they bought a defective product. ",嗰 55 個順利畢業嘅人 有兩個冇嘢做 有 18 個搵唔到長工 
"Perhaps, in time, young and old Americans may rediscover, as the gentleman said earlier, their curiosity, their love of learning -- begin to study what they love, love what they study, follow their passion ... ",雖然大學畢業生搵得多過中學畢業生 但究竟佢哋夠唔夠填嗰筆巨債 同埋你讀書嗰陣冇咗嘅搵錢機會呢？ 
"getting stimulated by their intelligence, follow paths of inquiry that they really want to. ",依家連經濟學家都承認 只有順利畢到業嘅大學生先還得哂 
"After all, it was Eric and Kevin, two years ago, just exactly these kinds of young men, who prompted me and worked with me, and still do, in the study of indebted students in America. ",而純粹係因為中學畢業生嘅薪水 幾廿年嚟大幅縮水 
Thank you for your attention. ,咁多年嚟 有高中學歷嘅人 付出同收入唔成正比 
(Applause) ,若果佢哋可以賺返佢哋應得嘅水平 咁讀大學對好多人嚟講肯定係蝕大本 
,大學畢業生薪水嘅溢價 
"When we're designing new products, services or businesses, the only time you'll know if they're any good, if the designs are good, is to see how they're used in the real world, in context. ",我睇都係靠高中畢業生倒貼而嚟 
I'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields in north London. ,有三份二嘅大學畢業生發現 工作未如理想 
It's absolutely beautiful. ,佢哋唔睇好前景 或者直情覺得前途暗淡 
There's a big open green space. ,而正正係佢哋要去承受 學債帶嚟嘅沉重負擔 
There's Georgian buildings around the side. ,最心悒嘅係，正正係佢哋 畀人最落力用學位升值呢個理由氹落搭 
But then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle. ,咁嘅銷售伎倆，自私自利不特止 仲係麻木不仁 
People clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge. ,咁我哋做啲乜嘢好？ 
"Instead, they want to take the shortcut, and that shortcut is self-reinforcing. ",如果學生同家長都當學位係商品呢？ 
"Now, this shortcut is called a desire path, and it's often the path of least resistance. ",個個似乎都咁睇 
"I find them fascinating, because they're often the point where design and user experience diverge. ",買任何商品嗰陣 你會要人哋清楚交代件貨嘅詳情 
"Now at this point, I should apologize, because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere. ",你去買藥 佢會寫明有咩副作用 
"But today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services. ",你買件大學商品嗰陣 佢需要有張警告標籤 畀消費者有權揀 知情下做決定 
The first is in the capital city of Brazil -- Brasilia. ,你去買車 佢會話你知每加侖預計跑到幾多里 
"And it reminds me that sometimes, you have to just focus on designing for a real need at low friction. ",但冇人會預計到讀完大學 譬如讀完科「加拿大研究」前景會係點 
"Now, Brasilia is fascinating. ",真係有呢個學系㗎 
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s. ,假如有個應用程式可以話個前景我哋知？ 
"It was the golden age of flying, so he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there. ",計吓個學費同預期人工係咪成正比 
"Slightly worryingly, he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit. ",暫且叫個應用程式做 Income-Based Tuition 或者 IBT 啦 
"But if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia, just where the point is there, you see it's littered with desire paths. ",係你哋其中一個人設計而嚟 
They're absolutely everywhere. ,（笑聲） 正視返你嘅前途問題 
"Now, they thought that they had future-proofed this design. ",（笑聲） IBT 呢個應用程式有三個好處 
They thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere -- we'd be able to drive -- so there was little need for walkways or pavements. ,用戶可以知道 讀完某某大學同埋學系，人工會係幾多 
"But as you can see, there's a real need. ",用家有咗呢啲資訊 就冇咁易 畀啲無良推銷員氹得掂 
These are very dangerous desire paths. ,同時可以揀得明智啲 
"If we just pick one, in the middle, you can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic. ",到時仲邊有人會交一筆 高過預期人工 15% 嘅學費出嚟呢? 
It won't surprise you guys that Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average US city. ,IBT 有第二個好處 
People are resourceful. ,透過顯示學費同薪金嘅關係 大學管理層必須要運用新思維 去妥善釐訂學費 
"They'll always find the low-friction route to save money, save time. ",譬如 大部份嘅學生不論學系，學費劃一 
"Not all these desire paths are dangerous, I was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow. ",呢個制度明顯好唔公平，需要改革 
Many of us get frustrated when we're confronted with the obligatory walk through duty-free. ,工程系嘅學生通常用到嘅資源 譬如設施、實驗室、教職員呢啲 會多過哲學系嘅學生 
"It was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long, meandering path to the left, and just cut through to the right, cut through the desire path. ",但呢班哲學生 變相資助緊班工程系學生 
The question that's interesting is: What do designers think when they see our behavior here? ,第時人工高一截嘅工程系學生 
Do they think we're stupid? ,點解要兩個人買嘅貨一樣 畀嘅錢一樣 但其中一個淨係享用到 一半甚或三份一呢？ 
Do they think we're lazy? ,事實上，某啲學系嘅畢業生 拎緊人工嘅 25% 嚟還債 但另一啲拎 5% 就得 
Or do they accept that this is the only truth? ,咁學科收費合理啲就會消除呢啲不公平 
This is their product. ,當然啦，而家呢堆資料… 我諗在座會有人走去搞㗎可？ 
"So our job is to design for real needs at low friction, because if you don't, the customer will, anyway. ",呢堆資料要有人整理好 譬如交畀會計公司做審計 避免畀啲統計數字呃 
The second desire path I wanted to share is at the University of California. ,統計大家都識㗎可？ 
And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it. ,除咗正話兩個好處 第三個，而且係 IBT 最大嘅好處 就係令美國人唔使驚再陷入財困 唔使再驚買咗件爛貨返嚟 
"Now, university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths. ",或者某個時刻 新舊兩代嘅美國人重新發現 正如頭先嗰位講者所講 對知識嘅追求同熱愛 開始學啲想學嘅嘢 鍾意自己學緊嘅嘢，隨心而行 
I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart. ,深受知識所啟發 去探索自己渴望探索嘅事物 
So they're dashing to lectures. ,望返轉頭，其實係阿 Eric 同 Kevin 兩年前 正正係呢一班後生仔 佢哋鼓勵我，同我共事 到到而家 依然落力研究緊美國呢個學生貸款問題 
And the designers here knew that. ,好多謝大家！ 
So they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form. ,（鼓掌） 
They then paved them. ,
(Laughter) Incredibly smart approach. ,我哋設計新產品、服務或者業務嗰陣 你永遠都唔會知道點嘅設計先為之好 除非你行出去望吓啲人用成點 
"In fact, often, just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want. ",次次行過倫敦海伯里公園嗰陣 呢個念頭都會自動彈出嚟 
"For example, Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant. ",嗰度超靚 
What should the menu be? ,有個好大嘅綠化空間 
"He launched a service, in this case a food truck, and he changed the location each day. ",側邊有一迾喬治王朝風格嘅建築 
He'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker to figure out what people wanted. ,但中間零零舍舍有條泥路 
He now has a chain of restaurants. ,好明顯啲人唔想氹氹框啦 
So it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths. ,佢哋想走捷徑 於是乎自己行咗條路出嚟 
The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you is the UNIH. ,我哋會叫呢個做「公眾期望嘅走法」 咁樣嘅走法往往都受歡迎 
"It reminds me that the world's in flux, and we have to respond to those changes. ",而我都覺得呢啲捷徑好正 因為佢哋說明咗設計 同用家體驗往往有出入 
"So as you'll guess, this is a hospital. ",但呢一刻，希望大家唔好話我 因為陣間你會見到好多 同「捷徑哲學」有關嘅嘢 
I've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department. ,今日，我揀咗三個幾得意嘅故仔 分享吓佢哋對於我 做設計嗰陣有啲咩啟發 
The patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right. ,第一個响巴西首都，巴西利亞 
"This was a patient-centered organization, so they laid on cars for their patients. ",提醒到我嘅係 有時設計就係用最直接嘅方法 嚟滿足人嘅需要 
But what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars. ,巴西利亞係幾正㗎 
"They were too nauseous, so they'd walk back to their hotels. ",五十年代由建築師尼邁爾規劃設計 
"This desire path that you see diagonally, formed. ",當其時因為航空業好發達 所以佢將巴西利亞規劃成飛機咁嘅外形 
"The patients even called it ""The Chemo Trail."" ",唯一頭痛嘅係 佢將好多重要政府建築 擺响駕駛艙嗰個位 
"Now, when the hospital saw this originally, they tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it. ",當你放大嚟睇，响城市正中心 紅色點嗰度 你會見周圍都穿插住一條條嘅小捷徑 
"But after a while, they realized it was an important need they were meeting for their patients, so they paved it. ",度度都係 
And I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths. ,佢哋自以為個設計好有前瞻性 
"If we look back at the one in North London again, that desire path hasn't always been there. ",以為第時人唔使再用對腳 揸架車就可以四圍去 所以斷定第時唔需要任何行人路 
"The reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium on game days, from the Underground station you see on the bottom right. ",但現實話我哋聽，我哋需要行人路 
So you see the desire path. ,呢拃捷徑全部都好危險 
"If we just wind the clock back a few years, when the stadium was being constructed, there is no desire path. ",就攞中間嗰條嚟講 你見佢橫跨咗成 15 條行車線 
"So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging, and, where appropriate, pave them, as someone did here. ",所以巴西利亞嘅行人事故 比起美國啲城市平均高出五倍 一啲都唔出奇 
"Someone installed a barrier, people started walking across and round the bottom as you see, and they paved it. ",人總係好多計仔 
"(Laughter) But I think this is a wonderful reminder as well, that, actually, the world is in flux. ",總係會扭盡六壬搵最快嗰條路 為嘅只係慳錢慳時間 
"It's constantly changing, because if you look at the top of this image, there's another desire path forming. ",不過唔係條條捷徑都咁危險嘅 我記得有次响希思羅機場 
So these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs. ,我哋成班都𢲷晒頭 唔明做乜免稅區中間 無端端有條行人路喺度 
I think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success. ,我估唔到嘅係 好多人唔會行左邊嗰條正式嘅路線 反而穿過右邊，自己開咗條捷徑 
"Design for real needs and design them in low friction, because if you don't offer them in low friction, someone else will, often the customer. ",有個幾得意嘅問題： 班設計師見到我哋咁行法，會點睇呢？ 
"Secondly, often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service. ",覺得我哋好蠢？ 
The answer is rarely inside the building. ,覺得我哋好懶？ 
Get out there and see what people really want. ,定還是會欣然接受呢？ 
"And finally, in part because of technology, the world is incredibly flux at the moment. ",佢哋設計咗啲路出嚟 而我哋就合力改個設計 
It's changing constantly. ,所以我哋嘅設計要以人為本、簡單直接 因為就算你個設計唔啱用 啲用家都會改到啱為止 
These desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever. ,第二條得意嘅捷徑响加州大學 
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them. ,提醒我嘅係 有時最掂嘅設計係來自用家自己 
Thank you very much. ,大學校園總會搵到啲好正嘅捷徑 
(Applause) ,我估因為啲學生成日遲到 兼有啲小聰明 
,所以飆去上堂嗰陣，硬係會搵捷徑 
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're a soldier in the heat of battle. ,呢間大學嘅設計師都深明此道 
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you're a Zulu warrior. ,所以佢哋起好啲大樓之後 等一頭半個月，由啲路自然成形 
"Regardless of your time and place, there are some things that are constant. ",然之後鋪返條路出嚟 
"Your adrenaline is elevated, and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes, reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy. ",（笑聲） 呢條橋超聰明！ 
"So now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role, that of the scout. ",事實上，直接交個波出去 你就會知道啲人其實想要乜 
The scout's job is not to attack or defend. ,就好似波士頓嘅 Ayr Muir 咁 佢想開餐廳，但開喺邊好呢？ 
The scout's job is to understand. ,賣啲咩好呢？ 
"The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles. ",於是乎佢揸住架餐車 日日駛去唔同地方 
"And the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge in a convenient location across a river. ",用雙頭筆寫低有咩嘢食賣 日日唔同款，試吓水溫 
"But above all, the scout wants to know what's really there, as accurately as possible. ",依家佢啲餐廳經已開到成行成市 
"And in a real, actual army, both the soldier and the scout are essential. ",所以話，將設計權交畀用家 其實可以好有效 
But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset -- a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives. ,第三個、亦係最尾我想分享嘅 係美國國立衛生研究院 
"What I'm going to argue today is that having good judgment, making accurate predictions, making good decisions, is mostly about which mindset you're in. ",佢提醒我，呢個世界每秒都變緊 所以我哋要順應時勢 
"To illustrate these mindsets in action, I'm going to take you back to 19th-century France, where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history. ",你應該估到呢度係醫院 
It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff. ,左上角寫住「腫瘤科」 
"It was torn up in a wastepaper basket, but when they pieced it back together, they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany. ",啲病人通常會响右下角啲酒店度住 
"So they launched a big investigation, and their suspicions quickly converged on this man, Alfred Dreyfus. ",呢間醫院好以人為本 會為病人提供專車接送 
"He had a sterling record, no past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell. ",但係當佢哋開始有幫病人做化療嗰陣 就留意到病人好少會搭專車 
"But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army, and unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti-Semitic. ",佢哋周時作嘔作悶，所以寧願行返酒店 
"They compared Dreyfus's handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match, even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity, but never mind that. ",就係咁，病人自己行咗條路出嚟 
"They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment, looking for any signs of espionage. ",打斜呢條 病人仲叫佢做「化療徑」添 
"They went through his files, and they didn't find anything. ",開頭醫院見到條路 仲諗住冚返層草皮上去 
"This just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty, but sneaky as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it. ",後尾佢哋至發現班病人好需要呢條路 所以鋪好咗條路畀病人 
"Next, they went and looked through his personal history for any incriminating details. ",我哋要做嘅嘢 就係鋪好呢啲用家想要嘅路 
"They talked to his teachers, they found that he had studied foreign languages in school, which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments later in life. ",再望返最開頭倫敦嗰個公園 條捷徑並唔係一直响度 
"His teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory, which was highly suspicious, right? ",佢之所以出現 係因為每逢有比賽 啲人就湧晒去隔籬嗰個阿仙奴球場 由右下角個地鐵站一路行行行 
"You know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things. ",先有今日呢條路 
"So the case went to trial, and Dreyfus was found guilty. ",如果返返去幾年前 個球場仲未起完嗰陣 我哋唔會見到條路 
"Afterwards, they took him out into this public square and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two. ",所以我哋要做嘅嘢 就係睇住啲路幾時出現 可以嘅就鋪好佢 正如呢幅相咁 
This was called the Degradation of Dreyfus. ,有人整咗個欄喺路中心 其他人就嘗試向右兜過佢 仲鋪靚佢添！ 
"And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named Devil's Island, which is this barren rock off the coast of South America. ",（笑聲） 同時，呢啲捷徑提緊我哋 世界係變緊 每一秒都有變化 
"So there he went, and there he spent his days alone, writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence. ",你大可以望吓幅相對岸 又有另一條小路慢慢現形 
"But for the most part, France considered the matter closed. ",呢三條捷徑提醒我 做設計要以人為本 
One thing that's really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. ,肯從用家角度出發 話唔定就係企業成功嘅關鍵 
"I mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up, that they were intentionally framing him. ",要體貼人嘅需要 要用最簡單嘅設計 如果你個設計唔夠直接 自自然有人會改返直佢 
But historians don't think that's what happened. ,再講，想知啲人要啲乜 最好就將設計權交畀佢哋 
"As far as we can tell, the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong. ",齋坐响寫字樓唔會幫到你 
Which makes you wonder: What does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man? ,不如行出去留意啲人需要啲乜 
"Well, this is a case of what scientists call ""motivated reasoning."" ",最後，有賴科技進步，成個世界變化萬千 
"It's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations, our desires and fears, shape the way we interpret information. ",冇一刻停落嚟 
"Some information, some ideas, feel like our allies. ",嚟緊呢啲捷徑肯定越見越多 
We want them to win. We want to defend them. ,我哋要做嘅，就係搵啲合適嘅小捷徑 然後將佢哋變成路 
"And other information or ideas are the enemy, and we want to shoot them down. ",多謝大家！ 
"So this is why I call motivated reasoning, ""soldier mindset."" ",（鼓掌） 
"Probably most of you have never persecuted a French-Jewish officer for high treason, I assume, but maybe you've followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed that when the referee judges that your team committed a foul, for example, you're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong. ",
But if he judges that the other team committed a foul -- awesome! ,請大家想像下 自己係個打緊仗嘅士兵 
"That's a good call, let's not examine it too closely. ",可能係個羅馬步兵 或者係中世紀嘅弓箭手 又或者係祖魯戰士 
"Or, maybe you've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy, like capital punishment. ",無論你身處何時何地 有啲嘢係唔會變嘅 
"And, as researchers have demonstrated, if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it's not effective, then you're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed. ",你嘅腎上腺素會升高 你嘅行為，其實根植於 呢啲反射動作之中 呢啲用黎保護你自己 同埋打敗敵人嘅反射動作 
"But if it shows that capital punishment works, it's a good study. ",所以依家我希望 你哋諗下喺頭先嘅情境中 自己扮演唔同嘅角色：偵察兵 
"And vice versa: if you don't support capital punishment, same thing. ",偵察兵唔洗攻擊或者防禦 
"Our judgment is strongly influenced, unconsciously, by which side we want to win. ",任務只係要了解情況 
And this is ubiquitous. ,偵察兵要行出去 畫出敵方嘅地圖 了解潛在嘅阻礙物 
"This shapes how we think about our health, our relationships, how we decide how to vote, what we consider fair or ethical. ",偵察兵希望了解嘅係譬如 一個方便過河嘅位置 係唔係有一座橋 
"What's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset, is how unconscious it is. ",不過更加重要嘅係，偵察兵希望 了解嗰度究竟有啲咩 知得越精確越好 
We can think we're being objective and fair-minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man. ,正如真正嘅軍隊入面 士兵同偵察兵都好重要 
"However, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story is not over. ",不過你又可以當呢啲 角色代表緊啲思維方式 比喻緊我哋喺日常生活之中 接收信息同諗嘢嘅過程 
This is Colonel Picquart. ,我哋今日想講嘅就係 要擁有優秀嘅判斷力 要作出精確嘅預測、正確嘅決定 主要取決於你嘅思維方式 
"He's another high-ranking officer in the French Army, and like most people, he assumed Dreyfus was guilty. ",依家我哋可以實際 展示下呢種思維方式 我會帶住你地去 十九世紀嘅法國 喺嗰度，呢張睇落微不足道嘅紙仔 引發咗歷史上 數一數二嘅政治醜聞 
"Also like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic. ",1894 年，有啲法國公務員發現 
"But at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect: ""What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"" ",垃圾桶裡面一張撕碎嘅紙 將啲紙砌返埋之後 佢哋發現隊伍裡面有人 偷偷地賣軍事機密畀德國 
"What happened was, he had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued, even after Dreyfus was in prison. ",於是佢哋開始咗個大規模嘅調查 調查結果好快指向一個人 阿弗列 ‧ 屈里弗斯 
"And he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo, much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting. ",佢嘅信用紀錄幾好 之前無做錯過嘢 又唔似有犯案動機 
"So he brought these discoveries to his superiors, but to his dismay, they either didn't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings, like, ""Well, all you've really shown, Picquart, is that there's another spy who learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting, and he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left. ",但係，屈里弗斯係隊伍 入面唯一一個猶太軍官 不幸嘅係，嗰時法國軍隊好歧視猶太人 
"But Dreyfus is still guilty."" ",佢哋攞屈里弗斯嘅字跡同嗰張紙做比較 發現係一致嘅 雖然其他筆跡專家 覺得冇咁似 但係無論點 
"Eventually, Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated. ",佢哋去咗屈里弗斯間屋 搵佢做間諜嘅痕跡 
"But it took him 10 years, and for part of that time, he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army. ",佢哋搵暈曬佢啲文件 都搵唔到證據 
"A lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story because he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, which I agree with. ",佢哋反而覺得屈里弗斯一定係做緊間諜 仲超級狡猾，係佢哋嚟到之前 已經將啲罪證收起曬 
"But personally, for me, the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic actually makes his actions more admirable, because he had the same prejudices, the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers, but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that. ",跟著落嚟，佢哋去查佢嘅個人歷史 試圖尋找犯罪嘅痕跡 
"So to me, Picquart is a poster child for what I call ""scout mindset."" ",佢哋向佢嘅老師問話 發現佢喺學校學過外語 就覺得佢一定係為咗之後 做外國間諜 
"It's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose, but just to see what's really there as honestly and accurately as you can, even if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant. ",佢嘅老師仲話 屈里弗斯記憶力好，好到出曬名 真係太可疑啦，係咪？ 
This mindset is what I'm personally passionate about. ,因為你知啦 間諜係需要記住好多嘢㗎嘛 
And I've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset. ,呢單案件上咗法庭 屈里弗斯被判有罪 
"Why are some people, sometimes at least, able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can? ",之後，佢哋將佢帶到廣場上 依足規矩咁扯走佢嘅徽章 又將佢嘅劍折成兩段 
And the answer is emotional. ,呢個就係屈里弗斯降級事件 
"So, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism, scout mindset is, too. ",佢哋判咗佢終身監禁 將佢流放到南美洲海岸 一個叫做魔鬼島嘅荒涼小島上 
It's just rooted in different emotions. ,佢之後就去咗嗰度淒涼度日 寫左一封又一封信畀法國政府 求佢哋重新審過單案時 會察覺佢係無辜嘅 
"For example, scouts are curious. ",但係大家都覺得 呢單案已經完曬 
They're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle. ,我覺得屈里弗斯事件 好有意思嘅一個地方 就係嗰啲官員點解咁肯定 屈里弗斯係有罪嘅呢 
They're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations. ,你甚至會覺得 佢地設佢局 特登陷害佢 
Scouts also have different values. ,不過歷史學家都唔係咁諗 
"They're more likely to say they think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs, and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak. ",我哋可以睇到 個啲官真係覺得 控訴屈里弗斯嘅理據十足 
"And above all, scouts are grounded, which means their self-worth as a person isn't tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic. ",呢件事令人奇怪 人類個腦到底有咩問題 以至咁丁點嘅證據 都可以說服到人判佢有罪？ 
So they can believe that capital punishment works. ,係咁嘅，科學家發現一種 叫做「動機性推理」嘅現象 
"If studies come out showing that it doesn't, they can say, ""Huh. Looks like I might be wrong. Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."" ",係指我哋嘅潛意識 我哋嘅慾望同恐懼 塑造咗我哋分析信息嘅方式 
This cluster of traits is what researchers have found -- and I've also found anecdotally -- predicts good judgment. ,有啲信息，有啲諗法 對我哋嚟講好似朋友 
And the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is that they're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know. ,我哋想佢地贏 我哋想護住佢哋 
"In fact, they don't correlate very much with IQ at all. ",有啲信息好似仇人咁樣 我哋想消滅佢哋 
They're about how you feel. ,所以我鐘意叫動機性推理 做「士兵思維」 
"There's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry. ",你哋就從未迫害過 猶太裔法國軍官，話佢係叛徒 我估係呱 不過你如果鍾意睇體育 或者政治新聞 你可能已經留意到 譬如，當個裁判話 你鍾意嗰隊犯規 你就會好想搵理由講 佢點解判錯咗 
"He's the author of ""The Little Prince."" ",不過如果佢判另外嗰隊 犯咗規，你就會覺得好啱 
"He said, ""If you want to build a ship, don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work. ",這個例子幾好 但大家唔好咁認真 
"Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."" ",或者，你可能啱啱先讀咗一篇 有關一啲爭議嘅文章或者研究 譬如應唔應該有死刑 
"In other words, I claim, if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics, even though those things are quite valuable. ",啲研究員發現 如果你支持死刑 但係篇文話死刑無用嘅話 你就會好想搵出 呢份報告邊度寫得唔好 
But what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset. ,不過如果篇文支持死刑 你就會覺得佢寫得好好 
We need to change the way we feel. ,反之亦然：如果你唔 支持死刑，都係一樣嘅 
We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something. ,我哋嘅判斷力喺無意之中 受我哋嘅立場好大影響 
We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs. ,呢個現象好普遍 
So the question I want to leave you with is: What do you most yearn for? ,決定緊我哋點睇 健康同人際關係 點投票 點先覺得係公平或者合乎道德 
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs? ,最驚嚇嘅係 動機性推理或者士兵思維 都係完全無意嘅 
Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can? ,我哋以為自己好公正、好客觀 但係都可以冤死無辜嘅人 
Thank you. ,不過，好彩屈里弗斯嘅故事未完 
(Applause) ,呢個係皮卡爾上校 
,佢係另外一個法軍高官 同其他人一樣，佢都覺得屈里弗斯有罪 
Imagine you are a part of a crew of astronauts traveling to Mars or some distant planet. ,又同其他人咁，佢都有少少反猶太 
The travel time could take a year or even longer. ,不過，過咗一段時間，皮卡爾開始懷疑 「我哋係唔係冤枉咗屈里弗斯？」 
The space on board and the resources would be limited. ,之後，佢發現 屈里弗斯坐緊監時 都繼續有人為德國通風報信 
So you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food with minimal inputs. ,佢仲發現軍隊入面 有人嘅字跡同果張紙仔上嘅一模一樣 而且比起屈里弗斯嘅字跡更加似 
"What if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds, and grow crops in a matter of hours? ",於是，佢向上級匯報佢嘅發現 不過令佢失望嘅係，佢哋一係就唔上心 一係就兜個大圈，合理化啲新發現 譬如「皮卡爾，你只不過 發現咗另一個間諜 模仿咗屈里弗斯嘅字跡。 喺屈里弗斯坐監之後接手間諜工作。 
"And what if those crops would then make more seeds, enabling you to feed the entire crew with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip? ",不過屈里弗斯都係有罪嘅。」 
"Well, the scientists at NASA actually figured out a way to do this. ",最尾，皮卡爾成功幫屈里弗斯洗脫罪名 
What they came up with was actually quite interesting. ,但係就用咗整整十年 期間佢自己都因為 對軍隊不忠坐咗陣監 
"It involved microorganisms, which are single-celled organisms. ",好多人覺得皮卡爾唔係成件事嘅英雄 因為佢都歧視猶太人，我同意呢點 
And they also used hydrogen from water. ,不過，對我黎講，正因為皮卡爾反猶太 佢嘅舉動更加令人佩服 因為佢都同其他軍官有一樣嘅偏見 有同樣嘅原因可能作出唔公正嘅判斷 但佢尋找、堅持真相嘅動力將功補過 
"The types of microbes that they used were called hydrogenotrophs, and with these hydrogenotrophs, you can create a virtuous carbon cycle that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft. ",對於我嚟講 皮卡爾係「偵察思維」嘅典範 
"Astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide, that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious, carbon-rich crop. ",冇支持或反對任何觀點 而係純粹發現事實所在 盡量真實準確嘅事實 即使啲事實唔光彩、唔方便人 唔討人歡喜 
"The astronauts would then eat that carbon-rich crop and exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide, which would then be captured by the microbes, to create a nutritious crop, which then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide by the astronauts. ",呢個就係我熱愛嘅思維 
"So in this way, a closed-loop carbon cycle is created. ",過去幾年，我試圖探索同發現 「偵察思維」係點樣形成嘅 
So why is this important? ,點解有啲人，有啲時候 能夠摒棄自己嘅偏見、主觀同埋動機 嘗試用最客觀嘅眼光 去睇清事實同證據 
"We need carbon to survive as humans, and we get our carbon from food. ",答案就係情感上 
"On a long space journey, you simply wouldn't be able to pick up any carbon along the way, so you'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board. ",就好似士兵思維係出於 譬如防禦或者親疏有別嘅情感 偵察思維都係 
"This is a clever solution, right? ",不過係出於唔同嘅情感 
"But the thing is, that research didn't really go anywhere. ",譬如，偵察者有好奇心 
We haven't yet gone to Mars. We haven't yet gone to another planet. ,佢哋學到新嘢時 或者解開難題時 就會好開心 
And this was actually done in the '60s and '70s. ,如果佢哋發現有嘢 違背咗佢哋嘅假設 就會覺得好奇 
"So a colleague of mine, Dr. John Reed, and I, were interested, actually, in carbon recycling here on Earth. ",偵察者都有唔同嘅價值觀 
We wanted to come up with technical solutions to address climate change. ,佢哋覺得驗證自己嘅觀念 係一種美德 而唔會覺得 改變諗法係一種軟弱嘅行為 
And we discovered this research by reading some papers published in the '60s -- 1967 and later -- articles about this work. ,最後，偵察者係腳踏實地嘅 佢哋作為人嘅自尊唔係取決於 佢哋對於特定議題嘅諗法係對定錯 
And we thought it was a really good idea. ,佢哋可能覺得死刑係有用嘅 
"So we said, well, Earth is actually like a spaceship. ",但如果有研究話死刑係冇用嘅 佢哋會諗「係，我諗錯咗， 但都唔代表我差勁或者蠢」 
"We have limited space and limited resources, and on Earth, we really do need to figure out how to recycle our carbon better. ",研究員發現呢啲性格特點 ——而我都係啲故事中發現 預示咗人嘅判斷能力高低 
"So we had the idea, can we take some of these NASA-type ideas and apply them to our carbon problem here on Earth? ",我最想比你知道嘅就係 係呢啲性格特點同你醒唔醒無關 同你識幾多嘢都無關 
Could we cultivate these NASA-type microbes in order to make valuable products here on Earth? ,其實同智商都冇咩數據上嘅關係 
We started a company to do it. ,主要都係同情感有關 
"And in that company, we discovered that these hydrogenotrophs -- which I'll actually call nature's supercharged carbon recyclers -- we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked and understudied, and that they could make some really valuable products. ",我成日引用聖埃克絮佩里 
"So we began cultivating these products, these microbes, in our lab. ",——即係《小王子》嘅作者所講 
We found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide using these microbes. ,「如果你想造船， 唔好叫人地收集木頭、發號施令、 分配工作， 
And we even made a protein-rich meal that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal proteins. ,而係要教識佢哋嚮往 無邊無際嘅大海。」 
"We began cultivating them even further, and we found that we can make oil. ",換句話講 如果我哋真係想改善判斷能力 不論係作為係個人或者社會 我哋最需要嘅唔係更多嘅邏輯構建 比喻、機會率又或經濟學 儘管呢啲嘢都好有價值 
Oils are used to manufacture many products. ,不過要好好利用呢個理論 我哋最需要嘅係偵查思維 
"We made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil, which can be used for flavoring and for fragrances, but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner or even as a jet fuel. ",我哋需要改變自己嘅感觀 
And we made an oil that's similar to palm oil. ,我哋需要學習 喺發現自己諗錯嘢時 覺得自豪而唔係羞恥 
Palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods. ,需要學習如何喺發現一啲 同我哋觀念牴觸嘅資訊時 覺得好奇而唔係戒備 
"We began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology, and we're currently working with them to bring some of these products to market. ",所以，我想問你哋嘅問題係 你最想要嘅係咩？ 
We believe this type of technology can indeed help us profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products -- something that's beneficial for the planet but also beneficial for business. ,你想防禦自己嘅觀念？ 
That's what we're doing today. ,定係想盡可能睇到真實嘅世界？ 
"But tomorrow, this type of technology and using these types of microbes actually could help us do something even greater if we take it to the next level. ",多謝各位 
"We believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that's sustainable, that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow. ",（掌聲） 
And why might we need a sustainable agriculture? ,
"Well, actually, it is estimated that the population will reach about 10 billion by 2050, and we're projecting that we will need to increase food production by 70 percent. ",想像一下你係去火星或者其他遙遠星球 嘅其中一個宇航員 
"In addition, we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial goods. ",旅程時間可能長達一年 或者甚至更長 
So how will we scale to meet that demand? ,飛船上嘅空間同資源都受到限制 
"Well, modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand. ",所以你哋就要諗 點樣利用最少嘅原料去生產食物 
There are a number of reasons why. ,如果你只可以帶幾袋種子 喺幾個鐘裏面種出作物，會點？ 
One of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. ,如果嗰啲作物可以生產更多嘅種子 令你可以用其中嘅幾包種子 全程養活整個團隊，又會點？ 
"In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases than our cars, our trucks, our planes and our trains combined. ",NASA 嘅科學家已經諗到可行嘅方法 
Another reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land. ,佢哋嘅諗法非常有趣 
We have cleared 19.4 million square miles for crops and livestock. ,其中包括單細胞微生物 
What does that look like? ,科學家同時運用水入面嘅氫氣 
"Well, that's roughly the size of South America and Africa combined. ",佢哋利用嘅微生物係氫營養菌 你可以利用呢啲氫營養菌創造一個 良性嘅碳循環，維持太空船上嘅生命 
Let me give you a specific example. ,宇航員會呼出二氧化碳 二氧化碳會畀嗰啲微生物吸收 轉化成一種含有豐富營養同碳嘅作物 
"In Indonesia, an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately Ireland, between 2000 and 2012. ",之後宇航員食用嗰啲含豐富碳嘅作物 宇航員會以二氧化碳呼出 又會畀微生物吸收 生產新嘅營養作物 之後碳又會畀宇航員 以二氧化碳呼出 
"Just think of all of the species, the diversity, that was removed in the process, whether plant life, insects or animal life. ",咁樣就建立咗一個閉環碳循環 
And a natural carbon sink was also removed. ,點解呢樣嘢咁重要？ 
So let me make this real for you. ,我哋人類需要碳生存 我哋從食物中獲取碳 
This clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations. ,喺漫長嘅太空旅途中 根本就冇可能喺途中搵到碳 所以你要諗點樣喺飛船上循環利用碳 
"And as I mentioned before, palm oil is used to manufacture many products. ",呢個係一個聰明嘅方法，係唔係？ 
"In fact, it is estimated that over 50 percent of consumer products are manufactured using palm oil. ",但問題係，呢個研究並冇實行過 
"And that includes things like ice cream, cookies ... ",我哋未去過火星，亦未去過其他星球 
It includes cooking oils. ,事實上呢個研究 喺 60、70 年代就已經完成 
"It also includes detergents, lotions, soaps. ",所以我同一個同事，John Reed 博士 對地球上嘅碳循環好感興趣 
You and I both probably have numerous items in our kitchens and our bathrooms that were manufactured using palm oil. ,我哋想搵到應對氣候變化嘅 技術性解決方法 
So you and I are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests. ,通過閱讀 1967 年及以後嘅論文 我哋發現咗呢個研究 
"Modern ag has some problems, and we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably. ",我哋覺得呢個真係一個好主意 
"I believe that microbes can be a part of the answer -- specifically, these supercharged carbon recyclers. ",我哋認為，地球就好似一艘太空船 
"These supercharged carbon recyclers, like plants, serve as the natural recyclers in their ecosystems where they thrive. ",我哋嘅空間、資源都有限 喺地球上，我哋確實需要 思考點樣更有效去循環利用碳 
"And they thrive in exotic places on Earth, like hydrothermal vents and hot springs. ",所以我哋有一個諗法 可唔可以將呢啲 NASA 式嘅主意 用嚟解決地球上嘅碳問題？ 
"In those ecosystems, they take carbon and recycle it into the nutrients needed for those ecosystems. ",我哋可唔可以培養呢啲 NASA 式微生物 用嚟喺地球上生產有價值嘅物品？ 
"And they're rich in nutrients, such as oils and proteins, minerals and carbohydrates. ",我哋創立咗一間公司嚟研究 
"And actually, microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives. ",喺呢間公司，我哋發現呢啲氫營養菌 事實上我叫佢哋 大自然嘅「強勁碳循環機」 我哋發現佢哋係一種強大嘅微生物 佢哋畀嚴重忽視、未被深入研究 而且佢哋確實可以生產 一啲有價值嘅產物 
"If you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a Friday night, after a long, hard work week, then you are enjoying a product of microbes. ",所以我哋開始喺實驗室 培養呢啲產物同微生物 
If you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery -- a product of microbes. ,我哋發現可以利用呢啲微生物 將二氧化碳合成必需氨基酸 
"Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt. ",我哋甚至可以製作蛋白質營養餐 其中嘅必需氨基酸外形 同一啲動物蛋白質嘅氨基酸相似 
These are all products of microbes. ,我哋開始更進一步培養 發現我哋可以生產油 
But the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours versus months. ,油可以用嚟大量生產好多產品 
That means we can make crops much faster than we're making them today. ,我哋生產咗一種類似檸檬油嘅油 除咗可以摞嚟調味、製造香水 佢仲可以摞嚟做生物可降解清潔劑 甚至係噴氣燃料 
"They grow in the dark, so they can grow in any season and in any geography and any location. ",跟住我哋又生產咗一種類似棕櫚油嘅油 
They can grow in containers that require minimal space. ,棕櫚油可以用嚟生產唔同嘅 消費品同工業品 
And we can get to a type of vertical agriculture. ,我哋開始同製造商合作大量生產 依家我哋合作 將其中一啲產品推出市場 
"Instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture that requires so much land, we can scale vertically, and as a result produce much more product per area. ",我哋相信呢種技術可以幫助我哋 將二氧化碳有效轉化為有價值嘅產品 一啲同時對地球 同商業都有益嘅產品 
"If we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers, then we wouldn't have to remove any more rainforests to make the food and the goods that we consume. ",呢啲就係我哋依家做緊嘅事 
"Because, at a large scale, you can actually make 10,000 times more output per land area than you could -- for instance, if you used soybeans -- if you planted soybeans on that same area of land over a period of a year. ",但以後，如果我哋要更上一層 呢種技術同呢種微生物嘅應用 會幫助我哋完成一啲更加偉大嘅事 
Ten thousand times over a period of a year. ,我哋相信呢種技術 可以幫助我哋解決農業問題 可以畀我哋發展出一種可持續農業 令我哋可以滿足到未來嘅要求 
So this is what I mean by a new type of agriculture. ,點解我哋需要一個可持續農業呢？ 
And this is what I mean by developing a system that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of 10 billion. ,事實上，根據預測 到咗 2050 年 世界人口將會達到大概一百億 我哋預計糧食產量要提高70% 
And what would be the products of this new type of agriculture? ,同時，我哋會需要更多嘅資源、原材料 去生產消費品、工業品 
"Well, we've already made a protein meal, so you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal, or even cornmeal, or wheat flour. ",咁我哋要點樣滿足呢個需求？ 
"We've already made oils, so you can imagine something similar to coconut oil or olive oil or soybean oil. ",依家嘅現代農業滿足唔到呢個需求 
"So this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients that would give us pasta and bread, cakes, nutritional items of many sorts. ",原因有好多 
"Furthermore, since oil is used to manufacture multiple other goods, industrial products and consumer products, you can imagine being able to make detergents, soaps, lotions, etc., using these types of crops. ",其中一個就係現代農業 係溫室氣體嘅其中一個最大排放源 
"Not only are we running out of space, but if we continue to operate under the status quo with modern agriculture, we run the risk of robbing our progeny of a beautiful planet. ",事實上，佢溫室氣體嘅排放總量 比我哋嘅汽車、貨車、飛機 同埋火車嘅排放總量仲要大 
But it doesn't have to be this way. ,另一個原因就係佢佔據咗大面積嘅土地 
We can imagine a future of abundance. ,我哋為作物、牲畜騰出咗 
"Let us create systems that keep planet Earth, our spaceship, not only from not crashing, but let us also develop systems and ways of living that will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves and the 10 billion that will be on this planet by 2050. ",一千九百四十萬平方英里 即係點樣？ 
Thank you very much. ,大概就係南美洲同非洲加起嚟咁大 
(Applause) ,等我舉一個具體嘅例子 
,喺印尼，從 2000 年到 2012 年 大概有同成個愛爾蘭咁大嘅 原始熱帶雨林畀移除咗 
I am British. ,我哋可以想像到 畀趕離家園嘅物種數量之大 植物、昆蟲、動物，無一倖免 
"(Laughter) (Applause) Never before has the phrase ""I am British"" elicited so much pity. ",同時，一個天然碳匯都難逃一劫 
(Laughter) I come from an island where many of us like to believe there's been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years. ,咁等我講得更加真實一啲 
We tend to have historically imposed change on others but done much less of it ourselves. ,呢次移除係為咗種植棕櫚樹 
"So it came as an immense shock to me when I woke up on the morning of June 24 to discover that my country had voted to leave the European Union, my Prime Minister had resigned, and Scotland was considering a referendum that could bring to an end the very existence of the United Kingdom. ",就好似我之前所講 棕櫚油用於大量生產好多種產品 
"So that was an immense shock for me, and it was an immense shock for many people, but it was also something that, over the following several days, created a complete political meltdown in my country. ",事實上，根據估計 超過 50％ 嘅消費品都離不開棕櫚油 
"There were calls for a second referendum, almost as if, following a sports match, we could ask the opposition for a replay. ",其中包括雪糕、曲奇 
Everybody was blaming everybody else. ,仲有食用油 
People blamed the Prime Minister for calling the referendum in the first place. ,同埋清潔劑、乳液、肥皂 
They blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough. ,好可能你同我嘅廚房、浴室裏面 都有大量嘅由棕櫚油 製成嘅生活用品 
The young accused the old. ,所以你同我都係 移除熱帶雨林嘅罪魁禍首 
The educated blamed the less well-educated. ,現代農業存在住一啲問題 如果想可持續發展 我哋就需要解決方法 
That complete meltdown was made even worse by the most tragic element of it: levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of Britain at a level that I have never seen before in my lifetime. ,我相信微生物可以提供答案 特別係呢種強勁嘅碳循環機 
"People are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England, or, as one of my colleagues put it, whether we're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park floating in the Atlantic Ocean. ",呢種強勁嘅碳循環機 比如植物，喺佢哋成長嘅生態系統中 扮演著「自然循環機」嘅角色 
"(Laughter) But my question is really, should we have the degree of shock that we've experienced since? ",佢哋喺地球嘅特殊地貌生長 比如海底熱泉、溫泉 
Was it something that took place overnight? ,喺嗰啲生態系統，佢哋吸收碳 將碳再生為生態系統所需嘅營養 
Or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today? ,佢哋含有豐富營養 譬如油脂、蛋白質 礦物質、碳水化合物 
So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions. ,事實上，微生物已經成為 我哋日常生活嘅一部分 
"First, what does Brexit represent, not just for my country, but for all of us around the world? ",如果辛苦工作咗一個漫長嘅星期 你喺星期五晚品嘗一杯葡萄酒 咁其實你就係品嘗緊微生物嘅產物 
"And second, what can we do about it? ",如果你品嘗當地小型啤酒廠嘅一種啤酒 都係一種微生物嘅產物 
How should we all respond? ,或者係麵包、芝士、酸奶 
"So first, what does Brexit represent? ",呢啲全部都係微生物嘅產物 
Hindsight is a wonderful thing. ,但呢哋強勁碳循環機嘅魅力、力量在於 佢哋嘅生產力係數以小時計 而唔係以月嚟計算 
Brexit teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world. ,咁就意味著我哋可以 以比依家更快嘅速度去種作物 
It highlights in ways that we seem embarrassingly unaware of how divided our societies are. ,作物可以喺黑暗中生長 即係可以喺任何季節 任何地理環境、任何地方生長 
"The vote split along lines of age, education, class and geography. ",佢哋可以喺佔地最小嘅容器生長 
"Young people didn't turn out to vote in great numbers, but those that did wanted to remain. ",咁我哋就可以開發一種垂直農業 
Older people really wanted to leave the European Union. ,同佔地廣闊嘅傳統水平農業唔同 我哋可以向上發展 從而提高單位土地嘅產量 
"Geographically, it was London and Scotland that most strongly committed to being part of the European Union, while in other parts of the country there was very strong ambivalence. ",如果我哋利用呢啲碳循環機 實行呢種方法 咁我哋就唔再需要為食物、消費品 而移除任何熱帶雨林 
Those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously. ,因為通過大規模種植 實際上你可以種出 – 比如種大豆 如果你喺同一片土地種植大豆 一年之後 你會比原先得到多出一萬倍嘅單位產量 
"But more profoundly, the vote teaches us something about the nature of politics today. ",一年時間收穫係比原先產量嘅一萬倍 
Contemporary politics is no longer just about right and left. ,呢個就我所講嘅新型農業 
It's no longer just about tax and spend. ,呢個亦係我所講嘅發展一個系統 嚟滿足一百億人口需求嘅系統 
It's about globalization. ,咁呢種新型農業可以生產乜嘢？ 
The fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization and those that fear globalization. ,我哋已經整咗一種蛋白質餐 咁你可以想像到一啲類似黃豆餐 或者甚至係粟米粉、小麥麵粉嘅產品 
"(Applause) If we look at why those who wanted to leave -- we call them ""Leavers,"" as opposed to ""Remainers"" -- we see two factors in the opinion polls that really mattered. ",我哋已經生產咗油 咁你可以想像一啲類似椰子油嘅產品 或者係橄欖油、大豆油 
"The first was immigration, and the second sovereignty, and these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives and the feeling that they are unrepresented by politicians. ",所以呢種作物實際上可以生產 富含營養嘅意大利麵、麵包 蛋糕、各種營養食品 
But those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation. ,而且，既然油可以用嚟生產多種物品 工業品、消費品 你可以想像利用呢種作物 都可以生產清潔劑、肥皂、乳液等等 
They represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders in ways that many of us would reject. ,如果我哋繼續用依家嘅現代農業種植 就唔單止面臨土地資源匱乏嘅問題 仲會有風險令我哋啲子孫 失去呢個美麗嘅星球 
"What I want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that, that liberal internationalists, like myself, and I firmly include myself in that picture, need to write ourselves back into the picture in order to understand how we've got to where we are today. ",但係用新型農業就可以避免 
"When we look at the voting patterns across the United Kingdom, we can visibly see the divisions. ",我哋可以想像一個富足嘅未來 
The blue areas show Remain and the red areas Leave. ,等我哋嚟創造唔單止可以 避免地球毀滅、太空船墜毀 仲可以發展造福我哋 以及 2050 年一百億人口生活嘅 生態系統同生活方式 
"When I looked at this, what personally struck me was the very little time in my life I've actually spent in many of the red areas. ",好多謝大家 
"I suddenly realized that, looking at the top 50 areas in the UK that have the strongest Leave vote, I've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas. ",（掌聲） 
"In some of those places, I didn't even know the names of the voting districts. ",
"It was a real shock to me, and it suggested that people like me who think of ourselves as inclusive, open and tolerant, perhaps don't know our own countries and societies nearly as well as we like to believe. ",我係英國人 
"(Applause) And the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to narrate globalization to those people, to recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university, who haven't necessarily grown up with the Internet, that don't get opportunities to travel, they may be unpersuaded by the narrative that we find persuasive in our often liberal bubbles. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 「我係英國人」呢句說話 從來未引起過咁多人同情 
(Applause) It means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand. ,（笑聲） 我嚟自一個島國 好多人都相信 過去咁多年有好多嘢持續發生緊 
"In the Leave vote, a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred, creating lies and mistrust around, for instance, the idea that the vote on Europe could reduce the number of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Europe, when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration from outside the European Union. ",歷史上，我哋傾向改變其他國家 但好少改變自己 
But for a significant majority of the Leave voters the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment. ,所以當我六月廿四號朝早起身 發現我個國家公投結果係脫歐之後 我好震驚 首相辭咗職 蘇格蘭講緊第二場公投 有可能令英國瓦解 
"This was a protest vote for many, a sense that nobody represented them, that they couldn't find a political party that spoke for them, and so they rejected that political establishment. ",所以成件事對於我嚟講都幾震撼 對於好多人嚟講都係 但呢件事幾日後 發展成我國家嘅一個政治危機 
This replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world. ,有呼聲話要舉行第二場公投 呢個情況就好似運動比賽完咗 我哋叫對手重新比賽一樣 
"We see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States, with the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary, with the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France. ",每個人都指責其他人 
The specter of Brexit is in all of our societies. ,人民指責首相 話佢當初做咩搞公投 
"So the question I think we need to ask is my second question, which is how should we collectively respond? ",啲人鬧在野黨黨魁唔夠努力爭取 
"For all of us who care about creating liberal, open, tolerant societies, we urgently need a new vision, a vision of a more tolerant, inclusive globalization, one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind. ",後生指控老人家 
That vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization. ,受過教育責備無受過良好教育嘅 
"The consensus amongst economists is that free trade, the movement of capital, the movement of people across borders benefit everyone on aggregate. ",危機裏面最不幸嘅事 令成個危機更差 仇外同種族情緒充斥喺英國街頭 去到我前所未見嘅水平 
"The consensus amongst international relations scholars is that globalization brings interdependence, which brings cooperation and peace. ",啲人宜家講緊究竟我個國家 會變成小英格蘭 定係好似我同事話齋 變成一個浮沉喺大西洋嘅 五十年代懷舊公園 
But globalization also has redistributive effects. ,（笑聲） 但我嘅問題係 我哋應唔應該保持震驚嘅程度呢？ 
It creates winners and losers. ,究竟脫歐係咪一夜之間出現呢？ 
"To take the example of migration, we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances. ",定係有深層結構性因素 令我哋走到今日咁嘅地步？ 
"But we also have to be very aware that there are redistributive consequences, that importantly, low-skilled immigration can lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies and also put pressure on house prices. ",我想退一步，問兩個好基本嘅問題 
"That doesn't detract from the fact that it's positive, but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them. ",第一，英國脫歐代表咩？ 唔只對我國家 佢對全世界有咩意思？ 
"In 2002, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, gave a speech at Yale University, and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization. ",第二，我哋可以喺脫歐之後做啲乜？ 
That was the speech in which he coined that term. ,我哋要點樣應對？ 
"And he said, and I paraphrase, ""The glass house of globalization has to be open to all if it is to remain secure. ",返去第一條問題，英國脫歐代表咩？ 
"Bigotry and ignorance are the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization."" ",事後孔明係一件有趣嘅事 
That idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in 2008 in a conference on progressive governance involving many of the leaders of European countries. ,脫歐教曉好多關於我哋社會嘅嘢 以至世界上其他社會嘅嘢 
"But amid austerity and the financial crisis of 2008, the concept disappeared almost without a trace. ",脫歐呢件事反映咗 我哋唔為意我哋社會有幾分裂 
Globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda. ,投票取向因年齡、教育程度、 階級同地理位置而唔同 
It's perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all. ,年輕人唔踴躍投票 但出咗嚟投票嘅年輕人都投咗留歐 
And it needs to be reclaimed on a far more inclusive basis than it is today. ,長者想脫歐 
"So the question is, how can we achieve that goal? ",地理上，倫敦同蘇格蘭最想留歐 而其他地方就一半一半 
How can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation while on the other hand refusing vehemently to give in to xenophobia and nationalism? ,取態唔同係我哋需要認真看待嘅嘢 
That is the question for all of us. ,但更重要既係 公投話咗畀我哋聽今日嘅政治形勢 
"And I think, as a social scientist, that social science offers some places to start. ",當代政治唔再只係左翼同右翼 
"Our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change, and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point. ",唔再只係交稅同開支 
The first relates to the idea of civic education. ,當代政治係講緊全球化 
What stands out from Brexit is the gap between public perception and empirical reality. ,當代政治嘅分裂在於 鍾意同害怕全球化之間 
"It's been suggested that we've moved to a postfactual society, where evidence and truth no longer matter, and lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence. ",（掌聲） 如果我哋睇下想脫歐嘅人 我哋叫佢哋做脫歐陣營 相反嘅係留歐陣營 我哋見到民意調查裏面 兩個好重要嘅因素 
So how can we -- (Applause) How can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies? ,第一係移民，其次係國家主權 呢兩樣都代表咗 啲人想爭取返佢哋生活嘅自主權 代表佢哋覺得 參政嘅人唔代表佢哋 
"It has to begin with education, but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps. ",但呢啲脫歐諗法意味住恐懼同孤立 
"In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI published a survey on attitudes to immigration, and it showed that as numbers of immigrants increase, so public concern with immigration also increases, although it obviously didn't unpack causality, because this could equally be to do not so much with numbers but the political and media narrative around it. ",代表倒退到民族主義同邊界管制嘅年代 而我哋好多人都接受唔到 
But the same survey also revealed huge public misinformation and misunderstanding about the nature of immigration. ,我想講成件事嘅更加複雜 自由國際主義者，好似我咁 需要將自己擺埋落成件事裏面 至可以明白 我哋點樣走到今時今日嘅地步 
"For example, in these attitudes in the United Kingdom, the public believed that levels of asylum were a greater proportion of immigration than they were, but they also believed the levels of educational migration were far lower as a proportion of overall migration than they actually are. ",我哋睇返投票分佈 我哋見到分裂 
"So we have to address this misinformation, the gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globalization. ",藍色係留歐 紅色係脫歐 
"And that can't just be something that's left to our schools, although that's important to begin at an early age. ",當我睇到呢幅圖 我覺得好震撼嘅係 我人生冇幾多時間喺紅色嘅地方生活 
It has to be about lifelong civic participation and public engagement that we all encourage as societies. ,望住頭五十個最想脫歐嘅地方 我突然意識到 我只係花咗四日喺呢啲哋方生活 
The second thing that I think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities. ,呢五十個地方當中 我甚至唔知道一啲選區嘅名 
"(Applause) One of the things that stands out for me very strikingly, looking at immigration attitudes in the United Kingdom, is that ironically, the regions of my country that are the most tolerant of immigrants have the highest numbers of immigrants. ",我對呢樣嘢好驚訝 呢樣嘢亦都反映 好似我以為自己包容、開放、忍耐嘅人 或者對於我哋嘅國家同社會 同自己願意去相信嘅事物一樣咁唔清楚 
"So for instance, London and the Southeast have the highest numbers of immigrants, and they are also by far the most tolerant areas. ",（掌聲） 而伴隨著嘅挑戰係我哋要搵新方法 向支持脫歐嘅人解釋全球化 同埋要明白呢啲人未必讀過大學 互聯網未必陪伴佢哋成長 佢哋未必去過旅行 佢哋可能未被我哋自由社會裏面 覺得有說服嘅嘢說服 
It's those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration that actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants. ,（掌聲） 即係話我哋要接觸同埋理解更多 
So we need to encourage exchange programs. ,喺呢次公投裏面 小數人激起政治恐懼同憎恨 導致謊言同唔信任四起 例如，留歐其實可以減少 嚟歐洲嘅難民同申請庇護嘅人數 但脫歐就一啲都做唔到 
We need to ensure that older generations who maybe can't travel get access to the Internet. ,大多數脫歐支持者嘅憂慮 係對政治體制嘅幻滅 
"We need to encourage, even on a local and national level, more movement, more participation, more interaction with people who we don't know and whose views we might not necessarily agree with. ",呢場公投其實係一場抗議 抗議政制裏面無人代表到佢哋 佢哋搵唔到為佢哋發聲嘅政黨 於是佢哋唔要宜家嘅政治體制 
"The third thing that I think is crucial, though, and this is really fundamental, is we have to ensure that everybody shares in the benefits of globalization. ",呢種不滿政制嘅情況喺歐洲 同好多自由民主嘅國家重覆出現 
This illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking. ,同時，我哋見到特朗普喺美國冒起 匈牙利總理奧班嘅民族主義喺當地冒起 馬琳 · 勒龐喺法國嘅愈嚟愈受歡迎 
It shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the European Union were those who actually benefited the most materially from trade with the European Union. ,成個社會裏面都有支持英國脫歐嘅人 
But the problem is that those people in those areas didn't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries. ,咁我哋就要問第二個問題 我哋要點樣一齊應對？ 
They didn't believe that they were actually getting access to material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world. ,對於我哋關心營造 自由、開放、寛容社會嘅人嚟講 我哋急需要新願景 營造更包容同更寛容嘅全球化 令我哋走埋一齊，而唔係拋低邊個 
"I work on questions predominantly to do with refugees, and one of the ideas I spent a lot of my time preaching, mainly to developing countries around the world, is that in order to encourage the integration of refugees, we can't just benefit the refugee populations, we also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas. ",而當呢個全球化願景開始嘅時候 我哋需要認識全球化嘅好處 
"But in looking at that, one of the policy prescriptions is that we have to provide disproportionately better education facilities, health facilities, access to social services in those regions of high immigration to address the concerns of those local populations. ",經濟學家都有共識 全球化有利自由貿易、資金同人嘅流動 有利所有走埋一齊嘅人 
"But while we encourage that around the developing world, we don't take those lessons home and incorporate them in our own societies. ",至於國際關係學者都同意 全球化令國與國更加倚靠對方 促成合作同和平 
"Furthermore, if we're going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits, our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they, too, have to take people with them. ",但全球化有重新分配嘅效果 
The fourth and final idea I want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics. ,佢創造贏家同輸家 
There's very little social science evidence that compares attitudes on globalization. ,用移民做例子 我哋知道移民喺大多數情況下 對經濟都係正面嘅 
"But from the surveys that do exist, what we can see is there's huge variation across different countries and time periods in those countries for attitudes and tolerance of questions like migration and mobility on the one hand and free trade on the other. ",但我哋亦都要好小心 全球化帶嚟重新分配嘅結果 尤其低技術移民 可以令社會最貧困嘅一群工資下降 而且低技術移民會推高物業價格 
But one hypothesis that I think emerges from a cursory look at that data is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization. ,但以上都削弱唔到全球化嘅正面影響 全球化只會令更多人受到正面影響 
"It's the societies like Sweden in the past, like Canada today, where there is a centrist politics, where right and left work together, that we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization. ",2002 年，前聯合國秘書長安南 喺耶魯大學發表演講 演講圍繞包容性全球化 
"And what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization, a failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics, and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground that can encourage communication and a shared understanding. ",佢喺演講裏面創造咗 「包容性全球化」呢個詞 
"We might not achieve that today, but at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media to drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant of one another. ",我轉述返佢講嘅嘢︰ 「全球化如果要保持穩當嘅話 佢嘅大門就要向所有人打開 
"(Applause) These ideas are very tentative, and that's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project. ",偏執同無知係排外同對抗全球化」 
I am still British. ,2008 年，好多歐洲國家領袖參與 一個有關漸進式管治嘅會議 包容性全球化嘅概念再次被提出 
I am still European. ,但 2008 年金融海嘯 同實行緊縮措施嗰陣 呢個概念消失得無影無蹤 
I am still a global citizen. ,全球化一直用喺新自由綱領裏面 
"For those of us who believe that our identities are not mutually exclusive, we have to all work together to ensure that globalization takes everyone with us and doesn't leave people behind. ",全球化被認為係精英人士嘅綱領 多過係有利各方嘅事物 
Only then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization. ,明日嘅全球化應該要比今日更加包容 
Thank you. ,咁問題係，我哋點樣做到呢？ 
(Applause) ,我哋點樣顧及恐懼、孤立嘅情緒 而拒絕仇外、民族主義呢？ 
,呢條問題係畀我哋所有人 
I'm really glad to be here. ,作為社會科學家 我覺得社會科學係解決問題嘅好開始 
"I'm glad you're here, because that would be a little weird. ",我哋需要係意念上同物質上轉變 我想講四個諗法作為你哋嘅開始 
I'm glad we're all here. ,第一係同公民教育有關 
"And by ""here,"" I don't mean here. ",英國脫歐最突出嘅係 公眾認知同現實差距 
Or here. ,有人話我哋社會變成唔講事實 證據同真相唔再重要 反而大話同證據有同等地位 
But here. ,咁我哋點… （掌聲） 喺呢個自由民主嘅社會裏面 我哋點重新尊重真相同證據？ 
I mean Earth. ,咁就要由教育著手 但要由認識巨大嘅差距開始 
"And by ""we,"" I don't mean those of us in this auditorium, but life, all life on Earth -- (Laughter) from complex to single-celled, from mold to mushrooms to flying bears. ",2014 年，民意調查機構 Ipsos MORI 公佈一個英國人對於移民嘅態度調查 調查顯示移民嚟英國嘅人愈多 公眾愈關注移民嘅情況 雖然調查明顯無解構其中嘅因果關係 因為可能唔太關數字事 但政治同傳媒方面就覺得兩者有關係 
"(Laughter) The interesting thing is, Earth is the only place we know of that has life -- 8.7 million species. ",但同一個調查發現 公眾對於移民有好大嘅誤解 
"We've looked other places, maybe not as hard as we should or we could, but we've looked and haven't found any; Earth is the only place we know of with life. ",例如，英國公眾相信 難民佔移民嘅比例比實際高 但佢哋同時相信 受教育嘅移民嘅比例遠低於實際 
Is Earth special? ,我哋要重視呢個觀感同現實嘅落差 
"This is a question I've wanted to know the answer to since I was a small child, and I suspect 80 percent of this auditorium has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer. ",呢個係全球化重要嘅方面 但呢樣嘢唔可以剩係由學校做 雖然由細個開始著手係重要嘅 
"To understand whether there are any planets -- out there in our solar system or beyond -- that can support life, the first step is to understand what life here requires. ",處理落差需要花成世時間做公民參與 而呢樣正係社會所期望嘅 
"It turns out, of all of those 8.7 million species, life only needs three things. ",第二樣我覺得同時係機遇嘅係 我哋可以鼓勵呢個分裂嘅社群 有更多交流 
"On one side, all life on Earth needs energy. ",（掌聲） 當我睇返英國人對於移民態度嘅時候 其中一樣非常引起我注意 好諷刺地 最包融移民嘅地方有最多移民 
"Complex life like us derives our energy from the sun, but life deep underground can get its energy from things like chemical reactions. ",例如倫敦同東南部有最多移民 而呢兩個地方都係最接納到移民 
There are a number of different energy sources available on all planets. ,至於，有最少移民嘅地方 就最排斥同最唔能夠包融移民 
"On the other side, all life needs food or nourishment. ",所以我哋要鼓勵交流計劃嘅出現 
"And this seems like a tall order, especially if you want a succulent tomato. ",我哋要令未必能夠旅行嘅 上一代可以上到網 
"(Laughter) However, all life on Earth derives its nourishment from only six chemical elements, and these elements can be found on any planetary body in our solar system. ",係本地或者國家層面 我哋都要鼓勵更多嘅流動、參與 鼓勵同唔識嘅人 同睇法不完全一樣嘅人 有更多嘅交流 
"So that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole, the thing that's hardest to achieve. ",第三我覺得關鍵而又好基本嘅係 我哋要確保每個人 都可以享受到全球化嘅成果 
"Not moose, but water. ",呢幅圖由金融時報做 係有關後脫歐時代，好震撼 
(Laughter) Although moose would be pretty cool. ,幅圖顯示想脫歐嘅人其實係 最受惠於歐盟貿易嘅物質成果 
"(Laughter) And not frozen water, and not water in a gaseous state, but liquid water. ",但問題係 嗰啲喺想脫歐嘅地方嘅人 唔覺得佢哋係受惠於歐盟嘅一群 
"This is what life needs to survive, all life. ",佢哋唔信佢哋受惠緊 世界貿易同流動上升 所帶嚟嘅物質成果 
"And many solar system bodies don't have liquid water, and so we don't look there. ",我主要鑽研難民問題 而我其中一個針對發展中國家 花咗好多時間宣揚嘅諗法 係若然要鼓勵難民融合 我哋唔可以剩係令難民受惠 我哋亦要顧及本土社區嘅憂慮 
"Other solar system bodies might have abundant liquid water, even more than Earth, but it's trapped beneath an icy shell, and so it's hard to access, it's hard to get to, it's hard to even find out if there's any life there. ",但睇返其中一項政策 我哋要喺有大量移民嘅地區 提供唔合比例地好嘅 教育設施、醫療設施、社會服務 以回應當地居民嘅憂慮 
So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about. ,但當我哋喺發展中國家行呢套嘅同時 我哋冇將呢套帶返嚟我哋自己國家 用喺我哋自己社會入面 
So let's make the problem simpler for ourselves. ,再講，如果我哋真係要 確保人人都可以享受經濟成果 公司同企業就要一個全球化嘅示範 令佢哋明白佢哋都要對人有所承擔 
Let's think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet. ,第四個，亦係最後一個就係 我哋需要更負責任嘅政治 
"There are only three bodies to think about in our solar system, with regard to liquid water on the surface of a planet, and in order of distance from the sun, it's: Venus, Earth and Mars. ",但我哋得好少社會科學嘅證據 比較啲人對全球化嘅態度 
You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid. ,但睇返現有嘅調查 我哋可以睇到 國家之間 就算同一個國家喺唔同嘅時間 對於移民、人口流動 自由貿易嘅態度同承受能力 都有好大差別 
You have to be very careful with that atmosphere. ,但從呢啲數據得出一個假設係 兩極化社會更加接受唔到全球化 
"You can't have too much atmosphere, too thick or too warm an atmosphere, because then you end up too hot like Venus, and you can't have liquid water. ",好似以前嘅瑞典同宜家嘅加拿大咁 都有中間路線嘅政治 左翼同右翼合作 鼓勵支持全球化 
"But if you have too little atmosphere and it's too thin and too cold, you end up like Mars, too cold. ",但我哋今時今日見到嘅兩極化係悲慘嘅 政治極端兩邊嘅人冇辦法對話 兩班人都失去咗中間自由嘅光譜 而呢個中間地帶 卻可以鼓勵兩邊溝通同體諒對方 
"So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold, and Earth is just right. ",我哋未必今日做到 但至少我哋要呼籲政客同傳媒 用詞唔好再係表達恐懼 而係更包容呢兩個極端 
You can look at these images behind me and you can see automatically where life can survive in our solar system. ,（掌聲） 呢啲諗法都係初步 咁係因為解決方案需要多方意見 
"It's a Goldilocks-type problem, and it's so simple that a child could understand it. ",我仲係英國人 
"However, I'd like to remind you of two things from the Goldilocks story that we may not think about so often but that I think are really relevant here. ",我仲係歐洲人 
"Number one: if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold when Goldilocks walks into the room, does that mean it's always been too cold? ",我仲係世界公民 
Or could it have been just right at some other time? ,相信我哋身份並唔係互相排斥嘅我哋 我哋要走埋一齊 確保全球化唔會抌低我哋任何一個 
When Goldilocks walks into the room determines the answer that we get in the story. ,只有嗰陣 我哋先真正將民主同全球化調和 
And the same is true with planets. ,多謝 
They're not static things. They change. ,（掌聲） 
They vary. They evolve. ,
And atmospheres do the same. ,我好高興可以喺度 
So let me give you an example. ,我都好高興你哋可以喺度 因爲冇你哋嘅話，會些少奇怪 
Here's one of my favorite pictures of Mars. ,我好高興我哋都喺度 
"It's not the highest resolution image, it's not the sexiest image, it's not the most recent image, but it's an image that shows riverbeds cut into the surface of the planet; riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water; riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form. ",我講嘅「呢度」 唔係指 TED 呢度 
This can't happen on Mars today. ,或者呢度 
The atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid. ,係呢度 
"This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed, and it changed in big ways. ",我指嘅係地球 
"And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable, because the three requirements for life were present long ago. ",而我所講嘅「我哋」唔係指 呢度演講廳嘅咁多位 而係生命 地球上所有嘅生命 （笑聲） 由複雜細胞到單細胞 由黴菌到蘑菇 到飛天熊都係 
Where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be liquid at the surface? ,（笑聲） 有趣嘅係 地球係我哋知道唯一有生命嘅地方 八百七十萬種生物 
"Well, one idea is it escaped away to space. ",我哋人類其實有睇過其他地方 不過可能冇畀心機搵喇 但係我哋搵咗之後都冇發現有生物 地球係我哋知道唯一有生命嘅地方 
"Atmospheric particles got enough energy to break free from the gravity of the planet, escaping away to space, never to return. ",地球特殊嗎？ 
And this happens with all bodies with atmospheres. ,呢個問題由我細時就已經想知 而我估呢座禮堂八成嘅人 都諗過同樣嘅事 亦都想知道答案 
Comets have tails that are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape. ,要知道有冇其他行星 喺我哋太陽系或者其他地方 能夠支持生命 第一步需要了解地球嘅生命需要啲乜 
"But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time, and Mars and Earth as well. ",事實證明，喺呢八百七十萬個物種之中 生命只需要三件事 
It's just a matter of degree and a matter of scale. ,三張相嘅一邊 地球上所有生命都需要能量 
So we'd like to figure out how much escaped over time so we can explain this transition. ,好似我哋咁嘅複合生物體 需要從太陽取得能量 但係地下深處嘅生物 可以由化學反應取得能量 
How do atmospheres get their energy for escape? ,能量嘅來源喺每個星球都有好多種 
How do particles get enough energy to escape? ,相片另一邊 所有生命都需要食物或者營養 
"There are two ways, if we're going to reduce things a little bit. ",咁聽起嚟係過分要求 尤其當你想要一隻多汁嘅番茄時 
"Number one, sunlight. ",（笑聲） 但係地球上所有嘅生命 只需由六種化學元素取得營養 呢啲元素都可以喺我哋嘅太陽系 任何一個行星上面發現 
Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles. ,所以剩低中間嘅嘢最難達到 
"Yes, I'm dancing, but they -- (Laughter) Oh my God, not even at my wedding. ",唔係麋鹿，係水 
(Laughter) They get enough energy to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet just by warming. ,（笑聲） 雖然如果係麋鹿都幾型 
A second way they can get energy is from the solar wind. ,（笑聲） 唔係冰結嘅水，亦唔係氣態嘅水 
"These are particles, mass, material, spit out from the surface of the sun, and they go screaming through the solar system at 400 kilometers per second, sometimes faster during solar storms, and they go hurtling through interplanetary space towards planets and their atmospheres, and they may provide energy for atmospheric particles to escape as well. ",而係液態水 水係所有生命生存都需要嘅嘢 
"This is something that I'm interested in, because it relates to habitability. ",太陽系好多星球都冇液態水 所以我哋唔去呢啲星球度搵 
"I mentioned that there were two things about the Goldilocks story that I wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about, and the second one is a little bit more subtle. ",但有啲太陽系嘅星球可能有大量液態水 甚至多過地球 但啲水都係困喺冰層底下 所以好難接近，好難用到 亦都令到我哋好難探測 冰層下面有冇生命 
"If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot, and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold, shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder if we're following the trend? ",咁只剩低幾個星球值得考慮 
"This thing that you've accepted your entire life, when you think about it a little bit more, may not be so simple. ",所以等我哋簡化一下問題 
"And of course, distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature. ",我哋只要諗喺星球表面搵到液態水就好 
This has to play into habitability. ,咁我哋嘅太陽系裡邊 只有三個星球可以諗 按太陽嘅距離依次序為： 金星、地球、火星 
But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about. ,因為你想大氣層畀到水係液體狀態 
"Maybe it's the bowls themselves that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story, what is just right. ",所以要對大氣層非常講究 
"I could talk to you about a lot of different characteristics of these three planets that may influence habitability, but for selfish reasons related to my own research and the fact that I'm standing up here holding the clicker and you're not -- (Laughter) I would like to talk for just a minute or two about magnetic fields. ",大氣層唔可以太厚或者太暖 因為咁樣嘅話會好似金星一樣咁熱 而且冇可能有液態水 
Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not. ,但係如果你嘅大氣層太薄太凍 結果就會好似火星一樣咁凍 
Magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds Earth. ,所以金星太熱，火星太凍 地球就啱啱好 
"If you have a compass, you know which way north is. ",睇下我後邊嘅相，你自然會睇到 我哋嘅太陽系邊度可以有生命 
Venus and Mars don't have that. ,呢個係「金髮女孩 與三隻熊故事」嘅問題 簡單到兒童都可以理解 
"If you have a compass on Venus and Mars, congratulations, you're lost. ",不過，我想提醒各位兩件事 喺金髮女孩與三隻熊個故事裡面 我哋經常忽略、但我認為非常切題嘅事 
(Laughter) Does this influence habitability? ,第一 當金髮女孩行入屋時 如果熊媽媽碗粥太凍 咁碗粥係咪一路都係凍嘅呢？ 
"Well, how might it? ",定係喺之前係暖嘅呢？ 
"Many scientists think that a magnetic field of a planet serves as a shield for the atmosphere, deflecting solar wind particles around the planet in a bit of a force field-type effect having to do with electric charge of those particles. ",金髮女孩行入屋時就一口咬定咗個答案 
I like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets. ,行星都一樣 
"(Laughter) And yes, my colleagues who watch this later will realize this is the first time in the history of our community that the solar wind has been equated with mucus. ",行星唔係靜態嘅嘢，佢哋一直改變緊 
"(Laughter) OK, so the effect, then, is that Earth may have been protected for billions of years, because we've had a magnetic field. ",佢哋會變化、會演化 
Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape. ,大氣層都一樣 
"Mars, on the other hand, has been unprotected because of its lack of magnetic field, and over billions of years, maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away to account for a transition from a habitable planet to the planet that we see today. ",我舉一個例子 
"Other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sails on a ship, enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself. ",呢個係我最鍾意嘅火星圖片 
The sails may gather energy from the solar wind. ,佢唔係最高解析度，亦唔係最靚 都唔係最新嘅相 但係佢顯示行星表面嘅河床 液態水流動而形成嘅河床 河床要上百上千甚至上萬年先能形成 
"It's an idea that has to be tested, but the effect and how it works seems apparent. ",依家嘅火星冇可能發生呢件事 
That's because we know energy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere here on Earth. ,依家嘅火星大氣層太薄太冷 導致水唔可以維持液態 
"That energy is conducted along magnetic field lines down into the polar regions, resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora. ",呢張相話我哋知火星嘅大氣層改變咗 而且改變好大 
"If you've ever experienced them, it's magnificent. ",佢由可居住嘅狀態變成依家咁 以前之所以可居住係因為 生命三大要素曾經喺嗰度出現過 
We know the energy is getting in. ,以前大氣層可以令地表維持液態水 但依家火星嘅大氣層去咗邊度？ 
We're trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way. ,一種理論係佢逃逸去到太空 
"So I've posed a problem for you here, but I don't have a solution yet. ",話大氣粒子有足夠嘅能量 走出行星嘅引力 散逸到太空，一去不返 
But we're working on it. How are we working on it? ,呢種現象喺有大氣層嘅星球上面 都會發生 
"Well, we've sent spacecraft to all three planets. ",彗星嘅尾就係大氣逃逸嘅最佳例子 
"Some of them are orbiting now, including the MAVEN spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars, which I'm involved with and which is led here, out of the University of Colorado. ",但係金星嘅大氣都會隨著時間逃逸 火星與地球都會 
It's designed to measure atmospheric escape. ,只不過係程度同規模嘅問題 
We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth. ,所以我哋要搵出逃逸嘅速率 先能夠解釋大氣層消失嘅現象 
"Once we have all our measurements, we can combine all these together, and we can understand how all three planets interact with their space environment, with the surroundings. ",大氣點得到逃逸所需嘅能量？ 
And we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for habitability or not. ,粒子點得到足以逃逸嘅能量？ 
"Once we have that answer, why should you care? ",如果我哋簡單嚟睇，有兩種方法 
"I mean, I care deeply ... ",第一，陽光 
"And financially as well, but deeply. ",大氣粒子吸收太陽發出嘅光 令到粒子增溫 
"(Laughter) First of all, an answer to this question will teach us more about these three planets, Venus, Earth and Mars, not only about how they interact with their environment today, but how they were billions of years ago, whether they were habitable long ago or not. ",係，我跳緊舞，不過粒子佢哋… （笑聲） 該煨，我喺自己嘅婚禮都冇跳過… 
It will teach us about atmospheres that surround us and that are close. ,（笑聲） 佢哋增溫就已經得到足夠嘅能量 去逃離引力 
"But moreover, what we learn from these planets can be applied to atmospheres everywhere, including planets that we're now observing around other stars. ",第二種方法係靠太陽風 
"For example, the Kepler spacecraft, which is built and controlled here in Boulder, has been observing a postage stamp-sized region of the sky for a couple years now, and it's found thousands of planets -- in one postage stamp-sized region of the sky that we don't think is any different from any other part of the sky. ",由太陽表面噴出嘅粒子、物質 會喺太陽系裡邊 以每秒 400 公里嘅速度呼嘯而過 太陽風暴嚟嗰陣有時仲會快啲添 佢哋穿梭行星之間 向著行星同行星嘅大氣飛去 佢哋可能畀到大氣粒子能量去逃逸 
"We've gone, in 20 years, from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system, to now having so many, that we don't know which ones to investigate first. ",呢個就係我覺得有興趣嘅嘢 因為呢個同適居性有關 
Any lever will help. ,我講過金髮女孩嘅故事 有兩樣嘢你哋要留意一下 而第二件事更加微妙︰ 
"In fact, based on observations that Kepler's taken and other similar observations, we now believe that, of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone, on average, every star has at least one planet. ",如果熊爸爸碗粥太熱 而熊媽媽碗粥太凍 咁熊寶寶碗粥咪應該更加凍？ 如果我哋跟著個趨勢諗 
"In addition to that, estimates suggest there are somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion of those planets that we would define as habitable in just our galaxy. ",呢件你成世人都以為嘅事 如果仔細諗下，可能冇咁簡單 
"We have the observations of those planets, but we just don't know which ones are habitable yet. ",當然，行星溫度取決於佢同太陽嘅距離 
"It's a little bit like being trapped on a red spot -- (Laughter) on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and desperately wanting to know more about them, wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you. ",就同適居性有關 
"You can't do that. You can't go there, not yet. ",但係我哋可能需要考慮其他事情 
"And so you have to use the tools that you've developed around you for Venus, Earth and Mars, and you have to apply them to these other situations, and hope that you're making reasonable inferences from the data, and that you're going to be able to determine the best candidates for habitable planets, and those that are not. ",可能碗本身都會決定個故事嘅結局︰ 亦即係乜為之啱啱好 
"In the end, and for now, at least, this is our red spot, right here. ",我可以同大家講好多 關於呢三個行星唔同嘅特性 點樣影響適居性 但係因為我研究嘅關係 同埋因為我係講者 （笑聲） 所以我想花一兩分鐘同你哋講下磁場 
"This is the only planet that we know of that's habitable, although very soon we may come to know of more. ",地球有磁場；金星同火星就冇 
"But for now, this is the only habitable planet, and this is our red spot. ",地球內部深處有一啲電導液體物質 呢啲電導液體物質流動嗰陣 會形成地球嘅磁場 
I'm really glad we're here. ,如果你有指南針，你就會知道邊邊係北 
Thanks. ,但金星同火星都冇磁場 
(Applause) ,如果你喺金星同火星上面用指南針 恭喜！你盪失路 
,（笑聲） 磁場會影響適居性嗎？ 
"Mom, who are these people? ",會點影響？ 
It was an innocent question from my young daughter Alia around the time when she was three. ,好多科學家認為行星嘅磁場 就好似大氣層嘅防護罩 令行星四周嘅太陽粒子改變方向 屬於力場效應嘅一種 亦都同粒子嘅電荷有關 
We were walking along with my husband in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls. ,我鐘意將佢比喻為 麫包鋪廚窗揭得開嘅玻璃蓋 
Alia was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall. ,（笑聲） 係嘅，之後睇呢段片嘅同事會發覺 呢個係我哋第一次 將太陽風等同為口水唾沫 
It featured the three rulers of the United Arab Emirates. ,（笑聲） 好，所以地球之所以 幾十億年嚟都受到保護 全因我哋有磁場 
"As she tucked in my side, I bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the UAE who had worked hard to develop their nation and preserve its unity. ",以至大氣冇辦法逃脫 
"She asked, ""Mom, why is it that here where we live, and back in Lebanon, where grandma and grandpa live, we never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls? ",另一方面因為火星冇磁場 火星嘅大氣冇保護 以致可能幾十億年嚟火星失去嘅大氣 足以令到呢個原本可以居住嘅行星 變成今日我哋睇到嘅樣 
"Is it because women are not important?"" ",其他科學家認為磁場可能更似船嘅帆 令行星可以同太陽風交換更多嘅能量 
"This is probably the hardest question I've had to answer in my years as a parent and in my 16-plus years of professional life, for that matter. ",磁場可以收集太陽風嘅能量 畀更加多嘅大氣脫逃到 
"I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon, the younger of two daughters to a very hard-working pilot and director of operations for the Lebanese Airlines and a super-supportive stay-at-home mom and grandma. ",呢個理論仲需要去證實 但係佢嘅效應同運作方式睇起來好明顯 
My father had encouraged my sister and I to pursue our education even though our culture emphasized at the time that it was sons and not daughters who should be professionally motivated. ,咁係因為我哋知道 太陽風嘅能量已經注入緊 我哋地球嘅大氣層度 
I was one of very few girls of my generation who left home at 18 to study abroad. ,嗰股能量順著磁力線傳導 向下導入兩極 化成無比璀璨嘅極光 
"My father didn't have a son, and so I, in a sense, became his. ",如果你有睇過極光，你就知佢有幾壯麗 
"Fast-forward a couple of decades, and I hope I didn't do too badly in making my father proud of his would-be son. ",我哋知道能量入緊嚟 
"As I got my Bachelor's and PhD in electrical engineering, did R and D in the UK, then consulting in the Middle East, I have always been in male-dominated environments. ",我哋想計下有幾多粒子逃逸 同埋睇下磁場係咪真係有影響 
"Truth be told, I have never found a role model I could truly identify with. ",我有一個問題畀大家 但係我未有答案，我們冇答案 
My mother's generation wasn't into professional leadership. ,但係我哋努力緊。我哋係點努力呢？ 
"There were some encouraging men along the way, but none knew the demands and pressures I was facing, pressures that got particularly acute when I had my own two beautiful children. ",我哋送咗太空船去呢三個行星度 
"And although Western women love to give us poor, oppressed Arab women advice, they live different lives with different constraints. ",有啲圍繞緊行星 包括 MAVEN 太空船 目前喺火星嘅軌道上面 呢項計劃我都有參與 而且係由呢度嘅科羅拉多大學帶領 
So Arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models. ,個計劃為咗測量大氣逃脫 
"We have had to juggle more than Arab men, and we have had to face more cultural rigidity than Western women. ",我哋喺金星同地球都有類似嘅量度 
"As a result, I would like to think that we poor, oppressed women actually have some useful, certainly hard-earned lessons to share, lessons that might turn out useful for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world. ",當我哋集齊所有嘅量度數據 我哋就可以將佢哋併埋一齊 就可以了解呢三個行星 點樣同周圍嘅太空環境互動 
Here are three of mine. ,我哋就可以決定磁場係咪對適居性重要 
"[""Convert their sh*t into your fuel.""] (Laughter) (Applause) There is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success: resilience. ",就算我哋有咗答案 但係點解你哋要咁在乎？ 
"Well, what exactly is resilience, and how do you develop it? ",我意思係，我好在乎 
I believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel. ,我亦都在乎研究經費 
"In my previous job, well before my current firm, I was working with a man we will call John. ",（笑聲） 首先，呢個問題嘅答案 會教我哋更多關於 金星、地球以及火星嘅事 唔單止包括佢哋點樣同現今嘅環境互動 仲包括佢哋幾十億以前嘅狀態 同埋佢哋好耐以前係咪適合居住 
"I had teamed up with John and was working hard, hoping he would notice how great I was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm. ",答案會揭示大氣層嘅嘢 
"I was, in addition to delivering on my consulting projects, writing passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment. ",另外，我哋從呢幾個行星嘅 大氣層學到嘅知識 可以應用喺其他星球嘅大氣層度 包括我哋觀察緊嘅 幾個環繞著其他恆星嘅行星 
"One day, I got to present my research to a roomful of MBA students. ",舉個例子，喺波德呢度 建造同埋控制嘅哈勃太空望遠鏡 已經好幾年觀察緊 一塊郵票咁大嘅天空範圍 佢目前已經喺郵票咁大嘅天空裏面 發現咗幾千個行星 而我哋唔覺呢塊天空 同其他天空有咩唔同 
John was part of the audience listening for the first time to the details of my study. ,廿年裏邊 我哋由一個太陽系以外嘅 行星都唔認識 到依家知道有咁多行星 我哋都唔知應該由邊度開始探索 
"As I proceeded with my presentation, I could see John in the corner of my eye. ",任何幫手都歡迎 
He had turned a dark shade of pink and had slid under his chair in apparent shame. ,其實，跟據哈勃太空望遠鏡得到嘅觀察 加上其他類似嘅觀測，我哋宜家相信 剩係我哋銀河系二千億個星裡邊 平均每個恆星至少有一個行星 
I finished my presentation to an applauding audience and we rushed out and jumped into the car. ,除此之外，單單喺我哋嘅銀河 我哋估計有大概四百億 到一千億個行星係適居嘅 
There he exploded. ,我哋得到呢啲行星嘅觀測資料 但係我哋仲未知邊一個係適合居住嘅 
"What you did up there was unacceptable! 
You are a consultant, not an activist! ",有點似被困喺台上嘅呢塊紅地氈一樣 （笑聲） 但係你又知道仲有其他世界存在 你又極想了解佢哋 你又想調查睇下有冇一兩個星球 好似自己嘅星球 
"I said, ""John, I don't understand. ",但係你就係做唔到，你去唔到 
"I presented a couple of gender parity indices, and some conclusions about the Arab world. ",所以你要用上 為到金星、地球同火星開發嘅工具 你要將工具用喺其他情況度 並確保能夠從數據裏面作出合理嘅推斷 從而揀出最有可能適居嘅行星 同埋搵出最冇可能適居嘅行星 
"Yes, we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index, but what is it that I said or presented that was not factual?"" ",最終，同埋至少目前 呢個就係我哋嘅紅地氈，就喺呢度 
"To which he replied, ""The whole premise of your study is wrong. ",呢個係目前我哋所知唯一適居嘅行星 雖然好快我哋可能會發現仲有其他嘅 
"What you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society."" ",但係目前，呢個係唯一適居嘅行星 呢個就係我哋嘅紅地氈 
"He paused, then added, ""When women have children, their place is in the home."" ",我真係好高興我哋都喺度 
"Time stood still for a long while, and all I could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was: ""You can forget about that partnership, Leila. ",多謝 
"It's just never going to happen."" ",（掌聲） 
"It took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications, but once I did, I reached three conclusions. ",
"One, that these were his issues, his complexes. ",「媽咪，呢啲係咩人啊？」 
"There may be many like him in our society, but I would never let their issues become mine. ",呢個天真嘅問題喺我細女 Alia 喺大概三歲個時提出嚟嘅 
"Two, that I needed another sponsor, and fast. ",當時我哋同我先生一齊 喺 Abu Dhabi 嘅一間大型商場行街 
"(Laughter) I got one, by the way, and boy, was he great. ",Alia 望住掛喺 商場正中央高處嘅巨幅海報 
"And three, that I would get to show John what women with children can do. ",上面有阿拉伯聯合酋長國嘅三位酋長 
I apply this lesson equally well to my personal life. ,佢匿埋我嘅身後 我彎低腰，同佢講 佢哋係阿聯酋嘅酋長 佢哋努力發展佢哋嘅國家 維護國家嘅統一 
"As I have progressed in my career, I have received many words of encouragement, but I have also often been met by women, men and couples who have clearly had an issue with my husband and I having chosen the path of a dual-career couple. ",佢問 ︰「媽咪，點解喺度 同埋喺公公婆婆住嘅黎巴嫩， 我哋都冇見到有女強人嘅相掛喺牆上， 
"So you get this well-meaning couple who tells you straight out at a family gathering or at a friends gathering, that, come on, you must know you're not a great mom, given how much you're investing in your career, right? ",係唔係因為女性唔重要？」 
I would lie if I said these words didn't hurt. ,呢個大概係我為人母以來 同埋我 16 年職業生涯中最難答嘅問題 
"My children are the most precious thing to me, and the thought that I could be failing them in any way is intolerable. ",我喺黎巴嫩嘅家鄉長大 我係屋企嘅細妹 長大之後做咗一位飛行員 到後嚟黎巴嫩航空運行總監 再之後成為全職媽媽同抱孫 
"But just like I did with John, I quickly reminded myself that these were their issues, their complexes. ",我爸爸鼓勵我哋兩姊妹去追求學業 雖然當時我哋嘅文化認為 只有男仔而非女仔 先可獲得深造嘅機會 
"So instead of replying, I gave back one of my largest smiles as I saw, in flashing light, the following sign in my mind's eye. ",我係我嗰代人其中一個為數不多嘅 女仔喺 18 歲出國留學 
"[Be happy, it drives people crazy.] (Applause) You see, as a young woman in these situations, you have two options. ",我爸爸膝下無子 所以喺某種程度上，我就係佢嘅仔 
"You can either decide to internalize these negative messages that are being thrown at you, to let them make you feel like a failure, like success is way too hard to ever achieve, or you can choose to see that others' negativity is their own issue, and instead transform it into your own personal fuel. ",如果時光可以倒流幾十年 我希望自己成為爸爸自豪嘅「仔」 
"I have learned to always go for option two, and I have found that it has taken me from strength to strength. ",當我取得電氣工程嘅學士、博士學位 喺英國做研發，喺中東做技術顧問 我一直都處於由男人掌控嘅環境 
And it's true what they say: success is the best revenge. ,老實講，我從未搵到我真心認同嘅榜樣 
Some women in the Middle East are lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career. ,我媽媽嗰代人，冇女人擠身到領導層 
"Correction: I should say ""smart enough,"" because who you marry is your own choice, and you'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career. ",我一直都遇到一啲好好人嘅男上司 但係冇一個人知道我嘅需要同壓力 特別係有咗兩個細路之後雪上加霜 
"Still today, the Arab man is not an equal contributor in the home. ",雖然西方女人樂意畀建議我 呢啲貧窮、受壓迫嘅阿拉伯女人 但係佢哋嘅生活同制肘同我哋截然不同 
"It's simply not expected by our society, and even frowned upon as not very manly. ",所以我呢一代嘅阿拉伯女性 必須要成為自己嘅榜樣 
"As for the Arab woman, our society still assumes that her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity of her children and husband. ",我哋需要比阿拉伯男性能加能幹 必須要承受比西方女性更嚴重嘅偏見 
She mostly exists for her family. ,因此，我認為我哋 呢啲貧窮、受壓迫嘅女人 有一啲有用、來之不易嘅經驗要分享 呢啲經驗可能會 對渴望立足於當今世界嘅人有用 
"Things are changing, but it will take time. ",以下喺我嘅三個經驗 
"For now, it means that the professional Arab woman has to somehow maintain the perfect home, make sure that her children's every need is being taken care of and manage her demanding career. ",[ 將佢哋嘅垃圾（負能量） 變成你嘅燃料（動力） ] （笑聲） （掌聲） 以下詞語受每個人 奉為成功嘅不二法門： 堅忍 
"To achieve this, I have found the hard way that you need to apply your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life. ",但「堅忍」實際係乜嘢，又要點培養？ 
You need to work your life. ,我堅信堅忍就係將 負能量轉化為動力嘅能力 
Here is how I do this in my personal life. ,好耐之前我喺前東家工作 我同一個男同事，我哋叫佢 John 
One thing to know about the Middle East is that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help. ,我同 John 搭檔，我好努力工作 希望佢可以意識到我有幾咁出色 咁佢就會支持我喺公司裏面同人搭檔 
The challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively. ,當時，除咗交我嘅顧問報告 我仲好有熱情研究女性嘅經濟權力 
"Just like I would in my business life, I have based the selection of who would support me with my children while I'm at work on a strong referral. ",有一日，我要向成間房嘅 工管碩士生報告研究 
Cristina had worked for four years with my sister and the quality of her work was well-established. ,John 係其中一位聽眾 佢第一次聽我研究嘅內容 
"She is now an integral member of our family, having been with us since Alia was six months old. ",當我繼續我嘅報告時 我睇到 John 
"She makes sure that the house is running smoothly while I'm at work, and I make sure to empower her in the most optimal conditions for her and my children, just like I would my best talent at work. ",佢面色漲紅 好似羞愧咁癱坐喺張椅度 
"This lesson applies whatever your childcare situation, whether an au pair, nursery, part-time nanny that you share with someone else. ",當報告完畢，聽眾拍手 我哋飛奔出去，坐上車 
"Choose very carefully, and empower. ",佢突然之間情緒爆發咁 
"If you look at my calendar, you will see every working day one and a half hours from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time blocked and called ""family time."" ",「你啱啱講嘅嘢令人難以接受！ 
This is sacred time. ,你係顧問，唔係搞社運！」 
I have done this ever since Alia was a baby. ,我講︰「John，我唔明， 
"I do everything in my power to protect this time so that I can be home by then to spend quality time with my children, asking them about their day, checking up on homework, reading them a bedtime story and giving them lots of kisses and cuddles. ",我舉出咗幾個性別平等指數 同埋一啲關於阿拉伯世界嘅結論。 
"If I'm traveling, in whatever the time zone, I use Skype to connect with my children even if I am miles away. ",冇錯，喺指數上 我哋依家確實處於劣勢， 但點可以否認我嘅報告呢？」 
"Our son Burhan is five years old, and he's learning to read and do basic maths. ",佢反駁︰ 「你成個研究嘅前提都係錯嘅， 
Here's another confession: I have found that our daughter is actually more successful at teaching him these skills than I am. ,無異於玩火自焚， 破壞我哋社會結構。」 
"(Laughter) It started as a game, but Alia loves playing teacher to her little brother, and I have found that these sessions actually improve Burhan's literacy, increase Alia's sense of responsibility, and strengthen the bonding between them, a win-win all around. ",佢停咗一下，又繼續講 「女人有咗細路之後， 家庭就係歸宿。」 
The successful Arab women I know have each found their unique approach to working their life as they continue to shoulder the lion's share of responsibility in the home. ,時間繼續流逝 混亂中我唯一諗到、重複嘅係： 「Leila，你可以忘記呢段搭檔關係， 
But this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother. ,佢已經成為過去。」 
This is also about being in the present. ,我用咗幾日去完全消化呢件事 後來，我得出咗三個結論 
"When I am with my children, I try to leave work out of our lives. ",第一，呢啲係佢嘅問題 係佢糾纏 
"Instead of worrying about how many minutes I can spend with them every day, I focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments, moments where I'm seeing my kids, hearing them, connecting with them. ",可能呢個社會中有好多人同佢一樣嘅人 但係我冇必要令到佢成為我嘅問題 
"[""Join forces, don't compete.""] Arab women of my generation have not been very visible in the public eye as they grew up. ",第二，我需要快啲搵到另一個贊助人 
"This explains, I think, to some extent, why you find so few women in politics in the Arab world. ",（笑聲） 順帶一提，我搵到咗一個 仲係個好男仔 
"The upside of this, however, is that we have spent a lot of time developing a social skill behind the scenes, in coffee shops, in living rooms, on the phone, a social skill that is very important to success: networking. ",第三，我想畀 John 睇到 人母都可以事業有成 
I would say the average Arab woman has a large network of friends and acquaintances. ,我將呢個經驗好好咁實踐喺個人生活 
The majority of those are also women. ,當我事業有成 我聽到好多鼓勵之詞 但係都有好多男人、女人、夫妻 對我哋夫妻都外出工作嘅選擇 感到不解 
"In the West, it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women hoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room. ",呢啲人會喺家庭聚會、朋友聚會上面 話你唔係個好媽媽 因為你將好多心機擺喺工作裏邊 
This leads to the much-spoken-about competitive behavior between professional women. ,如果我話呢啲話唔傷人，係呃人 
"If there's only room for one woman at the top, then you can't make room for others, much less lift them up. ",仔女對我嚟講係最珍貴嘅 任何覺得我會辜負仔女嘅諗法 都難以忍受 
"Arab women, generally speaking, have not fallen for this psychological trap. ",但係就好似我對 John 咁 我好快就提醒自己呢啲係佢哋嘅問題 係佢哋糾結 
"Faced with a patriarchal society, they have found that by helping each other out, all benefit. ",所以與其回答 我只係笑臉相迎 因為有一樣嘢浮現喺我腦海裏面 
"In my previous job, I was the most senior woman in the Middle East, so one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues couldn't bring many benefits and that I should instead invest my time developing my relationships with male seniors and peers. ",[ 做人最緊要開心。] （掌聲） 身陷呢啲情況嘅年輕女人 有兩個選擇 
Yet two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women. ,一係選擇接收負能量 令你覺得自己係失敗者 就好似成功永遠都遙不可及 抑或係你視人哋嘅消極與你無關 並且將佢嘅消極轉化成你嘅積極 
It was the head of marketing who initially suggested I be considered as a young global leader to the World Economic Forum. ,我往往會選擇第二個 我意識到咁會令到我內心更加強大 
"She was familiar with my media engagements and my publications, and when she was asked to voice her opinion, she highlighted my name. ",至理名言： 成功係最好嘅復仇 
"It was a young consultant, a Saudi lady and friend, who helped me sell my first project in Saudi Arabia, a market I was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman. ",一啲中東嘅女性可以嫁畀 一個支持佢哋事業嘅人 實在係三生有幸 
"She introduced me to a client, and that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in Saudi. ",糾正：應該係「有智慧」至真 因為你同邊個結婚，係你自己嘅選擇 如果想有事業有長遠發展 你最好搵返個支持你嘅人 
"Today, I have two senior women on my team, and I see making them successful as key to my own success. ",時至今日，阿拉伯男性依然 冇對家庭承擔起同等應負嘅責任 
"Women continue to advance in the world, not fast enough, but we're moving. ",當然我哋嘅社會都冇期待過 甚至認為係一種冇男子氣概嘅行為 
"The Arab world, too, is making progress, despite many recent setbacks. ",至於阿拉伯女性，我哋嘅社會依然認為 一個女人嘅幸福應該嚟自於仔女同丈夫 
"Just this year, the UAE appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet, for a total of eight female ministers. ",女性為佢嘅家庭而生 
"That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet, and more than many developed countries can claim. ",但一切都會改變，只係需要時間啫 
This is today my daughter Alia's favorite picture. ,咁意味著，依家阿拉伯嘅職業女性 既要想辦法維繫完美家庭 又要保證佢嘅細路仔嘅所有需求 得到滿足 同時又要為高要求嘅工作拼搏 
"This is the result, no doubt, of great leadership, but it is also the result of strong Arab women not giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries. ",為咗做到曬以上三樣嘢 我搵到一個方法 使你應用來之不易嘅職業技能 到個人生活上 
"It is the result of Arab women deciding every day like me to convert shit into fuel, to work their life to keep work out of their life, and to join forces and not compete. ",你需要活出你嘅生活 
"As I look to the future, my hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage some 20, 30 years from now are that she be as proud to call herself her mother's daughter as her father's daughter. ",呢個就係我生活中嘅做法 
"My hopes for my son are that by then, the expression ""her mother's son"" or ""mama's boy"" would have taken on a completely different meaning. ",有一件關於中東嘅事係你要知道嘅 就係幾乎每個家庭都請得起家庭工 
Thank you. ,因此難題就變成咗點樣有效招聘 
(Applause) ,就好似作為商人，我會傾向於選擇 既喺我工作嗰時 可以幫我照顧細路仔嘅人 又係受人強烈推薦嘅 
,Cristina 同我姐姐做咗四年工 佢嘅表現無可挑剔 
So this is my niece. ,依家佢係我哋家庭不可缺少嘅一份子 從 Alia 6 個月大個時就同我們一齊生活 
Her name is Yahli. ,佢確保我工作嗰時屋企得到適切打理 而我會為佢提供一個 對佢同我細路仔都最為適合嘅環境 就好似我會喺工作中做到最好一樣 
She is nine months old. ,呢個經驗對兒童都啱用 無論你用緊嘅係互惠生、托兒所 抑或兼職保姆 
"Her mum is a doctor, and her dad is a lawyer. ",看護人當然要非常謹慎咁揀 但亦都要放手畀看護人 
"By the time Yahli goes to college, the jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different. ",如果你嚟睇睇我嘅日曆 你就會發現每個工作日嘅 晚上 7 點到 8 點半 呢一個半鐘 都劃做「家庭時間」 
"In 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on the future of work. ",呢個係「神聖」嘅時間 
They concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines. ,從 Alia 係嬰兒嗰時我就開始咁做 
Machine learning is the technology that's responsible for most of this disruption. ,我盡我一切所能去分配呢段時間 咁我就可以喺屋企 好好同我嘅細路仔共處 譬如問下佢哋今日過得點樣 檢查佢哋嘅功課 同佢哋講一個睡前故事 錫下佢哋、攬下佢哋 
It's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence. ,如果我去咗旅遊，無論喺邊個時區 儘管相隔千里 我都會用 Skype 同細路仔聯絡 
It allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do. ,我哋嘅仔仔 Burhan 依家五歲大 佢喺度學緊做簡單嘅數學題 
"My company, Kaggle, operates on the cutting edge of machine learning. ",我又要坦白另一件事： 我發現我哋個女比我更有效教仔仔數學 
We bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia. ,（笑聲） 一開始只係一個遊戲 但 Alia 鍾意扮成老師教弟弟 而我發現呢個過程提高咗 Burhan 識字能力 增加咗 Alia 嘅責任感 同時令佢哋嘅感情更加深厚 咁係一件雙贏嘅事 
"This gives us a unique perspective on what machines can do, what they can't do and what jobs they might automate or threaten. ",我所知道嘅成功阿拉伯女性 都搵到獨特嘅方法去過佢哋嘅生活 同時仲要承受家庭重擔 
Machine learning started making its way into industry in the early '90s. ,但係呢個唔單只關乎同時勝任 職業女性同母親呢兩種角色 
It started with relatively simple tasks. ,仲關乎活在當下 
"It started with things like assessing credit risk from loan applications, sorting the mail by reading handwritten characters from zip codes. ",當我同我嘅細路仔一齊嗰時 我盡力唔掂工作 
"Over the past few years, we have made dramatic breakthroughs. ",與其擔心每日有幾多時間 可以同佢哋一齊 我會將天倫之樂轉化為美好嘅回憶 所謂天倫之樂，就係我望住細路仔 聆聽佢哋心聲，同佢哋喺埋一齊 
"Machine learning is now capable of far, far more complex tasks. ",[ 合作好過競爭。] 我呢一代嘅阿拉伯女性 冇好好得到公眾關注 
"In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community to build an algorithm that could grade high-school essays. ",咁就可以解釋 點解阿拉伯世界咁少女性從政 
The winning algorithms were able to match the grades given by human teachers. ,但係，咁有一個好處 通過花費大量時間喺幕後 包括咖啡店、客廳 同電話裏面 我哋發展出 一種對成功至關重要嘅社會技能： 網絡 
"Last year, we issued an even more difficult challenge. ",我可以講一般嘅阿拉伯女性 都有龐大嘅社交網絡 
Can you take images of the eye and diagnose an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy? ,呢個網絡當中主要都係女性 
"Again, the winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses given by human ophthalmologists. ",喺西方，有野心嘅女人 似乎經常會將自己同人哋比較 希望被認受為最為出類拔萃嘅女人 
"Now, given the right data, machines are going to outperform humans at tasks like this. ",呢個就引伸出老生常談嘅 職業女性之間嘅競爭行為 
"A teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career. ",如果最高職位只能夠畀一位女性坐 其他人就冇機會上，更加唔好提拔 
"An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes. ",一般嚟講，阿拉伯女性 冇踩入呢個心理陷阱 
A machine can read millions of essays or see millions of eyes within minutes. ,反而生活喺一個男尊女卑嘅社會 佢哋發現互相幫助 會令所有人受惠 
"We have no chance of competing against machines on frequent, high-volume tasks. ",我之前份工嘅職級 係中東國家婦女之中最高 所以有人會認為 我投資喺在職婦女身上毫無好處 反而認為我應該將自己嘅時間 發展同男性前輩、同輩嘅關係 
But there are things we can do that machines can't do. ,但我兩個最大嘅突破 都源自其他女性嘅支持 
Where machines have made very little progress is in tackling novel situations. ,一位市場推廣巨頭最初建議 我以年輕全球領袖嘅身分 出席世界經濟論壇 
They can't handle things they haven't seen many times before. ,佢熟悉我嘅媒體活動同出版物 當佢被邀請發表意見個時 佢提到我︰ 
The fundamental limitations of machine learning is that it needs to learn from large volumes of past data. ,「一位任職顧問嘅年輕沙特女性朋友 幫我推銷沙特第一個項目。 嗰時我因為女性身份屢屢碰壁， 
"Now, humans don't. ",佢將我介紹畀一位顧客， 到我後來接手做好多沙特嘅項目。 
We have the ability to connect seemingly disparate threads to solve problems we've never seen before. ,依家，我嘅團隊裏面有兩位資深女性， 我將佢哋嘅成功視為 自己成功嘅關鍵。」 
"Percy Spencer was a physicist working on radar during World War II, when he noticed the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar. ",女性繼續進步 雖然唔夠快，但係我哋一直都進步緊 
He was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent -- any guesses? -- the microwave oven. ,同樣，阿拉伯世界 雖然困難重重，都有進步 
"Now, this is a particularly remarkable example of creativity. ",就喺今年，阿聯酋內閣 任命五位女性大臣 令女性大臣總共有八位 
But this sort of cross-pollination happens for each of us in small ways thousands of times per day. ,所占比例大概係內閣人數嘅 28％ 遠多於好多發達國家政府內閣嘅比例 
"Machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations, and this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate. ",呢張係我嘅女 Alia 最鍾意嘅相 
So what does this mean for the future of work? ,毫無疑問，呢個係 優秀領導之下嘅豐碩成果 亦都係堅強嘅阿拉伯女性嘅奮鬥成果 佢哋從未放棄，為打破藩籬而孜孜不倦 
"The future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question: To what extent is that job reducible to frequent, high-volume tasks, and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations? ",呢個結果反映阿拉伯女性好似我咁 每日將負能量轉換成動力 活出佢哋嘅生活，而平時唔講工作 唔鬥個你死我活，反之一齊合作 
"On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines are getting smarter and smarter. ",當我展望未來 我希望佢我嘅女 二三十年之後企喺呢個舞臺上 因為自己係佢父母嘅女而自豪 
Today they grade essays. They diagnose certain diseases. ,我希望我嘅仔長大之後 「佢媽媽嘅仔」或者「媽咪嘅乖仔」 兩種嘅表述會有截然不同嘅意義 
"Over coming years, they're going to conduct our audits, and they're going to read boilerplate from legal contracts. ",多謝 
Accountants and lawyers are still needed. ,（掌聲） 
"They're going to be needed for complex tax structuring, for pathbreaking litigation. ",
But machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by. ,呢個係我嘅姪女/外甥女 
"Now, as mentioned, machines are not making progress on novel situations. ",佢叫做 Yahli 
The copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers' attention. ,佢依家 9 個月大 
It has to stand out from the crowd. ,佢嘅媽咪係醫生，爹哋係律師 
"Business strategy means finding gaps in the market, things that nobody else is doing. ",等到 Yahli 去返大學嗰時 佢父母依家做嘅工作將會有巨變 
"It will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing campaigns, and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy. ",牛津大學嘅研究人員喺2013年 做咗一個關於未來工作嘅研究 
"So Yahli, whatever you decide to do, let every day bring you a new challenge. ",佢哋推斷差不多每兩份工作 就有一份會面臨畀機器取代嘅危險 
"If it does, then you will stay ahead of the machines. ",「機器學習」科技就係呢種威脅嘅元兇 
Thank you. ,佢係人工智能最強勁嘅學科分支 
(Applause) ,佢令到機器可以從數據中學習 模仿有啲人類會做嘅事 
,我間公司 Kaggle 企喺機器學習嘅最前線 
"There's this fact that I love that I read somewhere once, that one of the things that's contributed to homo sapiens' success as a species is our lack of body hair -- that our hairlessness, our nakedness combined with our invention of clothing, gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose. ",我哋匯聚咗成千上萬嘅專家 嚟解決工業、學術嘅重大問題 
And now we've evolved to the point where we can't survive without clothing. ,因為咁樣令我哋對機器有獨特嘅見解 知道乜嘢機器可以做 同乜嘢唔可以做 乜嘢工可以自動化同乜嘢工受到威脅 
"And it's more than just utility, now it's a communication. ",機器學習喺90年代初期喺工業起步 
"Everything that we choose to put on is a narrative, a story about where we've been, what we're doing, who we want to be. ",一開始做啲比較簡單嘅任務 
I was a lonely kid. ,例如評估貸款申請嘅信用風險 識別手寫嘅郵政編碼嚟揀信 
"I didn't have an easy time finding friends to play with, and I ended up making a lot of my own play. ",喺過去幾年，我哋取得驚人嘅突破 
I made a lot of my own toys. ,依家機器學習已經做到更加複雜嘅任務 
It began with ice cream. ,2012 年， Kaggle 考驗佢嘅團隊 要佢哋設計一條批改高中習作嘅算法 
"There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown, and they served ice cream from behind the counter in these giant, five-gallon, cardboard tubs. ",獲勝算法嘅打分 能夠同人類老師嘅打分相符 
"And someone told me -- I was eight years old -- someone told me that when they were done with those tubs, they washed them out and kept them in the back, and if you asked they would give you one. ",舊年，我哋提出咗更難嘅挑戰 
"It took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage, but I did, and they did. ",你可唔可以僅憑眼睛嘅圖像就診斷出 病人患有「糖尿病視網膜病變」？ 
They gave me one -- I went home with this beautiful cardboard tub. ,同樣，勝出嘅算法做嘅診斷結果 可以同人類眼科醫生嘅診斷結果符合 
"I was trying to figure out what I could do with this exotic material -- metal ring, top and bottom. ",依家只要輸入正確數據，機器就可以 比人類做好似呢啲工作更加出色 
"I started turning it over in my head, and I realized, ""Wait a minute -- my head actually fits inside this thing."" ",喺 40 職業生涯入面 一位老師可以批改一萬份習作 
"(Laughter) Yeah, I cut a hole out, I put some acetate in there and I made myself a space helmet. ",一位眼科醫生可以為五萬雙眼睛診斷 
"(Laughter) I needed a place to wear the space helmet, so I found a refrigerator box a couple blocks from home. ",而一部機器可以喺幾分鐘之內 批改成千上萬份習作 或者檢查數以百萬對嘅眼睛 
"I pushed it home, and in my parents' guest room closet, I turned it into a spaceship. ",對於頻繁、大量嘅工作 我哋簡直無可能同機器競爭 
I started with a control panel out of cardboard. ,但係有啲嘢係機器無法取代我哋嘅 
I cut a hole for a radar screen and put a flashlight underneath it to light it. ,就係當要處理新嘅情況時 機器往往一籌莫展 
"I put a view screen up, which I offset off the back wall -- and this is where I thought I was being really clever -- without permission, I painted the back wall of the closet black and put a star field, which I lit up with some Christmas lights I found in the attic, and I went on some space missions. ",佢哋只可以處理多次出現嘅情況 
"A couple years later, the movie ""Jaws"" came out. ",機器學習嘅基本限制在於 佢需要通過以前大量嘅數據嚟學習 
"I was way too young to see it, but I was caught up in ""Jaws"" fever, like everyone else in America at the time. ",但係，人類唔需要 
"There was a store in my town that had a ""Jaws"" costume in their window, and my mom must have overheard me talking to someone about how awesome I thought this costume was, because a couple days before Halloween, she blew my freaking mind by giving me this ""Jaws"" costume. ",我哋有能力串連看似無關嘅線索 嚟解決我哋從未遇見嘅情況 
"Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope for people of a certain age to complain that kids these days have no idea how good they have it, but let me just show you a random sampling of entry-level kids' costumes you can buy online right now ... ",Percy Spencer 係一名研究 雷達嘅物理學家 二戰時期佢發現磁電管可以融化朱古力 
"... and this is the ""Jaws"" costume my mom bought for me. ",佢將自己對電磁輻射嘅理解 同烹飪知識結合起嚟 發明咗..要唔要估下？就係微波爐 
"(Laughter) This is a paper-thin shark face and a vinyl bib with the poster of ""Jaws"" on it. ",呢個發明嘅例子，令人拍案叫絕 
(Laughter) And I loved it. ,但係呢種「異花傳粉」每一天都會 喺我哋生活細微處發生無數次 
"A couple years later, my dad took me to a film called ""Excalibur."" ",要處理未知情況嗰陣 機器比唔上我哋 咁樣做成咗機器取代 人類工作嘅基本限制 
"I actually got him to take me to it twice, which is no small thing, because it is a hard, R-rated film. ",所以佢對未來工作嘅意義係乜嘢？ 
But it wasn't the blood and guts or the boobs that made me want to go see it again. ,任何工作嘅前景都取決於一個問題 呢份工可以減輕頻密又 大量嘅任務到乜嘢程度 又喺幾大程度上會遇到未知情況？ 
They helped -- (Laughter) It was the armor. ,機器處理頻繁又大量嘅任務越來越叻 
"The armor in ""Excalibur"" was intoxicatingly beautiful to me. ",依家佢哋可以批改習作、診斷一啲疾病 
"These were literally knights in shining, mirror-polished armor. ",幾年之後，雖然機器可以幫我哋做審計 閱讀法律合同中嘅樣板 
"And moreover, the knights in ""Excalibur"" wear their armor everywhere. ",但我哋依然需要會計師同律師 
"All the time -- they wear it at dinner, they wear it to bed. ",分析複雜嘅稅務架構 探索訴訟法律 但係機器會降低工作對人嘅要求 
"(Laughter) I was like, ""Are they reading my mind? ",令人更難就業 
"I want to wear armor all the time!"" ",依家，好似之前所講 機器喺處理未知情況方面毫無進展 
"(Laughter) So I went back to my favorite material, the gateway drug for making, corrugated cardboard, and I made myself a suit of armor, replete with the neck shields and a white horse. ",市場營銷為了捉住消費者嘅眼球 
"Now that I've oversold it, here's a picture of the armor that I made. ",需要脫穎而出 
"(Laughter) (Applause) Now, this is only the first suit of armor I made inspired by ""Excalibur."" ",佢哋嘅策略係要喺市場夾縫中搵到商機 尋找獨一無二之處 
"A couple of years later, I convinced my dad to embark on making me a proper suit of armor. ",只有人類才能喺幕後策劃市場營銷 只有人類才能不斷升級商業戰略 
"Over about a month, he graduated me from cardboard to roofing aluminum called flashing and still, one of my all-time favorite attachment materials, POP rivets. ",所以 Yahli，無論你決定做乜嘢 請你每日都要面對新挑戰 
"We carefully, over that month, constructed an articulated suit of aluminum armor with compound curves. ",咁樣你就可以比機器遙遙領先 
"We drilled holes in the helmet so that I could breathe, and I finished just in time for Halloween and wore it to school. ",多謝 
"Now, this is the one thing in this talk that I don't have a slide to show you, because no photo exists of this armor. ",（掌聲） 
"I did wear it to school, there was a yearbook photographer patrolling the halls, but he never found me, for reasons that are about to become clear. ",
There were things I didn't anticipate about wearing a complete suit of aluminum armor to school. ,我好鍾意一種曾經睇過嘅講法 係話人類喺物種進化上 成功嘅其中一個因素 係多得我哋無體毛 我哋因為無體毛，加上發明咗衫 我哋可以調節體溫 以至無論喺咩氣候之下都生存到 
"In third period math, I was standing in the back of class, and I'm standing in the back of class because the armor did not allow me to sit down. ",依家我哋已經進化到冇衫就生存唔到 
(Laughter) This is the first thing I didn't anticipate. ,同時衫已經唔凈係衫 佢仲有表達嘅用途 
"And then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned about halfway through the class and says, ""Are you feeling OK?"" ",所有我哋著上身嘅服飾 都喺度訴說緊我哋嘅嘢 例如透露緊我哋曾經去過邊度 我哋做緊乜嘢、我哋想成為乜嘢人咁 
"I'm thinking, ""Are you kidding? Am I feeling OK? ",細個時我好孤單 
"I'm wearing a suit of armor! I am having the time of my --"" And I'm just about to tell her how great I feel, when the classroom starts to list to the left and disappear down this long tunnel, and then I woke up in the nurse's office. ",我一直都好難搵到細路仔同我玩 於是我整咗好多遊戲同自己玩 
"I had passed out from heat exhaustion, wearing the armor. ",我為自己做咗好多玩具 
"And when I woke up, I wasn't embarrassed about having passed out in front of my class, I was wondering, ""Who took my armor? Where's my armor?"" ",最初係從雪糕開始 
"OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years, some colleagues and I get hired to make a show for Discovery Channel, called ""MythBusters."" ",我家鄉有一間 Baskin Robbins 喺櫃台後面，佢哋將雪糕 裝喺呢啲超大、五加侖裝嘅紙桶裏面 
"And over 14 years, I learn on the job how to build experimental methodologies and how to tell stories about them for television. ",喺我八歲嗰時，有人話畀我知 佢哋用完紙桶之後 會將紙桶洗乾淨，放喺後面 如果你問佢哋，佢哋會畀一個紙桶你 我用咗幾個星期去鼓起勇氣去問 
I also learn early on that costuming can play a key role in this storytelling. ,最後我問咗，佢哋又畀咗個我 
"I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color and narrative clarity to the stories we're telling. ",我就摞住呢個靚紙桶返咗屋企 
"And then we do an episode called ""Dumpster Diving,"" and I learn a little bit more about the deeper implications of what costuming means to me. ",我喺度諗要點處理呢個新奇嘅嘢 有金屬環、蓋同埋底 
"In the episode ""Dumpster Diving,"" the question we were trying to answer is: Is jumping into a dumpster as safe as the movies would lead you to believe? ",我將佢倒轉戴喺頭上 之後我諗，「等陣， 呢樣嘢啱啱好戴得落我個頭。」 
(Laughter) The episode was going to have two distinct parts to it. ,（笑聲） 冇錯，我剪咗個窿 放咗啲醋酸纖維落去 成個太空頭盔就咁大功告成！ 
One was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman into an air bag. ,（笑聲） 之後我諗我仲需要一部太空船 就喺距離屋企幾條街嘅地方 我搵到一個裝冰箱嘅紙皮箱 
And the second was the graduation to the experiment: we'd fill a dumpster full of material and we'd jump into it. ,我將佢推返屋企 之後喺我爸爸媽媽嘅客房個衣帽間裏面 我將佢整成一部太空船 
"I wanted to visually separate these two elements, and I thought, ""Well, for the first part we're training, so we should wear sweatsuits -- Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee' on the back of the sweatsuits. ",我先用紙皮箱整咗塊控制面板 
"That's for the training."" ",我剪咗一個圓形當做雷達顯示 同埋喺雷達後面放咗個電筒發光 
"But for the second part, I wanted something really visually striking -- ""I know! I'll dress as Neo from 'The Matrix.'"" (Laughter) So I went to Haight Street. ",我再利用牆壁做支撐，整咗個駕駛窗口 其實我真係覺得自己好機智 我擅自將衣帽間後面幅牆油黑佢 再用喺閣樓度搵到嘅聖誕燈 佈置到成個星空咁 之後我就去繼續幻想我嘅太空使命 
"I bought some beautiful knee-high, buckle boots. ",幾年之後，電影《大白鯊》上映 
"I found a long, flowing coat on eBay. ",雖然唔啱細路仔睇，但我對佢入曬迷 就好似當時其他美國人咁樣 
"I got sunglasses, which I had to wear contact lenses in order to wear. ",有件「大白鯊」服裝掛咗喺 我鎮上面嘅一間士多 我媽媽肯定係聽到我同人哋講 我覺得士多件衫幾咁型 所以喺萬聖節嘅前幾日 送咗我呢件大白鯊衫 件事係完全出乎曬我嘅意料 
"The day of the experiment shoot comes up, and I step out of my car in this costume, and my crew takes a look at me ... ",依家，我成日聽到 某個年齡層嘅人喺度抱怨 依家啲細路仔唔知自己嘅生活有幾好 咁就等我舉個簡單嘅例子嚟講下 呢啲細路入門級扮演服裝 係依家你喺網上可以買到嘅 
and start suppressing their church giggles. ,呢件就係… 
"They're like, ""(Laugh sound)."" ",我媽買畀我嘅大白鯊衫 （笑聲） 鯊魚塊面薄到好似張紙咁 圍嘴上面仲要黏住張《大白鯊》廣告 
And I feel two distinct things at this moment. ,（笑聲） 但我就係鍾意佢 
I feel total embarrassment over the fact that it's so nakedly clear to my crew that I'm completely into wearing this costume. ,幾年之後 爸爸帶我去睇一部叫做《聖劍》嘅電影 
"(Laughter) But the producer in my mind reminds myself that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo, that flowing coat is going to look beautiful behind me. ",事實上我叫佢帶我去睇兩次 而且對我嚟講係好大件事 因為呢部電影係一部限制級嘅 R 片 
"(Laughter) Five years into the ""MythBusters"" run, we got invited to appear at San Diego Comic-Con. ",不過唔係血腥場面、內臟 或者女性胸部吸引我去睇多一次 
I'd known about Comic-Con for years and never had time to go. ,雖然呢啲都幾有吸引力 （笑聲） 係盔甲吸引我 
This was the big leagues -- this was costuming mecca. ,我覺得《聖劍》嘅盔甲真係好靚好型 
People fly in from all over the world to show their amazing creations on the floor in San Diego. ,騎士著住好閃嘅 好似塊鏡咁反光嘅盔甲 
And I wanted to participate. ,仲有，騎士去到邊度都著住件盔甲 
"I decided that I would put together an elaborate costume that covered me completely, and I would walk the floor of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously. ",佢哋著住盔甲食飯，又著住盔甲瞓覺 
The costume I chose? ,（笑聲） 我就諗︰「唔通佢哋解讀緊我嘅思想？ 
Hellboy. ,我都想喺任何時候都著住件盔甲！」 
"That's not my costume, that's actually Hellboy. ",（笑聲） 所以我又返去搵我最鍾意嘅材料︰ 手工嘅材料 有波紋嘅硬紙皮 我同我自己整咗套盔甲 加咗護頸，配埋一匹白馬 
"(Laughter) But I spent months assembling the most screen-accurate Hellboy costume I could, from the boots to the belt to the pants to the right hand of doom. ",雖然我已經將佢賣咗 但我哋可以睇下張相 
I found a guy who made a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest and I put them on. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 呢個係我受到《聖劍》啓發 而整嘅唯一一套盔甲 
I even had contact lenses made in my prescription. ,幾年之後 我說服咗我爸爸動手整返件啱身嘅盔甲 
I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con and I can't even tell you how balls hot it was in that costume. ,大概過咗一個月，佢幫我升級咗材料 從硬紙皮 到叫做「遮雨板」嘅 鋁製屋頂材料 仲有一種我一直都好鍾意嘅連接材料︰ POP 鉚釘 
(Laughter) Sweating! I should've remembered this. ,成個月，我哋都喺度小心翼翼咁 整一套鋁製鉸接式 有好多混合波紋嘅盔甲 
"I'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes, and none of it matters because I'm totally in love. ",我哋喺頭盔度鑽咗幾個窿，方便我透氣 咁啱喺萬聖節之前整好咗 於是我就著住佢去返學 
"(Laughter) Not just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor, but also with the community of other costumers. ",依家，呢樣嘢冇幻燈片可以畀你哋睇到 因為我無呢套盔甲嘅相 
"It's not called costuming at Cons, it's called ""cosplay."" ",但我有著住佢去返學 當時有個年刊攝影師喺走廊度周圍影相 佢從來都冇搵到我 後來發覺係有原因嘅 
"Now ostensibly, cosplay means people who dress up as their favorite characters from film and television and especially anime, but it is so much more than that. ",有啲嘢喺我著住套鋁製盔甲 去返學個時完全無諗到嘅 
These aren't just people who find a costume and put it on -- they mash them up. ,當時係第三期數學班 我企喺課室嘅後面 因為我著住套盔甲根本就坐唔低 
They bend them to their will. ,（笑聲） 呢個係我冇預到嘅第一件事 
They change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions. ,之後我嘅老師好擔心咁望住我 隔住大概半個課室問我有冇事 
They're super clever and genius. ,我諗：老師你冇嘢掛？我有冇事？ 我依家著住套盔甲啊！ 
They let their freak flag fly and it's beautiful. ,我係度享受緊我…… 就喺我準備要話畀佢知我有幾爽嗰時 我見到成間課室開始向左傾斜 跟住就消失喺呢條長長嘅隧道 之後我喺校醫室醒返 
"(Laughter) But more than that, they rehearse their costumes. ",我因為套盔甲中暑虛脫而暈咗 
"At Comic-Con or any other Con, you don't just take pictures of people walking around. ",當我醒返嗰時 我冇因為喺成班同學面前暈低而尷尬 反而我諗，邊個摞走咗我套盔甲？ 我套盔甲喺邊度？ 
"You go up and say, ""Hey, I like your costume, can I take your picture?"" ",好，講緊幾年後 我同幾個同事一齊受聘請去 同探索頻道做一檔 叫做《流言終結者》嘅節目 
And then you give them time to get into their pose. ,大概有 14 年嘅時間 我都喺度學習點樣去訂立實驗方法 同埋點樣喺電視上面講故事 
They've worked hard on their pose to make their costume look great for your camera. ,同時我又好早就知道 服裝可以對講故事起到舉足輕重嘅作用 
And it's so beautiful to watch. ,我用服裝令我哋講述嘅故事 更加幽默、清晰，有喜劇效果、有色彩 
"At subsequent Cons, I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk as the Joker from ""The Dark Knight."" ",後來當我哋做一集《垃圾搜尋》 我又有更深一層嘅體會 我領悟到服裝對我有更深嘅意義 
"I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith from ""Lord of the Rings,"" and I actually frighten some children. ",喺《垃圾搜尋》呢一集 我哋想回答嘅問題係： 跳入一個大型垃圾裝卸卡車係唔係 真係好似電影裏面演嘅咁安全？ 
"I learned that ""hrr hrr hrr"" -- that head laugh that Chewbacca does. ",（笑聲） 呢一集係打算分成兩部份進行 
"And then I dressed up as No-Face from ""Spirited Away."" ",一部份係我哋接受特技演員嘅訓練 學識從建築物跳到氣墊上面 
"If you don't know about ""Spirited Away"" and its director, Hayao Miyazaki, first of all, you're welcome. ",而第二部份就係嚟真嘅 大型垃圾裝卸卡車會裝滿緩衝物料 俾我哋跳入去 
"(Laughter) This is a masterpiece, and one of my all-time favorite films. ",我想呢兩部份 做到唔同嘅視覺效果 之後我諗︰「好， 既然第一部份我哋喺度訓練緊， 咁我哋就應該著住運動衫。 唔得！不如將 『特技訓練生』印喺衫後面， 
It's about a young girl named Chihiro who gets lost in the spirit world in an abandoned Japanese theme park. ,話畀人知係訓練嘅。」 
And she finds her way back out again with the help of a couple of friends she makes -- a captured dragon named Haku and a lonely demon named No-Face. ,但係到咗第二部份 我想要視覺衝擊嘅效果 「我知道啦！ 我會著成《黑客帝國》 嘅 Neo 咁。」 （笑聲） 所以我就去咗海特街 
"No-Face is lonely and he wants to make friends, and he thinks the way to do it is by luring them to him and producing gold in his hand. ",買咗啲好靚、及膝、有皮帶扣嘅長靴 
"But this doesn't go very well, and so he ends up going on kind of a rampage until Chihiro saves him, rescues him. ",跟住我又喺 eBay 度搵到一件褸 
"So I put together a No-Face costume, and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con. ",仲有一副墨鏡 為咗戴墨鏡，我仲要特登戴隱形眼鏡 
And I very carefully practiced No-Face's gestures. ,做實驗嘅日子終於嚟嘞 我著住呢套衫落車 之後我嘅劇組人員都望住我 
I resolved I would not speak in this costume at all. ,個個人都喺度揞住嘴偷笑 
"When people asked to take my picture, I would nod and I would shyly stand next to them. ",就好似咁 （大笑聲） 
They would take the picture and then I would secret out from behind my robe a chocolate gold coin. ,呢一刻我有一種冰火兩重天嘅感覺 
"And at the end of the photo process, I'd make it appear for them. ",非常尷尬 因為喺我同事睇嚟 我對呢套衫已經癡迷到走火入魔 
"Ah, ah ah! -- like that. ",（笑聲） 不過我腦裏面把聲喺度提醒我 喺高速鏡頭嘅慢動作裏面 我件風褸迎風飄揚嗰時肯定好型 
And people were freaking out. ,（笑聲） 同《流言終結者》做咗五年節目之後 我哋收到聖地牙哥國際動漫展嘅邀請 
"Holy crap! Gold from No-Face! Oh my god, this is so cool! ",我都知道咗呢個動漫展好多年 但係都冇時間去 
And I'm feeling and I'm walking the floor and it's fantastic. ,呢場動漫展好比 服裝界嘅盛事、服裝界嘅麥加 
And about 15 minutes in something happens. ,啲人從世界各地飛過去 展示佢哋嘅驚世嘅作品 
"Somebody grabs my hand, and they put a coin back into it. ",我都想去參加 
"And I think maybe they're giving me a coin as a return gift, but no, this is one of the coins that I'd given away. ",我決定要精心製作一套 會將我從頭包到落腳嘅戰服 咁就冇人知道我喺 聖地牙哥國際動畫展嗰度 
I don't know why. ,我揀咗邊件衫？ 
"And I keep on going, I take some more pictures. ",地獄男爵 
And then it happens again. ,嗰個唔係我件衫 嗰個真係地獄男爵嚟！ 
"Understand, I can't see anything inside this costume. ",（笑聲） 但係我洗咗幾個月嘅時間 盡可能還原地獄男爵喺螢屏上嘅形象 從佢嘅長靴，到皮帶，到長褲 再到「毀滅之右手」 
I can see through the mouth -- I can see people's shoes. ,我搵人整咗地獄男爵頭部同胸部 跟住我將佢哋著上身 
"But the third time someone gives me back a coin, I want to know what's going on. ",我甚至搵到咗心水嘅隱形眼鏡 
"So I sort of tilt my head back to get a better view, and what I see is someone walking away from me going like this. ",我著住呢套衫行入動漫展 講真，著住件衫真是好鬼熱 
And then it hits me: it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face. ,熱到你無法想像 （笑聲） 大汗淋漓！我早就應該醒起 
"In the film ""Spirited Away,"" bad luck befalls those who take gold from No-Face. ",我不停咁飚汗，隱形眼鏡又好傷我對眼 但係呢啲都唔緊要 因為我愛上咗角色扮演 
This isn't a performer-audience relationship; this is cosplay. ,（笑聲） 不單止係因為可以著上套衫 喺動漫展度行 仲因為我可以見到其他角色扮演者 
"We are, all of us on that floor, injecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us. ",但搞清楚，動漫展裏面嘅裝扮 係叫做「角色扮演」 
And we're making it our own. ,表面上，角色扮演就係 人著到佢哋最鍾意嘅電影電視角色咁 尤其係著到日本動漫咁 但係當中含義唔係咁簡單 
We're connecting with something important inside of us. ,佢哋唔係搵到套衫著上身算 佢哋將角色同自己融合起嚟 
And the costumes are how we reveal ourselves to each other. ,佢哋令套衫嘅角色 跟住自己嘅諗法去做 
Thank you. ,當佢哋著住套衫個時 佢哋將角色變成心中想要嘅角色 
(Applause) ,佢哋係犀利嘅天才 
,佢哋做出好靚嘅嘢令人嘆服 
"What do you do if you had to figure out the information behind 11.5 million documents, verify it and make sense of it? ",（笑聲） 除此之外，佢哋仲會排練 
That was a challenge that a group of journalists had to face late last year. ,喺聖地牙哥，或者任何其他嘅動漫展 你唔係淨係同 個啲行黎行去嘅人影相 
An anonymous person calling himself John Doe had somehow managed to copy nearly 40 years of records of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. ,實際上你會行上去講 「嘿，我好鍾意你件衫， 唔知可不可以影相？」 
"This is one of many firms around the world that specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, for rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets. ",之後你俾佢哋時間去擺甫士 
"John Doe had managed to copy every spreadsheet from this firm, every client file, every email, from 1977 to the present day. ",佢哋好努力咁擺姿勢 就為咗你部相機可以影到靚嘅畫面 
It represented the biggest cache of inside information into the tax haven system that anyone had ever seen. ,而呢一幕真係好靚，我會將佢記低 
But it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism. ,喺後來嘅動漫展裏面 我去學 Heath Ledger 喺《黑暗騎士》裏面 扮演小丑一角嘅蹣跚步履 
"Think about it: 11.5 million documents, containing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries. ",我去學點樣扮成《指環王》嘅恐怖戒靈 跟住我真係嚇親一啲細路仔 
Where do you start with such a vast resource? ,我仲學識咗「呵呵笑」 就好似楚巴卡喺《星球大戰》裏面咁笑 
"Where do you even begin to tell a story that can trail off into every corner of the globe, and that can affect almost any person in any language, sometimes in ways they don't even know yet. ",然後我扮成《千與千尋》嘅無面男 
John Doe had given the information to two journalists at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. ,如果你唔知道《千與千尋》 同埋佢嘅導演宮崎駿嘅話 我係好樂意講解下 
"He said he was motivated by -- and I quote -- ""The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal."" ",（笑聲） 呢部電影真係一部傑作 一直都係我其中一齣最鍾意嘅電影 
But one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information. ,喺電影裏面 一個叫荻野千尋嘅女仔喺 日本嘅一個廢棄公園嘅 靈異世界嗰度蕩失路 
"So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out to my organization in Washington, DC, The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. ",喺幾個朋友嘅幫助之下 佢又重新搵到出返嚟嘅路 其中兩個朋友 一個叫做白龍，一條被捉嘅龍嚟 另一個叫做無面男，孤獨魔鬼嚟 
We decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we'd been taught to do as journalists: share. ,無面男好孤單，佢好想同人做朋友 佢認為交朋友嘅方法 就係將佢哋誘惑到自己身邊 再喺手上變出金幣 
"(Laughter) By nature, investigative reporters are lone wolves. ",但係呢種方法唔係咁好用 所以最後佢性情暴變 直到荻野千尋拯救咗佢，佢先至平靜返 
"We fiercely guard our secrets, at times even from our editors, because we know that the moment we tell them what we have, they'll want that story right away. ",我著上無面男套衫 行入聖地牙哥國際動漫展嘅會場 
"And to be frank, when you get a good story, you like to keep the glory to yourself. ",我非常認真咁練習無面男嘅動作 
"But there's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world, and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this. ",我決定著住呢套衫個時唔出聲 
The issues we report on are more and more transnational. ,當有人想同我影相個時，我會點頭 同埋會好怕羞咁企喺佢哋隔籬 
Giant corporations operate on a global level. ,當佢哋影相 我會偷偷地從我件長袍後面 摞出一塊朱古力金幣 
Environmental and health crises are global. ,等佢哋影完相之後，我會送佢哋金幣 
"So, too, are financial flows and financial crises. ",啊，啊，啊！——就好似咁 
So it seems staggering that journalism has been so late to cover stories in a truly global way. ,之後佢哋就會非常興奮 
"And it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow to wake up to the possibilities that technology brings, rather than being frightened of it. ",「天啊！無面男嘅金幣！ 難以置信，太犀利啦！」 
The reason journalists are scared of technology is this: the profession's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news. ,我好享受，之後我繼續喺動漫展度行 
The advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken. ,大概喺 15 分鐘之後，有件事發生咗 
"And this has plunged journalism into crisis, forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function. ",有人捉住咗我嘅手 佢哋俾返金幣我 
"But where there is crisis, there is also opportunity. ",我覺得佢哋喺度回禮 但係唔係，呢個明明係我送出去嘅金幣 
The first challenge presented by what would eventually become known as the Panama Papers was to make the documents searchable and readable. ,但我唔知道點解佢哋咁做 
"There were nearly five million emails, two million PDFs that needed to be scanned and indexed, and millions more files and other kinds of documents. ",於是我繼續行，我又影咗更多嘅相 
They all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location in the cloud. ,但又有人俾返金幣我 
We next invited reporters to have a look at the documents. ,你要知道，著住套衫嗰時 我乜都睇唔到 
"In all, reporters from more than 100 media organizations in 76 countries -- from the BBC in Britain to Le Monde newspaper in France to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan. ",我可以通過面具嘅嘴睇到 啲人嘅鞋、佢哋講嘅嘢、佢哋對腳 
"Native eyes on native names, we called it, the idea being, who best to tell you who was important to Nigeria than a Nigerian journalist? ",但係喺第三次有人將個金幣俾返我嗰時 我想知道到底發生咗啲乜嘢 
Who best in Canada than a Canadian? ,為咗睇得清楚啲，我將頭稍微向後傾斜 我睇到有人從我身邊行開，就好似咁 
"There were only two rules for everyone who was invited: we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else, and we all agreed to publish together on the same day. ",呢一幕令我突然醒悟： 摞到無面男嘅金幣係不祥之兆 
We chose our media partners based on trust that had been built up through previous smaller collaborations and also from leads that jumped out from the documents. ,因為喺電影《千與千尋》裏面 如果有人向無面男摞咗金幣 
"Over the next few months, my small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people was joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups. ",厄運就會降臨 呢個唔係講緊演員同觀眾嘅關係 
"The biggest information leak in history had now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history: 376 sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do, working shoulder to shoulder, sharing information, but telling no one. ",而係角色扮演背後嘅意義 我哋，全部喺會場上嘅人 都喺度將自己注入到 對我哋嚟講有某種意義嘅故事裏面 
"For it became clear at this point that in order to make the biggest kind of noise, we first needed the biggest kind of silence. ",再將佢變成我哋自己嘅故事 
"To manage the project over the many months it would take, we built a secure virtual newsroom. ",我哋內心深處都有啲重要嘅嘢 
"We used encrypted communication systems, and we built a specially designed search engine. ",而服裝就係我哋表達內心嘅嘢畀其他人 
"Inside the virtual newsroom, the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents. ",多謝 
"Those interested in blood diamonds or exotic art, for instance, could share information about how the offshore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those commodities. ",（掌聲） 
"Those interested in sport could share information about how famous sports stars were putting their image rights into offshore companies, thereby likely avoiding taxes in the countries where they plied their trade. ",
"But perhaps most exciting of all were the number of world leaders and elect politicians that were emerging from the documents -- figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine, close associates of Vladimir Putin in Russia and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who is linked through his late father, Ian Cameron. ","如果要你喺 1,150 萬份 文件裏面搵出資料 然後核實真確同埋理解佢，你會點做？ "
"Buried in the documents were secret offshore entities, such as Wintris Inc., a company in the British Virgin Islands that had actually belonged to the sitting Icelandic prime minister. ",呢個係舊年好多記者要面對嘅挑戰 
"I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson, the Icelandic reporter we invited to join the project, as the loneliest man in the world. ",一個自稱 John Doe 嘅人 攞到巴拿馬莫薩克．馮賽卡律師事務所 近 40 年嘅紀錄 
"For nine months, he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife. ",呢間事務所係世界上其中一間專門 幫人喺海外避稅天堂 譬如英屬維爾京群島 設立銀行帳戶嘅公司 為有好多秘密要收埋嘅達官貴人服務 
He pasted tarps over the windows of his home to prevent prying eyes during the long Icelandic winter. ,John Doe 喺呢間公司複製咗 由 1977 年到今日嘅每一張表格 每一份客戶檔案、每一封電子郵件 
"And he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences, as he worked red-eyed, night after night, month after month. ",呢份係目前為止有著最多 避稅天堂內幕資料嘅紀錄 
"In all that time, he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country. ",仲為調查新聞界帶嚟巨大嘅挑戰 
"Now, when you're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery, such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company, that that company has a financial interest in Icelandic banks -- the very issue he's been elected on -- well, your instinct is to scream out very loud. ","諗一下：1,150 萬份文件 包含來自超過 200 個國家嘅人嘅秘密 "
"Instead, as one of the few people that he could speak to, Johannes and I shared a kind of gallows humor. ",咁大個紀錄，你要從邊度入手？ 
"Wintris is coming, he used to say. ",你要由邊度開始報導 先至可以觸及到世界每一個角落 影響到幾乎所有語言嘅人？ 
"(Laughter) (Applause) We were big fans of ""Game of Thrones."" ",John Doe 將信息畀咗 德國報社 Süddeutsche Zeitung 嘅兩個記者 
"When reporters like Johannes wanted to scream, they did so inside the virtual newsroom, and then they turned those screams into stories by going outside the documents to court records, official company registers, and by eventually putting questions to those that we intended to name. ",佢話佢出於以下動機︰ 「文件將會揭露不公義嘅規模」 
Panama Papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world through a different lens from everybody else. ,但單憑一個記者 唔足以處理咁大量嘅訊息 
"As we were researching the story, unconnected to us, a major political bribery scandal happened in Brazil. ",所以 Süddeutsche Zeitung 報社聯繫咗 我喺華盛頓嘅組織，國際調查記者聯盟 
A new leader was elected in Argentina. ,我哋決定要做一件違反記者操守嘅事︰ 分享呢份紀錄 
"The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA, the organization that controls the world of professional soccer. ",（笑聲） 就本性而言，調查記者等同孤狼 
The Panama Papers actually had unique insights into each one of these unfolding events. ,我哋死守自己嘅秘密 甚至連我哋嘅編輯都唔講得 因為我哋知道，只要透露少少風聲 佢哋就會即刻想要嗰篇新聞 
So you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas that could have ruined what we were trying to do. ,老實講，當你有一篇好新聞 你會想獨自領受呢份新聞嘅榮譽 
But they didn't. ,毫無疑問，我哋生活喺 一個萎縮緊嘅世界 但好多媒體都冇意識到呢一點 
"And on April 3 this year, at exactly 8pm German time, we published simultaneously in 76 countries. ",新聞嘅內容越嚟越國際化 
(Applause) The Panama Papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year. ,大型公司喺全世界運作 
This is the scene in Iceland the day after we published. ,環境、健康問題變成全球性 
It was the first of many protests. ,同樣，資金流動同金融危機都係咁 
The Icelandic prime minister had to resign. ,驚人嘅係，新聞界咁遲先 以全球嘅目光報導新聞 
It was a first of many resignations. ,同樣驚人嘅係 新聞界咁遲先意識到科技帶來嘅機遇 而唔係再怕科技 
"We spotlighted many famous people such as Lionel Messi, the most famous soccer player in the world. ",記者怕科技嘅原因係： 呢個行業嘅大型機構正經歷緊艱難時期 讀者閱讀新聞嘅方式正係改變緊 
And there were some unintended consequences. ,以往靠廣告賺錢嘅經營模式成為絕響 
These alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested after we published details about their hideout. ,令到新聞界陷入危機 迫使新聞機構去審視佢哋嘅運行模式 
They'd been using the address to register their offshore company. ,但有危就有機 
(Laughter) There's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do. ,巴拿馬文件帶嚟嘅第一個挑戰 就係要將文件變成搜尋得到同埋讀得到 
The technology -- the Internet -- that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself. ,呢件事涉及大概五百萬封電子郵件 兩百萬份需要掃描同埋編寫索引嘅 PDF 幾百萬份檔案同埋其他類型嘅文件 
And this dynamic is producing unprecedented levels of transparency and impact. ,呢啲嘢都需要存放喺 雲端一個安全嘅位置 
We showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world by applying new methods and old-fashioned journalism techniques to vast amounts of leaked information. ,跟住我哋邀請記者去睇下啲文件 
We put all-important context around what was given to us by John Doe. ,嚟自超過 100 個媒體組織 76 個國家嘅記者 包括英國廣播公司 法國世界報、日本朝日新聞 
"And by sharing resources, we were able to dig deep -- much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days, because of financial concerns. ",我哋將呢個做法叫做 「記者睇返各自國家」 邊個會比尼日利亞記者 更熟悉尼日利亞嘅重要人物？ 
"Now, it was a big risk, and it wouldn't work for every story, but we showed with the Panama Papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere, and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work. ",邊個會比加拿大人更了解加拿大？ 
Try obtaining a court injunction that would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries. ,我哋對所有加入嘅記者只有兩個規則： 我哋同意同我哋之間 分享我哋搵到嘅所有信息 我哋同意同一日公開所有資料 
Try stopping the inevitable. ,我哋同其他媒體合作係建基於 之前小型合作所建立起嚟嘅信任 同埋因為文件線索而合作 
"Shortly after we published, I got a three-word text from Johannes: ""Wintris has arrived."" ",喺跟住嘅幾個月 我嗰個原本少過 20 個人 嘅小型非營利組織 有超過 350 名 25 種唔同語言嘅記者加入 
"(Laughter) It had arrived and so, too, perhaps has a new era for journalism. ",史上最大泄密促使 新聞界史上最大嘅合作 376 位唔同國家嘅記者 並肩工作，分享信息 但係保密 
Thank you. ,我哋知道要營造最大嘅轟動 我哋首先要絕對嘅沉寂 
"(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you. ",為咗完成呢個可能耗時幾個月嘅任務 我哋建立咗一間虛擬 但安全嘅新聞編輯部 
"I guess you're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists who worked with you, right? ",我哋使用加密嘅溝通系統 我哋用特別嘅搜索引擎 
"Now, a couple of questions I would like to ask. ",喺虛擬新聞編輯部裏面 記者可以按主題閱讀文件 
"The first one is, you'd been working in secrecy for over a year with 350-something colleagues from all over the world -- was there ever a moment when you thought that the leak may be leaked, that the collaboration may just be broken by somebody publishing a story? ",譬如，從事血鑽 或者外地藝術品題材嘅記者 可以分享海外世界點樣被用嚟 隱暪呢兩種商品嘅交易情況 
Or somebody not in the group releasing some information that they got to know? ,從事體育新聞嘅記者可以分享 體育明星係點樣將肖像權歸入海外公司 以避過喺佢哋有做開貿易嘅 國家嗰度交稅 
"Gerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way, including when something major was happening in the world, the journalists from that country wanted to publish right away. ",但最令人興奮嘅係 文件提到嘅各國領導人、政治家 譬如烏克蘭嘅波羅申科 俄羅斯總統普京嘅密友 仲有英國前首相卡梅倫 因為牽涉到佢過咗身嘅老豆 Ian Cameron 
We had to calm them down. ,文件裏邊仲有秘密嘅海外公司 譬如 Wintris Inc. 一間喺英屬維爾京群島嘅公司 實際上屬於現任冰島總理 
"We'd sent a series of questions to the associates of Vladimir Putin, but instead of responding, the Kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us, and denounced the whole thing as being, I guess, a plot from the West. ",我想講一下 Johannes Kristjansson 佢係我哋項目邀請嘅冰島記者 亦係世界上最孤獨嘅男人 
"At that point, Putin thought it was just about him. ",九個月嚟，佢拒絕有薪工作 佢用太太嘅工資生活 
"And, of course, a lot of editors around the world were very nervous about this. ",佢將油布黏喺屋企嘅窗度 恐防漫長冬天有人監視 
They thought the story was going to get out. ,後來佢好快就用曬缺席嘅理由 佢工作到眼睛疲勞 日復一日，一個月又一個月 
"You can imagine the amount of time they'd spent, the amount of resources, money spent on this. ",喺嗰段時間 佢埋首於嗰啲最终可以 令國家領導人下台嘅信息 
"So I had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down, a bit like a general, where you're holding your troops back: ""Calm, remain calm."" ",依家，你係調查記者，你驚奇咁發現 你嘅首相可能同一間秘密海外公司有關 而嗰間公司喺冰島銀行有財務權益 首相嘅當選多得當中利益輸送 咁，你嘅直覺就係大聲咁廣而告之 
"And then eventually, of course, they all did. ",作為佢可以傾訴嘅幾個人之一 我同 Johannes Kristjansson 都係黑色幽默嘅人 
"BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so, you released a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via keyword, essentially. ",「Wintris 嚟啦」，佢曾經咁講 
GR: We very much believe that the basic information about the offshore world should be made public. ,（笑聲） （掌聲） 我哋係《權力的遊戲》嘅忠實粉絲 
"Now, we didn't publish the underlying documents of the journalists we're working with. ",當有記者好似 Johannes Kristjansson 咁想分享材料 佢哋會喺虛擬新聞編輯部分享 再會將分享嘅材料寫成故事 參考文件、法庭紀錄，同埋公司登記 最後向我哋嘅對象提問 
"But the basic information such as the name of a person, what their offshore company was and the name of that company, is now all available online. ",其實巴拿馬文件令記者 用一個與眾不同嘅角度嚟睇世界 
"In fact, the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do. ",當我哋喺度調查緊同我哋無關嘅事件 例如巴西政壇重大嘅賄賂醜聞 
GR: Thank you. ,阿根廷選舉選出新任領導人 
(Applause) ,美國聯邦調查局起訴國際足協嘅官員 
,巴拿馬文件都會 對呢啲事件有獨特嘅洞察 
"The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques, if we are able to dream. ",所以你可以想像調查時候 嘅壓力同內心掙扎 其實係可以令任何一個記者 唔守約定提早公佈呢份紀錄 
"As a child, I discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality. ",但係佢哋冇 
"I learned this from my grandmother, Dr. Ruth Tichauer, a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes. ",喺今年嘅 4 月 3 號德國時間晚上 8 點 我哋同時喺 76 個國家公開呢份紀錄 
That is how I grew up: encouraged to see beyond any limitation. ,（掌聲） 巴拿馬文件成為咗今年嘅一件大事 
"So part of my education included helping her in remote, indigenous communities. ",呢個係公開咗之後冰島嘅街頭 
"I cherish those memories, because they helped me to understand life outside the city, a life with a lot of possibilities, without barriers, as language or culture. ",呢個係第一場抗議 
"During those trips, my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem: ""Something hidden. Go and find it. ",冰島總理被迫辭職 
Go and look behind the Mountains. ,佢係第一個辭職嘅人 
Something lost behind the mountains. ,我哋將目光聚焦喺名人身上 譬如美斯 世界上最出名嘅足球運動員 
"Lost and waiting for you. Go!"" ",文件公開之後仲有一啲意想不到嘅後果 
"In the coming years, I became a medical student. ",喺我哋將佢哋藏身地點曝光之後 一批聲稱係墨西哥 販毒集團成員嘅人被捕 
One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease. ,因為佢哋曾經利用文件中嘅地址 註冊海外公司 
There's a part of this problem I think I can solve -- the part of this problem I have spent my life working on. ,（笑聲） 得意嘅係，我哋比以前可以做更多嘅嘢 
The problem starts during pregnancy. ,科技同互聯網打破咗傳統商業模式 令我哋能夠改造新聞界本身 
The fetus needs to survive inside the mother. ,而呢個改變令一切更加透明同有影響力 
Survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood. ,我哋證明咗記者可以 將新方法同舊新聞行業嘅技巧 應用到處理大量洩漏信息 從而影響全世界 
"At the moment of birth, this communication needs to stop. ",我哋根據 John Doe 嘅文件 將重要資料擺埋一齊 
"If it doesn't close, the baby has a hole in the heart. ",因為資源共享令到成本下降 我哋可以比依家大部份嘅傳媒 更深入更長時間咁調查 
It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions. ,但係巴拿馬文件證明咗 你可以喺任何地方報導任何國家嘅新聞 雖然咁樣做有好大風險 而且唔會適合每則新聞 但係你要搵一個地方去捍衛你嘅工作 
But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes. ,你要盡力攞到法院指令 避免一單新聞喺 76 個國家報導 
"As you can see in the chart, the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude. ",同埋盡力阻止你唔想見到嘅事發生 
"Video: (Baby crying) When you look at patients with this condition, they seem desperate to breathe. ",發佈新聞後冇幾耐 Johannes Kristjansson 發咗條短信畀我 「Wintris 已經到咗」 
"To close the hole, major surgery used to be the only solution. ",（笑聲） 或者，新聞界嘅新時代亦都嚟咗 
"One night, my friend Malte, were camping in the Amazon region. ",多謝 
The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch. ,（掌聲） 主持︰多謝你，Gerard 
Then came a moment of inspiration. ,我諗你打算將呢啲掌聲獻畀 350 位同你工作嘅記者，係嗎？ 
So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention. ,依家，我有幾個問題要問你 
The holes in children's hearts can be closed with it. ,第一個係 你秘密工作咗一年 同大約 350 位來自全世界嘅同仁共事 你有冇諗過 一旦有人將新聞發佈，秘密將會洩露 所有做嘅嘢就會白費 
A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself. ,又或者組織之外有人 洩露咗佢哋都知道嘅消息？ 
"It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now, but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem. ",講者：一路上我哋遇到咗好多危險 每當世界上發生咗重大事件 嗰個國家嘅記者就會想即刻公開紀錄 
"In this video, we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart. ",我哋必須令佢哋冷靜 我哋遇到嘅最大危險 發生喺新聞發佈前嘅一個禮拜 
The coil then closes the hole. ,我哋向普京嘅密友提咗一咋問題 但克裡姆林宮冇回答到 反而克裡姆林宮搞咗記幾招指責我哋 話成件事係西方嘅陰謀 
"After that moment of inspiration, there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype. ",嗰時，普京認為呢件事凈係同佢有關 
In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab. ,當然，世界各地嘅編輯 都非常緊張克裡姆林宮呢件事 
"The coil, if it works, can save lives. ",佢哋覺得成件事就快要爆 
"I returned from Germany to Bolivia, thinking that wherever we go, we have the opportunity to make a difference. ",你可以想像佢哋投入咗幾多時間 幾多資源、幾多金錢 
"With my wife and partner, Dr. Alexandra Heath, we started to see patients. ",最後個星期我基本上都喺度叫大家冷靜 就好似一個將軍咁穩定軍心 「淡定，保持淡定」 
"After successfully treating patients with our coil, we felt really enthusiastic. ",最終，當然，佢哋都係淡定返 
"But we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high. ",主持：大概喺幾個星期之前 你發佈咗好多文件 並用佢嚟做公開數據庫 畀大家通過關鍵字嚟搜索 
"And, the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition. ",講者：我哋堅信公眾應該 對於海外世界有基本嘅知情權 
"The hole in altitude patients is different, because the orifice between the arteries is larger. ",我哋冇公開同我哋一齊工作 嘅記者嘅身份檔案 
"Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time, and they die. ",但係，文件裏面嘅基本資料 好似啲人嘅名、佢哋海外公司嘅名 依家全部可以喺網上搵到 
The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia. ,主持：Gerard，多謝你所做嘅一切 
The search started again. ,講者：多謝 
We went back to the drawing board. ,（掌聲） 
"After many trials, and with the help of my grandmother's indigenous friends in the mountains, we obtained a new device. ",
"For centuries, indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms, and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device. ",祗要我哋敢去夢想 我哋呢個時代最難嘅問題 都可以用簡單嘅技巧解決 
We take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape. ,我細個已經發現創意 係實現夢想嘅鎖匙 
"It seems this time, the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn't rust because it's made of only one piece. ",呢樣嘢係我喺嫲嫲嗰度學返嚟 我嫲嫲叫 Ruth Tichauer，係個醫生嚟 佢係猶太裔難民，後嚟喺 安地斯山脈地區定居 
It can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop. ,喺我成長裏面 大人都係鼓勵我 唔好俾事物受到限制著目光 
"As you can see, the device enters the body through the natural channels. ",所以我受嘅教育包括 到偏遠嘅土著社區幫佢 
Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole. ,呢啲回憶好珍惜 因為啲回憶幫我明白 城外嘅世界有無限嘅機會 同時無語言同文化嘅限制 
"Our device expands, places itself and closes the hole. ",喺當時旅程裏面，嫲嫲成日 唱一首 Kipling 嘅詩： 「有東西躲起來了，快去找它出來。 
We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself. ,到山𥚃去找它吧， 
No open surgery was necessary. ,它在山背滅失了。 
"(Applause) As doctors, we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal -- if they do. ",它滅失了，正等著你。去吧！」 
"This is the child from before, after the procedure. ",後嚟我學醫 
"As you can see -- (Applause) As you can see, once the device is in place, the patient is 100 percent healed. ",知道世界上每一百個兒童 就有一個患心臟病 
"From start to finish, the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes. ",於是我諗我可以解決呢個問題嘅一部分 我一生都為呢一部分努力 
That's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view. ,而呢一部分 係從懷孕期開始 
"We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team -- a team, thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us. ",胎兒要喺母體存活 
"Together, we have only one idea: the best solutions need to be simple. ",就需要靠著循環系統 同肺之間流動嘅血 
We lost the fear of creating something new. ,喺出世嗰陣 呢種血液流動必然停止 
"The path, it's not easy. ",否則，嬰兒嘅心臟就會有個窿 
Many obstacles arise all the time. ,亦就係早産或者遺傳基因問題所見到嘅嘢 
But we receive strength from our patients. ,但係我哋而家知道 缺氧都係其中一個原因 
Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity. ,喺圖中，你哋可以睇到 心漏病嘅病發率 隨著海拔越高越大 
"Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind, not because of cost or access. ",影片：（嬰兒哭聲） 可以見到心漏病病人 好搏命咁呼吸 
So we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model. ,以前要封呢嗰窿 做手術係唯一嘅辦法 
We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated. ,有一晩，我個朋友 Malte 喺阿馬遜河叢林露營 
"We are in many countries now, but we need to be everywhere. ",我哋生火時，只有綠色嘅 鱷利樹枝唔會燒著 
"This whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it, really: No child is left behind. ",呢樣嘢觸發咗我嘅靈感 
Muchas gracias. ,於是我哋用呢啲樹枝為骨幹 
(Applause) ,做咗第一個用嚟堵塞心漏病嘅發明 
,一個線圈就係一條金屬線不斷繞住自己 
Imagine you're walking through a forest. ,可能你哋睇嚟覺得唔係好靚 但係，佢係我哋 解決呢個大難題嘅第一款儀器 
"I'm guessing you're thinking of a collection of trees, what we foresters call a stand, with their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns. ",喺呢段片，我哋可以 見到一條好幼嘅導管 點樣將儀器帶到心臟 
"Yes, trees are the foundation of forests, but a forest is much more than what you see, and today I want to change the way you think about forests. ",然後線圈塞著個窿 
"You see, underground there is this other world, a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate and allow the forest to behave as though it's a single organism. ",有咗靈感之後 我哋花咗好耐 製作一個雛形 
It might remind you of a sort of intelligence. ,試管或者活體研究 喺實驗室裏邊上演咗幾千個鐘 
How do I know this? ,如果線圈硏究成功，就能夠救到好多人 
Here's my story. ,我由德國返到玻理維亞 途中諗，無論我哋去到邊 都會有機會令人哋過得更好 
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia. ,然後我同太太兼合伙人 Alexandra Heath 醫生 開始診症 
I used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns. ,見到病人因為我哋嘅儀器醫返好 我哋都好熱血沸騰 
They were giants. ,但係有樣嘢困擾我哋 我哋住喺一處海拔萬二呎高嘅地方 
"My grandfather was a giant, too. ",而 嗰度啲病人需要特別嘅儀器治療心臟病 
"He was a horse logger, and he used to selectively cut cedar poles from the inland rainforest. ",因為居住喺高海拔嘅病人嘅病情係唔同嘅 因為佢哋動脈中間嗰窿特別大 
"Grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods, and how my family was knit into it. ",好多病人無錢睇醫生，變咗唔可以及時診治 最後就病死 
So I followed in grandpa's footsteps. ,第一個發明嘅儀器只可以醫好 玻利維亞一半呢類嘅病人 
"He and I had this curiosity about forests, and my first big ""aha"" moment was at the outhouse by our lake. ",於是研究又繼續 
Our poor dog Jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit. ,我哋返到去畫草稿 
So grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog. ,經過好多次試驗 同埋得到嫲嫲山區土著朋友幫助 我哋造咗一件新儀器 
"He was down there, swimming in the muck. ",過去幾百年嚟，土著婦女 都係透過布上織複雜嘅圖案去講故仔 呢啲以前無諗過嘅技藝 竟然幫我哋製造新儀器 
"But as grandpa dug through that forest floor, I became fascinated with the roots, and under that, what I learned later was the white mycelium and under that the red and yellow mineral horizons. ",我哋利用呢啲傳統嘅織布方法 同埋會記録形狀嘅物料 設計咗一樣嘢 
"Eventually, grandpa and I rescued the poor dog, but it was at that moment that I realized that that palette of roots and soil was really the foundation of the forest. ",今次嘅織布技巧 令儀器可以一件過生產 所以 儀器理應唔會生銹，甚至乎係天衣無縫 
And I wanted to know more. ,展望將來，呢種儀器經過幾十年嘅硏發 就會變成好精密嘅結構 
So I studied forestry. ,可以見到，呢種儀器經過自然嘅渠道 進入人體 
But soon I found myself working alongside the powerful people in charge of the commercial harvest. ,醫生要做嘅只係將心漏嘅導管關上 
"The extent of the clear-cutting was alarming, and I soon found myself conflicted by my part in it. ",之後儀器會脹大，自我安置好 然後封咗個窿 
"Not only that, the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches to make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs was astounding. ",呢個手術 容易執行 因為儀器會自動操作 
It seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine. ,亦唔需要開刀 
"So I went back to school, and I studied my other world. ",（掌聲） 我哋做醫生嘅 往往需要長時間同精力 先至可以同疾病搏鬥 
"You see, scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vitro that one pine seedling root could transmit carbon to another pine seedling root. ",呢個係之前睇到嘅小朋友 經過手術之後 
"But this was in the laboratory, and I wondered, could this happen in real forests? ",你可以睇到… （掌聲） 只要個儀器埋到去穿窿嘅位置 病人一定百分百好返 
I thought yes. ,由開始到完成 成個程序只需要半個鐘頭 
Trees in real forests might also share information below ground. ,從醫學同常人嘅角度嚟講都令人鼓舞 
"But this was really controversial, and some people thought I was crazy, and I had a really hard time getting research funding. ",以前嘅一啲病人家陣加入咗我哋團隊 佢哋令我哋好驕傲 咁係多得團隊之前同參與研究嘅病人 有緊密溝通 
"But I persevered, and I eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest, 25 years ago. ",講到呢度，我哋只有一個信念： 最好嘅方法一定要簡單 
"I grew 80 replicates of three species: paper birch, Douglas fir, and western red cedar. ",雖然我哋以前怕創造新嘅嘢 
"I figured the birch and the fir would be connected in a belowground web, but not the cedar. ",雖然路途艱難 
It was in its own other world. ,困難重重 
"And I gathered my apparatus, and I had no money, so I had to do it on the cheap. ",但係我哋嘅病人都好支持我哋 
"So I went to Canadian Tire -- (Laughter) and I bought some plastic bags and duct tape and shade cloth, a timer, a paper suit, a respirator. ",佢哋嘅抗逆能力同勇氣 都激發我哋嘅創意 
"And then I borrowed some high-tech stuff from my university: a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter, a mass spectrometer, microscopes. ",我哋嘅目標係話︰ 冇一個兒童 會因為經費或者就醫機會而得唔到治療 
And then I got some really dangerous stuff: syringes full of radioactive carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas and some high pressure bottles of the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas. ,於是我哋成立一個 以一對一嘅模式營運嘅基金 
But I was legally permitted. ,仲會向每位兒童免費提供一件儀器 等佢哋都可以接受治療 
"(Laughter) Oh, and I forgot some stuff, important stuff: the bug spray, the bear spray, the filters for my respirator. ",我哋現今已經推展到好多國家 但我哋仲需要走到世界每個角落 
Oh well. ,呢件事 源自一個無可能實現嘅念頭 而且會延續落去 確保每一個兒童都得到醫治 
"The first day of the experiment, we got out to our plot and a grizzly bear and her cub chased us off. ",多謝 
And I had no bear spray. ,（掌聲） 
"But you know, this is how forest research in Canada goes. ",
"(Laughter) So I came back the next day, and mama grizzly and her cub were gone. ",想像你喺片森林度散緊步 
"So this time, we really got started, and I pulled on my white paper suit, I put on my respirator, and then I put the plastic bags over my trees. ",我估你望到嘅係密麻麻嘅樹 我哋林務員稱佢為「林分」 佢哋嘅樹幹粗壯、樹冠茂盛 
"I got my giant syringes, and I injected the bags with my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases, first the birch. ",冇錯，樹係森林嘅基礎 但係森林絕對唔止你睇到嘅咁樣 今日，我希望改變你哋對森林嘅睇法 
"I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas, into the bag of birch. ",喺地底有另一個世界係 一個連結無窮生命嘅世界 連繫住樹木，畀空間佢哋交流 使成個森林成為一個生物咁運作 
"And then for fir, I injected the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas. ",佢可能使你諗起一種智慧 
"I used two isotopes, because I was wondering whether there was two-way communication going on between these species. ",我點知嘅？ 
"I got to the final bag, the 80th replicate, and all of a sudden mama grizzly showed up again. ",以下係我嘅故事 
"And she started to chase me, and I had my syringes above my head, and I was swatting the mosquitos, and I jumped into the truck, and I thought, ""This is why people do lab studies."" ",我喺加拿大卑詩省嘅森林度大嘅 
(Laughter) I waited an hour. ,細細個鍾意瞓喺度望住啲樹 
"I figured it would take this long for the trees to suck up the CO2 through photosynthesis, turn it into sugars, send it down into their roots, and maybe, I hypothesized, shuttle that carbon belowground to their neighbors. ",佢哋十足十巨人 
"After the hour was up, I rolled down my window, and I checked for mama grizzly. ",我爺爺都係一個巨人 
"Oh good, she's over there eating her huckleberries. ",佢係一個伐木工人 佢喺內陸森林度會揀一啲杉樹來鋸 
So I got out of the truck and I got to work. ,佢教識我欣賞森林生活嘅恬靜同諧嘅 仲有森林同我哋一家嘅聯繫 
I went to my first bag with the birch. I pulled the bag off. ,所以我繼承咗爺爺嘅事業 
I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves. ,佢同我對森林都有好奇 而我第一個醒悟 就來自我哋喺湖邊嘅廁所 
Kkhh! ,我哋隻狗 Jigs 跣咗落個屎氹度 
Perfect. ,爺爺就攞住個鏟，跑去救隻衰狗 
The birch had taken up the radioactive gas. ,爺爺喺個氹度游，成身臭晒 
Then the moment of truth. ,就喺爺爺挖緊泥嗰陣 我俾氹裡邊啲樹根吸引住 後來先知，地底嗰啲係白色菌絲 菌絲下面，係紅色同黃色嘅礦物層 
I went over to the fir tree. ,後尾，我同爺爺救到隻狗 喺嗰一剎那，我體會到 樹根同土壤嘅融合 先係森林嘅基礎 
I pulled off its bag. ,我仲想了解多啲 
"I ran the Geiger counter up its needles, and I heard the most beautiful sound. ",於是我去讀森林學 
Kkhh! ,好快就同一班大人物做嘢 一齊經營商業伐木 
"It was the sound of birch talking to fir, and birch was saying, ""Hey, can I help you?"" ",大規模嘅濫伐 景況令人擔憂 我亦飽受良心嘅譴責 
"And fir was saying, ""Yeah, can you send me some of your carbon? ",佢哋仲灑農藥、斬晒啲白楊樹同樺樹 純粹為咗改種更賺錢嘅松樹同冷杉樹 好令人震驚 
"Because somebody threw a shade cloth over me."" ",似乎咩都阻止唔到工業機器嘅推進 
"I went up to cedar, and I ran the Geiger counter over its leaves, and as I suspected, silence. ",所以我再讀去返書 開始研究我嘅另一個世界 
Cedar was in its own world. ,科學家啱啱先喺實驗室發現 喺試管裡邊，碳可以從一個松樹嘅幼苗 傳去另一棵幼苗嗰度 
It was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir. ,但呢個只係實驗室裡邊頭發現 我喺度諗，喺森林度得唔得呢？ 
"I was so excited, I ran from plot to plot and I checked all 80 replicates. ",我諗應該得 
The evidence was clear. ,樹木或者真係可以喺地底傳送信息 
The C-13 and C-14 was showing me that paper birch and Douglas fir were in a lively two-way conversation. ,但呢個諗法爭議太大 啲人甚至以為我癲咗 所以我好難籌到研究經費 
"It turns out at that time of the year, in the summer, that birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch, especially when the fir was shaded. ",但係我一直堅持 卒之， 我喺森林做咗啲實驗 喺 25 年前 
"And then in later experiments, we found the opposite, that fir was sending more carbon to birch than birch was sending to fir, and this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless. ",我種咗 3 種樹，一種 80 棵： 北美白樺、黃杉同紅崖柏 
"So it turns out the two species were interdependent, like yin and yang. ",我設想北美白樺同黃杉會喺地底有交流 但紅崖柏就冇 
"And at that moment, everything came into focus for me. ",紅崖柏只會自成一國 
"I knew I had found something big, something that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests, from not just competitors but to cooperators. ",跟住，我準備好曬啲器材 因為冇錢，成本盡量要低 
"And I had found solid evidence of this massive belowground communications network, the other world. ",所以我去咗加拿大輪胎公司 （笑聲） 買咗啲膠袋、牛皮膠紙、遮光布 計時器、防護衣同防護口罩 
"Now, I truly hoped and believed that my discovery would change how we practice forestry, from clear-cutting and herbiciding to more holistic and sustainable methods, methods that were less expensive and more practical. ",跟住我問大學借咗啲儀器： 一個蓋革計數器、一個閃爍輻射儀、 一個質譜儀同幾座顯微鏡 
What was I thinking? ,我仲攞咗一啲超危險嘅嘢： 幾支裝滿放射性 有「碳-14」嘅二氧化碳嘅注射器 同埋幾個裝咗穩定同位素 
I'll come back to that. ,有「碳-13」嘅二氧化碳嘅高壓氣樽 
So how do we do science in complex systems like forests? ,全部合法嘎 （笑聲） 有幾樣嘢我帶漏咗， 好重要嘅嘢： 殺蟲噴霧、防熊噴霧、口罩濾網 
"Well, as forest scientists, we have to do our research in the forests, and that's really tough, as I've shown you. ",好喇 
And we have to be really good at running from bears. ,實驗嘅第一日，我哋嚟到目的地 點知有隻灰熊媽媽同個仔追住我哋 
"But mostly, we have to persevere in spite of all the stuff stacked against us. ",我冇帶防熊噴霧 
And we have to follow our intuition and our experiences and ask really good questions. ,不過喺加拿大嘅森林做研究係咁㗎喇 
And then we've got to gather our data and then go verify. ,（笑聲） 第二日，我又嚟喇 隻灰熊同個仔走咗喇 
"For me, I've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest. ",所以今次，我哋真正開始喇 我著好件防護衣 戴好個防護面罩 之後 用膠袋冚住啲樹 
Some of my oldest experimental plantations are now over 30 years old. ,我拎住個超大注射器 將示蹤同位素二氧化碳 射入個膠袋度 首先係北美白樺 
You can check them out. ,我將放射性氣體「碳-14」 射入佢度 
That's how forest science works. ,之後係黃杉，我注入咗 穩定嘅同位素「碳-13」二氧化碳 
So now I want to talk about the science. ,我用咗兩種唔同嘅同位素 因為我想知 呢兩種樹之間係咪有雙向交流 
How were paper birch and Douglas fir communicating? ,注射用到最後一袋 即係第 80 組樹 突然間，隻灰熊又來咗 
"Well, it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon but also nitrogen and phosphorus and water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones -- information. ",喺後面追住我 我舉住個注射器過我個頭 一邊拍蚊，一邊跳到架貨車度 我心諗 難怪啲科學家鍾意留喺實驗室啦！ 
"And you know, I have to tell you, before me, scientists had thought that this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza was involved. ",（笑聲） 我等咗一個鐘 
"Mycorrhiza literally means ""fungus root."" ",我諗啲樹需要咁上下時間 透過光合作用吸收啲 放射性嘅二氧化碳 轉換成糖，然後送到樹根 然後傳畀隔離棵樹 
You see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest. ,過咗一個鐘 我拉低個車窗 睇下隻灰熊喺邊 
They're the mushrooms. ,太好喇，佢喺埋邊食緊堆黑莓 
"The mushrooms, though, are just the tip of the iceberg, because coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium, and that mycelium infects and colonizes the roots of all the trees and plants. ",於是我行出架貨車，開始做嘢 
"And where the fungal cells interact with the root cells, there's a trade of carbon for nutrients, and that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil and coating every soil particle. ",我行近第一棵樺樹，掹個袋落嚟 
The web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium under a single footstep. ,將部蓋勒計數器擺近啲葉度 
"And not only that, that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest, individuals not only of the same species but between species, like birch and fir, and it works kind of like the Internet. ",咔！ 
"You see, like all networks, mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links. ",完美 
We made this map by examining the short sequences of DNA of every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of Douglas fir forest. ,樺樹已經吸收咗啲放射性氣體 
"In this picture, the circles represent the Douglas fir, or the nodes, and the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways, or the links. ",關鍵時刻嚟喇 
"The biggest, darkest nodes are the busiest nodes. ",我行近棵杉樹 
"We call those hub trees, or more fondly, mother trees, because it turns out that those hub trees nurture their young, the ones growing in the understory. ",掹走個袋 
"And if you can see those yellow dots, those are the young seedlings that have established within the network of the old mother trees. ",將部機擺近啲針葉度 我聽到極之美妙嘅聲音 
"In a single forest, a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees. ",咔！ 
"And using our isotope tracers, we have found that mother trees will send their excess carbon through the mycorrhizal network to the understory seedlings, and we've associated this with increased seedling survival by four times. ",係樺樹同杉樹傾偈嘅聲音 樺樹問︰「喂，有冇嘢要幫手?」 
"Now, we know we all favor our own children, and I wondered, could Douglas fir recognize its own kin, like mama grizzly and her cub? ",杉樹話︰「有呀，你畀啲碳我得唔得？ 
"So we set about an experiment, and we grew mother trees with kin and stranger's seedlings. ",我俾塊遮光布擋住咗呀。」 
And it turns out they do recognize their kin. ,我行近棵杉樹，將部機擺近啲葉度 不出我所料 一啲聲音都冇 
Mother trees colonize their kin with bigger mycorrhizal networks. ,柏樹完全自成一國 
They send them more carbon below ground. ,佢冇同樺樹同杉樹連繫埋一齊 
They even reduce their own root competition to make elbow room for their kids. ,我太興奮嘞 行勻成個地方，檢查晒八十組嘅實驗 
"When mother trees are injured or dying, they also send messages of wisdom on to the next generation of seedlings. ",事實擺在眼前 
"So we've used isotope tracing to trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree down her trunk into the mycorrhizal network and into her neighboring seedlings, not only carbon but also defense signals. ",「碳-13」同「碳-14」向我證明咗 樺樹同杉樹真係有傾有講嘎 
And these two compounds have increased the resistance of those seedlings to future stresses. ,我哋發現 夏天時 樺樹送碳俾杉樹，多過收碳返來 尤其喺杉樹俾嘢遮住嗰陣 
So trees talk. ,往後嘅實驗有相反嘅結果 杉樹送碳元素俾樺樹，多過收碳返來 事關嗰時杉樹仲有葉，而樺樹落曬葉 
(Applause) Thank you. ,兩種樹真係互相倚靠 就好似陰同陽咁 
"Through back and forth conversations, they increase the resilience of the whole community. ",喺嗰一刻，一切都豁然開朗 
"It probably reminds you of our own social communities, and our families, well, at least some families. ",我知道我嘅發現好重大 使我哋重新審視到樹木同森林嘅關係 佢哋之間唔單只有競爭 仲有互相合作 
(Laughter) So let's come back to the initial point. ,我終於搵到有力嘅證據 證明龐大嘅地下溝通網絡 確實存在 
"Forests aren't simply collections of trees, they're complex systems with hubs and networks that overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate, and they provide avenues for feedbacks and adaptation, and this makes the forest resilient. ",呢個時候，我衷心期盼 我嘅發現會改變林業嘅操作 從大規模斬樹、濫用除草劑 轉為宏觀、持續 廉價、更實嘅方法 
That's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks. ,我有啲咩方法？ 
"But they're also vulnerable, vulnerable not only to natural disturbances like bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees but high-grade logging and clear-cut logging. ",陣間話你聽 
"You see, you can take out one or two hub trees, but there comes a tipping point, because hub trees are not unlike rivets in an airplane. ",我們點樣研究森林嘅複雜系統？ 
"You can take out one or two and the plane still flies, but you take out one too many, or maybe that one holding on the wings, and the whole system collapses. ",既然係研究森林，就要深入森林 但確實好難，正如你啱啱所見 
So now how are you thinking about forests? Differently? ,兼且要識得點避開啲熊人 
(Audience) Yes. ,但我哋要堅持 哪怕係困難重重 
Cool. ,更要順從自己嘅直覺同經驗 問一啲有價值嘅問題 
I'm glad. ,之後我們要收集數據，同去驗證 
"So, remember I said earlier that I hoped that my research, my discoveries would change the way we practice forestry. ",我做同發表過數以百計嘅森林實驗 
"Well, I want to take a check on that 30 years later here in western Canada. ",有啲實驗基地已經用咗三十年 
"This is about 100 kilometers to the west of us, just on the border of Banff National Park. ",你哋可以去望下 
That's a lot of clear-cuts. ,森林科學本應係咁 
It's not so pristine. ,接住我想從科學角度探討 
"In 2014, the World Resources Institute reported that Canada in the past decade has had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide, and I bet you thought it was Brazil. ",樺樹同杉樹到底點溝通嘅呢？ 
"In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year. ",事實上，佢哋除咗用碳作為媒介嚟交流 仲會用氮同磷 同水、防禦信號 等位基因化學物、激素 呢啲都係信息 
"Now, by my estimation, that's about four times the rate that is sustainable. ",喺我嘅發現之前，科學家認為 地底之所以有互惠共生嘅現象 係因為有菌根 
"Now, massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles, degrade wildlife habitat, and emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere, which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks. ",菌根，亦即係「菇菌嘅根」 
"Not only that, we're continuing to plant one or two species and weed out the aspens and birches. ",你行過森林，會見到佢哋嘅繁殖器官 
"These simplified forests lack complexity, and they're really vulnerable to infections and bugs. ",佢哋就係蘑菇 
"And as climate changes, this is creating a perfect storm for extreme events, like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak that just swept across North America, or that megafire in the last couple months in Alberta. ",而菇頂只係佢嘅一小部份 因為菇柄底會長出真菌絲 形成菌絲體，繼而感染同侵佔 其他植物嘅根部 
"So I want to come back to my final question: instead of weakening our forests, how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change? ",真菌細胞同樹根細胞交織嘅地方 都有用碳換取養份嘅現象 真菌向下生長，包實啲土壤顆粒 繼而吸收養份 
"Well, you know, the great thing about forests as complex systems is they have enormous capacity to self-heal. ",個菌絲網密到話唔定有幾百公里長 堆埋得個腳板咁細 
"In our recent experiments, we found with patch-cutting and retention of hub trees and regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes that these mycorrhizal networks, they recover really rapidly. ",除此之外，菌絲會連接森林嘅不同植物 不論係咪同一物種，譬如樺樹同杉樹咁 運作模式十足十係個互聯網 
"So with this in mind, I want to leave you with four simple solutions. ",同所有嘅網絡一樣 菌根嘅網絡由綫同點組成 
And we can't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on. ,我哋分析咗森林每棵杉樹同菇嘅 DNA 短序， 然後畫咗呢張地圖 
"First, we all need to get out in the forest. ",圖中嘅圓點代表住黃杉 啲綫代表住菌根之間嘅連繫 
We need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests. ,最大最深色嘅圓點，擁有最多連接 
"You see, most of our forests now are managed using a one-size-fits-all approach, but good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions. ",佢哋叫核心樹木 又暱稱「母樹」 因為佢哋會滋養住 年輕嘅矮層灌木 
"Second, we need to save our old-growth forests. ",黃色圓點 代表同母樹有連繫嘅樹苗 森林裡面 一棵母樹可以連繫住過百棵樹 
These are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks. ,透過同位素示蹤劑進行檢測 
So this means less cutting. ,我哋察覺到 母樹會透過菌根嘅聯網傳 送剩餘嘅碳俾 矮層嘅樹苗 我哋發現，樹苗嘅存活率 會因此大增四倍 
"I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting. ",正如父母會愛錫自己嘅仔女 所以我諗，黃杉會唔會好似嗰隻熊咁 認到自己啲仔女呢？ 
"And third, when we do cut, we need to save the legacies, the mother trees and networks, and the wood, the genes, so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road. ",我哋於是設計咗個實驗 將母樹、幼苗同其他種子種埋一齊 
We need to be conservationists. ,結果母樹認得出自己嘅後代 
"And finally, fourthly and finally, we need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species and genotypes and structures by planting and allowing natural regeneration. ",母樹利用更大嘅菌根網包裹幼苗 
We have to give Mother Nature the tools she needs to use her intelligence to self-heal. ,喺地底傳送更多嘅碳 
"And we need to remember that forests aren't just a bunch of trees competing with each other, they're supercooperators. ",甚至減少自己根部嘅發展 為幼苗創造生長空間 
So back to Jigs. ,喺母樹受傷或者就來枯萎 佢哋會將生存智慧傳俾下一代 
"Jigs's fall into the outhouse showed me this other world, and it changed my view of forests. ",我哋透過同位素示蹤法，追蹤碳嘅移動 從受傷嘅母樹嘅樹幹傳到菌根網 再傳到周圍嘅幼苗 唔單止係碳 仲有防禦信號 
I hope today to have changed how you think about forests. ,呢兩種混合物 增加咗幼苗嘅抗壓能力 
Thank you. ,所以樹木識講嘢 
(Applause) ,（掌聲） 多謝 
,經過反反覆覆嘅對話 佢哋增強咗成個團體嘅適應力 
"In July of 1911, a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor set out from his rainforest camp with his team. ",佢哋可能令你諗起咗 我嘅社會群體，我哋嘅家庭 嗯，至少部分家庭啦 
"After climbing a steep hill and wiping the sweat from his brow, he described what he saw beneath him. ",（笑聲） 我哋返到最初嘅問題 
"He saw rising from the dense rainforest foliage this incredible interlocking maze of structures built of granite, beautifully put together. ",森林唔單只有樹 佢哋係有樞紐同網絡嘅複雜系統 彼此覆蓋同聯繫，令佢哋可以交流 仲提供咗反饋同適應嘅方式 加強咗森林嘅適應能力 
"What's amazing about this project is that it was the first funded by National Geographic, and it graced the front cover of its magazine in 1912. ",因為森林有好多樞紐同彼此覆蓋嘅網絡 
"This professor used state-of-the-art photography equipment to record the site, forever changing the face of exploration. ",但係佢哋都好脆弱 唔單只會受到自然嘅干擾 譬如特別鍾意侵襲老樹嘅樹皮甲蟲 仲受到高強度伐木同清場式伐木嘅影響 
"The site was Machu Picchu, discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham. ",你可以攞走一兩棵樞紐樹 但係呢個就已經係極限 因為樞紐樹好似飛機上嘅卯釘 
"When he saw the site, he asked, ""This is an impossible dream. ",你攞走一兩粒卯釘，飛機仲飛得 但係如果你攞走太多 或著你攞走一個關鍵嘅卯釘 成個系統都會塌 
"So today, 100 years later, I invite you all on an incredible journey with me, a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor. ",咁宜家你係點睇啲森林？有冇啲唔同？ 
(Cheers) We will do nothing less than use state-of-the-art technology to map an entire country. ,（觀眾）係 
"This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham, but we are expanding it to the world, making archaeological exploration more open, inclusive, and at a scale simply not previously possible. ",太好啦 
"This is why I am so excited to share with you all today that we will begin the 2016 TED Prize platform in Latin America, more specifically Peru. ",我好高興 
(Applause) Thank you. ,記得我之前話過，我希望我嘅研究 同發現會改變我哋實踐林學嘅方式 
We will be taking Hiram Bingham's impossible dream and turning it into an amazing future that we can all share in together. ,我諗喺 30 年後，喺加拿大西部做檢測 
So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu. ,既係呢度向西 100 公里 就喺班夫國家公園嘅邊界 
"It has absolutely stunning jewelry, like what you can see here. ",嗰度有好多清場式伐木 
It has amazing Moche pottery of human figures. ,唔再係原始森林啦 
It has the Nazca Lines and amazing textiles. ,2014 年，世界資源研究所報導 過去十年加拿大有世界最高森林破壞率 你哋以為嗰個國家係巴西，係唔係 
"So as part of the TED Prize platform, we are going to partnering with some incredible organizations, first of all with DigitalGlobe, the world's largest provider of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery. ",喺加拿大，破壞率係每年 3.6% 
They're going to be helping us build out this amazing crowdsourcing platform they have. ,據我估計，係可持續破壞率嘅四倍 
Maybe some of you used it with the MH370 crash and search for the airplane. ,咁規模嘅大面積破壞明顯影響水循環 惡化野生生態環境 而且将溫室氣體放返入大氣 結果導致更加多嘅破壞同樹嘅回枯 
"Of course, they'll also be providing us with the satellite imagery. ",仲有，我們繼續種一種或著兩種樹木 停種同消滅山楊樹同樺樹 
National Geographic will be helping us with education and of course exploration. ,咁嘅森林冇曬多樣性 會好易患傳染病同受蟲害影響 
"As well, they'll be providing us with rich content for the platform, including some of the archival imagery like you saw at the beginning of this talk and some of their documentary footage. ",隨著氣候變化 幾樣嘢夾埋後果會好嚴重 譬如啱啱蔓延咗成個北美洲嘅 大規模山地松樹甲蟲蟲災 仲有最近喺阿爾伯塔嘅超級大火 
"We've already begun to build and plan the platform, and I'm just so excited. ",所以宜家我哋返到最後一個問題： 與其弱化我哋嘅森林， 我哋點樣 強化佢哋適應氣候變化嘅能力 
So here's the cool part. ,作為複雜嘅生態系統，森林好叻嘅一點 就係佢哋有好強嘅自我修復能力 
"My team, headed up by Chase Childs, is already beginning to look at some of the satellite imagery. ",我哋近期嘅實驗表明 用小規模砍伐、保護樞紐樹 重現物種多樣性 會使真菌菌根網好快咁恢復 
"Of course, what you can see here is 0.3-meter data. ",我想留畀你哋四個簡單嘅方案，我哋 
This is site called Chan Chan in northern Peru. ,唔可以呃自己，話啲方法太複雜做唔到 
It dates to 850 AD. ,首先，我哋都需要行入森林 
"It's a really amazing city, but let's zoom in. ",我哋需要令當地人重新融入啲森林度 
This is the type and quality of data that you all will get to see. ,宜家我哋大多數嘅森林 都俾人用單一嘅方式管理，但係 好嘅森林管理需要關於當地條件嘅知識 
"You can see individual structures, individual buildings. ",第二，我哋要完挽救我哋嘅老齡林 
And we've already begun to find previously unknown sites. ,佢哋係基因、母樹同真菌菌根網 嘅信息庫 
"What we can say already is that as part of the platform, you will all help discover thousands of previously unknown sites, like this one here, and this potentially large one here. ",即係要減少伐木 
"Unfortunately, we've also begun to uncover large-scale looting at sites, like what you see here. ",我唔係話禁止伐木，而係減少伐木 
"So many sites in Peru are threatened, but the great part is that all of this data is going to be shared with archaeologists on the front lines of protecting these sites. ",第三，喺我哋伐木時 挽救樹木嘅「遺産」 母樹同真菌菌根網 仲有樹林同基因 咁樣先可以将智慧傳畀下一代嘅樹木 使佢哋有應對未來壓力嘅能力 
"So I was just in Peru, meeting with their Minister of Culture as well as UNESCO. ",我哋需要成為自然環境保護主義者 
We'll be collaborating closely with them. ,最尾，第四點 再生擁有物種多樣性 基因型多樣性同結構多樣性嘅森林 必须通過人工種植同自然再生 
"Just so you all know, the site is going to be in both English and Spanish, which is absolutely essential to make sure that people in Peru and across Latin America can participate. ",我哋必須畀大自然需要嘅 可以幫佢自我治癒嘅工具 
"Our main project coprincipal investigator is the gentleman you see here, Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo, professor at Catholic University. ",森林唔單只係互相競爭嘅 一叢叢樹木 佢哋係超級合作者 
"As a respected Peruvian archaeologist and former vice-minister, Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate and share the data with archaeologists so they can explore these sites on the ground. ",再講返 Jigs 
"He also runs this amazing drone mapping program, some of the images of which you can see behind me here and here. ",Jigs 嗰件事令我睇到另外嘅世界 同改變咗我對森林嘅睇法 
"And this data will be incorporated into the platform, and also he'll be helping to image some of the new sites you help find. ",希望我今日改變咗你哋對森林嘅睇法 
"Our on-the-ground partner who will be helping us with education, outreach, as well as site preservation components, is the Sustainable Preservation Initiative, led by Dr. Larry Coben. ",多謝 
Some of you may not be aware that some of the world's poorest communities coexist with some of the world's most well-known archaeological sites. ,（掌聲） 
"What SPI does is it helps to empower these communities, in particular women, with new economic approaches and business training. ",
So it helps to teach them to create beautiful handicrafts which are then sold on to tourists. ,1911 年 7 月 一個 35 歲嘅耶魯大學畢業生、教授 同佢嘅團隊從雨林中嘅帳篷出發 
This empowers the women to treasure their cultural heritage and take ownership of it. ,翻過一座陡峭嘅山 拭去眉毛上嘅汗水 佢描述咗身下嘅景象 
"I had the opportunity to spend some time with 24 of these women at a well-known archaeological site called Pachacamac, just outside Lima. ",從茂密嘅熱帶雨林植被之中 佢睇到由花崗岩建造嘅 不可思議嘅迷宮結構 
"These women were unbelievably inspiring, and what's great is that SPI will help us transform communities near some of the sites that you help to discover. ",呢個項目奇妙在 佢係國家地理雜誌第一個資助嘅項目 並為 1912 年嘅雜誌封面增添風采 
Peru is just the beginning. ,呢位教授用咗最先進嘅攝影設備 去記錄呢個遺址 從此改變咗探索 
"We're going to be expanding this platform to the world, but already I've gotten thousands of emails from people all across the world -- professors, educators, students, and other archaeologists -- who are so excited to help participate. ",遺跡位於馬丘比丘 由 Hiram Bingham 發現嘅 
"In fact, they're already suggesting amazing places for us to help discover, including Atlantis. ",當佢睇到嗰個遺跡，佢問︰ 「呢個係冇可能嘅，點解會搵到嘅呢？」 
"I don't know if we're going to be looking for Atlantis, but you never know. ",所以今日 一百年之後 我邀請你哋同我 一位 37 歲嘅耶魯畢業生、教授 共赴一場奇妙旅程 
So I'm just so excited to launch this platform. ,（歡呼聲） 我哋會用到最先進科技 描繪成個國家嘅地形 
It's going to be launched formally by the end of the year. ,呢一個夢係由 Hiram Bingham 開始嘅 但我哋將個夢延伸到全世界 令更多地方都可以有考古 亦令到考古規模更加大 
"And I have to say, if what my team has already discovered in the past few weeks are any indication, what the world discovers is just going to be beyond imagination. ",呢樣就係點解 今日我會咁興奮同你哋分享 我哋將會喺拉丁美洲 具體啲喺秘魯 執行 2016 年 TED 大獎嘅計劃 
Make sure to hold on to your alpacas. ,（掌聲） 多謝 
Thank you very much. ,我哋要將 Hiram Bingham 不可能嘅夢 變成未來一個 我哋可以共同擔當嘅工作 
(Applause) Thank you. ,秘魯唔單只有馬丘比丘 
(Applause) ,仲有精緻嘅珠寶 就好似你喺呢度睇到嘅咁 
,有栩栩如生嘅 Moche 陶土人偶 
"(Music) Rainn Wilson: It takes its toll, being alone. ",有納斯卡線條 同令人驚歎嘅紡織品 
"I'm a little bit lost, and it's finally time to make a real connection. ",按著 TED 大獎嘅計劃嚟到做 我哋打算同一啲組織合作 首先同 DigitalGlobe 世界上最大嘅高分辨率 商用衛星圖像供應商 
Who am I? ,佢哋會幫我哋建立 呢個佢哋有嘅眾包平台 
"(Drums) I'm a single white male, 45 years of age. ",可能你哋當中 曾經有人都喺 DigitalGlobe 上面 幫手搵 MH370 嘅飛機 
I love animals. ,當然，佢哋都會提供衛星圖像 
Gainfully employed. ,國家地理雜誌將會提供 教育同課程開發方面嘅幫助 
I'm a people person. ,佢哋都會為我哋嘅平台提供豐富資源 包括你喺演講開始睇到嘅一啲檔案圖像 同埋一啲佢哋嘅紀錄片片段 
I keep fit. ,我哋已經開始咗建立同設計平台 而我依家好興奮 
Who am I looking for? ,跟住落嚟仲勁︰ 
I'm looking for my idea mate. ,由 Chase Childs 帶領嘅團隊 已經開始查緊一啲衛星圖像 
Are you that idea that matches with who I really am? ,當然，你依家睇到嘅係 長 0.3 米嘅地面 
(Video) Ron Finley: How would you feel if you had no access to healthy food? ,呢個就係秘魯北部 稱為 Chan Chan 嘅遺跡 
Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do. ,可以追溯到公元 850 年 
"RW: Wow, we sure are getting our fingers dirty for a first date, huh? ",呢座城市真係好神奇 等我哋放大嚟睇睇 
RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do. ,你哋遲啲睇到嘅數據 都係咁嘅類型同埋質素 
People in these areas -- they're exposed to crappy food. ,你會睇到單獨建築 
I want people to know that growing your own food is like printing your own money. ,仲有我哋已經開始搵早前未知嘅遺跡 
RW: You're like a food superhero! ,我哋可以肯定嘅係，作為平台嘅一份子 你會幫手搵好多之前未知嘅遺跡 就好似呢度呢個 同埋呢個潛在大型嘅遺跡 
RF: Food is the problem and food is the solution. ,不幸嘅係，我哋亦都喺遺跡發現 大規模搶劫嘅痕跡 就好似你哋依家睇到咁樣 
(Music) Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer. ,所以秘魯嘅好多遺跡都面臨威脅 但係令人欣慰嘅係 所有數據都會同前線 保護呢啲遺跡嘅考古學家分享 
My job is to put every word possible into the dictionary. ,冇幾耐之前，我同秘魯嘅文化部長 同埋 UNESCO 會面 
"RW: I love words, too -- just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer. ",我哋之間將會有密切合作 
"What if you love a word that you've just made up, like -- I don't know -- ""scuberfinkles""? ",就好似你哋所知咁 遺跡嘅工作將會用到英文同西班牙文 確保秘魯同其他拉丁美洲嘅人 都能夠參與 
Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality? ,我哋嘅聯合首席研究員就係佢︰ 美國天主教大學嘅 Luis Jaime Castillo 教授 
"RW: Well, I'm a little nearsighted, but yeah. ",身為備受尊敬嘅秘魯考古學家 同前任文化副部長 Luis Jaime Castillo 將會幫我哋 同考古學家協調分享數據 令佢哋就可以實地探索遺跡 
"BL: Well, you can't -- I mean, your brain has no access to this world. ",佢亦都開展緊無人機地圖測繪計劃 喺我背後睇到你可以見到其中一啲圖像 
"In fact, even the sensory information that your eyes are receiving, your ears are receiving, is completely meaningless because it could mean anything. ",而呢啲數據會被收入平臺之中 佢同時會描繪新遺跡，等你可以幫手搵 
"That tree could be a large object far away or a small object up close, and your brain has no way of knowing. ",我哋嘅實地探索團隊 會幫手做教育、外展 以及遺跡保護 個團隊都係屬於 由 Larry Coben 博士帶領嘅 可持續保護行動計劃 
RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot but it was just a German shepherd. ,你哋可能唔知啦 世界上嘅一啲最貧窮嘅社區 其實喺一啲最出名嘅考古遺跡旁邊 
"Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, your closest living relatives. ",SPI 嘅工作就係幫助呢啲社區 特別係當中嘅女性 教佢哋新嘅生活方式同訓練佢哋做生意 
Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex to manage conflict and solve social issues. ,等佢哋可以整手工藝賣畀遊客 
RW: I'm just curious: Do we have any conflict that needs managing or social issues to resolve? ,咁樣令到當地女性學識珍惜文化遺產 同埋對遺產負起主人翁嘅責任 
"IBI: Remember -- you're on a date with my idea, not me. ",我有機會同當地 24 名女性 共度一段時間 就喺利馬以外嘅 著名考古遺跡 Pachacamac 
"Jane McGonigal: This is the face of someone who, against all odds, is on the verge of an epic win. ",呢啲女性出乎意料嘅對我有啟發性 SPI 會幫我哋改造 一啲喺遺跡隔籬嘅社區 而呢啲遺跡你都會有份發現嘅 
RW: An epic win? ,秘魯只係開始 
"JM: An epic win is an outcome so extraordinarily positive, you didn't even know it was possible until you achieved it. ",我哋打算將呢個平台推廣到全世界 但目前我已經收到世界各地幾千封電郵 嚟自教授、教育工作者、學生 仲有考古學家 佢哋非常興奮話想要幫手搵 
You're not making the face. ,佢哋甚至提議咗一啲地方去搵 包括亞特蘭蒂斯 
"You're making the ""I'm not good at life"" face. ",我唔知道我哋係唔係會搵亞特蘭蒂斯 可能我哋會去搵都未定 
"RW: Arthur, I want to be really honest with you. ",所以我好開心啟動呢個平台 
I am seeing other ideas. OK? ,個平台將會喺今年年底正式發佈 
I'm dating around. ,我想講嘅係 如果我哋團隊喺過去幾星期 已經發現到一啲跡象 咁樣之後全世界嘅發現將會超乎想像 
That's the situation. ,請繼續支持我哋呢個項目 
"Arthur Benjamin: I'd say this: Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why. ",好多謝你哋 
RW: Do you want to get some pie? ,（掌聲） 多謝 
AB: Pi? ,（掌聲） 
"3.14159265358979 -- Reggie Watts: If we're going to do something, we've got to just make a decision. ",
Because without a decision we're left powerless. ,（音樂） 主角︰孤獨係需要代價嘅 
"Without power, we have nothing to supply the chain of those who are truly curious to solve all of our current conditions. ",我有一啲迷茫 但最終都係時候同外界有真實聯繫

"RF: Hell, no! Let's go plant some shit! ",我喺度搵緊我嘅思想 
RW: Let's plant some shit! ,你係唔係嗰個呼應我內心嘅諗法？ 
"Good, now what is this that I'm planting? ",（影片）Ron Finley︰ 如果你買唔到健康食物 你會有乜嘢感受？ 
Bonobos! ,園藝係你可以做嘅嘢當中 最治癒又最挑戰嘅事 
IBI: Bonobos! (Laughs) Bonobos. ,主角︰哇，我哋一開頭 就要整邋遢手指，係唔係？ 
"RWatts: Um, interested much? ",Ron Finley︰園藝係你可以做嘅 最治愈又挑戰嘅事 
RW: I want to have your idea baby. ,呢啲地方嘅人 佢哋接觸到嘅都係差嘅食物 
"RWatts: Well, you know what they say in Russia. ",我想大家明白自己種食物 就好似自己喺度印錢咁 主角︰你簡直係人類糧食嘅救星！ 
RW: Hm? ,Ron Finley︰食物既係問題，又係答案 
"RWatts: ""scuberfinckle."" ",（音樂） 
(Bottles clink) ,Erin McKean︰我係編寫詞典嘅 
,我嘅工作就係將每個可能存在嘅單詞 放入詞典裏面 
It's funny the things you forget. ,主角︰我都好鍾意單詞 就好似詞典編纂者鍾意單詞一樣 
"I went to see my mother the other day, and she told me this story that I'd completely forgotten about how, when we were driving together, she would pull the car over, and by the time she had gotten out of the car, and gone around the car to let me out of the car, I would have already gotten out of the car and pretended to have died. ",如果你好鍾意你隨意創造出嚟嘅詞 譬如，我隨便講個，「scuberfinkles」 你會做啲咩？ 
(Laughter) (Applause) Because that's how you die. ,Beau Lotto︰你真係睇清楚喇？ 
"(Laughter) And I remember, that was a game I used to play with myself to entertain myself whenever I was bored or frustrated. ",主角︰欸，我有一啲近視 但係我睇清楚喇 
(Laughter) Settle down. ,Beau Lotto︰你冇 我嘅意思係 你嘅大腦根本接觸唔到呢個世界 
(Laughter) People say we live in an age of information overload. Right? ,你眼感知到嘅訊息 你耳仔感知到嘅訊息 全部都係冇意義嘅 因為訊息可以代表任何嘢 
"I don't know about that, but I just know that I get too many marketing emails. ",嗰棵樹可以係一個遠在天邊嘅龐然大物 或者係近在眼前嘅細粒丁 但係你嘅大腦無辦法知道答案 
"I got a marketing email from a supermarket firm, which will remain nameless for predominantly legal reasons, but which I'm going to call ""SafeMart."" ",主角︰有一次我以為自己睇到大腳怪 但其實係一個德國牧羊人 
"(Laughter) I got an email from them, and it went like this, it said: ""Just three weeks until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"" ",Isabel Behncke Izquierdo︰ 倭黑猩猩同黑猩猩 都係人類最近親嘅物種 
"And I resented this, because not only do I not remember signing up to that, but I resent the fact that they appear to think that I should be excited about a shop opening. ",為咗化解矛盾、解決社會問題 倭黑猩猩交配得非常頻繁、混亂 
"So what I did was I scrolled down to the bottom of the email, and I pressed, ""Unsubscribe."" ",主角︰我凈係好奇 我哋兩個有冇乜嘢矛盾要化解 或者社會問題要解決？ 
And I thought that'd be the end of it. ,Isabel Behncke Izquierdo︰ 記住，你係追隨我嘅諗法 而唔係追隨我 
"But a week later, I got another one that said, ""Just two weeks until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"" ",Jane McGonigal︰呢個表情係 當一個人排除萬難 嚟到華麗制勝一刻嘅表情 
"And I thought, obviously, I haven't clicked hard enough. ",主角︰華麗制勝？ 
So I tried it again. Right? ,Jane McGonigal︰ 「華麗制勝」意味著成功咁解 你直至成功之前都唔會相信自己得咗 
"Lo and behold, a week passes, you guessed it, ""Just one week until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"" ",你冇做嗰個表情喔 
And here's the problem: The internet gave us access to everything; but it also gave everything access to us. ,你喺度做緊一個「我過得唔好」嘅表情 
"It's hard enough to discriminate between the things that genuinely matter in this world and the minutiae of life, without having emails about supermarket chains and Candy Crush Saga. ",主角︰Arthur，我想同你坦白 
"And I was really annoyed with them, and I thought, OK, I was about to write a strongly worded email, which I can do quite well. ",我喺度搵緊一啲諗法，你明掛？ 
"(Laughter) And I thought, no -- I'm going to find the game. ",我喺度搵新諗法 
"So I replied to it, and I said, ""I literally cannot wait!!!!"" ",呢個就係我嘅情況 
"(Laughter) ""What do you need from me?"" ",Arthur Benjamin︰我會咁講 數學唔單止係求解 x 同時都係度刨根問底 
"They got back to me; a guy called Dan said, ""Hi James. I've asked a colleague to help me with your query."" ",主角︰你想唔想食啲批？ 
(Laughter) Like it needs help. ,Arthur Benjamin︰π ？ 
"And I said, ""What's the plan, Dan? ",3.14159265358979… Reggie Watts︰ 如果我哋打算去做啲乜嘢 我哋就要做一個決定 
"I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."" ",因為如果冇決定，我哋就會冇力量 
"(Laughter) ""I'm not sure what you mean."" ",冇力量，我啲就冇嘢去幫 嗰一大班真正有好奇心 去解決我哋目前所有問題嘅人 
"(Laughter) I said, ""I'm just tremendously excited about the opening!"" ",主角︰仲有，Rush 樂隊話︰ 「如果你選擇唔去做決定， 咁你依然做咗一個決定。」 
"(Laughter) ""Do you want to book the bouncy castle or shall I?"" ",Jane McGonigal︰冇錯！ 
"He said, ""I think you have misunderstood."" ",當我哋迎接下個世紀嘅挑戰時 呢個就係我哋急切 想喺全世界智多星面上睇到嘅一種表情 
"(Laughter) ""A new store is opening, but there is no celebration planned."" ",主角︰所以，我哋要唔要 AA 制啊？ 
"I said, ""But what was all the 'Three weeks until,' 'Two weeks until' emails? ",Arthur Benjamin︰ 3846264338327950 28841… 
"(Laughter) ""I'm sorry you're disappointed."" ",971？ 
"(Laughter) I said, ""Not to worry. ",主角︰就一晚，要唔要去睇下電影 或者做其他嘢？ 
Let's do something anyway! ,Ron Finley︰正經啲啊！一齊嚟種嘢！ 
"Besides, the deposit on the bouncy castle was non-refundable."" ",主角︰一齊嚟種嘢！ 
"(Laughter) ""If we don't use it, we're out a few hundred quid, Dan."" ",好，咁我依家喺度種緊啲乜嘢啊？ 
"(Laughter) He said, ""Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsible for anything you have ordered."" ",倭黑猩猩！ 
"I said, ""Let's not get into who did what. ",Isabel Behncke Izquierdo︰ 倭黑猩猩！（笑） 倭黑猩猩 
"Bottom line: you and I are in this together."" ",Reggie Watts︰點啊，好感興趣？ 
"(Laughter) (Applause) ""Question: Will you be there to make sure people take their shoes off?"" ",主角︰我想聽你嘅諗法 
"(Laughter) I'll be honest, then my relationship with Dan deteriorated somewhat, because the next email I got was this: ""Thanks for your email - your Case Number is ..."" ",Reggie Watts︰咁 你知道佢哋俄語係點講？ 
(Laughter) That's outrageous. ,主角︰嗯？ 
"I said, ""Dan?"" ",Reggie Watts︰「scuberfinckle」 
"(Laughter) And I got -- and I was just like, this is ... -- and I, I .... ","（酒瓶碰撞聲） （十年以嚟，好嘅意念 滿足過無數好奇心） （多過 2,200 條影片，46 億人次收看） （往後更要一齊探索新意念） "
"And I said, ""Danny?"" ",
"And I thought, this is terrible. All I'm doing is collecting case numbers. ",唔記得嘅事係幾有趣 
"I said, ""D-Dog?"" ",有一日我探我媽 佢同我講呢個 我已經完全唔記得嘅故事 就係我同媽媽出街揸車，佢泊車 當佢落車 佢走去另一邊，畀我落車 而我已經一早落咗車 仲扮死添 
"(Laughter) ""The store is now open."" ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 因為我哋都係咁死 
"(Laughter) I said, ""But Dan, they must have wondered why there was no bouncy castle."" ",（笑聲） 仲記得我悶同煩惱嗰陣 我都會咁樣同自己玩，娛樂自己 
And then we were back to this. ,（笑聲） 就係冷靜 
"And that might have been the end of the story, but I remembered that anything -- everything -- even something as mundane as getting out of a car, can be fun if you find the right game. ",（笑聲） 好多人講我哋生活喺資訊爆炸嘅時代？ 
"So, this is what I replied: [Thanks for your email - your Case Number is #0000001.] (Laughter) (Applause) And we just, uh ... ",我唔知道呀 但我剩係知我收到好多推廣電郵 
(Laughter) It was like we were dancing. ,有一封係黎自超級市場 主要因為法律原因，我唔會講名 所以我就叫佢做 SafeMart 
We just kept going. ,（笑聲） 佢哋嘅電郵內容係︰ 「仲有三日就係 King's Cross 嘅 SafeMart 開幕！」 
It was lovely. ,我好嬲 首先因為係唔記得訂閱過佢哋 其次因為 佢哋覺得我應該要為超市開幕而興奮 
"But to be honest, guys, it was quite labor-intensive, and I had other stuff to do, believe it or not. ",於是我拉落去電郵最底 㩒取消訂閱 
So what I did is I have a little email auto-replier program. ,我以為就咁可以告一段落 
"And I set it up so every time it receives an email from SafeMart, it just pings one back. ",誰不知一星期後，我收到另一封電郵 話︰「仲有兩個星期 King's Cross 嘅 SafeMart 開幕啦！」 
"So I set it up, and it says, ""Thanks for your email - your Case Number is ..."" ",我諗係我未㩒到取消訂閱 
Then it has a little formula that I wrote to up the case number every time. ,所以我再試多次 
And I put it on the server and set it running. ,一個星期之後，你估下咩事？ 「仲有一個星期 King's Cross 嘅 SafeMart 開幕啦！」 
"(Laughter) I'll be honest, guys -- then I forgot about it. ",呢度有一個問題 我哋因為互聯網而知道曬所有嘅嘢 同時我哋都暴露無遺 
"(Laughter) I checked back on it the other day, and it appears there have been a number of emails going back and forth. ",冇咗連鎖超市同 Candy Crush 嘅電郵 我哋係好難去分別 乜嘢係對呢個世界真正重要 同對生命微不足道 
"We're on 21,439. ",但我真係覺得佢哋好煩 所以我要寫一封好嚴肅嘅電郵 而且我覺得我會勝任呢件事 
(Applause) It gives me an immense sense of satisfaction to know that these computer programs are just going to be pinging one another for eternity. ,（笑聲） 我覺得都係唔得 我要玩個遊戲 
"And as legacies go, I don't think that's bad. ",所以我回覆電郵話︰ 「我真係好期待！」 
"So guys, just remember: if ever you feel weighed down by the bureaucracy and often mundanity of modern life, don't fight the frustration. ",（笑聲） 「我有咩可以幫到你？」 
Let it be the catalyst for whimsy. ,然後有個叫 Dan 嘅男人回覆我︰ 「你好 James，我已經 叫我同事回答你嘅問題。」 
(Laughter) Thank you. ,（笑聲） 好似真係需要協助 
(Applause) ,我話︰「Dan 你有咩計劃？ 
,我諗緊煙花、充氣城堡…」 
I'm going to talk about a failure of intuition that many of us suffer from. ,（笑聲） 「我唔係好明你意思。」 
It's really a failure to detect a certain kind of danger. ,（笑聲） 我話︰「我只係對開幕超級期待！」 
"I'm going to describe a scenario that I think is both terrifying and likely to occur, and that's not a good combination, as it turns out. ",（笑聲） 「你想唔想訂充氣城堡， 或者我幫你訂？」 
"And yet rather than be scared, most of you will feel that what I'm talking about is kind of cool. ",佢話︰「我諗有啲誤會。」 
I'm going to describe how the gains we make in artificial intelligence could ultimately destroy us. ,（笑聲） 「新店開幕，不過冇慶祝計劃。」 
"And in fact, I think it's very difficult to see how they won't destroy us or inspire us to destroy ourselves. ",我話︰「但係啲倒數嘅電郵 令我愈來愈興奮！」 
"And yet if you're anything like me, you'll find that it's fun to think about these things. ",（笑聲） 「唔好意思，令你失望。」 
And that response is part of the problem. ,（笑聲） 我話︰「唔緊要， 
OK? That response should worry you. ,等我哋做啲嘢。 
"And if I were to convince you in this talk that we were likely to suffer a global famine, either because of climate change or some other catastrophe, and that your grandchildren, or their grandchildren, are very likely to live like this, you wouldn't think, ""Interesting. ",不過充氣城堡嘅訂金係無得退。」 
Famine isn't fun. ,（笑聲） 「如果我哋唔用， 我哋會損失幾百英磅，Dan。」 
"Death by science fiction, on the other hand, is fun, and one of the things that worries me most about the development of AI at this point is that we seem unable to marshal an appropriate emotional response to the dangers that lie ahead. ",（笑聲） 佢話︰「Veitch 先生， 我唔係負責你訂購咗嘅嘢。」 
"I am unable to marshal this response, and I'm giving this talk. ",我話︰「咁我哋唔傾邊個負責乜嘢。」 
It's as though we stand before two doors. ,最低嗰行︰呢件事係我同你都有份嘅 
"Behind door number one, we stop making progress in building intelligent machines. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 「問題︰你會唔會喺嗰度 確保所有人除鞋㗎？」 
Our computer hardware and software just stops getting better for some reason. ,（笑聲） 好老實，我同 Dan 嘅關係之後差咗 因為我收到嘅下一個電郵係︰ 「多謝你嘅電郵，你嘅檔案編號係…」 
Now take a moment to consider why this might happen. ,（笑聲） 咁好奇怪 
"I mean, given how valuable intelligence and automation are, we will continue to improve our technology if we are at all able to. ",我話︰「Dan？」 
What could stop us from doing this? ,（笑聲） 之後我收到… 「多謝，你嘅檔案編號係 #39009371。」 
A full-scale nuclear war? ,我話︰「Danny？」 
A global pandemic? ,我心諗咁樣唔掂喎 因為佢之後回覆嘅電郵都只有檔案編號 
An asteroid impact? ,所以我話︰阿狗公？ 
Justin Bieber becoming president of the United States? ,（笑聲） 然後我收到︰「店鋪依家開幕。」 
"(Laughter) The point is, something would have to destroy civilization as we know it. ",（笑聲） 我話︰「但係 Dan， 佢哋一定諗點解無充氣城堡。」 
"You have to imagine how bad it would have to be to prevent us from making improvements in our technology permanently, generation after generation. ",之後我哋又去返檔案編號 
"Almost by definition, this is the worst thing that's ever happened in human history. ",故事可能就咁完 但係我記得任何嘢或者所有嘢 即使同落車一樣咁普通 只要我哋識玩，都可以好有趣 
"So the only alternative, and this is what lies behind door number two, is that we continue to improve our intelligent machines year after year after year. ",所以我就咁回覆︰ 「多謝你嘅電郵， 你嘅檔案編號係 #0000001。」 （笑聲） （掌聲） 而我哋… 
"At a certain point, we will build machines that are smarter than we are, and once we have machines that are smarter than we are, they will begin to improve themselves. ",（笑聲） 我哋好似跳舞咁有一段美好嘅關係 
"And then we risk what the mathematician IJ Good called an ""intelligence explosion,"" that the process could get away from us. ",亦都所以繼續落去 
"Now, this is often caricatured, as I have here, as a fear that armies of malicious robots will attack us. ",成件事好得意 
But that isn't the most likely scenario. ,但老實講，咁樣做有啲麻煩 畢竟我有其他事做 
It's not that our machines will become spontaneously malevolent. ,所以我整咗個小小嘅 電郵自動回覆程式 
The concern is really that we will build machines that are so much more competent than we are that the slightest divergence between their goals and our own could destroy us. ,令到每次收到 SafeMart 嘅電郵 都會回覆一個返去 
Just think about how we relate to ants. ,我設定內容係︰ 「多謝你嘅電郵，你嘅檔案編號係…」 
We don't hate them. ,我仲寫咗一條程式 令到檔案編號每次會加一 
We don't go out of our way to harm them. ,我將個程式輸入個系統，同埋開咗佢 
"In fact, sometimes we take pains not to harm them. ",（笑聲） 好老實，之後我唔記得咗呢件事 
We step over them on the sidewalk. ,（笑聲） 有一日我睇返 我至發覺我同佢之間 一直都有好多電郵來來回回 
"But whenever their presence seriously conflicts with one of our goals, let's say when constructing a building like this one, we annihilate them without a qualm. ",我哋目前嘅編號係 21439 
"The concern is that we will one day build machines that, whether they're conscious or not, could treat us with similar disregard. ",（掌聲） 見到電腦程式會永遠將信件彈嚟彈去 我覺得好滿足 
"Now, I suspect this seems far-fetched to many of you. ",所以我想講 即使精彩生活不在，其實都唔係咁差啫 
"I bet there are those of you who doubt that superintelligent AI is possible, much less inevitable. ",就算你唔鍾意官僚主義 同現今平凡嘅生活模式 你都可以用佢黎製造幽默 
But then you must find something wrong with one of the following assumptions. ,所以千祈唔好唔開心 
And there are only three of them. ,（笑聲） 多謝 
Intelligence is a matter of information processing in physical systems. ,（掌聲） 
"Actually, this is a little bit more than an assumption. ",
"We have already built narrow intelligence into our machines, and many of these machines perform at a level of superhuman intelligence already. ",我想講下 一個好多人都經歷過嘅感官錯覺 
"And we know that mere matter can give rise to what is called ""general intelligence,"" an ability to think flexibly across multiple domains, because our brains have managed it. Right? ",當呢個錯覺嚟嗰陣 我哋會唔識得留意危險 
"I mean, there's just atoms in here, and as long as we continue to build systems of atoms that display more and more intelligent behavior, we will eventually, unless we are interrupted, we will eventually build general intelligence into our machines. ",我亦都想講下一個我認為駭人聽聞 同時又好有可能會發生嘅情景 呢個情景發生嘅話，唔係一件好事嚟 
"It's crucial to realize that the rate of progress doesn't matter, because any progress is enough to get us into the end zone. ",你哋可能唔覺得我依家講緊嘅嘢恐怖 反而覺得好型 
We don't need Moore's law to continue. We don't need exponential progress. ,所以我想講下 我哋人類喺人工智能方面取得嘅成就 最终會點樣摧毀我哋 
We just need to keep going. ,而事實上，我認為好難會見到 佢哋唔會摧毀我哋 或者導致我哋自我毀滅 
The second assumption is that we will keep going. ,依家你哋或者同我一樣 覺得諗呢啲嘢好得意 
We will continue to improve our intelligent machines. ,正因為覺得得意 亦都成為咗問題嘅一部份 
"And given the value of intelligence -- I mean, intelligence is either the source of everything we value or we need it to safeguard everything we value. ",你哋應該擔心你哋嘅反應至真！ 
It is our most valuable resource. ,如果我喺呢場演講度話畀你哋聽 因為氣候變化或者大災難嘅原因 我哋會遭遇一場饑荒 而你嘅孫，或者佢哋嘅孫 會好似咁樣生活 你就唔會覺得 「好有趣，我鍾意呢場 TED 演講。」 
So we want to do this. ,饑荒一啲都唔有趣 
We have problems that we desperately need to solve. ,但科幻小說描繪嘅死亡就好有趣 呢一刻，人工智能發展 最令我最困擾嘅係 我哋面對近在眼前嘅危險似乎無動於衷 
We want to cure diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. ,雖然我喺你哋面前演講 但我同你哋一樣都係冇反應 
We want to understand economic systems. We want to improve our climate science. ,成件事就好似我哋企喺兩道門前面 
"So we will do this, if we can. ",喺一號門後面，我哋唔再發展智能機器 
"The train is already out of the station, and there's no brake to pull. ",因為某啲原因 我哋電腦嘅硬件同軟件都停滯不前 
"Finally, we don't stand on a peak of intelligence, or anywhere near it, likely. ",依家嚟諗一下點解呢種情況會發生 
And this really is the crucial insight. ,即係話，因為智能同自動化好重要 所以我哋會喺許可嘅情況之下 繼續改善科技 
"This is what makes our situation so precarious, and this is what makes our intuitions about risk so unreliable. ",咁究竟係乜嘢會阻止我哋？ 
"Now, just consider the smartest person who has ever lived. ",一個全面嘅核戰爭？ 
On almost everyone's shortlist here is John von Neumann. ,一個全球流行病？ 
"I mean, the impression that von Neumann made on the people around him, and this included the greatest mathematicians and physicists of his time, is fairly well-documented. ",一個小行星撞擊？ 
"If only half the stories about him are half true, there's no question he's one of the smartest people who has ever lived. ",Justin Bieber 做咗美國總統？ 
So consider the spectrum of intelligence. ,（笑聲） 之但係，如我哋所知 有一啲嘢會摧毀文明 
Here we have John von Neumann. ,你必須要想像 如果我哋一代又一代人 永遠改善唔到科技 情況會有幾嚴重 
And then we have you and me. ,幾乎可以確定嘅係 呢個係人類史上最壞嘅事 
And then we have a chicken. ,所以唯一嘅選擇 就係二號門後嘅做法 我哋繼續年復一年升級改造智能機器 
"(Laughter) Sorry, a chicken. ",到咗某個地步 我哋就會整出比我哋仲要聰明嘅機器 一旦我哋有咗比我哋自己 仲聰明嘅機器 佢哋就會自我改良 
(Laughter) There's no reason for me to make this talk more depressing than it needs to be. ,到時我哋就會面臨數學家 IJ Good 講嘅「智能爆炸」危機 即係話，改良過程唔再需要人類 
"(Laughter) It seems overwhelmingly likely, however, that the spectrum of intelligence extends much further than we currently conceive, and if we build machines that are more intelligent than we are, they will very likely explore this spectrum in ways that we can't imagine, and exceed us in ways that we can't imagine. ",依家，經常會有人學呢張諷刺漫畫咁 描繪叛變嘅機器人會攻擊我哋 
And it's important to recognize that this is true by virtue of speed alone. ,但係呢個唔係最有可能發生嘅情景 
Right? So imagine if we just built a superintelligent AI that was no smarter than your average team of researchers at Stanford or MIT. ,我哋嘅機器唔會自動變惡 
"Well, electronic circuits function about a million times faster than biochemical ones, so this machine should think about a million times faster than the minds that built it. ",所以問題在於我哋製造出 比我哋更加做到嘢嘅機器嘅時候 佢哋目標上同我哋嘅細微分歧 會置我哋於死地 
"So you set it running for a week, and it will perform 20,000 years of human-level intellectual work, week after week after week. ",就諗下我哋同螞蟻之間嘅關係︰ 
"How could we even understand, much less constrain, a mind making this sort of progress? ",我哋唔討厭佢哋 
"The other thing that's worrying, frankly, is that, imagine the best case scenario. ",我哋唔會傷害佢哋 
So imagine we hit upon a design of superintelligent AI that has no safety concerns. ,甚至我哋為咗唔傷害佢哋 而會受一啲苦 
We have the perfect design the first time around. ,例如我哋會為咗唔踩到佢哋 而跨過佢哋 
It's as though we've been handed an oracle that behaves exactly as intended. ,但係一旦佢哋嘅存在 同我哋嘅其中一個目標有嚴重衝突 譬如話要起一棟咁樣嘅樓 我哋諗都唔諗就殺死佢哋 
"Well, this machine would be the perfect labor-saving device. ",問題係，我哋終有一日整出嘅機器—— 無論佢哋自己有冇意識都好 同樣會冷漠咁對待我哋 
"It can design the machine that can build the machine that can do any physical work, powered by sunlight, more or less for the cost of raw materials. ",依家，我估對於你哋大部份人嚟講 呢件情景都係遙不可及嘅 
So we're talking about the end of human drudgery. ,我賭你哋當中有人質疑 超級智能嘅可能性 更加唔好講 人類要避免超級智能 
We're also talking about the end of most intellectual work. ,但係你哋肯定會喺下面嘅假設當中 搵到一啲謬誤 
So what would apes like ourselves do in this circumstance? ,呢度一共有三個假設 
"Well, we'd be free to play Frisbee and give each other massages. ",喺物理系統裏面，智能等如訊息處理 
"Add some LSD and some questionable wardrobe choices, and the whole world could be like Burning Man. ",但係，呢個超過咗假設 
"(Laughter) Now, that might sound pretty good, but ask yourself what would happen under our current economic and political order? ",因為我哋已經喺我哋嘅機器裏面 植入咗弱人工智能 而且呢啲機器好多 已經處於一個超人類智能水平 
It seems likely that we would witness a level of wealth inequality and unemployment that we have never seen before. ,同時我哋知道僅僅係物質 就可以產生所謂嘅「一般智能」 一種可以喺唔同領域之間 靈活思考嘅能力 咁係因為我哋嘅大腦 已經可以做到，係唔係？ 
"Absent a willingness to immediately put this new wealth to the service of all humanity, a few trillionaires could grace the covers of our business magazines while the rest of the world would be free to starve. ",我嘅意思係，大腦凈係得原子 只要我哋繼續加設原子系統 機器就可以有更加多智能行為 除非進度有咩停頓 否則我哋最終會喺機器裏面 建構出一般智能 
And what would the Russians or the Chinese do if they heard that some company in Silicon Valley was about to deploy a superintelligent AI? ,明白進度嘅快慢並唔影響係好重要 因為任何過程都足以令我哋返唔到轉頭 
"This machine would be capable of waging war, whether terrestrial or cyber, with unprecedented power. ",我哋唔需要按照摩爾定律進行 我哋唔需要指數式增長 
This is a winner-take-all scenario. ,我哋只需要繼續做 
"To be six months ahead of the competition here is to be 500,000 years ahead, at a minimum. ",第二個假設就係我哋會繼續做 
So it seems that even mere rumors of this kind of breakthrough could cause our species to go berserk. ,我哋會繼續改造我哋嘅智能機器 
"Now, one of the most frightening things, in my view, at this moment, are the kinds of things that AI researchers say when they want to be reassuring. ",而考慮到智能嘅價值… 我係話，因為有智能 我哋至會珍重事物 或者我哋需要智能 去保護我哋珍重嘅一切 
And the most common reason we're told not to worry is time. ,智能係我哋最有寶貴嘅資源 
"This is all a long way off, don't you know. ",所以我哋想繼續發展智能 
This is probably 50 or 100 years away. ,我哋有極需解決嘅問題 
"One researcher has said, ""Worrying about AI safety is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars."" ",例如我哋想治療類似阿茲海默症 同癌症嘅疾病 
"This is the Silicon Valley version of ""don't worry your pretty little head about it."" ",我哋想認識經濟系統 我哋想改善我哋嘅氣候科學 
(Laughter) No one seems to notice that referencing the time horizon is a total non sequitur. ,所以如果可以做到嘅話 我哋會繼續發展智能 
"If intelligence is just a matter of information processing, and we continue to improve our machines, we will produce some form of superintelligence. ",件事亦都可以比喻為︰ 列車已經開出，但冇刹車掣可以踩 
And we have no idea how long it will take us to create the conditions to do that safely. ,最終，我哋唔會去到 智能嘅頂峰或者高智能水平 
Let me say that again. ,而呢個就係非常重要嘅觀察結果 
We have no idea how long it will take us to create the conditions to do that safely. ,就係呢個結果 將我哋置於岌岌可危嘅境地 亦令到我哋對於危險嘅觸覺唔可靠 
"And if you haven't noticed, 50 years is not what it used to be. ",依家，就諗下史上最聰明嘅人 
This is 50 years in months. ,幾乎喺每個人嘅名單上面 都會有 John von Neumann 
This is how long we've had the iPhone. ,我嘅意思係 John von Neumann 畀佢周圍嘅人嘅印象 包括佢畀嗰個時代最犀利嘅數學家 同物理學家嘅印象 都係有紀錄低嘅 
"This is how long ""The Simpsons"" has been on television. ",如果一半關於佢嘅故事有一半係真嘅 咁毫無疑問 佢係有史以來其中一個最聰明嘅人 
Fifty years is not that much time to meet one of the greatest challenges our species will ever face. ,所以當我哋畫一幅比較智力嘅圖 
"Once again, we seem to be failing to have an appropriate emotional response to what we have every reason to believe is coming. ",喺右邊高分嘅位置 我哋有 John von Neumann 
The computer scientist Stuart Russell has a nice analogy here. ,喺中間有你同我 
"He said, imagine that we received a message from an alien civilization, which read: ""People of Earth, we will arrive on your planet in 50 years. ",去到最左邊，我哋有雞仔 
"Get ready."" ",（笑聲） 係吖，就係一隻雞仔 
And now we're just counting down the months until the mothership lands? ,（笑聲） 我冇理由將呢個演講搞到咁灰㗎 
We would feel a little more urgency than we do. ,（笑聲） 但好有可能智力分佈 遠比我哋目前認知嘅廣 如果我哋建造出 比我哋擁有更高智慧嘅機器 佢哋嘅智力好有可能會 超越我哋認知嘅最高智力 同埋以無法想像嘅方式超越我哋 
Another reason we're told not to worry is that these machines can't help but share our values because they will be literally extensions of ourselves. ,同樣重要嘅係 單憑運算速度就可以超越我哋 
"They'll be grafted onto our brains, and we'll essentially become their limbic systems. ",啱唔啱？諗下如果我哋整咗一個 冇哈佛或者麻省理工研究人員 咁聰明嘅超級人工智能 
"Now take a moment to consider that the safest and only prudent path forward, recommended, is to implant this technology directly into our brains. ",但電路運行速度大概 比生化電路快一百萬倍 所以呢個機器嘅思考速度應該會 比佢嘅創造者快大概一百萬倍 
"Now, this may in fact be the safest and only prudent path forward, but usually one's safety concerns about a technology have to be pretty much worked out before you stick it inside your head. ",所以如果佢運行一個星期 佢就可以完成人類要兩萬年 先至完成得到嘅工作 
(Laughter) The deeper problem is that building superintelligent AI on its own seems likely to be easier than building superintelligent AI and having the completed neuroscience that allows us to seamlessly integrate our minds with it. ,而我哋又點會明白 人工智能係點樣完成咁龐大嘅運算呢？ 
"And given that the companies and governments doing this work are likely to perceive themselves as being in a race against all others, given that to win this race is to win the world, provided you don't destroy it in the next moment, then it seems likely that whatever is easier to do will get done first. ",另一個令人擔憂嘅事，老實講 就係…不如想像一下最好嘅情形 
"Now, unfortunately, I don't have a solution to this problem, apart from recommending that more of us think about it. ",想像一下我哋設計咗一個 冇安全問題嘅超級人工智能 
I think we need something like a Manhattan Project on the topic of artificial intelligence. ,我哋第一次擁有完美嘅設計 
"Not to build it, because I think we'll inevitably do that, but to understand how to avoid an arms race and to build it in a way that is aligned with our interests. ",就好似我哋摞住 一個按照預期發展嘅神諭 
"When you're talking about superintelligent AI that can make changes to itself, it seems that we only have one chance to get the initial conditions right, and even then we will need to absorb the economic and political consequences of getting them right. ",呢個機器仲會變成完美嘅慳力設備 
"But the moment we admit that information processing is the source of intelligence, that some appropriate computational system is what the basis of intelligence is, and we admit that we will improve these systems continuously, and we admit that the horizon of cognition very likely far exceeds what we currently know, then we have to admit that we are in the process of building some sort of god. ",事關機器可以生產另一款機器出嚟 做任何體力勞動 兼由太陽能驅動 成本仲同買原材料差唔多 
Now would be a good time to make sure it's a god we can live with. ,所以，我哋唔單止講緊咕哩勞力嘅終結 
Thank you very much. ,我哋同時講緊大部份用腦工作嘅終結 
(Applause) ,咁我哋人類面對工作削減 應該何去何從？ 
,我哋會好自由咁去掟飛盤 、同人按摩 
"The language I'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world's universal language, for better or for worse. ",服食一啲 LSD 精神藥 同埋著上怪異服飾 於是成個世界都會變成火人節嘅人咁 
"Let's face it, it's the language of the internet, it's the language of finance, it's the language of air traffic control, of popular music, diplomacy -- English is everywhere. ",（笑聲） 頭先講到嘅嘢聽起上嚟好似好好咁 但係撫心自問 面對目前嘅經濟政治秩序 乜嘢會發生呢？ 
"Now, Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more people, but more Chinese people are learning English than English speakers are learning Chinese. ",似乎我哋會目睹 我哋從未見過咁嚴重嘅 貧富懸殊同失業率 
"Last I heard, there are two dozen universities in China right now teaching all in English. ",如果呢筆新財富唔即時用嚟服務全人類 就算一啲億萬富翁使好多錢 㨘靚商業雜誌嘅封面 世界上其他人都要挨餓 
English is taking over. ,咁如果俄羅斯人或者中國人 聽到矽谷嘅一啲公司 打算使用一個超級人工智能 
"And in addition to that, it's been predicted that at the end of the century almost all of the languages that exist now -- there are about 6,000 -- will no longer be spoken. ",佢哋會點諗？ 呢個機器有能力用未見過嘅力度 發動地面或者網絡戰爭 呢個係「勝者全取」嘅情況 
There will only be some hundreds left. ,喺呢場人工智能較量中有六個月嘅優勢 
"And on top of that, it's at the point where instant translation of live speech is not only possible, but it gets better every year. ",就係至少要做多人類五十萬年做到嘅嘢 
"The reason I'm reciting those things to you is because I can tell that we're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked, which is: Why should we learn foreign languages -- other than if English happens to be foreign to one? ",甚至只係關於人工智能突破嘅謠言 就可以令到人類亂起上嚟 
Why bother to learn another one when it's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate in one? ,依家最驚人嘅一件事，我覺得 就係人工智能研究人員 安定人心時講嘅說話 
"I think there are a lot of reasons, but I first want to address the one that you're probably most likely to have heard of, because actually it's more dangerous than you might think. ",佢哋成日話，因為我哋有時間 所以我哋唔需要擔心 
"And that is the idea that a language channels your thoughts, that the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages gives everybody a different kind of acid trip, so to speak. ",「乜你唔知有排咩？ 
"That is a marvelously enticing idea, but it's kind of fraught. ",仲有五十年或者一百年先到。」 
So it's not that it's untrue completely. ,一位研究人員曾經咁講︰ 「擔心人工智能嘅安全就好似 擔心火星人口爆棚一樣。」 
"So for example, in French and Spanish the word for table is, for some reason, marked as feminine. ",呢句嘢等如矽谷同你講︰ 「你十八廿二就杞人憂天！」 
"So, ""la table,"" ""la mesa,"" you just have to deal with it. ",（笑聲） 冇人意識到 攞時間嚟到講完全係無稽之談 
"It has been shown that if you are a speaker of one of those languages and you happen to be asked how you would imagine a table talking, then much more often than could possibly be an accident, a French or a Spanish speaker says that the table would talk with a high and feminine voice. ",如果智能凈係同處理訊息有關 同埋我哋繼續改良我哋嘅機器嘅話 我哋最終會生產到超級智能 
"So if you're French or Spanish, to you, a table is kind of a girl, as opposed to if you are an English speaker. ",但我哋唔知道要用幾長時間 先可以生產安全嘅超級智能 
"It's hard not to love data like that, and many people will tell you that that means that there's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages. ",等我再講多一次 
"But you have to watch out, because imagine if somebody put us under the microscope, the us being those of us who speak English natively. ",我哋唔知道要用幾長時間 先可以生產安全嘅超級智能 
What is the worldview from English? ,如果你仲未意識到 五十年嘅概念已經唔同咗喇 
"So for example, let's take an English speaker. ",呢幅圖顯示咗以月份計嘅五十年 
"Up on the screen, that is Bono. ",先係 iPhone 面世至今嘅時間 
He speaks English. ,再係阿森一族出現係電視上嘅時間 
I presume he has a worldview. ,五十年不足以畀人類應對最大挑戰 
"Now, that is Donald Trump. ",再一次，我哋對於有理由發生嘅事 未有採取適當嘅情緒反應 
"In his way, he speaks English as well. ",對此，電腦科學家 Stuart Russell 有一個好嘅比喻 
"(Laughter) And here is Ms. Kardashian, and she is an English speaker, too. ",佢話︰想像一下我哋收到 一個來自外星文明嘅信息 上面寫住： 「地球上嘅人類， 我哋五十年之後會到達你哋嘅星球。 
So here are three speakers of the English language. ,請準備好。」 
What worldview do those three people have in common? ,咁我哋依家凈係會倒數外星人來臨？ 
What worldview is shaped through the English language that unites them? ,我哋應該更加緊張至係 
It's a highly fraught concept. ,另一個我哋被告知唔使擔心嘅原因係 呢啲機器只會識得 將我哋嘅價值觀傳開 因為佢哋係我哋人類嘅附屬嘅一部分 
"And so gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought, but it tends to be in rather darling, obscure psychological flutters. ",但同時佢哋會被植入我哋嘅大腦 所以我哋會成為佢哋嘅邊緣系統 
It's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world. ,依家使啲時間諗下 最安全同唯一審慎嘅做法 而推薦嘅做法就係 直接將呢種科技植入我哋嘅大腦 
"Now, if that's the case, then why learn languages? ",呢種做法可能係最安全同唯一審慎嘅 但係喺你將佢植入你個腦之前 科技嘅安全問題需要解決 
"If it isn't going to change the way you think, what would the other reasons be? ",（笑聲） 更深一層嘅問題係 人工智能自己整超級人工智能 似乎比整一個可以喺神經科學上 同我哋腦部無縫接合嘅 超級人工智能簡單 
There are some. ,考慮到從事研發人工智能嘅公司 同政府好可能會互相競爭 考慮到要贏呢場比賽就要贏成個世界 同埋先假設如果你下一刻 唔會糟塌人工智能嘅成果 咁樣，似乎更加簡單嘅事會完成咗先 
"One of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture, if you want to drink it in, if you want to become part of it, then whether or not the language channels the culture -- and that seems doubtful -- if you want to imbibe the culture, you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in. ",但唔好彩嘅係 我除咗叫大家反思呢個問題 我就再冇辦法解決呢個問題 
There's no other way. ,我覺得我哋喺人工智能方面 需要好似「曼哈頓計劃」咁嘅計劃 
There's an interesting illustration of this. ,唔係講點樣整人工智能 因為我認為人工智能終有一日會整到 而係搞清楚點樣避免一場軍備競賽 同埋往符合我哋利益嘅方向 發展人工智能 
"I have to go slightly obscure, but really you should seek it out. ",當你講緊可以自我改造嘅超級人工智能 我哋似乎只有一個機會 令到人工智能發展得安全 就算發展得安全 我哋都要接受 人工智能對經濟同政治產生嘅結果 
"There's a movie by the Canadian film director Denys Arcand -- read out in English on the page, ""Dennis Ar-cand,"" if you want to look him up. ",但係當我哋同意 訊息處理係智能嘅起步點 同意一啲適當嘅計算系統係智能嘅基礎 同意我哋會不斷完善人工智能 同意將來有好多嘢超越我哋認知嘅 咁我哋就必須要承認 我哋正喺度創造緊某種神明 
"He did a film called ""Jesus of Montreal."" ",依家會係一個好時機 確保佢係可以同我哋共存嘅神明 
"And many of the characters are vibrant, funny, passionate, interesting French-Canadian, French-speaking women. ",好多謝你哋 
"There's one scene closest to the end, where they have to take a friend to an Anglophone hospital. ",（掌聲） 
"In the hospital, they have to speak English. ",
"Now, they speak English but it's not their native language, they'd rather not speak English. ",我宜家用嘅語言 就來成爲世界通用語言 無論係好定壞 
"And they speak it more slowly, they have accents, they're not idiomatic. ",我哋要面對呢個事實 互聯網用英文 金融交易用英文 空中交通管制用英文 流行音樂用英文 外交亦係用英文 英文無處不在 
"Suddenly these characters that you've fallen in love with become husks of themselves, they're shadows of themselves. ",宜家，愈來愈多人用普通話交流 但係同時，學英文嘅華人 多過於學中文嘅外籍人士 
To go into a culture and to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain is to never truly get the culture. ,我聽講過 喺中國有 24 間大學 用英文教學 
"And so to the extent that hundreds of languages will be left, one reason to learn them is because they are tickets to being able to participate in the culture of the people who speak them, just by virtue of the fact that it is their code. ",英文正在成爲主流 
So that's one reason. ,仲有 有人預測喺呢個世紀尾 幾乎所有現存嘅語言 大概 6000 種 唔會俾用來做語言交流 
"Second reason: it's been shown that if you speak two languages, dementia is less likely to set in, and that you are probably a better multitasker. ",通用嘅語言會剩番幾百種 
"And these are factors that set in early, and so that ought to give you some sense of when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language. ",仲有 直播演講嘅即時翻譯唔只會成爲現實 仲會越來越好 
Bilingualism is healthy. ,我背咗咁多書 係因爲我知道，我哋已經到咗 一個要問問題嘅點 問題就係，母語係英文嘅人 點解仲要學其他語言？ 
"And then, third -- languages are just an awful lot of fun. ",全世界都可以用 同一種語言交流 點解仲要再學一種語言？ 
Much more fun than we're often told. ,我相信有好多種原因 第一個原因 可能亦係大家最經常聽到嗰个 因為事實危險過想象好多 
"So for example, Arabic: ""kataba,"" he wrote, ""yaktubu,"" he writes, she writes. ",換句話講 語言影響人嘅思維方式 唔同語言有唔同嘅詞彙同文法 令到人類擁有唔同嘅思維過程 就係咁 
"Uktub, write, in the imperative. ",呢係個好有趣嘅觀點 雖然有些小誤導人 
What do those things have in common? ,呢個觀點唔係全錯 
All those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars. ,譬如喺法文同西班牙文 個「枱」字係陰性 
"They stay still, and the vowels dance around the consonants. ",「la table，la mesa」 （法，西）我哋唯有記住 
Who wouldn't want to roll that around in their mouths? ,有實驗表明 如果你嘅母語係法文或者西班牙文 如果有人叫你 想象下張枱識講嘢會點講 好多時 講法文或者西班牙文嘅人 會話張枱用女聲 
"You can get that from Hebrew, you can get that from Ethiopia's main language, Amharic. ",既係，法國或西班牙人會當張枱係女仔 如果你講英文，你會當枱係男仔 
That's fun. ,呢啲數據真係好好玩 可能會有人話 如果你識外語，你就會有一種國際視角 
Or languages have different word orders. ,不過一定要注意 如果將母語係英語嘅人 作爲樣品觀察嘅話 
"Learning how to speak with different word order is like driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country, or the feeling that you get when you put Witch Hazel around your eyes and you feel the tingle. ",英文包括嘅國際視角又係乜 
A language can do that to you. ,講幾個例子 
"So for example, ""The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,"" a book that I'm sure we all often return to, like ""Moby Dick."" ",屏幕上嘅人叫 Bono 
"One phrase in it is, ""Do you know where I found him? ",佢用慣英文 
"Do you know where he was? He was eating cake in the tub, Yes he was!"" ",我假設佢有國際視角 
"Fine. Now, if you learn that in Mandarin Chinese, then you have to master, ""You can know, I did where him find? ",而呢個人係 Donald Trump 
"He was tub inside gorging cake, No mistake gorging chewing!"" ",佢喺度用佢嘅方式 講英文 
That just feels good. ,（笑聲） 呢個係 Kardashian 女士 佢都講英文 
Imagine being able to do that for years and years at a time. ,所以我哋有三個講英文嘅樣本 
"Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian? ",佢哋嘅國際視野有咩相似 
"Me either, but if I did, I would get to roll around in my mouth not some baker's dozen of vowels like English has, but a good 30 different vowels scooching and oozing around in the Cambodian mouth like bees in a hive. ",英文又點樣影響佢哋嘅國際觀念 
That is what a language can get you. ,呢係講法好誤導人 
"And more to the point, we live in an era when it's never been easier to teach yourself another language. ",慢慢形成嘅共識係語言影響思維方式 呢個係一個好模糊嘅共識 
"It used to be that you had to go to a classroom, and there would be some diligent teacher -- some genius teacher in there -- but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then, and then was not most times. ",唔係俾你多副眼鏡睇世界咁簡單 
You had to go to class. ,所以喺呢種情況下 點解要學語言 
"If you didn't have that, you had something called a record. ",如果學習言唔會改變思維方式 又有乜其他原因呢 
I cut my teeth on those. ,原因有以下幾個 
"There was only so much data on a record, or a cassette, or even that antique object known as a CD. ",一、你想要瞭解一個新文化 要瞭解通透，就要成爲佢嘅一部分 語言對文化有冇影響 亦冇一個明確嘅答案 如果你想瞭解一個文化 你就要喺某種程度上 瞭解呢種文化形成嘅語言因素 
"Other than that you had books that didn't work, that's just the way it was. ",除此之外，冇他法 
"Today you can lay down -- lie on your living room floor, sipping bourbon, and teach yourself any language that you want to with wonderful sets such as Rosetta Stone. ",有一個好有趣嘅實例 
I highly recommend the lesser known Glossika as well. ,有啲偏門，但你真係要睇下 
"You can do it any time, therefore you can do it more and better. ",加拿大導演 Denys Arcand 嘅一部電影 英文係「Dennis Ar-cand」 如果你想上網搜索 
You can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages. ,佢有部作品叫「蒙特利爾嘅耶穌」 
"I take some ""Dilbert"" in various languages every single morning; it can increase your skills. ",其中有好多角色 都係好有趣嘅法裔加拿大人 同講法文嘅女人 
"Couldn't have done it 20 years ago when the idea of having any language you wanted in your pocket, coming from your phone, would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people. ",喺電影結尾之前有一幕 主角要帶朋友去個英文醫院 
"So I highly recommend that you teach yourself languages other than the one that I'm speaking, because there's never been a better time to do it. ",所以喺醫院入邊 一定要講英文 
It's an awful lot of fun. ,但係英文唔係佢哋嘅母語 所以佢哋好唔想講英文 
"It won't change your mind, but it will most certainly blow your mind. ",唯有好慢咁講英文 佢哋有好重嘅口音，用詞好唔通順 
Thank you very much. ,突然間， 呢啲你好中意嘅人物嘅形象大打折扣 
(Applause) ,真係進入一個文化 凈係只透過層厚紗去觀察 係冇辦法真正瞭解一個文化 
,所以喺本世紀末，得番幾百種語言個時 其中一個去學習語言嘅原因係 學語言提供咗 一個 參與到原生語言環境中嘅機會 畢竟語言係一個羣體嘅符號 
Some people are obsessed by French wines. ,呢個係第一個原因 
Others love playing golf or devouring literature. ,第二個原因 研究表明 如果可以講兩種語言嘅人 唔容易得老年癡呆 而且項目管理能力會好叻 
"One of my greatest pleasures in life is, I have to admit, a bit special. ",呢類早期嘅影響因素 令我哋可以 畀大學生一個大致嘅概念 
"I cannot tell you how much I enjoy watching cities from the sky, from an airplane window. ",就係熟悉兩種語言有益健康 
"Some cities are calmly industrious, like Dusseldorf or Louisville. ",第三個原因 語言本身係十分之有趣 
"Others project an energy that they can hardly contain, like New York or Hong Kong. ",比我哋平時瞭解到嘅更加有趣，譬如 
"And then you have Paris or Istanbul, and their patina full of history. ",阿拉伯文嘅「kataba」係「他寫」 「yaktubu」係「他寫」、「她寫」 
I see cities as living beings. ,「Uktub」係「寫，命令式」 
"And when I discover them from far above, I like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space. ",佢哋有乜相同之處 
"Especially at night, when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden: the city's vascular system performing its vital function right before your eyes. ",佢哋嘅共同點 就係作為中流砥柱嘅輔音 
"But when I'm sitting in my car after an hour and a half of commute every day, that reality looks very different. ",輔音唔會變 元音就圍住輔音跳舞 
"(Laughter) Nothing -- not public radio, no podcast -- (Laughter) Not even mindfulness meditation makes this time worth living. ",咁好玩，係人都想練習下啲發音啦 
(Laughter) Isn't it absurd that we created cars that can reach 130 miles per hour and we now drive them at the same speed as 19th-century horse carriages? ,希伯來文，同衣索比亞嘅主要語言 阿姆哈拉文，都有相似嘅例子 
"(Laughter) In the US alone, we spent 29.6 billion hours commuting in 2014. ",真係好有趣 
"With that amount of time, ancient Egyptians could have built 26 Pyramids of Giza. ",唔同語言有唔同嘅文字順序 
(Laughter) We do that in one year. ,學識唔同嘅文字順序 就好似喺唔同國家開車用左右舵咁 好似金缕梅入眼一樣 你會感受到微震 
"A monumental waste of time, energy and human potential. ",語言有相似嘅效果 
"For decades, our remedy for congestion was simple: build new roads or enlarge existing ones. ",譬如話 《戴高帽子的猫又來了》 我相信大家都經常回顧呢本書 又譬如話《白鯨記》 
And it worked. ,有句話： 「你知唔知我喺邊度搵到佢？」 
"It worked admirably for Paris, when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings to create 85 miles of transportation-friendly boulevards. ",「你知唔知佢喺邊度？」 「佢食緊蛋糕係水缸入邊啊」 「真係啊！」 
And it still works today in fast-growing emerging cities. ,如果你用普通話講 嘅順序就會係 「你能想到我在哪裏把他找到的嗎？」 
"But in more established urban centers, significant network expansions are almost impossible: habitat is just too dense, real estate, too expensive and public finances, too fragile. ",「他在水缸裏面吃蛋糕」 「沒有錯，真是在吃蛋糕！」 
"Our city's vascular system is getting clogged, it's getting sick, and we should pay attention. ",呢種感覺真係好好 
Our current way of thinking is not working. ,想像一下你年年月月都識做呢件事 
"For our transportation to flow, we need a new source of inspiration. ",又或者，你哋有冇人學過柬埔寨文 
"So after 16 years working in transportation, my ""aha moment"" happened when speaking with a biotech customer. ",我都冇學過，不過如果我學過 我就會學到好多元音 唔止英文嘅十零個咁可憐 有成 30 幾個咁多 喺你嘴裡邊 好似蜜蜂喺巢裡邊，橫衝直撞 
She was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system. ,呢個就係語言可以做乜 
"Wow, I thought, ""Our vascular system -- all the veins and arteries in our body making miracles of logistics every day."" ",更重要嘅係 我哋生喺一個 可以容易自學其他語言嘅時代 
This is the moment I realized that biology has been in the transportation business for billions of years. ,喺以前，你要去課室 課室會有勤力嘅老師 亦都有天才老師 但係，佢哋唔喺成日喺度 仲去搵佢哋時 佢哋又未必有時間畀你 
"It has been testing countless solutions to move nutrients, gases and proteins. ",你唯有去上堂 
It really is the world's most sophisticated transportation laboratory. ,你如果冇機會去上堂 你就要跟住錄音碟 
"So, what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us? ",我就係用錄音磁帶開始學嘅 
"I wanted to know: Why is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives, when our big cities get clogged on a daily basis? ",錄音碟或者叫錄音磁帶 又或者係最經典嘅 CD 入邊內容有限 
And the reality is that you're looking at two very different networks. ,有時你手頭有書，但係本書唔好 以前就係咁嘞 
"I don't know if you realize, but each of us has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in our bodies -- 60,000 miles. ",但係家下，你可以癱喺沙發度 或者癱喺客廳個個地下 飲下酒 學你想學嘅語言 宜家有非常好嘅工具 譬如 Rosetta Stone 
"That's two-and-a-half times the Earth's circumference, inside you. ",我個人推介比較小衆嘅 Glossika 
"What it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us, not just under the surface of our skin. ",幾時學都得 所以你就有機會學得更多更好 
"But if you look at our cities, yes, we have some underground subway systems and some tunnels and bridges, and also some helicopters in the sky. ",你可以朝早學語言 
"But the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground, on the surface. ",我會喺每個早晨用唔同語言 睇「呆伯特（Dilbert）」動畫 來提高我嘅語言能力 
"So in other words, while our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us, our urban transportation is mostly two-dimensional. ",喺廿年前就冇咁方便 一個人可以隨身 譬如話，個袋入邊 手機入邊有學語言嘅資料 喺以前會係天方夜譚 
And so what we need is to embrace that verticality. ,所以，我強烈建議 你學幾個新語言 因爲宜家係個好好嘅機會 
"If our surface grid is saturated, well, let's elevate our traffic. ",真係會好好玩 
This Chinese concept of a bus that can straddle traffic jams -- that was an eye-opener on new ways to think about space and movement inside our cities. ,佢未必會改變你嘅諗法 但係一定會顛覆你嘅思維 
"And we can go higher, and suspend our transportation like we did with our electrical grid. ",多謝大家 
Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi are talking about testing these futuristic networks of suspended magnetic pods. ,（掌聲） 
"And we can keep climbing, and fly. ",
The fact that a company like Airbus is now seriously working on flying urban taxis is telling us something. ,有啲人鍾意飲法國紅酒 
Flying cars are finally moving from science-fiction déjà vu to attractive business-case territory. ,而有啲人鍾意打哥爾夫球 或者埋頭睇書 
And that's an exciting moment. ,我平時最大嘅樂趣之一 我必須承認有少少特別 
So building this 3-D transportation network is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams. ,我冇辦法描述我有幾鍾意 從飛機窗睇城巿 
But it's not the only one. ,有啲城市默默咁努力 比如話杜塞爾多夫 又或者路易斯維爾 
"We have to question other fundamental choices that we made, like the vehicles we use. ",有啲城市 投射出佢哋幾乎冇辦法承受嘅活力 比如話紐約 或者香港 
Just imagine a very familiar scene: You've been driving for 42 minutes. ,然後仲有巴黎 或者伊斯坦布爾 同埋佢哋充滿歷史印記嘅一面 
The two kids behind you are getting restless. ,我將城市睇成生物 
And you're late. ,當我從高空探索佢哋 我鍾意搵建構空間嘅大馬路同高速公路 
Do you see that slow car in front of you? ,尤其喺晚黑 當果啲上落班嘅人 令呢啲大馬路望起身非常璀璨 城市嘅血管系統執行緊重要嘅任務 就喺你眼前 
"Always comes when you're late, right? ",但係當我坐喺我部車入面 日日駕駛一個半鐘頭上落班之後 現實就好唔一樣啦 
(Laughter) That driver is looking for parking. ,（笑聲） 乜都無辦法 公共電台唔得 播客唔得 （笑聲） 甚至連冥想都冇辦法 令呢一段時間變得有意義 
"There is no parking spot available in the area, but how would he know? ",（笑聲） 唔覺得好可笑咩？ 我哋製造出時速可以達到 130 英里嘅車 然後以 19 世紀馬車嘅速度嚟開？ 
It is estimated that up to 30 percent of urban traffic is generated by drivers looking for parking. ,（笑聲） 凈係喺美國 2014 年，我哋就用咗296億個鐘上落班 
Do you see the 100 cars around you? ,同樣嘅時間 古埃及人可以起 26 個吉薩金字塔 
Eighty-five of them only have one passenger. ,（笑聲） 我哋喺一年時間就用咗咁多個鐘 
Those 85 drivers could all fit in one Londonian red bus. ,浪費大量嘅時間、能量同埋人類潜力 
So the question is: Why are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most? ,幾十年嚟 我哋應對塞車嘅措施都好簡單： 起一條新路或者擴闊現有嘅路 
Why are we doing this to ourselves? ,呢個措施好有效 
Biology would never do this. ,喺巴黎相當之有效 巴黎拆咗幾百座歷史建築 嚟起 85 英里 方便運輸嘅林蔭大道 
Space inside our arteries is fully utilized. ,呢個做法對宜家高速發展嘅新興城市 
"At every heartbeat, a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells into massive trains of oxygen that quickly flow throughout our body. ",依然好有效 但係喺更多發展完善嘅市中心裡面 大量嘅網絡擴張幾乎係唔可能嘅 住房建築太密集 房地產太貴 同埋公共財政太脆弱 
"And the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted, either. ",我哋城市嘅血管系統塞住咗、病咗 而我哋應該多多關注 
"In healthy conditions, more than 95 percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized. ",我哋目前嘅思考方式係唔掂嘅 
"Can you imagine if the vehicles we used in our cities were 95 percent full, all the additional space you would have to walk, to bike and to enjoy our cities? ",為咗令我哋嘅交通順暢 我哋需要新嘅靈感源頭 
"The reason blood is so incredibly efficient is that our red blood cells are not dedicated to specific organs or tissues; otherwise, we would probably have traffic jams in our veins. ",喺運輸業做咗16年之後 當我同一個做生物科技嘅客人 傾偈嘅時候 
"No, they're shared. ",靈感出現咗 佢同我講佢嘅療程 點利用血管系統裡面嘅某啲特性 
They're shared by all the cells of our body. ,我心諗︰哇，我哋嘅血管系統 即係體內所有嘅血管同動脈 每一日都創造緊物流嘅奇跡 
"And because our network is so extensive, each one of our 37 trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen precisely when it needs them. ",就係呢一刻，我意識到 生物學已經存在喺運輸業入面幾十億年 
Blood is both a collective and individual form of transportation. ,血管系統試過無數解決方法 嚟運送營養、氣體同埋蛋白質 
"But for our cities, we've been stuck. ",真係世界上最精密嘅運輸實驗室 
We've been stuck in an endless debate between creating a car-centric society or extensive mass-transit systems. ,如果解決交通需求嘅方法 就喺我哋體內呢？ 
I think we should transcend this. ,我想知 點解血液好平常咁喺血管流動 但係我哋嘅城市就日日塞車？ 
I think we can create vehicles that combine the convenience of cars and the efficiencies of trains and buses. ,事實上你係睇緊兩個非常唔同嘅網絡 
Just imagine. ,唔知你有冇意識到 我哋每個人體內都有六萬英里長嘅血管 有六萬英里 
"You're comfortably sitting in a fast and smooth urban train, along with 1,200 passengers. ",喺你嘅體內 係地球圓周嘅 2.5 倍 
"The problem with urban trains is that sometimes you have to stop five, ten, fifteen times before your final destination. ",亦即係話我哋體內周圍都係血管 唔只係喺我哋皮膚表層嘅下面 
What if in this train you didn't have to stop? ,但係當你望向我哋嘅城市 冇錯，我哋係有地鐵系統 有隧道同橋樑 仲有天上嘅直升機 
"In this train, wagons can detach dynamically while you're moving and become express, driverless buses that move on a secondary road network. ",但係大部分嘅交通都集中喺地面 喺表層 
"And so without a single stop, nor a lengthy transfer, you are now sitting in a bus that is headed toward your suburb. ",即係話 我哋體內嘅血管系統係立體 而市區運輸系統基本上係平面 
"And when you get close, the section you're sitting in detaches and self-drives you right to your doorstep. ",所以我哋應該將天空納入運輸系統 
It is collective and individual at the same time. ,如果我哋嘅平面飽和咗 咁就將交通升高 
"This could be one of the shared, modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow. ",呢個概念嚟自中國 巴士可以跨立係堵塞嘅車輛上面 呢個概念令我哋大開眼界 對於城巿入面嘅空間同移動 有新嘅思考方式 
Now ... ,我哋可以行高啲 將運輸系統懸掛 就好似我哋嘅供電網咁 
"as if walking in a city buzzing with drones, flying taxis, modular buses and suspended magnetic pods was not exotic enough, I think there is another force in action that will make urban traffic mesmerizing. ",特拉維夫同阿布扎比宜家討論緊 測試呢種磁懸浮車艙嘅未來網絡 
"If you think about it, the current generation of driverless cars is just trying to earn its way into a traffic grid made by and for humans. ",我哋可以繼續攀爬，飛天 
"They're trying to learn traffic rules, which is relatively simple, and coping with human unpredictability, which is more challenging. ",事實上好似空中巴士呢種公司 宜家認真咁研究市區空中的士 講明咗一啲事 
But what would happen when whole cities become driverless? ,飛天汽車終於從科幻 轉移到吸引嘅商業範疇 
Would we need traffic lights? ,呢一刻好令人興奮 
Would we need lanes? ,所以起呢個 3D 運輸網絡 係緩和並且解決塞車嘅方法之一 
How about speed limits? ,但唔係唯一嘅方法 
Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes. ,我哋必須質疑 我哋其他嘅根本性選擇 比如話交通工具 
They never stop at red lights. ,想象一下一個好熟悉嘅場景： 你已經開咗 42 分鐘車 
"In the first driverless cities, you would have no red lights and no lanes. ",你後面嘅兩個細路仔開始煩躁 
"And when all the cars are driverless and connected, everything is predictable and reaction time, minimum. ",而你已經遲到 
They can drive much faster and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up or the cars around them. ,見唔見到前面果部開得好慢嘅車？ 
"So instead of rigid traffic rules, flow will be regulated by a mesh of dynamic and constantly self-improving algorithms. ",呢種事成日發生係你遲到嘅時候 
The result: a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of German autobahns and the creative vitality of the intersections of Mumbai. ,啱唔啱？ （笑聲） 果個司機搵緊停車位 
(Laughter) Traffic will be functionally exuberant. ,果度附近冇空位 但係佢點知呢？ 
It will be liquid like our blood. ,估計大約 30% 嘅市區塞車問題 係因為司機搵緊停車位 
"And by a strange paradox, the more robotized our traffic grid will be, the more organic and alive its movement will feel. ",見唔見到你身邊嘅 100 部車？ 
"So yes, biology has all the attributes of a transportation genius today. ",其中 85 部車入面只有一個乘客 
"But this process has taken billions of years, and went through all sorts of iterations and mutations. ",呢 85 位司機可以坐滿一部倫敦紅巴士 
We can't wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system. ,然後問題係 如果空間係我哋急需嘅嘢 點解仲要浪費？ 
"We now have the dreams, the concepts and the technology to create 3-D transportation networks, invent new vehicles and change the flow in our cities. ",點解我哋要咁對待自己？ 
Let's do it. ,生物學永遠唔會咁做 
Thank you. ,我哋充分利用咗血管裡面嘅空間 
(Applause) ,每一下心跳 高血壓就壓迫幾百萬個紅血球 進入龐大嘅氧氣火車裡面 好快咁係我哋人體內流通 
,而紅血球裡面嘅小空間亦冇浪費 
Hi. ,喺健康嘅情况下 最少會用到 95% 嘅氧氣容量 
Thank you. ,你能唔能夠想象 如果城市裡面用嘅交通工具 使用率有 95% 將會有幾多額外空間攞嚟行路 踩單車、同埋享受城市嘅魅力？ 
[Jennifer Brea is sound-sensitive. ,血液之所以咁高效率 係因為我哋嘅紅血球並唔係只用喺 特定嘅器官同組織 如果唔係，我哋嘅血管可能會塞車 
"The live audience was asked to applaud ASL-style, in silence.] So, five years ago, this was me. ",紅血球係共享嘅 
"I was a PhD student at Harvard, and I loved to travel. ",係我哋體內所有細胞共享嘅 
I had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life. ,因為我哋嘅網絡咁龐大 37 兆個細胞，每一個都運送氧氣 啱啱好係需要嘅時候 
"I was 28, and like so many of us when we are in good health, I felt like I was invincible. ",血液係一種既集體又獨立嘅傳輸方式 
Then one day I had a fever of 104.7 degrees. ,但係對我哋嘅城市嚟講 我哋塞住咗 
"I probably should have gone to the doctor, but I'd never really been sick in my life, and I knew that usually, if you have a virus, you stay home and you make some chicken soup, and in a few days, everything will be fine. ",我哋塞喺無止境嘅辯論裡面 辯論建立以車為中心嘅社會 定建立係龐大嘅公共交通系統 
But this time it wasn't fine. ,我覺得我哋應該更進一步 
"After the fever broke, for three weeks I was so dizzy, I couldn't leave my house. ",我覺得我哋可以發明一啲交通工具 結合車嘅方便 同埋火車同巴士嘅高效率 
I would walk straight into door frames. ,想象一下 
I had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom. ,"你同 1,200 名乘客一齊 好舒服咁坐喺一部 又快又流暢嘅巿區火車裡面 "
"That spring I got infection after infection, and every time I went to the doctor, he said there was absolutely nothing wrong. ",城市火車嘅問題係 喺到達最終目的地之前 有時要停靠 5 次、10 次、15 次 
"He had his laboratory tests, which always came back normal. ",如果呢部火車係不需要停靠呢？ 
"All I had were my symptoms, which I could describe, but no one else can see. ",當你喺路上嘅時候 呢部火車嘅車廂可以動態分離 變成快車、無人駕駛嘅巴士 喺細啲嘅馬路上行駛 
"I know it sounds silly, but you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself, and so I thought maybe I was just aging. ",所以完全唔使停靠 亦唔會有漫長嘅轉車 你宜家坐喺一部開往郊區嘅巴士上 
Maybe this is what it's like to be on the other side of 25. ,就嚟到嘅時候 你坐嘅果部分會脫離 自動將你送到目的地 
(Laughter) Then the neurological symptoms started. ,既集體又獨立 
Sometimes I would find that I couldn't draw the right side of a circle. ,呢個係共享、組合式 無人駕駛嘅未來交通工具之一 
Other times I wouldn't be able to speak or move at all. ,宜家…… 
"I saw every kind of specialist: infectious disease doctors, dermatologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists. ",就好似喺城市行走，有無人機 空中的士、組合式巴士同埋磁懸浮車艙 都仲未夠神奇 我覺得仲有另外一種力量喺度努力緊 令巿區交通變得更有魅力 
I even saw a psychiatrist. ,你諗下 宜家嘅無人駕駛車輛諗緊辦法 進入由人製造、為人服務嘅 交通網絡裡面 
"My psychiatrist said, ""It's clear you're really sick, but not with anything psychiatric. ",佢哋嘗試學習交通規則 呢個仲算簡單 更有挑戰性嘅係 佢哋仲要應對人類嘅不可預測性 
"I hope they can find out what's wrong with you."" ",但係當成個城市變成 無人駕駛嘅時候會點？ 
"The next day, my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder. ",我哋仲需唔需要紅綠燈？ 
"He told me that everything -- the fevers, the sore throats, the sinus infection, all of the gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiac symptoms -- were being caused by some distant emotional trauma that I could not remember. ",仲需唔需要車道？ 
"The symptoms were real, he said, but they had no biological cause. ",速度限制呢？ 
I was training to be a social scientist. ,紅血球唔係喺車道上面流通嘅 
"I had studied statistics, probability theory, mathematical modeling, experimental design. ",佢哋從來都唔會因為紅燈而停 
I felt like I couldn't just reject my neurologist's diagnosis. ,係第一批無人駕駛嘅城市裡面 唔會有紅燈同埋車道 
"It didn't feel true, but I knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive, so easily obscured by what we want to believe. ",當所有車都係無人駕駛而且連埋一齊 一切都可以預測，反應時間都係最短 
So I had to consider the possibility that he was right. ,無人駕駛車可以開得更加快 可以採取任何合理嘅行為嚟加快速度 或者加快旁邊其他車嘅速度 
"That day, I ran a small experiment. ",車流會係可以透過使用動態 不斷自我改善嘅規則系統控制 代替死板嘅交通規則 
"I walked back the two miles from my neurologist's office to my house, my legs wrapped in this strange, almost electric kind of pain. ",結果就係，奇怪嘅交通系統 融合咗德國高速公路嘅快同穩 同埋孟買十字路口嘅創意活力 
"I meditated on that pain, contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this. ",（笑聲） 交通功能將會非常豐富 
"As soon as I walked through the door, I collapsed. ",會好似血液咁流動 
My brain and my spinal cord were burning. ,根據一個奇怪嘅悖論 交通網絡越係自動化 佢嘅流動就越統一而且充滿活力 
"My neck was so stiff I couldn't touch my chin to my chest, and the slightest sound -- the rustling of the sheets, my husband walking barefoot in the next room -- could cause excruciating pain. ",所以，冇錯 生物學有嗮所有 當代交通天才應該有嘅特性 
I would spend most of the next two years in bed. ,但呢個過程已經喺幾十億年前開始 而且經歷咗好多次嘅反覆同變異 
How could my doctor have gotten it so wrong? ,我哋唔可以等幾十億年 逐漸發展運輸系統 
"I thought I had a rare disease, something doctors had never seen. ",宜家我哋有夢想 有概念 有技術 嚟起一個 3D 運輸網絡 發明新嘅交通工具 同改變我哋城市嘅流動 
"And then I went online and found thousands of people all over the world living with the same symptoms, similarly isolated, similarly disbelieved. ",一起行動啦 
"Some could still work, but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed, just so they could show up the next Monday. ",多謝 
"On the other end of the spectrum, some were so sick they had to live in complete darkness, unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one. ",（鼓掌） 
I was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis. ,
"You've probably heard it called ""chronic fatigue syndrome."" ",大家好 
"For decades, that's a name that's meant that this has been the dominant image of a disease that can be as serious as this. ",多謝 
"The key symptom we all share is that whenever we exert ourselves -- physically, mentally -- we pay and we pay hard. ",[ Jennifer Brea 對聲音敏感 
"If my husband goes for a run, he might be sore for a couple of days. ",現場觀眾用美式手語歡迎 ] 呢個係五年前嘅我 
"If I try to walk half a block, I might be bedridden for a week. ",當時我係哈佛嘅博士生 鍾意旅行 
It is a perfect custom prison. ,啱啱同我生命中最愛嘅人訂婚 
"I know ballet dancers who can't dance, accountants who can't add, medical students who never became doctors. ",嗰陣我28歲，同大部份人一樣 覺得自己好健康、百毒不侵 
It doesn't matter what you once were; you can't do it anymore. ,有一日，我發燒燒到華氏 104.7 度 
"It's been four years, and I've still never been as well as I was the minute before I walked home from my neurologist's office. ",其實我應該要去睇醫生 不過，我一生中未患過病 而且我知，一般如果你受病毒感染 你留喺屋企，煲啲雞湯 幾日之內就會好返 
It's estimated that about 15 to 30 million people around the world have this disease. ,但係，呢次無好返 
"In the US, where I'm from, it's about one million people. ",發燒之後 三個星期都頭暈，無辦法出門口 
That makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis. ,我行路會撞落門框度 
Patients can live for decades with the physical function of someone with congestive heart failure. ,我要扶住墻先可以行去浴室 
"Twenty-five percent of us are homebound or bedridden, and 75 to 85 percent of us can't even work part-time. ",嗰年春天，我病完又病 每一次我去睇醫生 佢都話絕對無問題 
Yet doctors do not treat us and science does not study us. ,佢手上嘅化驗報告 都話我好正常 
How could a disease this common and this devastating have been forgotten by medicine? ,我所有嘅癥狀 我都可以形容 但無人睇到 
"When my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder, he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women's bodies that are over 2,500 years old. ",我知聽起嚟好傻 但係你點都會搵個原因畀自己 我以為可能係老化 
The Roman physician Galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly passionate women. ,或者呢個就係年過 25 嘅情況 
"The Greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up and wander around the body in search of moisture, pressing on internal organs -- yes -- causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis. ",（笑聲） 跟住，神經癥狀開始出現 
The cure was marriage and motherhood. ,有時，我發現我畫唔到圓形嘅右邊 
"These ideas went largely unchanged for several millennia until the 1880s, when neurologists tried to modernize the theory of hysteria. ",有時我會講唔到嘢，甚至郁唔到 
Sigmund Freud developed a theory that the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms when dealing with memories or emotions too painful for the conscious mind to handle. ,我睇過所有專科 傳染病科、皮膚科、內分泌科、心臟科 
It converted these emotions into physical symptoms. ,我甚至睇埋精神科 
"This meant that men could now get hysteria, but of course women were still the most susceptible. ",精神科醫生話︰「你好明顯病咗， 但同精神科無關。 
"When I began investigating the history of my own disease, I was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run. ",我希望其他醫生搵到係咩事。」 
"In 1934, 198 doctors, nurses and staff at the Los Angeles County General Hospital became seriously ill. ",第二日，神經科醫生診斷出 我患咗轉化症 
"They had muscle weakness, stiffness in the neck and back, fevers -- all of the same symptoms I had when I first got diagnosed. ",佢話所有癥狀—— 發燒、喉嚨痛、鼻竇炎 所有腸胃、神經同心臟癥狀—— 都因為某啲我唔記得嘅情緒創傷引起 
Doctors thought it was a new form of polio. ,佢話啲病癥都係真嘅 但都冇生理原因解釋 
"Since then, there have been more than 70 outbreaks documented around the world, of a strikingly similar post-infectious disease. ",我曾經受訓做社會科學家 
"All of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women, and in time, when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease, they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria. ",我讀過統計學、概率論 數學模型、實驗設計 
Why has this idea had such staying power? ,雖然我唔可以否定神經科醫生嘅診斷 
"I do think it has to do with sexism, but I also think that fundamentally, doctors want to help. ",但我又覺得醫生嘅診斷唔係真嘅 但知識話畀我聽事實多數違反直覺 事實好容易被自己想相信嘅嘢矇蔽 
"They want to know the answer, and this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable, to explain illnesses that have no explanation. ",所以我諗可能佢係啱嘅 
The problem is that this can cause real harm. ,嗰日，我做咗個小實驗 
"In the 1950s, a psychiatrist named Eliot Slater studied a cohort of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hysteria. ",我喺診所行咗兩英里返屋企 我對腳有種好奇怪、好似觸電嘅痛 
"Nine years later, 12 of them were dead and 30 had become disabled. ",沿途，我仔細咁諗 我嘅心理點樣令呢一切發生 
"Many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, brain tumors. ",當我行入門口 我跌低咗 
"In 1980, hysteria was officially renamed ""conversion disorder."" ",個腦同脊髓好似火燒咁 
"When my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in 2012, he was echoing Freud's words verbatim, and even today, women are 2 to 10 times more likely to receive that diagnosis. ",條頸僵硬到下巴掂唔到胸口 同埋，無論幾細嘅聲都好—— 就算床單摩擦 老公赤腳喺隔離房行嘅聲音—— 都會令我有難以忍受嘅痛楚 
The problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness is that it can never be proven. ,跟住兩年嘅大部分時間 我都喺床上度過 
"It is by definition the absence of evidence, and in the case of ME, psychological explanations have held back biological research. ",點解我嘅醫生會錯得咁離譜？ 
"All around the world, ME is one of the least funded diseases. ",我覺得我患咗一種罕見嘅病 連醫生都未見過嘅病 
"In the US, we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient, 250 dollars per MS patient and just 5 dollars per year per ME patient. ",之後我上網 搵到嚟自世界各地成千上萬嘅人 原來都有同樣嘅癥狀 同樣需要隔離 同樣覺得難以置信 
This was not just lightning. ,有啲人仲可以工作 但夜晚同周未都一定要留喺床上 只係為咗下星期一可以返工 
I was not just unlucky. ,至於其他人 有啲病得好嚴重 要喺完全黑暗嘅環境下生活 無辦法忍受人聲 或者伴侶嘅觸摸 
"The ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice, a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us. ",我被診斷患上肌痛性腦脊髓炎 
"We don't know why ME sometimes runs in families, why you can get it after almost any infection, from enteroviruses to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever, or why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men. ",即係你可能聽過嘅「慢性疲勞症候群」 
This issue is much bigger than just my disease. ,幾十年嚟 呢個名就代表住 一種可以嚴重成咁嘅疾病 
"When I first got sick, old friends were reaching out to me. ",一樣我哋都有共同病徵就係 當我哋耗盡全力，無論體力上定精神上 就要付出代價，好大代價 
I soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s whose bodies were falling apart. ,就好似如果我老公去跑步 佢可能會喉嚨痛幾日 
What was striking was just how much trouble we were having being taken seriously. ,或者如果我行過半個街口 大概就要瞓喺床度一個星期一樣 
"I learned of one woman with scleroderma, an autoimmune connective tissue disease, who was told for years that it was all in her head. ",呢個可以話係完美嘅軟禁 
"Between the time of onset and diagnosis, her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged, she will never be able to eat again. ",我識得跳唔到舞嘅芭蕾舞家 計唔到數嘅會計師 永遠都做唔成醫生嘅醫科生 
"Another woman with ovarian cancer, who for years was told that it was just early menopause. ",你曾經係咩唔重要 因為你都無辦法繼續做 
"A friend from college, whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed for years as anxiety. ",過咗四年 我仲未恢復到當日 由診所行返屋企前咁健康 
"Here's why this worries me: since the 1950s, rates of many autoimmune diseases have doubled to tripled. ","據估計，全球大概有 1,500 到 3,000 萬人患咗呢種病 "
Forty-five percent of patients who are eventually diagnosed with a recognized autoimmune disease are initially told they're hypochondriacs. ,喺我嘅國家，美國 就有一百萬人患咗呢種病 
"Like the hysteria of old, this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe. ",大約係患上多發性硬化嘅兩倍 
"Seventy-five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women, and in some diseases, it's as high as 90 percent. ",病人可以生存到幾十年 但佢哋嘅活動能力就好似 患咗充血性心力衰竭咁 
"Even though these diseases disproportionately affect women, they are not women's diseases. ",有 25% 嘅病人要留喺屋企或者喺床上 75% 至 85% 甚至唔可以做兼職 
ME affects children and ME affects millions of men. ,事實上，醫生唔會醫我哋 科學家唔會研究我哋 
"And as one patient told me, we get it coming and going -- if you're a woman, you're told you're exaggerating your symptoms, but if you're a guy, you're told to be strong, to buck up. ",點解呢種咁普遍同埋慘嘅病 會被醫學界遺忘？ 
And men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed. ,"當我嘅醫生診斷出我患咗轉化症 佢指向緊 一啲有 2,500 年歷史 有關女性身體嘅諗法 "
My brain is not what it used to be. ,古羅馬醫生蓋倫認為 歇斯底里症嘅成因係性渴求 尤其係熱情嘅女性 
"Here's the good part: despite everything, I still have hope. ",蓋倫認為子宮會變乾 並且喺身體遊走搵水份 擠壓內臟—— 無錯—— 引致極端情緒 甚至頭暈同癱瘓 
So many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms. ,當時嘅療法係結婚同生仔 
Patients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized until the EEG was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain. ,呢種諗法維持到 1880 年代 當時嘅神經病學家 嘗試更新歇斯底里症嘅理論 
Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis until the CAT scan and the MRI discovered brain lesions. ,佛洛伊德發展咗一個理論 佢話︰當明意識處理唔到 一啲太痛苦嘅記憶或者情緒 潛意識就會產生生理徵狀 
"And recently, we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress, until we discovered that H. pylori was the culprit. ",將情緒轉化為生理徵狀 
"ME has never benefited from the kind of science that other diseases have had, but that's starting to change. ",即係，依架男性都會患歇斯底里症 但當然女性比較容易受影響 
"In Germany, scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity, and in Japan, of brain inflammation. ",當我開始睇返我呢個病嘅歷史 我好驚訝呢啲舊諗法仍然深入民心 
"In the US, scientists at Stanford are finding abnormalities in energy metabolism that are 16 standard deviations away from normal. ",1934 年喺洛杉磯縣綜合醫院 198 個醫生、護士同醫院員工 病得好嚴重 
"And in Norway, researchers are running a phase-3 clinical trial on a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission. ",佢哋肌肉衰弱，頸同背脊僵硬，又發燒 同我當初病一樣 
What also gives me hope is the resilience of patients. ,醫生以為係變種嘅小兒麻痹症 
"Online we came together, and we shared our stories. ",自從嗰次之後 全球錄得超過 70 次 好相似嘅後感染性疾病個案 
We devoured what research there was. ,所有爆發傾向影響女性 當時醫生搵唔到病因 於是認為係大規模嘅歇斯底里症爆發 
We experimented on ourselves. ,點解呢個諗法可以保持咁耐？ 
We became our own scientists and our own doctors because we had to be. ,我真係覺得同性別歧視有關 但係我諗醫生係想幫手 
"And slowly I added five percent here, five percent there, until eventually, on a good day, I was able to leave my home. ",佢哋想知答案 但呢個講法至少可以畀醫生醫人 畀醫生去解釋一啲解釋唔到嘅疾病 
"I still had to make ridiculous choices: Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes, or will I wash my hair today? ",問題係，咁樣會帶嚟真正嘅傷害 
But it gave me hope that I could be treated. ,1950 年代 一個叫 Eliot Slater 嘅精神科醫生 研究咗 85 個 被診斷出患上歇斯底里症嘅病人 
I had a sick body; that was all. ,9 年之後，12 個死咗，30 個殘障 
"And with the right kind of help, maybe one day I could get better. ",好多人有診斷唔到嘅病 好似多發性硬化、癲癇、腦腫瘤 
"I came together with patients around the world, and we started to fight. ",喺 1980 年 歇斯底里症正式改名為「轉化症」 
"We have filled the void with something wonderful, but it is not enough. ",神經科醫生喺 2012 年幫我診症嘅時候 佢完全跟隨緊佛洛伊德嘅說話 今時今日 女性被診斷呢個病嘅機會 比男性多 2-10 倍 
"I still don't know if I will ever be able to run again, or walk at any distance, or do any of those kinetic things that I now only get to do in my dreams. ",問題係歇斯底里理論或者心理病理論 係永遠無辦法證實 
But I am so grateful for how far I have come. ,個理論本身係無證據 以肌痛性腦脊髓炎為例，你會發現 心理學嘅解釋窒礙生物學嘅研究 
"Progress is slow, and it is up and it is down, but I am getting a little better each day. ",喺全球，肌痛性腦脊髓炎 係其中一個研究資助最少嘅病 
"I remember what it was like when I was stuck in that bedroom, when it had been months since I had seen the sun. ","喺美國，每年喺每個愛滋病人身上 用咗大概 2,500 美金 多發性硬化症病人就 250 美金 而肌痛性腦脊髓炎病人就只用 5 美金 "
I thought that I would die there. ,呢件事唔係突然間嚟 
"But here I am today, with you, and that is a miracle. ",我唔只係唔好彩 
"I don't know what would have happened had I not been one of the lucky ones, had I gotten sick before the internet, had I not found my community. ",無視我呢個病係一個決定 係由應該要保護我哋嘅機構 做嘅一個決定 
"I probably would have already taken my own life, as so many others have done. ",我哋唔知點解有時肌痛性腦脊髓炎 喺家族入面發生 唔知點解你幾乎每次感染 腸道病毒、人類疱疹病毒第四型 以至到 Q 型流感嘅時候 肌痛性腦脊髓炎就會病發 又或者點解佢影響女性 比男性多兩至三倍 
"How many lives could we have saved, decades ago, if we had asked the right questions? ",呢啲嘢比我嘅病重要得多 
How many lives could we save today if we decide to make a real start? ,當初我病嘅時候 舊朋友都有樂意幫我 
"Even once the true cause of my disease is discovered, if we don't change our institutions and our culture, we will do this again to another disease. ",之後我發覺自己 同一班就嚟 30 歲嘅女士一樣 身體面臨崩潰 
Living with this illness has taught me that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors. ,最得人驚嘅係到底我哋面對緊嘅麻煩 有幾多係被認真咁對待 
"Doctors, scientists and policy makers are not immune to the same biases that affect all of us. ",我知道有個女士 患咗一種自身免疫結締組織病 好多年都係話問題喺佢個頭度 
We need to think in more nuanced ways about women's health. ,由發病到診斷 佢條食道完完全全被破壞 佢無辦法再食嘢 
Our immune systems are just as much a battleground for equality as the rest of our bodies. ,另一個患咗卵巢癌嘅女士 好多年都係話佢只係提早咗更年期 
"We need to listen to patients' stories, and we need to be willing to say, ""I don't know."" ",我有一個大學朋友 佢腦腫瘤曾經被誤診為焦慮症 
I don't know is a beautiful thing. ,呢個就係令我擔心嘅原因︰ 自從 1950 年代開始 患自身免疫病嘅比例增加三倍 
I don't know is where discovery starts. ,45% 最後確診患咗 一種已知嘅自身免疫病嘅人 初時被診斷患咗軟骨炎 
"And if we can do that, if we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know, and then, rather than fear uncertainty, maybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder. ",就好似以前嘅歇斯底里症咁 所有診斷都同性別拉上關係 
Thank you. ,75% 嘅自身免疫病嘅病人都係女性 某啲疾病甚至 90% 都係女性 
Thank you. ,就算女性係容易患上呢啲病 呢啲都唔係女性專有嘅病 
,肌痛性脊髓炎出現喺小朋友 亦出現喺過百萬男性身上 
I write about food. I write about cooking. ,正如某個病人同我講 我哋畀呢個病侵擾我哋…… 如果你係女性，人哋就話你誇大癥狀 但如果你係男性 人哋就叫你堅強、振作 
"I take it quite seriously, but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two. ",男性甚至更難診斷 
"It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se. ",雖然我嘅頭腦唔似以前咁 
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow. ,但無論點 我仲抱有希望 
"I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right? ",有好多病一開始都被認為係精神方面嘅 直至科學發現佢哋嘅生物機制 
But I still think that this -- (Laughter) -- may be this year's version of this. ,喺腦電圖測到大腦異常活動之前 癲癇病人可能被強制送入精神病院 
"Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic. ",喺斷層掃描同磁力共振發現腦病變之前 多發性硬化有可能誤診為 歇斯底里性麻痺 
And why do I say it? ,以前，我哋認為胃潰瘍 只係因為壓力而形成 到依架我哋發現 幽門螺旋菌先係罪魁禍首 
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined. ,肌痛性腦脊髓炎從未好似其他病咁 得到科學嘅幫助 但係呢個情況已經開始改變 
"There was the bomb, and there's now. ",喺德國，科學家開始 搵自身免疫病嘅證據 日本搵緊腦炎症嘅證據 
"And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives, but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now, we'd recognize it. ",喺美國，史丹福科學家喺度搵緊 能量代謝達16 個標準差嘅異常情況 
"It's a holocaust of a different kind, and hiding under our desks isn't going to help. ",喺挪威，研究人員 為一種喺某啲病人身上 可以完全緩解癌症嘅藥 進行緊第三階段嘅臨床實驗 
"Start with the notion that global warming is not only real, but dangerous. ",仲畀到希望我嘅就係病人嘅韌力 
"Since every scientist in the world now believes this, and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to, we can take this is a given. ",我哋透過網絡走埋一齊 分享自己嘅故事 
"Then hear this, please. ",我哋讀晒現有嘅研究 
"After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases. ",我哋用自己嚟做實驗 
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production -- more than transportation. ,我哋要成為自己嘅科學家同醫生 我哋一定要咁做 
"Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts, but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2, and it's not just methane. ",我慢慢咁喺呢度加 5%，嗰度加 5% 直到有一日，我可以行出屋企 
"Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation, air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity. ",我仍然要做一啲荒謬嘅訣擇︰ 我今日坐係花園 15 分鐘，定係洗頭好？ 
There's more. ,但係我仍然相信我可以好返 
"Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people, but to animals. ",我除咗有一個病咗嘅身體，咩都好好 
"But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this: if you're a progressive, if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green, or you're looking for organic, you should probably be a semi-vegetarian. ",得到正確嘅幫助，或者有一日我會好返 
"Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom, but it's all in the way we use these things. ",我同世界各地嘅病人一齊對抗呢個病 
"There's another piece of the puzzle, which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday, and one you already know. ",我哋將美好嘅事物填滿空虛 但咁係唔夠 
"There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world. ",我仍然唔知我仲可唔可以跑、行路 依架呢啲嘢只可以喺夢度做 
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet. ,但係嚟到呢度我都好感恩 
"Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day -- our demand for these things, not our need, our want, drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. ",進展係慢 有時好 有時壞 但係每一日都好一啲 
"And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease. ",我記得匿埋係睡房好幾個月 不見天日嘅感覺 
Now global warming was unforeseen. ,我以為我會死喺嗰度 
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility. ,但係我今日喺呢度，同你哋一齊 呢個就係奇蹟 
"Maybe a few lung diseases here and there, but, you know, that's not such a big deal. ",如果我唔係幸運嘅一群 如果我喺互聯網出現之前病 如果我搵唔到同病相憐嘅人 
"The current health crisis, however, is a little more the work of the evil empire. ",我唔知我會點 大概我會好似好多其他人咁已經自殺 
"We were told, we were assured, that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate, the healthier we'd be. ",如果我哋幾十年前問啱問題 可以救返幾多人？ 
"No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food, is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants. ",如果今日我哋真真正正開始 又可以救返幾多人？ 
"Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear -- it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants. ",如果我哋唔改變我哋嘅體制同文化 就算搵到我個病嘅真正原因 我哋都會喺其他病重蹈覆轍 
"It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot. ",呢個病教識咗我 科學同醫學都深受人類追求嘅 
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health. ,醫生、科學家同政策制訂者 都同普通人一樣受偏見影響 
This evidence is overwhelming at this point. ,我哋要喺微細之處諗諗女性嘅健康 
"You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer. ",我哋嘅免疫系統同身體其他部分一樣 需要顧及 
Not bad. ,我哋要聽病人嘅故事 亦要肯講「我唔知」 
But back to animals and junk food. ,「我唔知」係一件美好嘅事 
What do they have in common? ,「我唔知」先會有探索 
One: we don't need either of them for health. ,如果我哋做到「我唔知」 如果我哋可以接觸眾多嘅未知 而唔係怕當中嘅不確定性 我哋或者可以讚歎地欣賞其中 
"We don't need animal products, and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. ",多謝 
"Two: both have been marketed heavily, creating unnatural demand. ",多謝 
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles. ,
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet. ,我寫有關食物同煮嘢嘅文章 
"Now, let's imagine a parallel. ",我對呢件事好認真 但我響度想講一啲 呢兩年嚟對我嚟講好重要嘅嘢 
"Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy, while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy, knowing all the while that the result would be pollution, war and rising costs. ",呢樣嘢係有關食物嘅，但唔係講煮食本身 
"Incredible, isn't it? ",我先用一張好靚嘅母牛相做開場白 
Yet they do that. ,我唔係素食者…尼克遜成日都講呢句，係咪呀？ 
And they do this here. It's the same deal. ,但我就覺得 (觀眾笑) 呢張可能係今年嘅版本 
"The sad thing is, when it comes to diet, is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us, they fail. ",咁講只係有少少誇張啫 
"Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness, or they are puppets of agribusiness. ",點解我咁講？ 
"So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs. ",因為史上系依樣野之前只有一次，個人嘅命運 同全人類嘅命運 有咁緊密相連過 
"What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others, and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food. ",以前係原子彈，而依家就係呢一刻 
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen. ,而我哋依家行嘅路唔單止決定 個人生命嘅質素同長短 仲決定一個世紀以後 我哋望返地球嗰陣，仲會唔會認得出佢 
And guess what? ,呢次某程度係一個大屠殺 而逃避並唔係辦法 
Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness. ,我哋開始知道全球暖化 唔單止係真嘅，而且仲好危險 
"So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged. ",依家個個科學家都相信有全球暖化 就算布殊總統都話佢明白依個事實，又或者佢系扮明白 呢啲嘢可以係前提 
"So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets -- these are not solutions. ",咁大家請聽住 
"But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local, or whether we're being nice to animals, the most important issues just aren't being addressed. ",家畜係繼能源生產之後 第二大導致大氣層變化嘅氣體嘅生產者 
"Now, don't get me wrong. ",近五分一嘅溫室氣體 係由畜牧產生 占嘅比重仲大過交通工具 
"I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. ",任你想點用牛放屁嚟講笑都得 問題係甲烷比二氧化碳有毒二十倍 而且佢哋製造嘅唔止甲烷 
"But there's no way to treat animals well, when you're killing 10 billion of them a year. ",生畜仲係土地退化，空氣、食水污染 食水短缺同生物多樣性降低嘅促成者 
That's our number. 10 billion. ,仲有 
"If you strung all of them -- chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon, they'd go there and back five times, there and back. ",全國有一半嘅抗生素 唔係用響人度，係用咗響禽畜度 
"Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good, and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long, but you get the idea. ",但呢啲清單聽得多會麻木，我只係想話 如果你走在時代尖端 如果你揸緊環保車，或者支持綠色消費 又或者你搵緊有機食物嚟食 咁你都應該係半素食嘅 
That's just the United States. ,係，我反對食牛肉，好似反原子彈咁樣 但我反對嘅係我哋人類用呢啲嘢嘅方式 
"And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease, kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. ",你地都應該已經知道既 安古柏響尋日精彩嘅演講講到 呢個現象嘅其中一個構成部份 
"Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down, and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left. ",無容置疑，諗都唔駛諗，啲所謂都市病 好似糖尿病，心臟病，中風，某啲癌症 呢啲病響呢度 都比世界其他地方普遍 
"Another red herring might be exemplified by the word ""locavore,"" which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. ",呢啲病係西方飲食嘅直接結果 
Seriously. ,我哋追求肉、奶製品、精製過嘅碳水化合物 全世界一日飲咗以億樽計嘅可樂 我哋對呢啲嘢嘅需求，唔係必需嘅，只係慾望 令我哋食咗太多卡路里 
"And locavore, for those of you who don't know, is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California, but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. ",而呢啲卡路里唔會防止疾病，仲反而引起病痛 
"Between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision, you have two versions of how to improve our eating. ",無人預計到有全球暖化 
(Laughter). ,我哋唔知污染原來唔止令能見度差咗咁簡單 
"They both get it wrong, though. ",仲可能令人有一啲肺部嘅疾病 但你知道，呢啲都唔係咩大不了 
"The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist. ",重要係，依家嘅健康危機 比阻止邪惡帝國更加棘手 
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. ,人哋同我哋講，向我哋保證 家畜、奶製品、家禽食得越多 我哋就會越健康 
"And I'm going to go through that, at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now. ",錯。唔駛講，過量攝取肉類同垃圾食物 而蔬果食得少之有少係個問題 
"A hundred years ago, guess what? ",今次無時間講食蔬果有乜好處 但我想講清楚，最重要係蔬菜本身 唔係蔬菜入面嘅成份，係菜本身 
"Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby, and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion. ",唔係B-胡蘿蔔素，係紅蘿蔔本身重要 
"Every family had a cook, usually a mom. ",證據好清楚咁顯示蔬菜促進健康 
And those moms bought and prepared food. ,響呢方面嘅證據係不可置疑 
It was like your romantic vision of Europe. ,食多啲蔬果，食少啲其他嘢，你就長命啲 
Margarine didn't exist. ,聽落唔錯丫 
"In fact, when margarine was invented, several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink, so we'd all know that it was a fake. ",講返肉食同垃圾食品 
"There was no snack food, and until the '20s, until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food. ",佢地有乜共通點？ 
There were no restaurant chains. ,第一，我哋唔駛為咗健康而食呢啲嘢 
"There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people, but none of them would think to open another one. ",我哋唔需要肉類製品 當然我哋亦唔需要白麵包同可樂 
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic. ,第二，呢兩樣嘢都做好多推廣 製造唔自然嘅需求 
And fancy food was entirely French. ,我哋唔係生出嚟就淨食三文治或者彩虹糖 
"As an aside, those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide. ",第三，呢啲食物嘅生產有政府機構支持 而且代價系取代左一種更健康、更環保嘅飲食方式 
"(Laughter) Back in those days, before even Julia, back in those days, there was no philosophy of food. ",我哋一齊幻想下有對平行線 
You just ate. ,假設政府支持以石油經濟 又唔支持可持續發展嘅能源種類 而且佢知道後果會係 污染、戰爭、成本上升 
You didn't claim to be anything. ,不可思議呀呵？ 
There was no marketing. There were no national brands. ,但佢地係要咁做 
Vitamins had not been invented. ,佢哋就響度做呢啲嘢，係一樣㗎咋 
"There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones. ",可惜嘅係，講到飲食習慣 就算聯邦政府好心地咁 想為我哋撥亂反正，都衰咗 
"Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food. ",一係佢哋投票輸咗畀農業企業嘅傀儡 又或者佢哋就係農業企業嘅傀儡 
You ate food. ,所以當美國農業部最終承認 蔬果而唔係肉類令人健康之後 佢哋用過份簡化嘅食物金字塔去鼓勵我哋 每日食五份蔬果 同埋食多啲碳水化合物 
"Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient, because it was an ingredient. ",佢哋無講嘅係有啲碳水化合物係好啲 而蔬果同全穀食物 應該取代晒垃圾食物 
The cornflake hadn't been invented. ,但業界嘅說客又點會畀呢啲嘢發生 
"(Laughter) The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff. ",你估下實情係點？ 
Goldfish swam. ,諗呢個食物金字塔嘅人入面有一半 同農業企業有關係 
"(Laughter) It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food. ",所以蔬菜唔單指無取代到肉 我哋吃肉嘅胃口反而越變越大 而當中對身體最危險嘅影響仍然無變 
"And again, everyone ate local. ",嗰啲所謂低脂飲食、低澱粉質飲食 都唔係解決方法 
"In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present, because it came all the way from Florida. ",但好多聰明人 只著眼啲食物係咪有機或者本地嘅 或者係咪善待啲動物 但最重要嘅問題就無觸及到 
"From the '30s on, road systems expanded, trucks took the place of railroads, fresh food began to travel more. ",唔好誤會 
Oranges became common in New York. ,我好鍾意動物 我唔認同將佢哋嘅生產過程工業化 粗製濫造啲肉類出嚟 
"The South and West became agricultural hubs, and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland. ",但當你一年殺成百億動物嗰陣 就無辦法講點善待啲動物 
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. ,呢個係我哋呢度嘅數字，一百億 
"And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle, as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer. ",如果將啲雞呀、牛呀、豬呀、羊呀 動物排成一列去月球 條隊由呢度到月球可以來回五次 
"Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. ",我啲數學麻麻地，但系計依嘀都仲系夠用既 仲要視乎隻豬係四呎定五呎長 不過你明啦 
Thus arrived convenience. ,呢個數淨係計美國入面咋喎 
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework. ,我哋過度食用呢啲肉類 產生咁多溫室氣體，引起咁多心臟疾病 呢啲慈悲似乎只係用嚟轉移視線 
"Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 -- their mouths are watering at this point. ",我哋殺咗啲動物，食咗佢哋 然後諗下要點樣對剩低嘅動物好啲 
"(Laughter) (Applause) If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right? ",另一個煙幕可以用「土食主義者」做例子 呢個詞啱啱畀新牛津美語大辭典稱為本年度嘅風雲詞彙 
"(Laughter) But this may have cut down on housework, but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well. ",講真㗎 
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad. ,土食主義者就係 一啲只食本土種植嘅食品嘅人 如果你住加州就無問題 但其他人嚟講就難度好高 
"I, for one -- and I'm not kidding -- didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19. ",響正統嘅食物金字塔 同時興嘅土食主義之間 大家有兩款版本點去食好啲 
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere. ,(笑) 
"What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak? ",但雙方都諗錯方向 
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally. ,第一款至少都想普及一啲，而第二款直頭係精英主義 
"Rather than spending their lives eating grass, for which their stomachs were designed, they were forced to eat soy and corn. ",我哋變成咁樣，就要由美國食物史講起 
"They have trouble digesting those grains, of course, but that wasn't a problem for producers. ",而我依家帶你哋 好快咁睇下過去一百年係點 
New drugs kept them healthy. ,一百年前係點樣？ 
"Well, they kept them alive. ",個個都係食本地生產嘅食物 運啲食物去第二度簡直妙想天開 
Healthy was another story. ,每個屋企都有廚師，多數係由阿媽做埋 
"Thanks to farm subsidies, the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress, soy, corn and cattle became king. ",佢地買材料同煮嘢食 
And chicken soon joined them on the throne. ,就好似你哋幻想中浪漫嘅歐洲咁樣 
"It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began, the thing we're only realizing just now. ",人造牛油未出現 
"Listen to this, between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled. ",其實人造牛油面世時 有幾個州份都通過話要佢哋染成粉紅色 等啲人知呢啲唔係真牛油 
Meat consumption increased five-fold. ,嗰陣都未有零食，到二十年代 發明家貝爾塞發明急凍技術，至有急凍食品 
"Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food. ",嗰陣無連鎖餐廳 
And this took care of the situation resoundingly. ,得一嗰由本地人開畀鄰居嘅食肆 無人諗住要開多間分店 
"Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes. ",傳統飲食係聞所未聞，除非你本身係小數民族啦 
"There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups, because all of them could be bought at any store. ",啲花巧食物全部都係嚟自法國 
"Not that they were any good, but they were there. ",講開又講，如果你記得七十年代 丹‧艾克洛德扮茱莉亞‧查爾德嘅話 睇到呢張圖你就知點解佢有咁嘅諗頭 
"Most moms cooked like mine: a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing, canned soup, canned fruit salad. ",(笑) 響茱莉亞出名之前 嗰陣都無乜人提倡飲食文化 
"Maybe baked or mashed potatoes, or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice. ",食嘢就係食嘢 
"For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies. ",唔駛提倡啲乜嘢主義 
"My mom is not here, so I can say this now. ",嗰陣無市場推廣，無全國性品牌 
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself. ,維他命丸都未有 
(Laughter) It wasn't all bad. ,亦都無健康宣稱，連聯邦法例批准嘅都無 
"By the '70s, forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. ",脂肪、澱粉質、蛋白質，都無分好壞，佢哋只係食物 
"We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food, we knew or we were vegetarians. ",你就只係食食物 
"We weren't all hippies, either. ",好多時啲嘢食好少多過一個材料 因為佢哋本身就係材料 
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. ,嗰陣未發明粟米片 
"Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial. ",(笑) 甜夾心餅、薯片、芝士醬，呢啲嘢都未有 
"Perhaps because it was being produced rationally, as if it were plastic, food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both. ",當時金魚係游水（註：不是金魚餅） 
Many people became fat-phobic. ,(笑) 好難想像。嗰陣自己種嘢食，然後食種出嚟嘅嘢食 
"Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like. ",講多一次，佢哋食本地出產嘅食物 
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli. ,響紐約，聖誕節送橙好普遍 因為橙要由佛羅里達州運嚟 
"Instead they were sold on yogurt, yogurt being almost as good as broccoli. ",三十年代起，道路系統擴展 貨車取代鐵路 新鮮食物開始越運越遠 
"Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream. ",橙響紐約變得唾手可得 
"Similarly, let's look at a granola bar. ",南部同西部成為農業重鎮 其他地方嘅農地變成近郊 
"You think that that might be healthy food, but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list, it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. ",帶嚟嘅影響深遠，到處可見 
"Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma, if not actually killed -- the beginning of the heyday of value-added food, which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it. ",家庭式農場嘅消失是其中一環 就好似從真正社區沒落 到夏天都難搵一個靚蕃茄咁 都係影響嘅一部份 
Think of the frozen chicken nugget. ,最後加州出產太多食物，運都運唔晒 所以推廣罐頭和急凍食品在所必行 
"The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up, and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder, and then it's fried in corn oil. ",於是用方便嚟做賣點 
All you do is nuke it. What could be better? ,呢啲食物以原女性主義嘅主婦作對象 等佢哋做少啲家務 
"And zapped horribly, pathetically. ",我知道過咗大約四十五歲嘅觀眾 見到實流晒口水 
"By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets -- and we all have our favorites, actually -- made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home. ",(笑) (掌聲) 如果有幅漢堡扒嘅圖片，你哋流多啲口水添，係咪？ 
"At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce, and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden. ",(笑) 雖然咁樣會做少咗家務 但亦會減少左我哋食嘅食物嘅種類 
"So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights, you've got your grazing nights, you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on. ",我地好多人成長嗰陣除咗有時食下生紅蘿蔔 或者生菜沙律之外，好少會食新鮮蔬果 
Leading the way -- what's leading the way? ,以我為例，唔係講笑 到十九歲至食到真嘅菠菜同西蘭花 
"Meat, junk food, cheese: the very stuff that will kill you. ",邊個需要食呢啲嘢呢？周圍都有肉食 
"So, now we clamor for organic food. ",有啲乜野比煎塊扒畀屋企人食更加 容易，飽肚、或健康？ 
That's good. ,嗰陣啲牛已經唔係用天然方法飼養 
"And as evidence that things can actually change, you can now find organic food in supermarkets, and even in fast-food outlets. ",牛嘅胃系設計嚟食草既 但啲人硬系要迫佢食大豆同粟米 都唔由得佢食草 
"But organic food isn't the answer either, at least not the way it's currently defined. ",啲牛當然消化唔到啲穀物 但呢啲唔係生產者嘅間題 
Let me pose you a question. ,新嘅葯物會維持佢哋健康 
"Can farm-raised salmon be organic, when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet, even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth? ",應該話會令佢哋繼續生存 
"And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever, dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere? ",健唔健康係另一回事 
I don't know. ,多得農業補貼 呢啲農業企業同國會嘅微妙合作方式 大豆、粟米、牛隻大行其道 
"Packed in Styrofoam, of course, before landing somewhere in the United States, and then being trucked a few hundred more miles. ",之後雞都加埋入去添 
"This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit. ",呢個時期就係 飲食同地球毀滅嘅循環開端 呢樣嘢到依家我哋至意識到 
Now here is where we all meet. ,聽清楚 一九五零年至二千年之間，全球人口增加一倍 
"The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians, the vegans, the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food. ",但系肉食攝取就增加五倍 
"Even though we've come to this from different points, we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food. ",咁實有啲人食咗多出黎既肉，所以我哋有左快餐 
We need to start acting. ,咁就徹底解釋咗呢個問題 
"And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said -- and, of course, she's completely right -- but it's also one of global survival. ",響屋企煮嘢食都仲係普遍，但質素已經每況愈下 
"Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue, the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food. ",越來越少有屋企整嘅麵包、甜品同湯 因為全部呢啲嘢都可以響舖頭買到 
"As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production. ",唔係話買返嚟質素好啲，只不過係買就有得吃 
How much livestock do you need to produce this? ,大部份媽咪好似我阿媽咁煮飯 一塊烤肉，用樽裝沙律醬撈成嘅沙律 罐頭湯，罐頭生果沙律 
"70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth, 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat. ",可能有焗薯同薯蓉 又或者食史上最唔駛用腦嘅食物：即食飯 
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so. ,甜品就係響出面買嘅雪糕或者曲奇餅 
"And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now, it's not going to be 40 years. ",我阿媽唔在場，我可以講你知 
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do. ,因為呢啲咁嘅廚藝驅使我去學煮嘢食畀自己 
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life. ,(笑) 都唔一定係壞事嚟嘅 
"The most common argument is that we need nutrients -- even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends. ",七十年代，思想先進嘅人 開始意識到本地食材嘅價值 
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. ,於是自己整個花園，對有機食品有興趣 我哋認識或者成為素食人士 
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound. ,我哋唔係做咗嬉皮士 
But don't we need meat to be big and strong? ,有啲人仲仍然去幫襯好餐廳，學下點煮好餸 
Isn't meat eating essential to health? ,同時食物嘅生產過程變得工業化，叫工業化 
"Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless, sissy, liberals? ",可能因為畀人認為可以好似 塑膠咁系生產線到啤出嚟 食物獲得神奇或者有害嘅力量，甚至兩者都有 
(Laughter) Some of us might think that would be a good thing. ,好多人對肥胖有恐懼 
"But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players, the answer is no. ",另一啲人當西蘭花係神咁拜 
"In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth, and many will make you much healthier than ours does. ",但好多時佢哋都唔食西蘭花 
"We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition, we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us. ",取而代之，西蘭花就連埋乳酪咁一齊賣 乳酪好似同西蘭花咁好 
"To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat 50 percent less meat -- it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start. ",而事實上，業界銷售乳酪嗰陣 係將孔酪變到好似雪糕咁 
"It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen, and what progressive people, forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating, along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants. ",同樣，睇下啲穀類果仁棒球場 
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years. ,以為呢啲嘢食會健康啲 但你睇返原料表 原來佢似朱古力棒多過以燕麥 
"During that time, I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything. ",好可惜，呢個時候家庭式晚餐就算唔係一命嗚呼 都已經進入昏迷狀態 嗰啲可以塞幾多就塞幾多大豆同粟米製品 嘅增值食品 開始繁盛起嚟 
"I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure, but I do think that for the benefit of everyone, the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly. ",睇下啲急凍雞塊 
Ann Cooper's right. ,啲雞係用粟米餵大，啲肉同粟米製品 攪埋一齊，等佢大舊啲同黏得埋一齊 然後放入粟米油度炸 
The USDA is not our ally here. ,你只需要放入微波爐叮，有乜好過咁？ 
"We have to take matters into our own hands, not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone -- and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own. ",然後狼吞虎嚥咁食落肚 
And that happens to be quite easy. ,到七十年代，響屋企煮嘢食呢樣嘢己經到咗慘不忍睹嘅地步 一啲好似麥樂雞同叮叮食物 咁嘅高脂多調味料嘅食品 仲有其他我哋鍾意食嘅嘢 相比之下，起自家煮嘅 淡而無味嘅嘢食，呢類食物吸引人得多 
"Less meat, less junk, more plants. ",同時，大量女性投入勞動市場 男人唔覺得煮嘢食重要到 要渠去做呢樣野 
It's a simple formula: eat food. ,於是我哋依家薄餅就當一餐，微波爐叮嘢食當一餐 放任咁想吃就吃又系一餐， 自己照顧自己都系一餐，諸如此類 
Eat real food. ,乜嘢食物獨當一面？ 
"We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well, and we can eat even better. ",肉類，垃圾食物，芝士 呢啲嘢食都會拿你命 
"We can continue the search for the ingredients we love, and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals. ",依家我哋大大聲要有機食品 
"We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint. ",係好事嚟嘅 
"We can make food more important, not less, and save ourselves by doing so. ",證明啲事情其實會改變 依家響超市 甚至響快餐店都搵到有機食物 
We have to choose that path. ,但有機食物都唔係答案 至少唔係好似依家咁界定有機 
Thank you. ,我問下你哋 
,啲三文魚食嘅係有機，但同天然飲食無關嘅飼料 又畀人養響窄窄嘅圍入面 響自己啲污糟嘢入面游水 呢啲養殖三文魚可以叫有機嗎？ 
"(Music) Roughly 43,000 years ago, a young cave bear died in the rolling hills on the northwest border of modern day Slovenia. ",又如果啲三文魚來自智利，響嗰度劏 然後運去五千哩外，釋放唔知幾多碳入大氣層 呢啲又點算有機？ 
"A thousand years later, a mammoth died in southern Germany. ",我唔知道 
"A few centuries after that, a griffon vulture also died in the same vicinity. ",當然呢啲魚運到美國前 用發泡膠包住 然後再用貨車運去幾百哩外 
"And we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths, but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space did share one remarkable fate. ",字面係有機，但精神上當然唔係有機 
"After their deaths, a bone from each of their skeletons was crafted by human hands into a flute. ",呢個就係各類人意見嘅交點 
Think about that for a second. ,土食主義者，有機主義者，素食者 純素食者，美食家 仲有一啲純粹對好嘢食有興趣嘅人 
"Imagine you're a caveman, 40,000 years ago. ",雖然我哋出發點唔同 我哋全部要用自己知識 去改變他人對食物嘅諗法 
You've mastered fire. ,我哋要開始行動 
You've built simple tools for hunting. ,而且好以安古柏咁講，呢個唔單止關乎社會公義 而且佢講得啱 呢個亦關乎全球嘅存亡 
You've learned how to craft garments from animal skins to keep yourself warm in the winter. ,呢點帶到我去核心問題度 就係過度生產食物，過度攝取肉類同垃圾食物 
What would you choose to invent next? ,我講過，百分之十八嘅溫室氣體 來自家畜 
"It seems preposterous that you would invent the flute, a tool that created useless vibrations in air molecules. ",我哋要幾多家畜至製造到咁多氣體？ 
But that is exactly what our ancestors did. ,要用全球農業用地嘅七成 而地球三成陸地直接或間接咁 用咗黎養我哋食嘅生畜 
Now this turns out to be surprisingly common in the history of innovation. ,預計四十年後仲要用多一倍地 
Sometimes people invent things because they want to stay alive or feed their children or conquer the village next door. ,如果個數目係來自中國 而中國好似依家咁 唔駛四十年添 
"But just as often, new ideas come into the world simply because they're fun. ",我想講，好似我咁成世人食唔少穀飼牛肉 
"And here's the really strange thing: many of those playful but seemingly frivolous inventions ended up sparking momentous transformations in science, in politics and society. ",其實無乜原因要好似我地咁食咁多肉 
Take what may be the most important invention of modern times: programmable computers. ,常見嘅論點係我哋需要營養 但其實我哋平均食落肚嘅蛋白質 甚至係偏幫企業嘅農業部所建議嘅兩倍 
"Now, the standard story is that computers descend from military technology, since many of the early computers were designed specifically to crack wartime codes or calculate rocket trajectories. ",留心聽住，研究減少疾病嘅專家 建議成人每個禮拜只係食半磅肉 
"But in fact, the origins of the modern computer are much more playful, even musical, than you might imagine. ",你估我哋一日食幾多肉？半磅 
"The idea behind the flute, of just pushing air through tubes to make a sound, was eventually modified to create the first organ more than 2,000 years ago. ",但我哋唔駛食肉就可以大隻啲，強壯啲咩？ 
"Someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our fingers, inventing the first musical keyboard. ",乜食肉唔係健康必需嘅咩？ 
"Now, keyboards evolved from organs to clavichords to harpsichords to the piano, until the middle of the 19th century, when a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea of using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters. ",乜食得生果蔬菜多 唔會搞到我地變得邪惡、女人型、變成自由黨人咩？ 
"In fact, the very first typewriter was originally called ""the writing harpsichord."" ",(笑) 有啲人可能覺得食肉係好事 
Flutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs. ,但就算我哋全部都係食咗類固醇嘅足球員 答案仍然係錯 
"About a thousand years ago, at the height of the Islamic Renaissance, three brothers in Baghdad designed a device that was an automated organ. ",其實，世界上無一種飲食方式 滿足到基本營養需要而唔促進健康 好多飲食方式比我哋依家嘅都更能令人健康 
"They called it ""the instrument that plays itself."" ",我哋食肉唔係為咗充足嘅營養 反而令我哋有另類嘅營養不足，係致命嘅 
"Now, the instrument was basically a giant music box. ",想為個人、人類嘅健康著想 建議美國人食少一半肉 減少呢個份量不足以起作用，但起碼係個開始 
The organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder. ,聽起上嚟好古怪，但除咗叫人食相對多返嘅蔬菜 但呢啲至係應該發生嘅 係思想先進嘅人，改革派嘅人 應該做，應該提倡嘅 
"And if you wanted the machine to play a different song, you just swapped a new cylinder in with a different code on it. ",我用雜食人士角度，或者有人話係不加批判咁 寫咗有關食物嘅文章差唔多卅年 
This instrument was the first of its kind. ,響嗰段時間，我食咗 又推薦咗差唔多所有嘢食 
"Now, conceptually, this was a massive leap forward. ",我知道我唔會唔食肉 但我認為，為咗所有人嘅福祉 係時候唔好再用工業化方式飼養動物 唔好再無諗過就食肉 
The whole idea of hardware and software becomes thinkable for the first time with this invention. ,安古柏講得啱 
"And that incredibly powerful concept didn't come to us as an instrument of war or of conquest, or necessity at all. ",農業部唔係我地盟友 
It came from the strange delight of watching a machine play music. ,我哋要落手落腳去做 唔單止為其他人支持好啲嘅飲食方式 困難嘅係要改善自己嘅飲食 
"In fact, the idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by music for about 700 years. ",要做到呢樣嘢其實好易 
"In the 1700s, music-making machines became the playthings of the Parisian elite. ",食少啲肉、少啲垃圾食物，多啲食菜 
"Showmen used the same coded cylinders to control the physical movements of what were called automata, an early kind of robot. ",好簡單嘅竅門，就係進食 
"One of the most famous of those robots was, you guessed it, an automated flute player designed by a brilliant French inventor named Jacques de Vaucanson. ",食真正嘅食物 
"And as de Vaucanson was designing his robot musician, he had another idea. ",我哋可以繼續享受食物，繼續食得好 而且可以食得更有益 
"If you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds, why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth? ",仲可以繼續尋找鍾意嘅食材 繼續係我哋喜愛嘅餐點編寫故事 
"Instead of using the pins of the cylinder to represent musical notes, they would represent threads with different colors. ",我哋唔單止要減少進食卡路里，仲要減少碳足印 
"If you wanted a new pattern for your fabric, you just programmed a new cylinder. ",我哋可以令食物更重要，而唔係令食物唔再受人重視 而且咁做可以教到我哋 
This was the first programmable loom. ,我哋要揀呢條路去行啦 
"Now, the cylinders were too expensive and time-consuming to make, but a half century later, another French inventor named Jacquard hit upon the brilliant idea of using paper-punched cards instead of metal cylinders. ",多謝 
Paper turned out to be much cheaper and more flexible as a way of programming the device. ,
"That punch card system inspired Victorian inventor Charles Babbage to create his analytical engine, the first true programmable computer ever designed. ",（音樂） 大概四萬三千年以前 一頭後生嘅穴熊喺今日斯洛文尼亞 西北邊境嘅綿延山巒上去世 
And punch cards were used by computer programmers as late as the 1970s. ,一千年之後 一頭長毛象喺德國南部去世 
So ask yourself this question: what really made the modern computer possible? ,幾個世紀之後，一隻兀鷲 喺同一片地區去世 
"Yes, the military involvement is an important part of the story, but inventing a computer also required other building blocks: music boxes, toy robot flute players, harpsichord keyboards, colorful patterns woven into fabric, and that's just a small part of the story. ",我哋唔知道呢啲動物係點樣去世嘅 但呢啲存在於唔同時空嘅生物 卻最終殊途同歸 
"There's a long list of world-changing ideas and technologies that came out of play: public museums, rubber, probability theory, the insurance business and many more. ",佢哋去世之後，骨骸中嘅一塊骨頭 都經由人類嘅巧手變成咗一支長笛 
Necessity isn't always the mother of invention. ,等我哋嚟諗返頭先嘅嘢 
"The playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory, seeking out new possibilities in the world around us. ",想像你係一個四萬年前嘅穴居人 
And that seeking is why so many experiences that started with simple delight and amusement eventually led us to profound breakthroughs. ,你識得點樣用火 
"Now, I think this has implications for how we teach kids in school and how we encourage innovation in our workspaces, but thinking about play and delight this way also helps us detect what's coming next. ",又已經整咗一啲用嚟打獵嘅簡單工具 
"Think about it: if you were sitting there in 1750 trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th, the 20th centuries, automated machines, computers, artificial intelligence, a programmable flute entertaining the Parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time. ",你已經學識點樣摞獸皮嚟整衫 嚟抵禦凜冬嘅寒冷 
"It seemed like an amusement at best, not useful in any serious way, but it turned out to be the beginning of a tech revolution that would change the world. ",咁下一步你會去發明咩呢？ 
You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun. ,發明長笛似乎好荒謬 因為呢個工具只能發聲 
,但實際上呢個就係我哋祖先做嘅事 
What is a parent? ,喺發明嘅歷史長河中 無用嘅發明竟然係比比皆是 
What is a parent? ,儘管有時候人發明事物 係為咗生存，或者養育下一代 或者征服隔籬嘅村莊 
It's not an easy question. ,但係往往，新諗法嘅誕生 其實只係因為佢哋畀到人樂趣 
"Today we have adoption, stepfamilies, surrogate mothers. ",實在令人覺得奇怪嘅係： 好多好玩但似乎微不足道嘅發明 最終都會喺科學、政治同社會上 帶嚟極為重要嘅轉變 
Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions. ,就以可能係依家最為重要嘅發明—— 可編程電腦為例 
Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation? ,依家一般講法係，電腦起源於軍事技術 因為好多早期嘅電腦專門設計 嚟破解戰時密碼或者計算火箭彈道 
"If so, when? ",但事實上，現代電腦嘅起源 比你想像中仲要有趣得多 甚至同音樂有關 
What words to use? ,長笛背後 利用空氣通過管道嚟發聲嘅諗法 最終喺兩千幾年前演變為第一部風琴 
"Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father?"" ",有人諗到用手指敲擊細槓杆 嚟發聲嘅絕世好竅 從而發明咗第一個琴鍵 
"As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. ",從風琴、古鋼琴、大鍵琴，到鋼琴 琴鍵都一直演變緊 直到十九世紀中期 一班發明家突發奇想 摞鍵盤嚟寫信，而唔係摞鍵盤演奏 
"But today, I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children. ",事實上，最初期嘅打字機 原來係被稱為「識寫字嘅大鍵琴」 
"I will show you that they know what matters most in a family, even though their family looks a little different. ",但原來，長笛同音樂 曾經引致更加勁嘅突破 
I will show you their creative ways of dealing with tough questions. ,大概一千年之前 喺「伊斯蘭復興運動」嘅鼎盛時期 嚟自巴格達嘅三兄弟 設計咗一部自動風琴 
But I will also show you the parents' uncertainties. ,命名為「自動演奏風琴」 
"We interviewed couples who received fertility treatment at Ghent University Hospital, using sperm from a donor. ",依家睇嚟，呢個樂器其實就係 一個巨型嘅八音盒 
"In this treatment timeline, you can see two points at which we conducted interviews. ",通過將凸點加注喺一個轉動嘅音筒上 風琴就可以演奏曲目 
"We included heterosexual couples, where the man for some reason did not have good-quality sperm, and lesbian couples who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere. ",如果你想機器演奏一首唔同嘅曲目 只需要換上一個有唔同凸點排列嘅音筒 
We also included children. ,呢個樂器係同類中嘅首創，可以編寫 
I wanted to know how those children define concepts like parenthood and family. ,依家，從概念上嚟講，呢個係一大進步 
"In fact, that is what I asked them, only not in that way. ",因為呢個發明嘅面世 將硬件同軟件嘅概念形象化 
I drew an apple tree instead. ,而呢個不可思議嘅犀利諗法 唔係嚟自一個用於戰爭嘅工具 亦都唔係嚟自需求 
"This way, I could ask abstract, philosophical questions in a way that did not make them run off. ",佢嚟自於望住一個機器 演奏音樂時嘅神奇愉悅感 
"So as you can see, the apple tree is empty. ",事實上，可編程機器嘅諗法 一直只出現喺音樂世界裏面大概七百年 
And that illustrates my research approach. ,喺十六世紀，音樂演奏機器 成為巴黎上流社會嘅玩物 
"By designing techniques like this, I can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview, because I want to hear that from them. ",表演者用同樣嘅編碼音筒 嚟控制一種叫做自動玩偶嘅 早期機器人嘅動作 
I asked them: What would your family look like if it were an apple tree? ,其中一個最出名嘅機器人 就係由一位才華橫溢嘅法國發明家 Jacques de Vaucanson 設計嘅 自動長笛演奏玩偶 
"And they could take a paper apple for everyone who, in their view, was a member of the family, write a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted. ",當 de Vaucanson 設計緊佢嘅 機器人音樂家嗰時 佢有另一個諗法 
And I would ask questions. ,佢諗，既然可以編程 一個發出優美樂聲嘅機器 咁點解唔摞佢織出色彩斑斕嘅布匹？ 
Most children started with a parent or a sibling. ,佢哋與其用凸點音筒播歌 佢哋用唔同顏色嘅線頭織成布匹 
"One started with ""Boxer,"" the dead dog of his grandparents. ",如果你想要一匹有新圖案嘅布 咁編程一個新嘅轉筒就得啦 
"At this point, none of the children started mentioning the donor. ",呢個就係第一個可編程織布機 
"So, I asked them about their birth story. ",但係整轉筒實在係太貴又浪費時間 於是半個世紀之後 另一位叫做 Jacquard 嘅 法國發明家靈光一閃 諗到摞打窿卡嚟代替金屬轉筒 
"I said, ""Before you were born, it was just your mom and dad, or mom and mommy. ",原來用紙編程一個裝置會更加靈活同平 
"Can you tell me how you came into the family?"" ",之後嗰個窿片穿孔系統啟發 維多利亞時代發明家 Charles Babbage 砌出一台分析引擎 於是，有史以嚟第一部 真正能夠編程嘅電腦就咁誕生咗 
And they explained. ,穿窿卡片去到二十世紀七十年代 都仲俾電腦程序員用緊 
"One said, ""My parents did not have good seeds, but there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds. ",試問： 到底係咩真正令到現代電腦成為現實？ 
"They bring them to the hospital, and they put them in a big jar. ",冇錯，軍事需要確實係好重要嘅原因 但係發明一部電腦都離唔開其他因素： 八音盒、玩具長笛演奏機器人 大鍵琴鍵盤，同埋印上布匹嘅斑斕圖案 軍事需要只係成個故仔中一小部份 
"My mommy went there, and she took two from the jar, one for me and one for my sister. ",有好多改變世界嘅諗法同科技 都係嚟自「玩」 譬如公共博物館、橡膠 概率論、保險行業等等 
"She put the seeds in her belly -- somehow -- and her belly grew really big, and there I was."" ",發明唔係總係因求而生 
Hmm. ,就係因為鍾意玩，我哋先至會探索 先至會發掘周圍嘅可能 
"So only when they started mentioning the donor, I asked questions about him, using their own words. ",而嗰種探索態度 正正令原本好多只為樂趣、玩樂嘅事物 變成重大突破嘅嘢 
"I said, ""If this would be an apple for the friendly man with the seeds, what would you do with it?"" ",依家，我覺得玩樂同我哋點樣 喺學校教育細路仔 同埋點樣喺工作場所鼓勵創新 都有關係 但咁樣睇，玩樂同樂趣 都可以幫我哋預知未來 
"And one boy was thinking out loud, holding the apple. ",試諗下：喺 1750 年，你坐喺度 想像緊 20、21 世紀社會 翻天覆地嘅改變 譬如自動化機器、電腦、人工智能 而一個取悅巴黎上流社會嘅可編程長笛 喺當時已經成為將來發展嘅最強線索 
"And he said, ""I won't put this one up there with the others. ",雖然佢睇起身最多係一種消遣 冇乜嚴肅實際嘅用處 但係最終卻會牽起 一個會改變世界嘅科技革命 
He's not part of my family. ,最後，你可以喺啲人最多樂趣嘅地方 預見未來 
But I will not put him on the ground. ,
That's too cold and too hard. ,乜嘢係父母？ 
"I think he should be in the trunk, because he made my family possible. ",阿爸，阿媽又係乜嘢？ 
"If he would not have done this, that would really be sad because my family would not be here, and I would not be here."" ",呢個問題唔簡單 
"So also, parents constructed family tales -- tales to tell their children. ",今日，我哋有領養 再婚家庭 同代孕媽媽 
One couple explained their insemination by taking their children to a farm to watch a vet inseminate cows. ,好多父母都面臨著難題 同艱難嘅選擇 
And why not? ,講唔講畀個细路知 精子捐贈呢件事？ 
It's their way of explaining; their do-it-yourself with family narratives. ,如果講， 幾時講？ 
DIY. ,點講？ 
And we had another couple who made books -- a book for each child. ,精子捐贈人通常被稱為「親身阿爸」 但係我哋應唔應該用「阿爸」呢個詞？ 
They were really works of art containing their thoughts and feelings throughout the treatment. ,身為一個哲學家同社會科學家 我研究父母身份呢個問題 
They even had the hospital parking tickets in there. ,今日，我想同大家講下 我同啲父母同細路 傾偈學到嘅嘢 
"So it is DIY: finding ways, words and images to tell your family story to your child. ",佢哋知道個屋企裡邊咩最緊要 就算佢哋同一般家庭有啲唔同 
"And these stories were highly diverse, but they all had one thing in common: it was a tale of longing for a child and a quest for that child. ",我會講下佢哋點有創意咁處理難題 
It was about how special and how deeply loved their child was. ,亦會講下呢啲父母嘅不安 
And research so far shows that these children are doing fine. ,我哋採訪過幾對 喺根特大學附屬醫院 接受不孕治療 通過精子捐贈而受孕嘅夫婦 
They do not have more problems than other kids. ,我哋喺呢個治療嘅 時間線上嘅兩個點 （治療同之後 7-10 年）做採訪 
"Yet, these parents also wanted to justify their decisions through the tales they tell. ",我哋包括咗因男方不育嚟尋治嘅 異性戀夫婦 同需要精子捐贈嘅女同性戀夫婦 
They hoped that their children would understand their reasons for making the family in this way. ,我哋亦包括佐啲細路 
Underlying was a fear that their children might disapprove and would reject the non-genetic parent. ,我之前想知 啲細路點定義父母同家庭 
"And that fear is understandable, because we live in a very heteronormative and geneticized society -- a world that still believes that true families consist of one mom, one dad and their genetically related children. ",事實上，我有問佢哋呢個問題 不過用咗唔同嘅問法 
Well. ,我畫咗一棵蘋果樹 
I want to tell you about a teenage boy. ,然後以一種唔容易離題嘅方式 問佢哋一啲抽象嘅、哲學性嘅問題 
He was donor-conceived but not part of our study. ,大家喺度睇到 呢棵蘋果樹係空嘅 
"One day, he had an argument with his father, and he yelled, ""You're telling me what to do? ",呢個就係我嘅研究方法 
"You're not even my father!"" ",咁樣 我可以盡量減少我講嘅嘢 而將重點放喺佢哋講嘅嘢 
That was exactly what the parents in our study feared. ,我問佢哋： 如果你嘅家庭係一顆蘋果樹 佢會係咩樣？ 
"Now, the boy soon felt sorry, and they made up. ",佢哋就係代表 家庭成員嘅紙蘋果寫上個名 想挂喺樹上嘅邊度就掛嗰度 
But it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting. ,然後我再問問題，多數細路 
"He said, ""This outburst had nothing to do with the lack of a genetic link. ",會從爸爸媽媽或者兄弟姊妹度講起 
It was about puberty -- being difficult. ,有個細路從 「拳師」講起 佢係個細路嘅阿爺屋企死咗嘅狗仔 
It's what they do at that age. ,嗰時，冇一個細路提及精子捐贈人 
"It will pass."" ",我問佢哋出世嘅故仔嗰時 
"What this man shows us is that when something goes wrong, we should not immediately think it is because the family is a little different. ",我話：「喺你出世之前， 個屋企就得你嘅爸爸、媽媽， 或者媽媽同媽咪。你可唔可以 
These things happen in all families. ,同我講下你係點嚟到呢個屋企呢？」 
"And every now and then, all parents may wonder: Am I a good enough parent? ",佢哋就講畀我聽 
"These parents, too. ",一個細路話 「我嘅阿爸阿媽冇好嘅種子， 但係有啲好人有剩餘嘅種子， 
"They, above all, wanted to do what's best for their child. ",佢哋將啲種子帶去醫院度， 放喺一個大罐度。 
But they also sometimes wondered: Am I a real parent? ,我媽咪佢喺醫院 從個罐度摞咗兩粒種子， 一個係我，一個係我妹妹。 
And their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents. ,佢將種植放入佢肚腩度。 唔知點， 佢嘅肚腩就變到好大， 然後我就出咗世。」 
"At the start of treatment, when they first saw the counselor, they paid close attention to the counselor, because they wanted to do it right. ",嗯 
"Even 10 years later, they still remember the advice they were given. ",佢哋有提到精子捐贈人時 我就用佢哋嘅語言 問關於捐赠人嘅問題 
"So when they thought about the counselor and the advice they were given, we discussed that. ",我話 「如果呢個蘋果係 嗰個有種植嘅好人， 你會點做？」 
"And we saw one lesbian couple who said, ""When our son asks us, 'Do I have a dad?' we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.' But we will say nothing more, not unless he asks, because he might not be ready for that. ",有個男仔攞住個紙蘋果 諗邊講 
"The counselor said so."" ",話： 「我唔會將個蘋果放喺個樹上， 
Well. ,佢唔係我屋企人， 
I don't know; that's quite different from how we respond to children's questions. ,但係我亦唔會將佢放喺個地度， 
"Like, ""Milk -- is that made in a factory?"" ",個地度太凍太硬。 
"We will say, ""No, it comes from cows,"" and we will talk about the farmer, and the way the milk ends up in the shop. ",我覺得佢應該喺個樹幹度， 因為佢使我哋有個屋企， 
"We will not say, ""No, milk is not made in a factory."" ",如果冇佢（將種子放入個罐度）， 就冇我哋屋企， 咁就好慘喇， 我就唔會喺度。」 
"So something strange happened here, and of course these children noticed that. ",所以，父母都會講啲 關於屋企嘅故仔畀啲仔女聽 
"One boy said, ""I asked my parents loads of questions, but they acted really weird. ",有對夫婦為咗解釋佢哋受精嘅過程 帶咗啲仔女去農場 睇獸醫同奶牛接種 
"So, you know, I have a friend at school, and she's made in the same way. ",有咩唔得呢？ 
"When I have a question, I just go and ask her."" ",呢個係佢哋解釋嘅方式 佢哋自製嘅家庭敘事方式 
Clever guy. ,DIY 
Problem solved. ,我哋仲採訪咗一對自己整書 一個細路一本書嘅夫婦 
"But his parents did not notice, and it certainly was not what they had in mind, nor what the counselor had in mind when they were saying how important it is to be an open-communication family. ",嗰啲書真係藝術品 寫咗夫婦喺治療過程嘅感想 
And that's the strange thing about advice. ,仲放埋當時喺醫院嘅泊車飛入去 
"When we offer people pills, we gather evidence first. ",呢就係 DIY 揾到方法、語言同畫面 將你屋企嘅故仔話畀啲仔女知 
"We do tests, we do follow-up studies. ",呢啲故仔多種多樣 但係有個共同點： 都有講對 BB 嘅渴望 同追求 
"We want to know, and rightly so, what this pill is doing and how it affects people's lives. ",係關於佢哋對仔女深深嘅愛 
And advice? ,研究顯示， 呢啲仔女發育得好正常 
"It is not enough for advice, or for professionals to give advice that is theoretically sound, or well-meant. ",並冇比其他細路多問題 
It should be advice that there is evidence for -- evidence that it actually improves patients' lives. ,但係，呢啲父母亦想通過啲家庭故仔 為自己辯護 
So the philosopher in me would now like to offer you a paradox: I advise you to stop following advice. ,佢哋希望佢哋嘅仔女明白 佢哋用呢種方式組建家庭嘅理由 
"But, yes. ",表面之下，佢哋好驚佢哋嘅仔女會 唔認同甚至抗拒冇血緣嘅父母 
(Applause) I will not end here with what went wrong; I would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families. ,呢種擔心係情有可原 事關我哋身處一個異性主流 同強調基因遺傳嘅社會 一個仲係相信一個真正嘅家庭 有一個爸爸，一個媽媽，仲有 同佢哋有血緣關係嘅仔女嘅家庭 
Remember the books and the trip to the farmer? ,噢 
"When parents do things that work for them, they do brilliant things. ",我想同大家分享一個男仔嘅故仔 
"What I want you to remember as members of families, in no matter what form or shape, is that what families need are warm relationships. ",佢係靠捐贈出世 但唔係我哋嘅研究對象 
And we do not need to be professionals to create those. ,有一日，佢同佢阿爸鬧交 佢話： 「你要叫我做嘢？ 
"Most of us do just fine, although it may be hard work, and from time to time, we can do with some advice. ",你都唔係我爸爸！」 
"In that case, bear in mind three things. ",呢就係我哋研究嘅父母最驚嘅 
Work with advice that works for your family. ,呢個男仔好快就知錯 然後同佢爸爸好返 
"Remember -- you're the expert, because you live your family life. ",最好玩嘅就係佢爸爸對呢件事嘅反應 
"And finally, believe in your abilities and your creativity, because you can do it yourself. ",佢話： 「成件事同我哋冇基因聯繫冇關係， 
Thank you. ,關個仔喺青春期多啲。 
(Applause) ,到嗰個年齡就係咁㗎啦， 
,而且會過去嘅。」 
"I am a chef and a food policy guy, but I come from a whole family of teachers. ",呢個男人使我哋明白 有啲事唔順利時 唔好即刻諗 係因為屋企有啲唔同 
My sister is a special ed teacher in Chicago. ,查實個個屋企都會有啲嘢唔同 
My father just retired after 25 years teaching fifth grade. ,而且 所有嘅父母都想知 佢哋做阿爸阿媽夠唔夠稱職 
My aunt and uncle were professors. ,我哋研究嘅父母亦會咁問 
My cousins all teach. ,畢竟，佢哋都想畀仔女最好嘅嘢 
"Everybody in my family, basically, teaches except for me. ",佢哋有時亦會諗 我係咪一個真正嘅阿爸阿媽？ 
They taught me that the only way to get the right answers is to ask the right questions. ,佢哋喺做爸爸媽媽之前就唔確定 
So what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for our children? ,個療程啱啱開始時 佢哋第一次去見諮詢師時 佢哋就聽得好專心 事關佢哋好想做得好 
"There's obviously many important questions, but I think the following is a good place to start: What do we think the connection is between a child's growing mind and their growing body? ",甚至十年後 佢哋仲記得當初收到嘅建議 
What can we expect our kids to learn if their diets are full of sugar and empty of nutrients? ,所以佢哋諗起嗰個諮詢師 同佢畀嘅建議 我哋就討論下 
What can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally going hungry? ,有一對女同性戀夫婦講： 「我哋嘅仔仔問我哋︰ 『我有冇阿爸？』 我哋會話：『唔，你冇阿爸。』 但係我哋唔會再講咩，除非佢再問， 事關佢可能未準備好接受嗰個答案。 
"And with all the resources that we are pouring into schools, we should stop and ask ourselves: Are we really setting our kids up for success? ",嗰個諮詢師都話係咁。」 
"Now, a few years ago, I was a judge on a cooking competition called ""Chopped."" ",好 
Four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes. ,呢個同我哋一般 解答細路嘅問題好唔一樣 
Except for this episode -- it was a very special one. ,譬如「牛奶係咪喺工廠裡邊造出嚟？」 
"Instead of four overzealous chefs trying to break into the limelight -- something that I would know nothing about -- (Laughter) these chefs were school chefs; you know, the women that you used to call ""lunch ladies,"" but the ones I insist we call ""school chefs."" ",我哋會話「唔係， 牛奶喺奶牛個度出嚟嘅。」 然後我哋會講下農民 同牛奶點樣去到商店 
"Now, these women -- God bless these women -- spend their day cooking for thousands of kids, breakfast and lunch, with only $2.68 per lunch, with only about a dollar of that actually going to the food. ",我哋唔會講 「唔係，牛奶唔係喺工廠度 整出嚟嘅。」 
"In this episode, the main-course mystery ingredient was quinoa. ",所以就有怪事發生 啲細路都發覺到 
"Now, I know it's been a long time since most of you have had a school lunch, and we've made a lot of progress on nutrition, but quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias. ",一個男仔講︰ 「我問我爸媽好多問題， 但係佢哋嘅反應得好奇怪。 
(Laughter) So this was a challenge. ,我喺學校有個朋友， 佢亦係捐贈受孕出世嘅。 
But the dish that I will never forget was cooked by a woman named Cheryl Barbara. ,我有嘢想問時， 就直頭去問佢。」 
Cheryl was the nutrition director at High School in the Community in Connecticut. ,叻仔！ 
She cooked this delicious pasta. ,問題就咁解決咗 
It was amazing. ,但係佢嘅父母都唔覺得係咁 佢哋同個諮詢師討論建立 一個開放式溝通嘅家庭時 應該冇諗到呢個情況 
"It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage, kale, Parmesan cheese. ",畀人哋意見就係奇怪 
"It was delicious, like, restaurant-quality good, except -- she basically just threw the quinoa, pretty much uncooked, into the dish. ",我哋同人開藥時，會先收集證據 
"It was a strange choice, and it was super crunchy. ",再做化驗 再做後續研究 
"(Laughter) So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing that you're supposed to do, and I asked her why she did that. ",我哋要知道個藥丸有咩作用 同會點影響病人嘅生活 
"Cheryl responded, ""Well, first, I don't know what quinoa is."" ",至於畀意見呢？ 
"(Laughter) ""But I do know that it's a Monday, and that in my school, at High School in the Community, I always cook pasta."" ",專家畀意見 唔應該就係理論上好好 或者有善意，就得喇 
"See, Cheryl explained that for many of her kids, there were no meals on the weekends. ",畀出嘅意見應該有 真正改善人嘅生活嘅證據 
No meals on Saturday. ,身為一個哲學家 我想畀大家一個悖論諗下： 我建議大家唔再聽從任何建議 
"No meals on Sunday, either. ",係 
So she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew her children would eat. ,（掌聲） 我唔想講完咩錯咗就停低 咁係對唔住我哋研究嘅咁溫暖嘅家庭 
"Something that would stick to their ribs, she said. ",仲記唔記得 嗰啲自製書同去農場嘅郊遊？ 
Something that would fill them up. ,父母做適合啲仔女嘅嘢時 佢哋做得好叻 
"Cheryl talked about how, by the time Monday came, her kids' hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn't even begin to think about learning. ",我想大家記住，作為家庭嘅一份子 無論個屋企係咩形式 屋企人需要互相關愛 
Food was the only thing on their mind. ,冇專業人士嘅指導 
The only thing. ,我哋都會做得好好 雖然可能會好難 時不時，仲要聽下其他人嘅意見 
"And unfortunately, the stats -- they tell the same story. ",所以 記住三件事 
"So, let's put this into the context of a child. ",聽取適合你屋企人嘅意見 
"And we're going to focus on the most important meal of the day, breakfast. ",記住，你係專家 事關呢個係你同你家人嘅生活 
Meet Allison. ,收屘 相信你自己嘅能力同創意 你自己搞得掂 
"She's 12 years old, she's smart as a whip and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up. ",多謝 
"If Allison goes to a school that serves a nutritious breakfast to all of their kids, here's what's going to follow. ",（鼓掌） 
"Her chances of getting a nutritious meal, one with fruit and milk, one lower in sugar and salt, dramatically increase. ",
Allison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid. ,我係廚師 同時負責制定食品政策 我嘅屋企有好多係老師 
She'll have to visit the nurse less. ,我家姐喺芝加哥，係一個特殊教育老師 
She'll have lower levels of anxiety and depression. ,我阿爸教咗 25 年五年級，啱啱退休 
She'll have better behavior. ,我叔叔同阿姨係大學教授 
"She'll have better attendance, and she'll show up on time more often. ",我嘅堂表兄弟姊妹全部都教書 
Why? ,基本上，除咗我，我成家人都教書 
"Well, because there's a good meal waiting for her at school. ",佢哋教我知，揾到正確答案嘅唯一方法 就係問正確嘅問題 
"Overall, Allison is in much better health than the average school kid. ",喺改善小朋友嘅教育成效方面 咩先至係正確嘅問題？ 
So what about that kid who doesn't have a nutritious breakfast waiting for him? ,顯然有好多緊要嘅問題 但係我諗以下係一個好嘅出發點 我哋諗下， 小朋友心智嘅成長 同佢哋身體嘅成長 有咩關係 
"Well, meet Tommy. ",如果小朋友食嘅嘢，冇營養又多糖 我哋點期望佢哋學得好 
He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid. ,如果佢哋好肚餓 佢哋點學到嘢 
He wants to be a doctor. ,我哋畀學校 大量嘅資源嘅同時 應該停落來問下： 我哋有冇為小朋友嘅成功提供條件 
"By the time Tommy is in kindergarten, he's already underperforming in math. ",幾年前 我喺一個叫「 Chopped 」嘅 廚藝節目度做評委 
"By the time he's in third grade, he's got lower math and reading scores. ",四個廚師用即場提供嘅食材 睇邊個可以做出最好嘅菜 
"By the time he's 11, it's more likely that Tommy will have to have repeated a grade. ",但係今次特殊啲 
"Research shows that kids who do not have consistent nourishment, particularly at breakfast, have poor cognitive function overall. ",今次冇四個狂熱，爭先表演嘅大廚 我唔知你喺度講邊個 （笑聲） 今次係啲學校裡邊嘅廚師 既係簡稱 「廚娘」嘅師奶群體 但係我堅持稱佢哋為「校園廚師」 
So how widespread is this problem? ,宜家呢啲令人尊敬嘅女人 成日為幾千個小朋友煮嘢食 早餐同午餐 每餐預算得 2.68 美金 其中食材嘅成本得 1 美金左右 
"Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive. ",節目裏邊 比赛嘅食材係藜麥 
"Let me give you two stats that seem like they're on opposite ends of the issue, but are actually two sides of the same coin. ",我諗大家都好耐 冇食校園餐喇 我哋喺營養學上有咗好大進步 但係藜麥喺啲校園裏邊仲唔多見 
"On the one hand, one in six Americans are food insecure, including 16 million children -- almost 20 percent -- are food insecure. ",（笑聲） 所以呢係個挑戰 
"In this city alone, in New York City, 474,000 kids under the age of 18 face hunger every year. ",我最記得其中一位女士做嘅菜 佢叫雪利爾．芭芭拉 
It's crazy. ,雪利爾喺康康涅狄格州一個社區中學 做營養師 
"On the other hand, diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country, by far. ",佢做咗一道好好味嘅意麵 
And fully a third of the kids that we've been talking about tonight are on track to have diabetes in their lifetime. ,好好食 
"Now, what's hard to put together but is true is that, many times, these are the same children. ",係闊麵配香腸 羽衣甘藍（一種蔬菜）帕爾馬芝士 
So they fill up on the unhealthy and cheap calories that surround them in their communities and that their families can afford. ,味道係高級餐廳級別不過 佢将冇煮熟嘅藜麥 直接放喺啲面上邊 
"But then by the end of the month, food stamps run out or hours get cut at work, and they don't have the money to cover the basic cost of food. ",呢個選擇好奇怪 口感好脆 
"But we should be able to solve this problem, right? ",（笑聲） 於是乎我做個扮嘢評委 問佢點解咁做 
We know what the answers are. ,雪利爾話︰「呃，第一， 我唔知咩係藜麥。」 
"As part of my work at the White House, we instituted a program that for all schools that had 40 percent more low-income kids, we could serve breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school. ",（笑聲） 「不過我知道今日係星期一。 喺我返工嘅社區中學度， 我成日都煮意麵。」 
For free. ,雪利爾話佢學校好多细蚊仔 週末冇嘢食 
"This program has been incredibly successful, because it helped us overcome a very difficult barrier when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast. ",即係，周六冇嘢食 
And that was the barrier of stigma. ,周日亦冇嘢食 
"See, schools serve breakfast before school, and it was only available for the poor kids. ",佢星期一煮意麵 因爲啲細蚊仔肯定食 
So everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help. ,佢話意麵頂肚 
"Now, all kids, no matter how much or how little their parents make, have a lot of pride. ",食完咁飽 
So what happened? ,雪利爾話，到咗星期一 佢啲細路肚餓到 唔會去諗學嘢 
"Well, the schools that have implemented this program saw an increase in math and reading scores by 17.5 percent. ",只會諗住 
17.5 percent. ,食嘢 
"And research shows that when kids have a consistent, nutritious breakfast, their chances of graduating increase by 20 percent. ",好唔好彩，統計數據帶出同樣嘅故事 
20 percent. ,我哋就講一個細蚊仔 
"When we give our kids the nourishment they need, we give them the chance to thrive, both in the classroom and beyond. ",就講一日裡邊 最重要嘅一餐︰早餐 
"Now, you don't have to trust me on this, but you should talk to Donna Martin. ",呢個係艾莉森 
I love Donna Martin. ,佢 12 歲 好聰明 大個咗想做物理學家 
"Donna Martin is the school nutrition director at Burke County in Waynesboro, Georgia. ",如果艾莉森去一間為全部細蚊仔 提供營養早餐嘅學校 以下事情會發生 
"Burke County is one of the poorest districts in the fifth-poorest state in the country, and about 100 percent of Donna's students live at or below the poverty line. ",佢食到營養餐 即係有水果同牛奶、低糖低鹽 嘅機率大咗好多 
"A few years ago, Donna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming, and overhaul her nutrition standards. ",艾立森比一般嘅細紋仔冇咁容易肥 
She improved and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains. ,會冇咁經常去睇醫生 
She served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids. ,患焦慮症同抑鬱症嘅機率會細啲 
And she implemented a dinner program. ,佢會有良好嘅行為 
Why? ,會更經常更準時咁返學 
"Well, many of her kids didn't have dinner when they went home. ",點解？ 
So how did they respond? ,因為學校有一餐飯等住佢 
"Well, the kids loved the food. ",咁樣，艾立森會有比一般細紋仔 更好嘅健康狀況 
"They loved the better nutrition, and they loved not being hungry. ",咁個啲冇營養早餐食 嘅細紋仔會點呢 
But Donna's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place. ,呢個係湯米 
"His name from Eric Parker, and he was the head football coach for the Burke County Bears. ",亦係 12 歲，佢好乖 
"Now, Coach Parker had coached mediocre teams for years. ",佢想做醫生 
The Bears often ended in the middle of the pack -- a big disappointment in one of the most passionate football states in the Union. ,湯米仲喺幼稚園時 佢嘅數學已經唔得喇 
"But the year Donna changed the menus, the Bears not only won their division, they went on to win the state championship, beating the Peach County Trojans 28-14. ",喺三年級時 數學和閱讀都係低分 
"(Laughter) And Coach Parker, he credited that championship to Donna Martin. ",喺佢 11 歲時 湯米睇怕要留級 
"When we give our kids the basic nourishment, they're going to thrive. ",研究發現，如果細紋仔營養唔夠 特别係早餐 咁佢學嘢會好難學得好 
And it's not just up to the Cheryl Barbaras and the Donna Martins of the world. ,呢個問題有幾廣泛呢？ 
It's on all of us. ,好唔好彩，係非常之普遍 
And feeding our kids the basic nutrition is just the starting point. ,我畀你兩個 看似相互矛盾 但實際上冇矛盾嘅數據 
What I've laid out is really a model for so many of the most pressing issues that we face. ,一方面 六分之一嘅美國人冇三餐温飽 包括一千六百萬嘅兒童，即 20% 國民 冇糧食安全 
"If we focus on the simple goal of properly nourishing ourselves, we could see a world that is more stable and secure; we could dramatically improve our economic productivity; we could transform our health care and we could go a long way in ensuring that the Earth can provide for generations to come. ",喺紐約 每年有近 50 萬個 18 歲以下 嘅細路面臨飢餓 
Food is that place where our collective efforts can have the greatest impact. ,真係冇辦法想像 
So we have to ask ourselves: What is the right question? ,另一方面喺美國 可預防死亡同疾病嘅首要原因 係飲食同營養不當 
"What would happen if we fed ourselves more nutritious, more sustainably grown food? ",我哋今晚講嘅細紋仔 有 1/3 會糖尿病 
What would be the impact? ,兩件事一齊講，就係話 呢啲食得唔健康 
"Cheryl Barbara, Donna Martin, Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears -- I think they know the answer. ",食廉價同唔健康卡路里嘅細紋仔 以後最容易得病 
Thank you guys so very much. ,到咗月尾 食物券用曬或者父母嘅工時被減 佢哋冇錢買基本嘅食物 
(Applause) ,但係我哋應该點解決呢啲問題？ 
,我哋知道答案 
"[This talk contains graphic language and descriptions of sexual violence] [Viewer discretion is advised] ""Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut. ",我喺白宮時，開展咗個項目 任何有超過 40% 嘅細紋仔 係來自低收入家庭嘅學校 全部細紋仔都食到 
You can't sue someone for calling them a cunt. ,免費嘅早餐和午餐 
"If you can't handle the Internet, fuck off, whore. ",呢個項目成功到超乎想像 佢克服咗一個 提供營養早餐時嘅大阻礙 
"I wish Ashley Judd would die a horrible death. 
She is the absolute worst. ",嗰個阻礙就係耻辱同自尊嘅問題 
"Ashley Judd, you're the reason women shouldn't vote. ",以前學校只對 窮細紋仔提供早餐 
"'Twisted' is such a bad movie, I don't even want to rape it. ",你睇到邊個食免費早餐，就知道邊個窮 
"Whatever you do, don't tell Ashley Judd. She'll die alone with a dried out vagina. ",宜家，全部嘅細紋仔，有冇錢都好 都可以保持自尊 
"If I had to fuck an older woman, oh my God, I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd, that bitch is hot af. 
The unforgivable shit I would do to her. ",然後發生咩？ 
"Online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy, and it is imperative that it ends. ",啲學校實行咗呢個計劃之後 學生嘅數學同閱讀成績 提高 17.5% 
"(Applause) Girls' and women's voices, and our allies' voices are constrained in ways that are personally, economically, professionally and politically damaging. ",17.50%
"And when we curb abuse, we will expand freedom. ",研究顯示，如果細紋仔持續有營養早餐 佢哋畢業率會提升 20% 
"I am a Kentucky basketball fan, so on a fine March day last year, I was doing one of the things I do best: I was cheering for my Wildcats. ",20%
"The daffodils were blooming, but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to. ",細紋仔吸收到必需嘅營養 就等於 有好好成長嘅機會 
"(Laughter) Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip, but they really ignore me during the game. ",你哋唔使信我 問下唐娜．馬丁就得喇 
"(Laughter) Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ... ",唐娜．馬丁好勁嘅 
[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a -- @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.] It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you. ,唐娜．馬丁係伯克縣 佐治亞州韋恩斯伯勒 嘅學區營養總監 
It happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. ,伯克縣係其中一個最窮嘅地方 而佐治亞州係全国第五窮州 唐娜嘅學生幾乎都 喺貧困線以下 
"Since I joined Twitter in 2011, misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step. ",幾年前 唐娜決定提早修訂 同推廣新嘅營養標準 
"My spirituality, my faith, being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't -- all of it is fair game. ",仲加咗水果、蔬菜，同全麥食品 
And I have responded to this with various strategies. ,佢為全部細紋仔提供早餐 
I've tried engaging people. ,仲有晚餐 
"This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff, and there was a girl in his avatar. ",點解？ 
I wrote him back and said ... ,好多細紋仔喺屋企冇晚餐食 
"Is that your daughter? 
I feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way. ",呢個項目有乜效果 
"And he surprised me by saying, ""You know what? You're right. I apologize."" ",啲細紋仔好鍾意食嘢 
Sometimes people want to be held accountable. ,佢哋鍾意更好嘅營養 佢地好鍾意唔使挨餓 
This one guy was musing to I don't know who that maybe I was the definition of a cunt. ,出乎大家嘅意料，唐娜最大嘅支持者 
"I was married to a Scot for 14 years, so I said, ""Cunt means many different things in different countries -- (Laughter) but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."" ",叫埃里克．帕克 佢就係伯克縣小熊隊嘅足球教練 
"(Laughter) (Applause) I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches, but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it, but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle. ",以前，小熊隊麻麻地 
What is seen goes in. ,成日都中挻位置 對一個對美式足球狂熱嘅州嘅人嚟講 好令人失望 
And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ... ,喺唐娜改革咗營養餐之後 小熊隊不但止赢咗小組賽 仲攞埋州冠軍 打敗咗桃子縣嘅勇士隊 28 比 14 
"Because even I, an avowed, self-declared feminist, who worships at the altar of Gloria -- (Laughter) internalize the patriarchy. ",（笑聲） 帕克教練話 呢個歸功於唐娜．馬丁 
This is really critical. ,我哋畀細紋仔基本嘅營養時 佢哋會成功 
Patriarchy is not boys and men. ,我哋唔可以淨係靠雪利爾．芭芭拉 同唐娜．馬丁佢哋 
"It is a system in which we all participate, including me. ",要靠我哋全部人 
"On that particular day, for some reason, that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a ""cyber mob."" ",畀細紋仔基本嘅營養只係個開始 
"This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech: death threats, rape threats. ",我所講嘅只係解決好多 緊急嘅問題嘅模式 
"And don't you know, when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown, I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband, and he said on a voice mail, ""Loved one ... ",如果我哋注意畀自己恰當嘅飲食 我哋會有一個更加安全、可靠嘅社會 我哋可以大大咁提高經濟生產 可以改善醫療系統 同持續發展 確保地球可以為後代提供足夠資源 
"what is happening to you is not OK."" ",喺食物領域，我哋微小嘅努力 可以有好大嘅影響 
And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ... ,所以我哋要問︰咩係正確問題 
And I started to write. ,如果我哋食更加營養、更加可持續嘅食物 會發生咩？ 
"I started to write about sharing the fact that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse, including three rapes. ",有咩影響？ 
And the hate speech I get in response to that -- these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets. ,雪利爾．芭芭拉 唐娜．馬丁 帕克教練同伯克縣小熊隊 我諗佢哋知道答案 
"Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun. ",多謝大家 
"[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!] Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus. ",（鼓掌） 
"Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine. ",
"So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled, ""Forget Your Team: It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."" ",〔警告︰本篇演講內容露骨同涉及性暴力〕 〔觀眾務必慎入〕 「Ashley Judd，正一無知蕩婦。」 
"(Laughter) (Applause) And I did that alone, and I published it alone, because my chief advisor said, ""Please don't, the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable -- I fear for you."" ",「人哋話你臭閪關你撚事咩。」 
"But I trust girls and I trust women, and I trust our allies. ",「網路就係咁㗎啦， 你睇唔過眼就死開啦，八婆！」 
"It was published, it went viral, it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all, all over the world, and when it is intersectional, it is worse. ",「我求神拜佛 Ashley Judd 不得好死。 
"Sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion -- you name it, it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women, and for our younger girls, it is worse. ",我未見過咁仆街嘅人。」 
It's clearly traumatizing. ,「Ashley Judd 就係點解 女人唔應該有投票權。」 
"Our mental health, our emotional well-being are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically as violence. ",「演《熄燈追緝令》嗰個八婆， 畀我屌我都唔屌。」 
"The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired, we lose productivity at work. ",「咪理 Ashley Judd 個粉腸啦！ 等佢成世無人屌，孤獨終老。」 
And let's talk about work. ,「如果係都要我上佢，你老味， Ashley Judd 我一定會搞到你瀨屎。 條八婆絕對係淫婦， 
"Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them, false allegations they have STDs, their addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex. ",我唔搞死佢正契弟。」 
Our ability to go to school is impaired. ,針對女性嘅網路暴力 對全球兩性平權而言係悲劇 務必制止，刻不容緩 
96 percent of all postings of sexual images of our young people ... ,（掌聲） 無論少女抑或婦女嘅聲音 甚至我哋女性同盟嘅聲音都被打壓 令無論係個人、經濟 職業定政治層面都深受其害 
Our girls. ,只有阻止欺凌 我哋先可以獲得更多自由 
Our boys are two to three times more likely -- nonconsensually -- to share images. ,我係肯塔基籃球隊嘅球迷 上年三月某一日 我做緊我平日最鍾意做嘅事 到場為我最愛嘅山貓隊加油 
And I want to say a word about revenge porn. ,諗住好好咁睇場波 但之後我見到犯規 想提裁判吹罰，裁判都冇做 
Part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet. ,（笑聲） 搞笑嘅係，佢哋喺開波之前對我好友善 但比賽過程中就完全冇理我 
"We started something called the Speech Project; curbing abuse, expanding freedom. ",（笑聲） 我哋隊三名球員俾人侵犯至流血 於是我又做咗件事︰發推特 
"And that website provides a critical forum, because there is no global, legal thing to help us figure this out. ",「@ArkRazorback 打矛波， 抵罰球啦。 @KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn 三名球員都俾佢整傷。」 毫無意外，我每日都喺推特、臉書 呢啲社交媒體 
"But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions, because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is. ",俾人用好似開場講嘅嗰啲說話 鬧到隻狗咁 
And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied. ,2011 年我開始玩推特之後 歧視女性嘅人總係 留意著我做嘅每一樣嘢 
It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us. ,包括我倡議嘅精神、我嘅信念 我甚至俾人話係鄉下婆 所有嘢都無一倖免俾人攻擊 
Our natural sexuality is -- I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful. ,於是我對用唔同方法回應 
And my expressing it does not pornography make. ,我試過同佢哋接觸 
"(Applause) So, I have all these resources that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not. ",但有個男人發超淫穢、超核突嘅相畀我 裏邊有一個女仔同佢一齊 
I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues. ,我咁樣覆返佢 
I can often get a social media company's attention. ,「圖中個女仔係你個女吖？ 
I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up. ,我真係好驚啊， 你竟然諗埋曬咁核突嘅嘢， 仲咁樣同女性講嘢！」 
Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ... ,然後佢嘅回覆令我意想不到 「你講得啱，我向你道歉。」 
"I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds, attempting to spare my brain the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech. ",有時候人嘅良知需要被提醒 
And guess what? ,呢個男人根本都唔知同緊邊個玩 佢又大概當咗我係壞嘅女人 
"Oh, you live in an echo chamber. ",我同一個蘇格蘭男人結婚 14 年 我話︰「壞女人」 喺唔同國家有唔同意思 （笑聲） 不過我肯定你絕對係賤男中嘅極品 
"Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they ""can't wait to cum on my face,"" I have a right to set that boundary. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 我曾經反抗同努力迎戰 呢啲針對女性嘅說話 但係喺上社交平台嘅大部分時間裡面 我隻眼開隻眼閉，費事理 覺得無能為力 
"(Applause) And this distinction between virtual and real is specious because guess what -- that actually happened to me once when I was a child, and so that tweet brought up that trauma, and I had to do work on that. ",但又覺得不堪入目、好傷心 
"But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech, and we disaggregate it, and we code it, and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it: when I get porn, when it's about political affiliation, when it's about age, when it's about all of it. ",所以我成日暗暗安慰自己 嗰啲攻擊我嘅、講緊我嘅評論 並非真實 
We're going to win this fight. ,即使我一個自稱女權主義者嘅人 願為女權聖戰拋頭顱撒熱血… （笑聲） 內心都接受咗男權主義 
There are a lot of solutions -- thank goodness. ,真係好攞命 
"I'm going to offer just a few, and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own. ",男權主義並非狹義為男性 
"Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy, and clearly it must have a gendered lens. ",而係我哋活喺呢個世界嘅一種制度 冇人，包括我，可以獨善其身 
"Kids, schools, caregivers, parents: it's essential. ",就喺嗰日，某種原因 我發嘅嗰條籃球推特 刺激咗全球一班「網路暴民」 
Two ... ,用最尖酸、最惡毒嘅語言威脅我 話要打要殺要奸咁 
shall we talk about our friends in tech? ,你知嗎 當我夜晚獨坐家中 我收到我前夫發嚟嘅一條語音短訊 「莉莉…… 
"Said with dignity and respect, the sexism in your workplaces must end. ",嗰啲人嘅行為實在太惡劣喇。」 
"(Applause) (Cheers) EDGE, the global standard for gender equality, is the minimum standard. ",正因佢當晚一番話，我決心要企出嚟 
"And guess what, Silicon Valley? ",我開始寫作 
"If L'Oréal in India, in the Philippines, in Brazil and in Russia can do it, you can, too. ",寫我面對各種性騷擾之後 包括三次強姦之後，我係點樣撐過嚟 
Enough excuses. ,但我因為寫作而收到惡意評論 呢啲係其中一啲惡意評論 
"Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies, including building platforms from the ground up, will the conversations about priorities and solutions change. ",而且我想講，被人叫做「 二五仔 」 真係過癮！ 
And more love for my friends in tech: profiteering off misogyny in video games must end. ,（ Jay：「佢都不知幾享受 俾人搞嘅每一秒！」） 觀眾：天呀，搞錯吖！ 
"I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties -- like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen -- about how deplorable #Gamergate was, when you're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport. ",講者：多謝你哋 我都希望上天會睇得到 
Basta! -- as the Italians would say. ,所以我寫咗篇女性專欄 題為「你對女性所作嘅網路暴力 只會引嚟女性審判你」 
"(Applause) Our friends in law enforcement have much to do, because we've seen that online violence is an extension of in-person violence. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 我孤身作戰，自己發表文章 因為我嘅顧問勸我 「唔好寫出街， 網路暴民報復於無形， 你只會令我替你擔心。」 
"In our country, more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners than died on 9/11 and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. ",不過我信任各位女性 信任同我哋志同道合嘅人 
"And it's not cool to say that, but it is true. ",文章發表之後被瘋傳 亦證明每日針對女性嘅網路暴行 已經成為全世界普遍嘅現象 牽連我哋所有人 而且一旦多過一種問題俾人插嗰陣 情況更甚 
We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ... ,性傾向、性別認同、種族、民族 以至宗教都可以俾人抨擊 以上種種嘅批評 只會加深女性經歷嘅傷害 特別係對年輕女性 
"In 2015, 72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country. ",到最後，批評只會傷害女性 
That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them. ,女性嘅身心健康亦因此被嚴重損害 出現同遇到暴力時一樣嘅生理反應 
"Law enforcement must be empowered with up-to-date internet technology, the devices and an understanding of these platforms -- how they work. ",皮質醇會激增，大腦邊緣系統會受損 生產力會因而下降 
"The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called about the death threat she was getting on Twitter, but they couldn't really when they said, ""What's Twitter?"" ",另外，喺工作方面，女性受到諸多束縛 
Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today's technology and our notions of free and hate speech. ,求職嘅女性先喺網上被洩露裸照 然後被人話係有性病 佢哋嘅住址被惡意公開，用嚟招攬嫖客 最後真係引嚟嫖客上門 
"In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed -- even if it was anonymous -- they must have been committed by telephone, in mail, by telegraph -- (Laughter) The language must be technologically neutral. ",我哋喺學校亦受到騷擾 
"So apparently, I've got a pretty bold voice. ",96% 喺網路發佈嘅色情圖像 都係影後生女 
"So, let's talk about our friends ... ",係，我哋嘅女仔 
You have a role to play and a choice to make. ,男仔比女仔高出二至三倍 喺未經同意情況下互傳圖片 
"You can do something, or you can do nothing. ",關於報復式散佈色情，我想講 
"We're cool in this room, but when this goes out, everyone will say, ""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."" ",呢一次推特貼文事件嘅來龍去脈係 我連絡志同道合 一齊爭取網路安全同自由 
"That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz, chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers, he asked me to include it in my talk. ",我哋開頭建立名為 Speech Project 嘅網站 抵制網路暴力，伸張自由 
"We need to grow support lines and help groups, so victims can help each other when their lives and finances have been derailed. ",個網站係一個非常重要嘅平台 因為到而家都未有國際合法嘅組織 應對針對女性嘅網路暴行 
We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening. ,但係我哋可以做嘅就係 喺呢個網站度列出明確嘅定義 因為如果我哋無統一界定標準 就唔可以準確打擊暴力 
92 percent of young people 29 and under witness it. ,我又發現報復式色情圖文 經常被危險使用 
72 percent of us have witnessed it. ,嗰啲未經同意情況下轉發嘅圖片 都係用嚟刻意羞辱、侮辱女性 試圖色情化女性 
We must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding. ,我唔知大家對「女性美」嘅定義係點 我認為「女性美」本身係美麗、美好嘅 
"And lastly, believe her. ",而唔應該表現為色情淫穢 
Believe her. ,（掌聲） 我深知我有嘅資源同力量 係世界上好多人都冇 
(Applause) This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction. ,譬如話，我能夠同我嘅同事 創建 Speech Project 網站 
"And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing, trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred. ",我經常能夠引起社交媒體關注 
"Edith Wharton said, ""The end is latent in the beginning,"" so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech. ",我遲啲仲會去臉書總部參觀 
"Because I get lonely in this, but I know that we are allies. ",不過仲未解決到差劣嘅報導手法… 
I recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions. ,我仲請人幫我刪除網路嘅惡意評論 令我耳根清淨 唔使受惡意評論影響 
"It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction, and gratitude in particular -- free, available globally any time, anywhere, to anyone in any dialect -- it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate, a watershed part of the brain that floods it with great, good stuff. ",但係你估唔到 有人因為咁走嚟鬧我 
So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself. ,「超，你咪活喺 一個只有你聲音嘅世界囖。」 
I would like for you to reflect it back to me. ,但正因為有人發咗張性騷擾嘅相畀我 並且喺上面寫著想顏射我 所以我有權捍衛我嘅底線 
"It might sound something like this -- (Laughter) I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, ""Yes, you are."" ",（掌聲） 虛擬同現實只係一線之差 點解咁講呢？你哋可能唔知 我細個真係被性侵犯過 所以嗰條推特鉤起咗我嘅傷痛 我唔可以再軟弱無為 
"Audience: Yes, you are. ",知唔知我哋採取咩行動？ 我哋收集所有惡意評論，然後分析 編配意思，提取數據 從而理解當中嘅關係： 幾時同性騷擾有關 幾時同政治聯繫有關 幾時同年齡有關 幾時係同所有嘢有關 
Ashley Judd: My mama loves me. ,我哋會贏呢場仗嘅！ 
"A: Yes, she does. ",好在解決問題嘅辦法有好多 
AJ: I did a great job with my talk. ,我會講其中幾種辦法 當然好歡迎你哋出謀獻策 
"A: Yes, you did. ",第一：我哋必須從數碼媒體嘅知識著手 我哋要建立一個從女性角度出發嘅視野 
AJ: I have a right to be here. ,兒童、學校、監護人、父母 都係我哋嘅對象 
"A: Yes, you do. ",第二 
AJ: I'm really cute. ,我哋不如講下科技行業嘅人？ 
"(Laughter) A: Yes, you are. ",因為關乎女性嘅尊嚴同尊重 所以職場性別歧視必須停止 
AJ: God does good work. ,（掌聲） （歡呼聲） EDGE 係全球性別平等嘅認證 亦係我哋最低要求 
"A: Yes, He does. ",如果連歐萊雅集團 喺印度、菲律賓、巴西 
AJ: And I love you. ,同俄羅斯嘅分公司都可以達到標準 矽谷同樣得 
Thank you so much for letting me be of service. ,唔好再揾藉口喇 
Bless you. ,只有女性喺每個企業部門裏面 有著重要份量 兼且建立支援女性嘅平台 性別平等問題先至可以得到重視同解決 
(Applause) ,我仲想同科技界嘅朋友講︰ 利用電玩遊戲裏邊 悔辱女性嘅元素賺錢必須停止 
,我唔想再見到 ——好似幾個星期前 喺阿斯彭某個酒會度 你哋一面譴責「 玩家門 」戲謔女性 一面繼續以殘害及摔打女性為遊戲賣點 從遊戲之中賺數以十億美元利潤 
The last time I heard my son's voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school. ,俗啲講句 夠嘞！我真喺頂你唔順 
"He called out one word in the darkness: ""Bye."" ",（歡呼聲、掌聲） 我哋嘅執法人員更需要維持法紀 因為我哋見到個人暴力 已經延伸到網路暴力 
"It was April 20, 1999. ",喺美國 被男性親密伴侶殺害嘅女性 比 9.11 當中遇害嘅女性仲要多 比起喺阿富汗加埋伊拉克中 喪生嘅美國人仲要多 
"Later that morning, at Columbine High School, my son Dylan and his friend Eric killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded more than 20 others before taking their own lives. ",呢啲嘢唔應該攞出嚟講，不過係事實 
"Thirteen innocent people were killed, leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma. ",我哋非常關心一笪地方嘅男性 點樣對待女性 
"Others sustained injuries, some resulting in disfigurement and permanent disability. ","2015 年 美國有 72,828 名女性 因為伴侶暴力問題尋求援助 "
But the enormity of the tragedy can't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place. ,我哋唔係要知道幾多人需要援助 
"There's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school, or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts. ",而係我哋希望執法者需要有 最新嘅網路科技、設備 同埋理解呢啲平台點樣運作 
"There's no way to assess the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine, especially when it can be a blueprint for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own. ",警方曾經處理一宗 女士喺推特收到死亡恐嚇嘅案件 但警方束手無策，仲問返轉頭︰ 「 推特係乜嚟？」 
"Columbine was a tidal wave, and when the crash ended, it would take years for the community and for society to comprehend its impact. ",我哋需要新嘅法例去追得上今日嘅科技 同埋保障言論自由之餘 又可以杜絕仇恨言論 
It has taken me years to try to accept my son's legacy. ,但最近紐約一名被告脫罪嘅事令人失望 原因係警方認為匿名或非匿名犯案 必須要通過電話、郵件、電報嚟犯案 （笑聲） 演講言辭必須科學中立 
The cruel behavior that defined the end of his life showed me that he was a completely different person from the one I knew. ,但好明顯，我嘅言詞真係太大膽 
"Afterwards people asked, ""How could you not know? ",咁我哋嚟講下白人男性 
"What kind of a mother were you?"" ",白人男性喺社會裏邊都有角色 亦有決定要做 
I still ask myself those same questions. ,身為白人男性嘅你可以貢獻一分力量 亦都可以置之不理 
"Before the shootings, I thought of myself as a good mom. ",喺呢個演講廳度 大家白人男性都唔出聲 但一出咗呢個門，所有人都會話 「噢，天哪， 佢係逆向歧視主義嘅人。」 
"Helping my children become caring, healthy, responsible adults was the most important role of my life. ",呢句話係一位叫 Robert Moritz 嘅 白人男士講嘅 佢係羅兵咸永道會計師事務所主席 係佢叫我喺演講入面講返呢件事出嚟 
"But the tragedy convinced me that I failed as a parent, and it's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today. ",所以我哋需要更多互助小組 以便受害者嘅生活或者財政出現問題時 大家可以互相幫助 
"Aside from his father, I was the one person who knew and loved Dylan the most. ",當性暴力發生嘅時候 我哋每個人必須奮起抵抗 
"If anyone could have known what was happening, it should have been me, right? ",92% 29 歲以下嘅年輕人 遇過網路上面嘅性暴力 
But I didn't know. ,我哋當中 72% 嘅人又曾經遇到過 
"Today, I'm here to share the experience of what it's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts. ",所以我哋要必須鼓起勇氣 停止蘊釀緊嘅性暴力風氣 
"For years after the tragedy, I combed through memories, trying to figure out exactly where I failed as a parent. ",最後，請大家相信我 
But there are no simple answers. ,相信我 
I can't give you any solutions. ,（掌聲、歡呼聲） 呢個係人類之間互動嘅一個根本問題 
All I can do is share what I have learned. ,但我相信互動係解決問題嘅核心所在 問題唔解決只會延續落去 
"When I talk to people who didn't know me before the shootings, I have three challenges to meet. ",Edith Wharton 話過︰ 「 結局隱藏喺開端 」 所以嚟到演講最尾 等我哋一齊為善去惡 
"First, when I walk into a room like this, I never know if someone there has experienced loss because of what my son did. ",雖然我一直孤身作戰 但係我知道我哋係同一陣線 
I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family who isn't here to do it for himself. ,最近我學到誠意同肯定 點樣化解惡性互動 
"So first, with all of my heart, I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain. ",化解惡性互動有五個要點︰ 需要特別真誠 要有時間 可以隨時、隨地、同任何語言嘅人溝通 做到嘅話，會令到前扣帶迴 ——大腦一個過渡位置 不斷充斥住美好嘅事物 
The second challenge I have is that I must ask for understanding and even compassion when I talk about my son's death as a suicide. ,所以我準備讚下我自己 
"Two years before he died, he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook that he was cutting himself. ",希望大家畀啲反應 
He said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life. ,我哋嚟囖嚄，係咁讚嘅吓… （笑聲） 我係有能力又堅強嘅女性，你哋會話？ 
I didn't know about any of this until months after his death. ,觀眾：係，你係 
"When I talk about his death as a suicide, I'm not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life. ",講者︰我阿媽錫我 
I'm trying to understand how his suicidal thinking led to murder. ,觀眾：係，佢鍚你 
"After a lot of reading and talking with experts, I have come to believe that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill but in his desire to die. ",講者︰我場演講好掂 
"The third challenge I have when I talk about my son's murder-suicide is that I'm talking about mental health -- excuse me -- is that I'm talking about mental health, or brain health, as I prefer to call it, because it's more concrete. ",觀眾：係，掂吖 
"And in the same breath, I'm talking about violence. ",講者︰我有權企喺呢度 
The last thing I want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding that already exists around mental illness. ,觀眾：係，無錯 
"Only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other people, but of those who die by suicide, it's estimated that about 75 to maybe more than 90 percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind. ",講者︰我真係靚爆鏡 
"As you all know very well, our mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone, and not everyone with destructive thoughts fits the criteria for a specific diagnosis. ",（笑聲） 觀眾：係，靚曬 
Many who have ongoing feelings of fear or anger or hopelessness are never assessed or treated. ,講者︰上帝愛大家 
"Too often, they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis. ",觀眾：係，上帝愛我 
"If estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person, when suicide rates rise, as they are rising for some populations, the murder-suicide rates will rise as well. ",講者︰我都愛你哋 
"I wanted to understand what was going on in Dylan's mind prior to his death, so I looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss. ",多謝大家畀我為大家服務 
"I did research and volunteered to help with fund-raising events, and whenever I could, I talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt. ",我祝福你哋 
One of the most helpful conversations I had was with a coworker who overheard me talking to someone else in my office cubicle. ,（歡呼聲、掌聲） 
She heard me say that Dylan could not have loved me if he could do something as horrible as he did. ,
"Later, when she found me alone, she apologized for overhearing that conversation, but told me that I was wrong. ",我最後一次聽到我仔把聲 佢出緊前門 去返學 
"She said that when she was a young, single mother with three small children, she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe. ",門口好黑，佢就講咗一個字 「拜。」 
"At the time, she was certain that her children would be better off if she died, so she had made a plan to end her life. ",1999 年 4 月 20 號朝早 
"She assured me that a mother's love was the strongest bond on Earth, and that she loved her children more than anything in the world, but because of her illness, she was sure that they would be better off without her. ",我個仔迪倫同佢朋友艾瑞克 喺科倫拜高中 殺咗 12 個學生同一個老師 傷咗 20 幾個人之後自殺 
What she said and what I've learned from others is that we do not make the so-called decision or choice to die by suicide in the same way that we choose what car to drive or where to go on a Saturday night. ,13 個無辜嘅人被殺 留畀佢哋嘅親友 無限悲痛同創傷 
"When someone is in an extremely suicidal state, they are in a stage four medical health emergency. ",其他傷者 有人毁咗容，有人終生殘廢 
Their thinking is impaired and they've lost access to tools of self-governance. ,但係，呢個慘案嘅危害性 唔可以用傷亡人數來衡量 
"Even though they can make a plan and act with logic, their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain through which they interpret their reality. ",我哋亦冇辦法去衡量佢 對喺學校嘅目擊人同參與救援 同清理嘅人造成嘅心裡創傷 
"Some people can be very good at hiding this state, and they often have good reasons for doing that. ",亦冇辦法估量其他人模仿 呢個槍殺案 會造成嘅影響 
"Many of us have suicidal thoughts at some point, but persistent, ongoing thoughts of suicide and devising a means to die are symptoms of pathology, and like many illnesses, the condition has to be recognized and treated before a life is lost. ",科倫拜慘案係個大浪 風波之後，社會需要好耐來 消化、理解同認識佢嘅影響 
But my son's death was not purely a suicide. ,我用咗好多年來接受 我個仔留低嘅問題 
It involved mass murder. ,暴行定義咗佢最後嘅人生 佢已經唔係我識嗰個人 
I wanted to know how his suicidal thinking became homicidal. ,修尾有人問我 「你點解會唔知？ 
But research is sparse and there are no simple answers. ,你到底點做媽咪？」 
"Yes, he probably had ongoing depression. ",我都猛咁問自己 
"He had a personality that was perfectionistic and self-reliant, and that made him less likely to seek help from others. ",槍擊案之前，我自認係個好媽咪 
He had experienced triggering events at the school that left him feeling debased and humiliated and mad. ,幫助我啲仔女成為體貼 健康、負責嘅成年人 係我一世人最重要嘅角色 
"And he had a complicated friendship with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation, and who was seriously disturbed, controlling and homicidal. ",但係呢個悲劇話我知 我做媽咪好失敗 挫敗感使我今日企喺呢度 
"And on top of this period in his life of extreme vulnerability and fragility, Dylan found access to guns even though we'd never owned any in our home. ",除咗佢嘅爸爸 我係最了解同最愛迪倫嘅人 
"It was appallingly easy for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns, both legally and illegally, without my permission or knowledge. ",假使有人可以預料到呢件事 嗰個人應該係我，係咪？ 
"And somehow, 17 years and many school shootings later, it's still appallingly easy. ",但係我唔知 
"What Dylan did that day broke my heart, and as trauma so often does, it took a toll on my body and on my mind. ",今日，我想分享下我作為 一個殺人兇手嘅媽咪嘅感受 
"Two years after the shootings, I got breast cancer, and two years after that, I began to have mental health problems. ",慘案之後好多年 我猛咁梳理我啲記憶 諗我到底做錯咗咩 
"On top of the constant, perpetual grief I was terrified that I would run into a family member of someone Dylan had killed, or be accosted by the press or by an angry citizen. ",我揾唔到明確嘅答案 
"I was afraid to turn on the news, afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person. ",亦冇任何解決方案 
I started having panic attacks. ,我可以做嘅，唯有 同你哋分享我嘅經驗同教訓 
"The first bout started four years after the shootings, when I was getting ready for the depositions and would have to meet the victims' families face to face. ",同槍擊案之後 先識我嘅人傾偈時 我要面對三個挑戰 
"The second round started six years after the shootings, when I was preparing to speak publicly about murder-suicide for the first time at a conference. ",第一，我行入類似宜家間房時 我冇辦法知道，有冇人因為我嘅仔 受到過傷害 
Both episodes lasted several weeks. ,我要承認我個仔 造成咗嘅災難 
"The attacks happened everywhere: in the hardware store, in my office, or even while reading a book in bed. ",首先，我誠摯咁 為我個仔對你哋 造成嘅傷害道歉 
"My mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror and no matter how I hard I tried to calm myself down or reason my way out of it, I couldn't do it. ",第二個挑戰 係我講我個仔 係死於自殺時 我需要你哋嘅諒解，甚至同情 
"It felt as if my brain was trying to kill me, and then, being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts. ",喺佢過身前兩年 佢曾經喺本日記度寫 佢係度自殘 
"That's when I learned firsthand what it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind, and that's when I truly became a brain health advocate. ",佢話佢好痛苦 想摞把槍了結自己 
"With therapy and medication and self-care, life eventually returned to whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances. ",我喺佢死後幾個月先知道 
"When I looked back on all that had happened, I could see that my son's spiral into dysfunction probably occurred over a period of about two years, plenty of time to get him help, if only someone had known that he needed help and known what to do. ",我講我個仔係自殺時 唔係想減輕佢嘅罪過 
"Every time someone asks me, ""How could you not have known?"", it feels like a punch in the gut. ",我只係試圖去理解 點解佢自殺嘅意圖 會導致一場屠殺 
It carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt that no matter how much therapy I've had I will never fully eradicate. ,讀咗好多文章，同資訊專家之後 我逐漸相信 佢策劃槍擊案唔係想殺人 而係想自殺 
"But here's something I've learned: if love were enough to stop someone who is suicidal from hurting themselves, suicides would hardly ever happen. ",講我個仔嘅自殺謀殺時 第三個挑戰 就係講心理健康 唔好意思 就係講心理健康 稱為大腦健康會更準確 
"But love is not enough, and suicide is prevalent. ",同时，我亦係度講緊暴力 
"It's the second leading cause of death for people age 10 to 34, and 15 percent of American youth report having made a suicide plan in the last year. ",我當然唔想加重 大家對心理疾病嘅誤解 
"I've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can, we cannot know or control everything our loved ones think and feel, and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different, that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else, can cause us to miss what's hidden in plain sight. ",只有好少有心理疾病嘅人 對其他人有暴力傾向 但係，自殺嘅群體 有 75%，甚至 90% 有可以被診斷嘅心理健康狀況 
"And if worst case scenarios do come to pass, we'll have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing or for not asking the right questions or not finding the right treatment. ",眾所周知，我哋嘅心理健康 醫療機制照顧唔到每一個人 同時，唔係每個有破壞性傾向嘅人 都會診斷到嘅 心理病 
"We should always assume that someone we love may be suffering, regardless of what they say or how they act. ",好多覺得恐懼、憤怒、或者絕望嘅人 從來都冇 俾診斷或者治療過 
"We should listen with our whole being, without judgments, and without offering solutions. ",等到有行為危機時 我哋先注意到佢哋 
"I know that I will live with this tragedy, with these multiple tragedies, for the rest of my life. ",根據統計數據 大概百分之一到二嘅自殺 會導致另一個人嘅死亡 一個群體嘅自殺率上升時 佢嘅自殺加謀殺率亦會上升 
"I know that in the minds of many, what I lost can't compare to what the other families lost. ",我好想了解，迪倫喺死前諗緊咩 於是我去研究啲自殺未遂嘅人 
I know my struggle doesn't make theirs any easier. ,我做調查，又幫手籌款 一有機會 就同啲自殺未遂 或者有自殺傾向嘅人倾偈 
"I know there are even some who think I don't have the right to any pain, but only to a life of permanent penance. ",我一個同事 畀我好大嘅啟發 佢之前喺辦公室 偶然聽到我同人講 
"In the end what I know comes down to this: the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to help, but for love's sake, we must never stop trying to know the unknowable. ",迪倫肯定唔愛我，唔係嘅話 佢點會做出咁恐怖嘅事 
Thank you. ,之後，我呢個同事單獨嚟搵我 佢話，唔好意思，無意中聽到我講嘢 同時間話我知，我係錯嘅 
(Applause) ,佢係個後生嘅單身媽咪時 佢要湊住三個細蚊仔 佢變得好抑鬱，需要住院來確保安全 
,嗰個時候，佢堅信 如果佢死咗，佢嘅细路仔會更好 於是佢準備自殺 
(Guitar music starts) (Cheers) (Cheers) (Music ends) ,佢話，母愛係世界上最堅韌嘅紐帶 佢愛佢嘅仔女，多於世上嘅一切 但係因為佢個病 佢堅信佢啲仔女冇佢仲好 
,我從佢同其他人身上學到 我哋對自殺嘅抉擇 同我哋諗買邊駕車 或者星期六去邊度玩嘅嗰種選擇 係好唔同 
"When I was a kid, I was the quintessential nerd. ",喺一個人極度想自殺時 佢處於最嚴重嘅醫學緊急狀態 
"I think some of you were, too. ",佢嘅思考能力受損，冇曬自律能力 
"(Laughter) And you, sir, who laughed the loudest, you probably still are. ",儘管佢哋計劃同執行時好有逻辑 佢嘅是非觀已經俾痛苦扭曲 呢種痛苦改變咗 佢哋對現實嘅理解 
"(Laughter) I grew up in a small town in the dusty plains of north Texas, the son of a sheriff who was the son of a pastor. ",有哋人好識掩飾自己 因為迫不得已 
Getting into trouble was not an option. ,好多人都諗過自殺 如果呢個念頭揮之唔去 仲會諗點去執行 呢就好似其他疾病 係一種病態 呢種病況需要、喺仲有得救時 辨認同治療 
And so I started reading calculus books for fun. ,但係我個仔唔單止自殺 
"(Laughter) You did, too. ",佢仲導致咗一場屠殺 
"That led me to building a laser and a computer and model rockets, and that led me to making rocket fuel in my bedroom. ",我想知，佢嘅自殺傾向 點變成謀殺傾向 
"Now, in scientific terms, we call this a very bad idea. ",呢方面嘅研究好少 冇簡單同直接嘅答案 
"(Laughter) Around that same time, Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" came to the theaters, and my life was forever changed. ",冇錯，佢一直都有抑鬱症 
"I loved everything about that movie, especially the HAL 9000. ",佢係個完美主義者，唔鍾意依靠人 佢嘅性格使佢 好少向其他人求助 
"Now, HAL was a sentient computer designed to guide the Discovery spacecraft from the Earth to Jupiter. ",佢曾經喺學校經歷過使佢覺得 羞愧，屈辱同憤怒嘅觸發事件 
"HAL was also a flawed character, for in the end he chose to value the mission over human life. ",而且，佢同一個 係憤怒同孤獨嘅男仔 有個複雜嘅關係 呢個男仔處於極度不安嘅狀態 有強烈嘅控制慾同嗜殺慾 
"Now, HAL was a fictional character, but nonetheless he speaks to our fears, our fears of being subjugated by some unfeeling, artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity. ",喺佢哋人生裡邊 最脆弱嘅時候 即使我哋屋企冇槍 迪倫都有其他渠道摞到咗槍支 
I believe that such fears are unfounded. ,一個十七歲嘅男仔，合法或者非法 唔使我知道或允許 就輕易摞到槍支 
"Indeed, we stand at a remarkable time in human history, where, driven by refusal to accept the limits of our bodies and our minds, we are building machines of exquisite, beautiful complexity and grace that will extend the human experience in ways beyond our imagining. ",過去十七年嚟嘅校園槍擊 買賣槍支依然係 令人膽寒嘅容易 
"After a career that led me from the Air Force Academy to Space Command to now, I became a systems engineer, and recently I was drawn into an engineering problem associated with NASA's mission to Mars. ",迪倫嗰日做嘅嘢令我心碎 創傷就係有咁嘅後果 時刻折磨住我嘅身心 
"Now, in space flights to the Moon, we can rely upon mission control in Houston to watch over all aspects of a flight. ",槍擊事件後兩年，我得咗乳腺癌 再過咗两年，我得咗心理病 
"However, Mars is 200 times further away, and as a result it takes on average 13 minutes for a signal to travel from the Earth to Mars. ",同永久嘅悲哀 我好驚我會撞見 被害人嘅家屬 或者媒體 或者一個憤怒嘅市民 
"If there's trouble, there's not enough time. ",我怕開電視睇新聞 驚人哋鬧我衰，鬧我核突 
And so a reasonable engineering solution calls for us to put mission control inside the walls of the Orion spacecraft. ,我開始有恐慌發作 
"Another fascinating idea in the mission profile places humanoid robots on the surface of Mars before the humans themselves arrive, first to build facilities and later to serve as collaborative members of the science team. ",第一發作喺槍擊案後四年 我準備去法庭作證 要面對被害人家屬嗰 
"Now, as I looked at this from an engineering perspective, it became very clear to me that what I needed to architect was a smart, collaborative, socially intelligent artificial intelligence. ",第二次發作，喺槍擊案後六年 我生來第一次 公開參加討論自殺加謀殺 
"In other words, I needed to build something very much like a HAL but without the homicidal tendencies. ",兩次發作，每次延續幾個星期 
(Laughter) Let's pause for a moment. ,恐慌發作隨時會發生 喺五金店，喺寫字樓 甚至喺床上睇書嗰時 
Is it really possible to build an artificial intelligence like that? ,我會突然充滿恐懼 無論我點試住 冷靜落來 我做唔到 
"Actually, it is. ",感覺好似，我嘅大腦整死我 之後，我一直 好驚自己咁驚 
"In many ways, this is a hard engineering problem with elements of AI, not some wet hair ball of an AI problem that needs to be engineered. ",呢個就係我嘅 大腦失常嘅親身經歷 所以，我係大腦健康嘅擁護者 
"To paraphrase Alan Turing, I'm not interested in building a sentient machine. ",用藥物治療同自我護理 我嘅生活慢慢返到正軌 變到相對嘅正常 
I'm not building a HAL. ,我諗下過去， 逐漸明白 我個仔臨死前兩年可能 因為機能失調過得好辛苦 嗰時，哪怕有一個人知道佢需要幫助 又知道點做 兩年時間咁長，肯定有機會幫到佢 
"All I'm after is a simple brain, something that offers the illusion of intelligence. ",每一次有人問我 「你點會唔知？」 好似重重一拳打落我個心度 
"The art and the science of computing have come a long way since HAL was onscreen, and I'd imagine if his inventor Dr. Chandra were here today, he'd have a whole lot of questions for us. ",指責我，引發我嘅負罪感 無論我接受幾多治療 永遠都唔會完全好返 
"Is it really possible for us to take a system of millions upon millions of devices, to read in their data streams, to predict their failures and act in advance? ",從中我學到 如果愛就夠曬 去打消一個人自殺 同傷人嘅念頭 咁自殺就幾乎唔會發生 
Yes. ,但係如果有愛仲唔夠 咁自殺會普遍咁發生 
Can we build systems that converse with humans in natural language? ,自殺喺 10 至 34 歲嘅群體 係第二大致死原因 舊年 2016 年 百分之十五嘅美國青少年 話自己計劃過自殺 
Yes. ,我認識到，無論我哋幾想做到 我哋永遠都唔知道，亦控制唔到 我哋愛嘅人嘅所有諗法同感覺 我哋堅信，我哋同其他人唔同 所以我愛嘅人唔會去自殘 或者傷害其他人 呢個觀念會導致我哋忽視 平靜嘅表面下邊嘅嘢 
"Can we build systems that recognize objects, identify emotions, emote themselves, play games and even read lips? ",假使最壞嘅事發生咗 我哋要學識 原諒自己唔知嘅嘢 原諒自己冇發現嘅問題 原諒自己冇搵到對策 
Yes. ,我哋應該假設 我哋所愛嘅人可能受緊折磨 即使佢嘅言行 好正常 
"Can we build a system that sets goals, that carries out plans against those goals and learns along the way? ",我哋應該用成個身心咁 唔帶任何偏見咁 未必畀到解決方法咁去傾聽 
Yes. ,我好清楚，我成世都 會帶著呢個悲劇 呢幾個悲劇，一直行落去 
Can we build systems that have a theory of mind? ,我知道，好多人諗 我嘅損失嘅 遠唔及受害者家屬 
This we are learning to do. ,我嘅掙扎 唔會減輕佢哋嘅痛苦 
Can we build systems that have an ethical and moral foundation? ,有人認為，我冇痛苦嘅權利 只有用成世去贖罪 
This we must learn how to do. ,我嘅總結係 我哋就算再負責再警覺 最尾都可能 防止唔到悲劇嘅發生 但係為咗愛 我哋絕唔可以放棄嘗試 去了解現實背後嘅未知 
So let's accept for a moment that it's possible to build such an artificial intelligence for this kind of mission and others. ,多謝

"In scientific terms, this is what we call ground truth, and here's the important point: in producing these machines, we are therefore teaching them a sense of our values. ",哈爾係一部機械人 專為太空船導航而設計 指引太空船由地球飛往木星 
"To that end, I trust an artificial intelligence the same, if not more, as a human who is well-trained. ",但哈爾都有缺點 佢最後為實現目的而罔顧人類安全 
"But, you may ask, what about rogue agents, some well-funded nongovernment organization? ",哈爾雖然係虛構 但佢反映咗我哋嘅恐懼 就係怕無感情嘅人工智能 以後會操控人類 
I do not fear an artificial intelligence in the hand of a lone wolf. ,我認為呢種恐懼唔成立 
"Clearly, we cannot protect ourselves against all random acts of violence, but the reality is such a system requires substantial training and subtle training far beyond the resources of an individual. ",講真，人類呢一刻嘅歷史 可以話係最輝煌嘅 我哋冇向身體同大腦限制低頭 反而製造出精良、複雜又美觀嘅機器 協助人類逹至超乎想象嘅領域 
"And furthermore, it's far more than just injecting an internet virus to the world, where you push a button, all of a sudden it's in a million places and laptops start blowing up all over the place. ",我以前喺空軍學校同太空指揮部做嘢嘅 咁而家，我做咗系統工程師 最近我著手於美國太空總署嘅 火星任務嘅一個工程問題 
"Now, these kinds of substances are much larger, and we'll certainly see them coming. ",到目前為止，所有上月球嘅太空船 我哋都可以留喺休斯頓控制中心控制 
Do I fear that such an artificial intelligence might threaten all of humanity? ,不過，火星比月球遠 200 倍 於是乎由地球傳送到火星嘅訊號 平均要花 13 分鐘先可以送到 
"If you look at movies such as ""The Matrix,"" ""Metropolis,"" ""The Terminator,"" shows such as ""Westworld,"" they all speak of this kind of fear. ",所以如果中途出咗咩問題 我哋都唔夠時間解決 
"Indeed, in the book ""Superintelligence"" by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, he picks up on this theme and observes that a superintelligence might not only be dangerous, it could represent an existential threat to all of humanity. ",所以解決方法係 我哋要將任務控制台 裝喺太空船獵戶號嘅墻板裏邊 
Dr. Bostrom's basic argument is that such systems will eventually have such an insatiable thirst for information that they will perhaps learn how to learn and eventually discover that they may have goals that are contrary to human needs. ,另一個方法係 喺人類登陸之前 喺火星表面放置一個機械人 機械人前期負責興建設施 後期就加入科學團隊擔當協助 
Dr. Bostrom has a number of followers. ,而當我企喺工程師嘅角度嚟睇 我好清楚我要打造嘅 係一個高智能、富團隊精神 同善於交際嘅人工智能 
He is supported by people such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. ,換句話嚟講，我要整到好似哈爾咁樣 不過係唔會當人類 係冚家鏟要消滅嘅機械人 
"With all due respect to these brilliant minds, I believe that they are fundamentally wrong. ",（笑聲） 等陣先 
"Now, there are a lot of pieces of Dr. Bostrom's argument to unpack, and I don't have time to unpack them all, but very briefly, consider this: super knowing is very different than super doing. ",咁係咪真係有可能整個咁嘅機械人先？ 
HAL was a threat to the Discovery crew only insofar as HAL commanded all aspects of the Discovery. ,其實，係可以嘅 
So it would have to be with a superintelligence. ,好多時，設計人工智能元素係好難嘅 咁唔係講緊整機械人頭髮 
It would have to have dominion over all of our world. ,學 Alan Turning 話齋 我無興趣整隻有感覺嘅機器 
"This is the stuff of Skynet from the movie ""The Terminator"" in which we had a superintelligence that commanded human will, that directed every device that was in every corner of the world. ",亦都唔係生產另一個哈爾 
"Practically speaking, it ain't gonna happen. ",我所追求嘅係一個會簡單思考 同有少少智慧嘅機械人 
"We are not building AIs that control the weather, that direct the tides, that command us capricious, chaotic humans. ",自從哈爾喺電影出現之後 計算科學已經發展咗好多 我想像得到，如果發明佢嘅 Chandra 博士今日喺度嘅話 佢實有好多問題問我哋 
"And furthermore, if such an artificial intelligence existed, it would have to compete with human economies, and thereby compete for resources with us. ",我哋有冇可能 從數以億計嘅設備裡面讀取數據 同時預測機器犯嘅錯誤 同埋及早更正呢？ 
And in the end -- don't tell Siri this -- we can always unplug them. ,可以 
(Laughter) We are on an incredible journey of coevolution with our machines. ,我哋可唔可以 整隻機械人出嚟識講人話？ 
The humans we are today are not the humans we will be then. ,可以 
To worry now about the rise of a superintelligence is in many ways a dangerous distraction because the rise of computing itself brings to us a number of human and societal issues to which we must now attend. ,我哋可唔可以整隻機械人 識得識別物體、辨別情感 自帶情感、打機，甚至識讀唇語？ 
How shall I best organize society when the need for human labor diminishes? ,可以 
How can I bring understanding and education throughout the globe and still respect our differences? ,我哋可唔可以整隻機械人識訂立目標 實現目標兼且喺過程中自學？ 
How might I extend and enhance human life through cognitive healthcare? ,可以 
How might I use computing to help take us to the stars? ,我哋可唔可以整隻 有思維邏輯嘅機械人？ 
And that's the exciting thing. ,我哋宜家嘗試緊 
"The opportunities to use computing to advance the human experience are within our reach, here and now, and we are just beginning. ",我哋可唔可以整隻機械人 明白道德觀念同底線？ 
Thank you very much. ,呢個任務我哋責無旁貸 
(Applause) ,咁姑且我哋有可能 為呢個任務或者其他任務 整隻咁樣嘅機械人 
,跟住你實會問 咁嘅人工智能會唔會造成威脅？ 
"(Guitar) (Singing) Rollercoaster, carousel. ",時至今日，每項新科技面世 唔多唔少都會帶嚟不安 
"Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. ",以前啲人第一次見到汽車時 就驚車禍會造成家破人亡 
"You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over, you can never tell. ",以前第一次見到電話時 啲人就驚人同人之間嘅交流會受到破壞 
People tell you this one thing -- will make your life complete. ,曾幾何時啲人見到文字可以傳送 又驚人類嘅記憶力會喪失 
"So you, you give it everything you got and you wind up on the street. ",呢啲不安喺一定程度上嚟講無錯 但同時呢啲科技 拓闊咗人類嘅體驗 
"Then one day you wake up, and they tell you ""you're a queen,"" but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings. ",我哋不如再講遠啲 
"Rollercoaster, carousel. ",我唔驚呢啲人工智能面世 因為佢最終會接受人類嘅一啲價值 
"Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. ",試下咁唸：製造感知機械人 同製造以前傳統嘅軟件密集型機械人 係有根本性分別 
"You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over, you can never tell. ",我哋而家唔係編程機械人 我哋係教機械人 
"The one you love, they love you -- oh yeah -- until the end of time. ",為咗教機械人識別花 我攞幾千種我鍾意嘅花畀佢睇 
"But lose your edge or lose your cool, they will drop you like a dime. ",為咗教曉機械人點打機—— 我真係教㗎。你都會咁做 
Everyone is crowding 'round when fortune is your friend. ,我真係鍾意花呢—— 
"When your luck is running out, you're all alone again. ",為咗教識機械人打「殺出重圍」 我畀佢打幾千局遊戲 不過呢個過程，我又會教佢 辨別好局同劣局 
"Rollercoaster, carousel. ",如果我想整隻法律助理機械人 我除咗會教佢法律 我仲會教佢法律嘅寛容同公義 
"Where the highs are heaven but the lows, oh, they can be hell. ",套用科學術語 呢啲係我哋所謂嘅參考標準 而且重要嘅係： 製造呢啲機械人時 我哋將自己嘅價值觀灌輸畀佢 
"You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over you can never tell. ",最終，我相信人工智能 會同一個受過專業訓練嘅人一樣 
"Well, maybe I'm just cynical, and all these words are lies, but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise. ",不過，你哋可能會問 如果呢啲人工智能被非法分子利用呢？ 
"But caution makes you hesitate, and hesitate you're lost, so take your opportunities and never count the cost. ",雖然我哋唔可能杜絕所有暴力事件發生 
"Rollercoaster, carousel. ",但我唔擔心人工智能落入一啲壞人手中 因為人工智能需要持續同細微嘅改進 單憑個人資源唔使旨意做到 
"Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. ",而且，唔好當成植入網絡病毒咁簡單 唔好以為隨時隨地㩒個掣 全世界嘅電腦瞬間就會爆炸 
"You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over -- over, over, you can never, ever tell. ",人工智能係複雜好多嘅嘢 但我相信遲早有一日人工智能會出現 
"Rollercoaster, carousel, rollercoaster, yeah, yeah, yeah, carousel. ",我驚唔驚人工智能會威脅全人類？ 
"Carousel, carousel, carousel, carousel. ",電影《黑客帝國》、《大都會》 《終結者》、電視劇《西部世界》 呢類影視作品都係刻畫呢種恐懼 
(Applause) Michael Pemberton. ,無錯，哲學家 Nick Bostrom 喺《超人工智能》一書裏邊都認為 超人工智能唔單止危險 而且仲危及全人類 
(Applause) Thank you so much. ,佢嘅基本論點有︰ 咁樣嘅機械人 最終唔會滿足於眼前擁有嘅資訊 機械人可能會因而自己鑽研學習方法 以至到最後發現 自己有啲目標同人類需要有矛盾 
Thank you. ,有人支持博森博士嘅觀點 
,包括 Elon Musk 同霍金 
So there's this thing called the law of unintended consequences. ,我想指出其實幾位智者諗錯咗 
"I thought it was just like a saying, but it actually exists, I guess. ",Nick Bostrom 嘅理論有好多錯誤 但我無時間講曬所有 但簡單嚟講，可以咁理解： 超智能唔代表超萬能 
"There's, like, academic papers about it. ",哈爾對於成個太空探索團隊嘅威脅 僅限於佢可以對探索任務落命令 
And I'm a designer. ,所以任務需要一個超智能機器 
I don't like unintended consequences. ,落命令嘅需要有統治世界嘅能力 
"People hire me because they have consequences that they really intend, and what they intend is for me to help them achieve those consequences. ",電影《未來戰士 2018》 裡面嘅 Skynet 嗰個可以操控人類意志嘅 超人工智能防禦系統 控制曬全世界所有嘅機器同裝置 
So I live in fear of unintended consequences. ,即係話 電影情節係唔會發生 
And so this is a story about consequences intended and unintended. ,我哋唔係整隻機械人出嚟呼風喚雨 操控喜怒無常、陷於鬥爭嘅人類 
I got called by an organization called Robin Hood to do a favor for them. ,再者，如果咁樣嘅機械人真係存在 佢就會同人類嘅經濟鬥過 甚至同人類爭資源 
"Robin Hood is based in New York, a wonderful philanthropic organization that does what it says in the name. ",最終結果係—— 唔好話俾 Siri 聽—— 我哋可以隨時熄咗佢哋 
"They take from rich people, give it to poor people. ",（笑聲） 我哋同機械人係共同進化 
"In this case, what they wanted to benefit was the New York City school system, a huge enterprise that educates more than a million students at a time, and in buildings that are like this one, old buildings, big buildings, drafty buildings, sometimes buildings that are in disrepair, certainly buildings that could use a renovation. ",未來嘅人類同今日嘅我哋 唔可以同日而語 
"Robin Hood had this ambition to improve these buildings in some way, but what they realized was to fix the buildings would be too expensive and impractical. ",人類擔心人工智能帶嚟威脅 只會令人類唔去真正關心 科技崛起帶嚟嘅人文同社會問題 而呢啲問題正正係 我哋需要著手解決嘅 
"So instead they tried to figure out what one room they could go into in each of these buildings, in as many buildings that they could, and fix that one room so that they could improve the lives of the children inside as they were studying. ",問題例如有︰ 當我哋唔再需要勞動力嘅時候 我哋要點去調控社會？ 
"And what they came up with was the school library, and they came up with this idea called the Library Initiative. ",點樣向全世界傳播知識同教育 同時又尊重當地嘅差異？ 
All the students have to pass through the library. ,點樣通過認知式保健幫人類延年益壽？ 
That's where the books are. ,點樣利用電腦幫人類踏足外太空？ 
That's where the heart and soul of the school is. ,諗下都覺得興奮 
So let's fix these libraries. ,利用計算科學去開拓人類經歷嘅機會 就喺手裏邊 而我哋只係啱啱捉緊到 
"So they did this wonderful thing where they brought in first 10, then 20, then more architects, each one of whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was. ",多謝大家 
They trained special librarians. ,（掌聲） 
So they started this mighty enterprise to reform public schools by improving these libraries. ,
"Then they called me up and they said, ""Could you make a little contribution?"" ",（吉他） （演唱） 過山車 迴旋木馬 
"I said, ""Sure, what do you want me to do?"" ",喺高處時你見到天堂 降到低處時 你睇到地獄 
"And they said, ""Well, we want you to be the graphic designer in charge of the whole thing."" ",你出力揸住個環 敲響個鐘 但係永遠唔知道 幾時先至到終點 
"And so I thought, I know what that means. That means I get to design a logo. ",人人都話你知 點樣可以令生命完整 
I know how to design that. I design logos. ,所以你 為佢付出咗所有 最後流落街頭 
That's what people come to me for. ,有一日你醒咗 佢哋話你係個女王 但係你發現另一個人 喺度操控所有嘢 
"So OK, let's design a logo for this thing. ",過山車 同迴旋木馬 
"Easy to do, actually, compared with architecture and being a librarian. ",喺高處時你見到天堂 喺低處時 你睇見地獄 
"Just do a logo, make a contribution, and then you're out, and you feel really good about yourself. ",你出力揸住個環 敲響個鐘 但係永遠唔知 幾時先至到達終點 
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel good about myself when I do these favors. ,你愛嘅人 亦愛你 噢 直到地老天荒 
"So I thought, let's overdeliver. ",但係你唔喺狀態時 佢哋會拋銀仔咁拋棄你 
"I'm going to give you three logos, all based on this one idea. ",你有錢時 個個圍住你 
"So you have three options, pick any of the three. ",但係你好運用盡時 你又變返孤零零一個 
"They're all great, I said. ",過山車 迴旋木馬 
"So the basic idea was these would be new school libraries for New York schools, and so the idea is that it's a new thing, a new idea that needs a new name. ",喺高處時你見到天堂 喺低處時 你睇見地獄 
"What I wanted to do was dispel the idea that these were musty old libraries, the kind of places that everyone is bored with, you know, not your grandparents' library. ",你出力揸住個和環 敲響個鐘 但係永遠唔知 幾時先至到達終點 
Don't worry about that at all. ,或者係我太憤世嫉俗 可能我講嘅都係大話 但係經歷話我知 謹慎啲唔會錯嘅 
"This is going to this new, exciting thing, not a boring library. ",但係謹慎會令你猶豫 令你迷失 所以仲係快點揸緊個機會 唔好計較得失 
"So option number one: so instead of thinking of it as a library, think of it as a place where it is like: do talk, do make loud noises. ",過山車 同迴旋木馬 
"Right? So no shushing, it's like a shush-free zone. ",喺高處時你見到天堂 降到低處時 你睇見地獄 
We're going to call it the Reading Room. ,你出力揸住個環 敲響個鐘 但係永遠唔知 永遠唔知 幾時到達終點 
"That was option number one. OK, option number two. ","過山車 同迴旋木馬 過山車 yeah, yeah, yeah 迴旋木馬 "
"Option number two was, wait for it, OWL. ",迴旋木馬 迴旋木馬 迴旋木馬 迴旋木馬 
I'll meet you at OWL. ,（掌聲） Michael Pemberton 
I'm getting my book from the OWL. Meet you after school down at OWL. ,（掌聲） 多謝你哋 
"I like that, right? Now, what does OWL stand for? ",多謝 
"Well, it could be One World Library, or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn. ",
Or it could be -- and I figure librarians could figure out other things it could be because they know about words. ,有樣嘢叫做意外結果定律 
"So other things, right? ",我以為佢係個傳說 其實，佢真係存在 
And then look at this. It's like the eye of the owl. ,仲有人寫關於佢嘅學術論文 
This is irresistible in my opinion. ,我係個設計師 
But there's even another idea. ,我唔鍾意意外嘅結果 
Option number three. ,啲客戶請我 因為佢哋要喺控制範圍以內 達到佢哋要嘅嘅效果 
Option number three was based actually on language. ,所以我好怕失控 同意外嘅結果 
"It's the idea that ""read"" is the past tense of ""read,"" and they're both spelled the same way. ",呢個故事係關於 預期同意外嘅效果 
So why don't we call this place The Red Zone? ,有個叫羅賓漢嘅機構揾到我 叫我幫手 
I'll meet you at the Red Zone. ,羅賓漢，如同其名 係一個喺紐約嘅好正嘅慈善機構 
Are you Red? Get Red. ,佢哋摞富濟貧 
I'm well Red. ,今次，佢哋想幫助紐約嘅公立學校系統 一個每年負責教育 過百萬嘅學生嘅龐大嘅機構 啲教學樓就係噉樣 又大又舊 漏風，年久失修 好需要修理 
"(Laughter) I really loved this idea, and I somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and I don't know. ",羅賓漢嘅本意係想改善下哋樓房 但係佢哋意識到 成棟樓咁修不但止貴，而且唔現實 
"(Laughter) But sometimes cleverness is more important than spelling, and I thought this would be one of those instances. ",所以，佢哋諗不如 每棟樓翻修一間房 盡量多整幾棟樓 咁樣，佢哋可以改善 啲細路嘅學習環境 
"So usually when I make these presentations I say there's just one question and the question should be, ""How can I thank you, Mike?"" ",於是，佢哋決定翻修每個學校嘅圖書館 就係「圖書館計劃」 
"But in this case, the question was more like, ""Um, are you kidding?"" ",所有學生都去過圖書館 
"Because, they said, the premise of all this work was that kids were bored with old libraries, musty old libraries. ",一個有好多書嘅地方 
They were tired of them. ,係學校嘅心臟同靈魂所在 
"And instead, they said, these kids have never really seen a library. ",好，我哋去翻新圖書館喇 
"The school libraries in these schools are really so dilapidated, if they're there at all, that they haven't bored anyone. ",佢哋嘅計劃好正，請咗十，二十 然後更多嘅建築師嚟 一人重新設計一個圖書館 
They haven't even been there to bore anyone at all. ,佢哋仲培訓特殊嘅圖書管理員 
"So the idea was, just forget about giving it a new name. ",成個事業好宏大 改革公立學校，從圖書館做起 
"Just call it, one last try, a library. ",佢揾到我，問：「可唔可以幫手？」 
Right? OK. ,我話：「冇問題，你要我做咩？」 
"So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph? ",佢哋話：「呃，我哋要你 做成個平面設計嘅總監。」 
Exclamation point? ,我就諗 收到，設計一個標誌 
"Then -- this is because I'm clever -- move that into the ""i,"" make it red, and there you have it, the Library Initiative. ",我知掂做，我做呢行嘅 
"So I thought, mission accomplished, there's your logo. ",人哋就係揾我做呢個嘅 
"So what's interesting about this logo, an unintended consequence, was that it turned out that they didn't really even need my design because you could type it any font, you could write it by hand, and when they started sending emails around, they just would use Shift and 1, they'd get their own logo just right out of the thing. ",好，設計標誌 
"And I thought, well, that's fine. ",其容易過起建築 或者管理圖書館 
Feel free to use that logo. ,設計完個標誌，我就走得 仲好有自豪感 
And then I embarked on the real rollout of this thing -- working with every one of the architects to put this logo on the front door of their own library. Right? ,我係個好人，幫到人時我好高興 
So here's the big rollout. ,我諗，不如超越客戶要求 
Basically I'd work with different architects. ,一個理念，三個標誌 
First Robin Hood was my client. Now these architects were my client. ,任你揀 
"I'd say, ""Here's your logo. Put it on the door."" ",我同啲客仔講，個個設計都好正 
Here's your logo. Put it on both doors. ,基本理念係 為紐約嘅學校設計嘅 新嘅學校圖書館 新生事物，就要有個新名 
Here's your logo. Put it off to the side. ,我唔想啲人認為 係圖書館都又老又舊 睇到都好悶嗰種 你知喇，老一脫人用嘅嗰種圖書館 
Here's your logo repeated all over to the top. ,完全唔係咁 
So everything was going swimmingly. ,呢個係一個令人振奮嘅新事物 唔係無聊嘅圖書館 
"I just was saying, ""Here's your logo. Here's your logo."" ",所以，方案一： 唔好當呢個地方係圖書館 而當佢係自由傾偈 同發聲嘅地方 
"Then I got a call from one of the architects, a guy named Richard Lewis, and he says, ""I've got a problem. ",冇人可以噓你 
"You're the graphics guy. Can you solve it?"" ",呢個地方就叫閱讀室 
"And I said, OK, sure."" ",然後第二個方案 
"And he said, ""The problem is that there's a space between the shelf and the ceiling."" ",睇住啦 OWL 
"So that sounds like an architectural issue to me, not a graphic design issue, so I'm, ""Go on."" ",我哋喺 OWL 見啦 
"And Richard says, ""Well, the top shelf has to be low enough for the kid to reach it, but I'm in a big old building, and the ceilings are really high, so actually I've got all this space up there and I need something like a mural."" ",我去 OWL 摞書 放學我喺 OWL 等你 
"And I'm like, ""Whoa, you know, I'm a logo designer. ",我好鍾意呢個 OWL 係咩？ 
I'm not Diego Rivera or something. ,可以係 「一個世界圖書館「」嘅簡寫 亦可以解做開放 、好奇，同學習 
"I'm not a muralist."" ",其他解法就留畀啲圖書管理員諗喇 佢哋識咁多字 
"And so he said, ""But can't you think of anything?"" ",仲有咩？ 
"So I said, ""OK, what if we just took pictures of the kids in the school and just put them around the top of the thing, and maybe that could work."" ",佢似唔似隻貓頭鷹嘅眼？ 
"And my wife is a photographer, and I said, ""Dorothy, there's no budget, can you come to this school in east New York, take these pictures?"" ",我覺得你係冇辦法抗拒呢個設計 
"And she did, and if you go in Richard's library, which is one of the first that opened, it has this glorious frieze of, like, the heroes of the school, oversized, looking down into the little dollhouse of the real library, right? ",仲有 
"And the kids were great, hand-selected by the principals and the librarian. ",方案三 
"It just kind of created this heroic atmosphere in this library, this very dignified setting below and the joy of the children above. ",其實係個文字遊戲 
"So naturally all the other librarians in the other schools see this and they said, well, we want murals too. ",靈感來自英文 「閱讀」嘅現在式同過去式一樣嘅拼法 而「閱讀」嘅過去式又同「紅色」同音 
"And I'm like, OK. ",不如叫圖書館做「紅區」？ 
"So then I think, well, it can't be the same mural every time, so Dorothy did another one, and then she did another one, but then we needed more help, so I called an illustrator I knew named Lynn Pauley, and Lynn did these beautiful paintings of the kids. ",喺「紅區」見喇 
Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin at a place called Automatic Design. ,你「讀」咗未？ 紅咯！ 
He did these amazing collages. ,我好「紅」！ 
We had Rafael Esquer do these great silhouettes. ,（笑聲） 我好鍾意呢個諗法 但係我就冇考慮到 啲圖書管理員 其實都好肉緊啲拼同寫 
"He would work with the kids, asking for words, and then based on those prompts, come up with this little, delirious kind of constellation of silhouettes of things that are in books. ",（笑聲） 但係有時創意緊要過拼寫 好似宜家咁 
Peter Arkle interviewed the kids and had them talk about their favorite books and he put their testimony as a frieze up there. ,我畀客戶睇我嘅設計時 通常客戶只有一個問題，就係： 「Mike，我要點多謝你先得？」 
"Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu and they did this amazing manga-style statement, ""Everyone who is honest is interesting,"" that goes all the way around. ",不過今次，個客嘅問題係： 「呃，你講笑啊？」 
"Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator, did a whole series of things where he embedded books into the faces and characters and images and places that you find in the books. ",佢哋話 我嘅設計前提係 啲細路已經好厭呢啲 
And then even Maira Kalman did this amazing cryptic installation of objects and words that kind of go all around and will fascinate students for as long as it's up there. ,又老又舊嘅圖書館 
"So this was really satisfying, and basically my role here was reading a series of dimensions to these artists, and I would say, ""Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want. ",但其實窮學校嘅細路從來都 未見過真正嘅圖書館 
"Let me know if you have any problem with that."" ",窮學校嘅圖書館 好舊好爛 有啲學校甚至冇圖書館 
And they would go and install these. It just was the greatest thing. ,所以啲細路俾圖書館煩嘅機會都冇 
"But the greatest thing, actually, was -- Every once in a while, I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail made of construction paper, and it would say, ""You are invited to the opening of our new library."" ",所以，我冇需要起個新名 
"So you'd go to the library, say, you'd go to PS10, and you'd go inside. ",叫圖書館就得 
"There'd be balloons, there'd be a student ambassador, there'd be speeches that were read, poetry that was written specifically for the opening, dignitaries would present people with certificates, and the whole thing was just a delirious, fun party. ",係咁 
So I loved going to these things. ,於是我諗，得，不如加小小新意？ 
"I would stand there dressed like this, obviously not belonging, and someone would say, ""What are you doing here, mister?"" ",加個感嘆號？ 
"And I'd say, ""Well, I'm part of the team that designed this place."" ",然後，我幾鬼馬嘎 我將個「 i 」變成感嘆號 同變成紅色 搞掂：「圖書館計劃」 
"And they'd said, ""You do these shelves?"" ",我諗，搞掂喇 
"And I said, ""No."" ""You took the pictures up above."" ",呢個標誌嘅意外嘅效果 就係，根本唔使我嚟設計 電腦都可以打印，手寫又得 佢哋寫電郵時開始咁寫添 用 Shift 同 1 就打出嚟喇 
No. ,我諗，都幾好 
"Well, what did you do? ",隨便用喇 
You know when you came in? The sign over the door? ,然後就真係要推出呢個標誌 我同每一個建築師合作 將個標誌放喺個門度 
The sign that says library? ,先前，羅賓漢係我個客 
"(Laughter) ""Yeah, I did that!"" ",宜家我同啲建築師合作 
"And then they'd sort of go, ""OK. Nice work if you can get it."" ",佢哋每一個都係我嘅客 
"So it was so satisfying going to these little openings despite the fact that I was kind of largely ignored or humiliated, but it was actually fun going to the openings, so I decided that I wanted to get the people in my office who had worked on these projects, get the illustrators and photographers, and I said, why don't we rent a van and drive around the five boroughs of New York and see how many we could hit at one time. ",我話: 「嗱， 畀你個標誌，放喺個門度。」 
"And eventually there were going to be 60 of these libraries, so we probably got to see maybe half a dozen in one long day. ",「畀你個標誌，一幢門一個。」 
"And the best thing of all was meeting these librarians who kind of were running these, took possession of these places like their private stage upon which they were invited to mesmerize their students and bring the books to life, and it was just this really exciting experience for all of us to actually see these things in action. ",「摞住個標誌，放喺旁邊。」 
So we spent a long day doing this and we were in the very last library. ,「 畀個標誌你，喺上面放一排。」 
"It was still winter, because it got dark early, and the librarian says, ""I'm about to close down. So really nice having you here. ",做得好順利 
"Hey, wait a second, do you want to see how I turn off the lights?"" ",我就話：「畀你個標誌你。」 
"I'm like, ""OK."" ",然後有個叫理查 ．劉易斯嘅建築師 打電話畀我：「我有個問題。 
"And she said, ""I have this special way that I do it."" ",你係平面設計師 可唔可以幫手？」 
And then she showed me. ,我話：「好。」 
"What she did was she turned out every light one by one by one by one, and the last light she left on was the light that illuminated the kids' faces, and she said, ""That's the last light I turn off every night, because I like to remind myself why I come to work."" ",佢話：「問題就係， 啲書櫃頂同天花板有啲空間。」 
"So when I started this whole thing, remember, it was just about designing that logo and being clever, come up with a new name? ",聽落好似個建築上嘅問題 唔係平面設計 嘅問題，我就話：「繼續講。」 
"The unintended consequence here, which I would like to take credit for and like to think I can think through the experience to that extent, but I can't. ",理查話：「嗰啲書櫃唔可以起得太高， 太高嘅話，啲細路就摞唔到啲書。 我負責嘅大樓嘅天花板高， 所以書櫃同天花板之間就有好多空白。 我需要啲壁畫嚟填呢個空間。」 
"I was just focused on a foot ahead of me, as far as I could reach with my own hands. ",我話：「哇，我設計標誌嘅， 
"Instead, way off in the distance was a librarian who was going to find the chain of consequences that we had set in motion, a source of inspiration so that she in this case could do her work really well. ",我唔係迭戈裡維拉， 
"40,000 kids a year are affected by these libraries. ",壁畫我唔得啵。」 
"They've been happening for more than 10 years now, so those librarians have kind of turned on a generation of children to books and so it's been a thrill to find out that sometimes unintended consequences are the best consequences. ",佢話：「咁你可唔可以幫手度下橋？」 
Thank you very much. ,我話：「不如影學生相， 將啲相放大，貼上個空間， 可能得。」 
(Applause) ,我太太係攝影師 我同佢講：「多羅西，我哋冇錢， 你可唔可以嚟呢間學校 幫手影相？」 
,佢去咗 宜家你去理查德嘅圖書館 佢是最早重新開放嘅圖書館之一 佢有好靚嘅雕帶 好似學校嘅大英雄 居高臨下 望住個圖書館 
"Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics. ",啲細路係校長 同圖書館長欽點嘅 
"In fact, mostly now in other things. ",使到個圖書館好有英雄氣氛 上邊莊重，下邊有細路嘅喜悅 
One thing is distant relationships among human languages. ,其他圖書館嘅館長 睇度呢個之後話 我哋都要壁畫 
"And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S. ",於是我話，冇問題 
"and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships, big groupings, groupings that go back a long time, longer than the familiar families. ",但係我又諗，啲壁畫個個一樣唔得 於是多羅西整個新嘅，又再整一個 我哋搞唔掂，需要揾人幫手 我打電話畀一個 叫 Lynn Pauley 嘅插圖家 佢畫嘅細蚊仔嘅畫好靚 
They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank. ,我打電話畀 Automatic Design 嘅 Charles Wilkin 
"And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads. ",佢做咗啲令人嘆為觀止嘅拼圖 
"Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago? ",我哋請咗 Rafael Esquer 嚟做啲獨具一格嘅剪影 
"And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages? ",佢叫啲細蚊仔畀啲生字佢 然後以呢啲生字為基礎 增成代表書裡邊嘅事物嘅剪影 
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go? ,Peter Arkle 問啲細蚊仔 最鍾意睇咩書 然後將嗰啲書嘅封面整成雕帶 
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back? ,Stefan Sagmeister 同 Yuko Shimizu 合作 用漫畫風格寫： 「任何誠實嘅人都係有趣嘅」 然後整成環繞住成間房嘅雕帶 
Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is? ,Christoph Niemann 一個才華橫溢嘅插圖家 做咗一個系列 將書嵌入書裡邊嘅場景 同人物面孔 
"Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier. ",仲有 Maira Kalman 整咗一個又神秘又迷人嘅 環繞住成個房間嘅 藝術作品 
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language. ,呢啲作品嘅效果好令人滿意 我嘅職責就係 將啲尺寸畀啲藝術家 然後話： 「三尺乘十五尺，隨你點整。 
"So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further. ",你有咩問題就揾我。」 
"But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck. ",佢哋就開工。真係好正 
"CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right. ",最正嘅係 間中 我會收到繪畫紙做嘅請柬 請我參加某個圖書館 
You may just know more about everything than anyone. ,譬如，PS10 圖書館，嘅開放典禮 去到嗰度 
"So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann. ",裡面有氣球，有學生大使 有演講 有贈興詩 有重要人物發獎狀 直程成個好開心同瘋狂嘅派對 
(Applause) ,我好鍾意去呢種派對 
,我會著成咁，企起度，格格不入 有人會問我：「先生，你嚟做咩？」 
I want to give you a new perspective. ,我會話：「我係設計團隊嘅成員。」 
"That sounds grandiose, and it is. ",佢哋問：「你設計咗啲書櫃？」 
I left Ireland yesterday morning. ,「唔係。」 「你影咗牆上邊嘅相？」 
I traveled from Dublin to New York independently. ,「唔係。」 
"But the design of an airport, plane and terminal offers little independence when you're 105 and a half centimeters tall. ",「咁你做咗咩？」 
"For Americans, that's 3' 5"". ",「你入嚟時有冇睇到門上邊嘅標誌？」 
I was whisked through the airport by airline assistants in a wheelchair. ,「圖書館嗰幾只字？」 
"Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair, but the design of an airport and its lack of accessibility means that it's my only way to get through. ",（笑聲） 「係啊。係我整嘅！」 
"With my carry-on bag between my feet, I was wheeled through security, preclearance and I arrived at my boarding gate. ",佢哋會話：「 咁都得。」 
I use the accessibility services in the airport because most of the terminal is just not designed with me in mind. ,總之，圖書館嘅開放儀式令我好滿足 就算冇人理我，就算我俾人笑 真係好好玩 於是乎，我將參加過呢個計劃嘅 插圖家、攝影師叫嚟 我話，不如租架大車 橫穿喺紐約五個區 睇下我哋一次可以去到幾個圖書館 
"Take security, for example. ",計劃結束時有 60 個咁樣嘅圖書館 我哋一日可能睇到半打 
I'm not strong enough to lift my carry-on bag from the ground to the carousel. ,最好嘅係，我哋會見到啲圖書管理員 佢哋係圖書館真正嘅主人 喺佢哋嘅私人舞台上 佢哋使書本有生命 使學生著迷 我好激動能夠親眼睇到 佢哋做嘅工作 
I stand at eye level with it. ,我哋用咗成日從一個個圖書館咁參觀 到咗最尾嗰個圖書館 
And those who work in that space for safety purposes cannot help me and cannot do it for me. ,嗰時仲係冬天，天黑得好快 個圖書管理員話： 「我要閂門喇。 好高興你哋嚟探我。 
Design inhibits my autonomy and my independence. ,你要唔要睇我熄燈？」 
"But traveling at this size, it isn't all bad. ",我話：「好啊。」 
The leg room in economy is like business class. ,佢話：「我有一套特殊嘅程序。」 
(Laughter) I often forget that I'm a little person. ,佢整畀我睇 
It's the physical environment and society that remind me. ,佢先將其他燈一盞一盞咁熄曬 細路壁畫嘅燈留到最後 佢話：「我晚晚最尾熄呢盞燈， 因為我想提醒自己 嚟返工嘅理由。」 
Using a public bathroom is an excruciating experience. ,我開始做呢個項目時 就淨係諗住設計個標誌 耍啲小聰明，起個新名 
I walk into the cubicle but I can't reach the lock on the door. ,我想話，啲意外嘅效果 我想認係我嘅功勞 係我深思熟慮之後嘅結果 但係我唔可以 
I'm creative and resilient. ,我其實就係見步行步 
I look around and see if there's a bin that I can turn upside down. ,殊不知，我哋做嘅嘢 會一件事連一件事咁 影響好多人同事 喺好耐以後，間接咁 畀一個圖書管理員 靈感同動力 
Is it safe? ,呢啲圖書館每年影響四萬個細路 
Not really. ,已經影響咗十年，啲圖書管理員 已經使一代嘅細路鍾意上讀書 令人激動嘅係 有時意外嘅效果係最好嘅結果 
Is it hygienic and sanitary? ,多謝 
Definitely not. ,（掌聲） 
But the alternative is much worse. ,
"If that doesn't work, I use my phone. ",其實，除咗物理之外，我都參與咗一些其他嘅領域。 
"It gives me an additional four- to six-inch reach, and I try to jam the lock closed with my iPhone. ",事實上，最近我嘅大部分時間都係度做哩地“其他事” 
"Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive had in mind when he designed the iPhone, but it works. ",其中一件就是關於人類語言的距離關係。 
The alternative is that I approach a stranger. ,美國以及西歐國家的職業歷史語言學者 
I apologize profusely and I ask them to stand guard outside my cubicle door. ,都試圖逃避 任何關於長距離聯繫（嘅研究）；大族群之間嘅、 那些可以追溯到很久遠、 比目前知道熟悉嘅族群都更古老的族群（嘅研究）。 
"They do and I emerge grateful but absolutely mortified, and hope that they didn't notice that I left the bathroom without washing my hands. ",距地唔中意研究哩地嘢，覺得哩地係好奇怪嘅嘢，但係我就唔係好認同。 
"I carry hand sanitizer with me every single day because the sink, soap dispenser, hand dryer and mirror are all out of my reach. ",有些非常優秀嘅語言學家，其中大多係俄羅斯人， 距地係莫斯科嘅聖塔菲研究院研究哩個課題 我一路都好期待知道哩個研究可以發展到邊。 
"Now, the accessible bathroom is somewhat of an option. ",現代語言會唔會真係指向一個2萬或者2萬5千年前 一個共同嘅原始語言？ 
"In this space, I can reach the lock on the door, the sink, the soap dispenser, the hand dryer and the mirror. ",又或者，如果我們繼續追溯到哩個原始語言之前又會點樣呢？ 當時大概有多種語言在相互競爭吧。 
"Yet, I cannot use the toilet. ",甘哩嘀係响幾耐之前呢？近代語言可以追溯到幾耐之前？ 
It is deliberately designed higher so that wheelchair users can transfer across with ease. ,係幾萬年前？ 
"This is a wonderful and necessary innovation, but in the design world, when we describe a new project or idea as accessible, what does that mean? ",Chris Anderson: 你有冇預感或者希望這個問題嘅答案會係咩呢？ 
Who is it accessible to? ,Murray Gell-Mann: 嗯，我會估現代語言（的起源）大概會比我們（想像的）更加古老 （距應該）比洞穴中嘅壁畫、雕刻、雕塑 或者西歐洞穴中軟泥上嘅舞步-係3萬5千年前嘅歐里納克時期-都要更早 或者西歐洞穴中軟泥上嘅舞步-係3萬5千年前嘅歐里納克時期-都要更早 
And whose needs are not being accommodated for? ,我好難相信距地可以做到所有哩地事，但係卻冇現代語言。 
"Now, the bathroom is an example of where design impinges upon my dignity, but the physical environment impacts upon me in much more casual ways too, something as simple as ordering a cup of coffee. ",所以我會估現代語言嘅真實起源至少可以追溯到果個時候，甚至更遠。 
"Now, I'll admit it. ",但哩個並唔代表所有、許多或者大多數 在今日確認嘅語言 唔會起源於更加後生的淵源，比如20000年前左右 哩個就係我們（在研究哩個問題時）所謂嘅瓶頸。 
I drink far too much coffee. ,CA: 好啦，Philip Anderson可能真係啱嘅 
"My order is a skinny vanilla latte, but I'm trying to wean myself off the syrup. ",你真係在每件事上都比任何人知道更多。 
"But the coffee shop, it's not designed well, at least not for me. ",所以好榮幸（可以請到你過來）。多謝你 
"Queuing, I'm standing beside the pastry cabinet and the barista calls for the next order. ",（掌聲） 
"Next, please! they shout. ",
They can't see me. ,我想帶畀你哋一個新嘅視野 
The person next to me in the queue points to my existence and everyone is embarrassed. ,聽起來好壯觀，佢的確係 
I order as quick as I can and I move along to collect my coffee. ,我勤日上晝離開愛爾蘭 
"Now, think just for a second. ",從都柏林飛到紐約 自己一個人 
Where do they put it? ,但係個飛機場 飛機同機場侯機樓嘅設計 為身高只有 105.5 厘米嘅人 提供好少嘅獨立空間 
Up high and without a lid. ,對美國人嚟講，即係3英尺5英寸 
Reaching up to collect a coffee that I have paid for is an incredibly dangerous experience. ,我坐住輪椅，俾工作人員 推住穿過飛機場 
But design also impinges on the clothes that I want to wear. ,其實，我唔使坐輪椅 但係飛機場嘅設計 加上佢冇障礙輔助功能 使到我唯有咁來過個飛機場 
I want garments that reflect my personality. ,我嘅隨身行李放喺腳邊 我被人推過安檢，境外入境審查 之後來佐入機口 
It's difficult to find in the childrenswear department. ,我利用無障礙輔助服務 因為多數侯機設計 都無考慮到我咁嘅人 
And often womenswear requires far too many alterations. ,就攞安檢舉個例 
"I want shoes that affect my maturity, professionalism and sophistication. ",我根本就唔夠大隻將我個隨身行李 從地下抬上個運輸帶 
"Instead, I'm offered sneakers with Velcro straps and light-up shoes. ",我同運輸帶差唔多高矮 
"Now, I'm not totally opposed to light-up shoes. ",係嗰個崗位嘅工作人員 因為安全性嘅緣故 唔可以幫我 
"(Laughter) But design also impacts on such simple things, like sitting on a chair. ",設計約束到我嘅自主同獨立能力 
I cannot go from a standing to a seating position with grace. ,但係我咁嘅體型去旅遊，都唔係壞事 
"Due to the standards of design heights of chairs, I have to crawl on my hands and knees just to get on top of it, whilst also being conscious that it might tip over at any stage. ",經濟艙對我類講，就寬敞到好似商務艙 
"But whilst design impacts on me whether it's a chair, a bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes, I rely on and benefit from the kindness of strangers. ",(笑聲) 我經常都會唔記得我係一位矮人 
But not everybody is so nice. ,係物理環境同社會提醒我 
"I'm reminded that I'm a little person when a stranger points, stares, laughs, calls me a name, or takes a photograph of me. ",去公共廁所係一個好痛苦嘅經驗 
This happens almost every day. ,我行入去厠所間 但係我手掂唔到個門鎖 
"With the rise of social media, it has given me an opportunity and a platform to have a voice as a blogger and as an activist, but it has also made me nervous that I might become a meme or a viral sensation, all without my consent. ",我係有創意同適應能力 
So let's take a moment right now to make something very clear. ,我睇下有冇垃圾桶可以畀我反過做凳 
"The word ""midget"" is a slur. ",安全？ 
It evolved from PT Barnum's era of circuses and freak shows. ,唔係 
Society has evolved. ,乾淨同衛生？ 
So should our vocabulary. ,肯定唔係 
Language is a powerful tool. ,但係另外嘅選擇仲衰 
It does not just name our society. ,如果嗰個方法行唔通，我用手機 
It shapes it. ,佢將我加長四到六英寸 我試著用我嘅蘋果手機去鎖上個門鎖 
"I am incredibly proud to be a little person, to have inherited the condition of achondroplasia. ",我惗喬納森艾維 當初設計蘋果唔係畀我咁用嘅 但係呢招真係得 
But I am most proud to be Sinead. ,另一個辦法就係去搵生普人幫手 
Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism. ,我會猛咁道歉 叫佢哋企喺我廁所間前邊幫我睇住 
"Achondroplasia translates as ""without cartilage formation."" ",佢哋就企 之後我猛咁講多謝 又覺得好尷尬 希望佢哋當時冇睇到 我冇洗手就走咗 
"I have short limbs and achondroplastic facial features, my forehead and my nose. ",我日日都會隨身帶消毒洗手液 因為我都唔夠高用 洗手盤，肥皂機，烘乾機，同埋鏡 
"My arms do not straighten fully, but I can lick my elbow. ",宜家，無障礙廁所係我另一個選擇 
I'm not showing you that one. ,喺呢個空間裡邊，我可以踮到個門鎖， 洗手盤，肥皂機，烘乾機，同埋塊鏡 
"Achondroplasia occurs in approximately one in every 20,000 births. ",冇錯，我仲係用唔到個馬桶 
80 percent of little people are born to two average-height parents. ,個馬桶設計專登整高啲 咁樣坐輪椅嘅人可以 好容易咁移到馬桶上面 
That means that anybody in this room could have a child with achondroplasia. ,設計得非常之好，仲有創意 設計界裡面嘅無障礙 其實係咩意思呢？ 
"Yet, I inherited my condition from my dad. ",受益者又係邊個呢？ 
I'd like to show you a photo of my family. ,邊啲人需要但又冇被列入考慮範圍？ 
"My mother is average height, my father is a little person and I am the eldest of five children. ",廁所就係一個例子 佢嘅設計對我嘅尊嚴帶嚟好大打擊 物理環境更加隨意咁影響我 啲好簡單嘅事，比如叫杯咖啡 
I have three sisters and one brother. ,我承認 
They are all average height. ,我飲太多咖啡 
"I am incredibly fortunate to have been born into a family that cultivated my curiosity and my tenacity, that protected me from the unkindness and ignorance of strangers and that armed me with the resilience, creativity and confidence that I needed to survive and manipulate the physical environment and society. ",我通常叫一杯脫脂雲呢嗱拿鐵 我試緊戒糖漿 
"If I was to pinpoint any reason why I am successful, it is because I was and I am a loved child, now, a loved child with a lot of sass and sarcasm, but a loved child nonetheless. ",個咖啡店設計得唔係幾好 至少對我來講 
In giving you an insight into who I am today I wanted to offer you a new perspective. ,我企喺個甜點壁橱隔離個度排隊 咖啡師叫下一個單時 
I wanted to challenge the idea that design is but a tool to create function and beauty. ,"佢哋叫︰「唔該, 下一位啊。」 "
"Design greatly impacts upon people's lives, all lives. ",佢哋見唔到我 
"Design is a way in which we can feel included in the world, but it is also a way in which we can uphold a person's dignity and their human rights. ",排喺我後邊嘅人會指出我嘅存在 大家都覺得好尷尬 
Design can also inflict vulnerability on a group whose needs aren't considered. ,於是我快啲落單，去旁邊等我杯咖啡 
"So today, I want your perceptions challenged. ",大家用幾秒去惗下 
Who are we not designing for? ,佢哋將杯咖啡放喺邊度 
How can we amplify their voices and their experiences? ,放喺高處，仲冇蓋 
What is the next step? ,去攞我畀咗錢嘅咖啡 係好危險嘅體驗 
"Design is an enormous privilege, but it is a bigger responsibility. ",連服裝設計都會打擊到我 
I want you to open your eyes. ,我想買啲可以突顯我嘅個性嘅服裝 
Thank you so much. ,只不過咁嘅樣式，喺童裝部好難搵到 
(Applause) ,好多時候女裝需要修改 
,我想買會顯得我 成熟，專業，同埋有教養嘅鞋 
"So, a few years ago I heard an interesting rumor. ",但係我得有魔術貼嘅帆布鞋 同會發光嘅鞋可以簡 
"Apparently, the head of a large pet food company would go into the annual shareholder's meeting with can of dog food. ",我唔係完完全全唔鍾意發光鞋 
And he would eat the can of dog food. ,（笑聲） 設計同樣影響到一啲好簡單嘅事 就比如坐喺個凳度 
"And this was his way of convincing them that if it was good enough for him, it was good enough for their pets. ",從企到坐，我都做唔到優雅 
"This strategy is now known as ""dogfooding,"" and it's a common strategy in the business world. ",因為凳高度設計嘅標準 我要用手同膝頭哥 爬上個凳度 而個凳分分鐘跌 
"It doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food, but businesspeople will use their own products to demonstrate that they feel -- that they're confident in them. ",設計影響我，無論係凳 廁所，咖啡店，亦或買衫 我依靠 生普人嘅善意 
"Now, this is a widespread practice, but I think what's really interesting is when you find exceptions to this rule, when you find cases of businesses or people in businesses who don't use their own products. ",但唔係人人都係好人 
"Turns out there's one industry where this happens in a common way, in a pretty regular way, and that is the screen-based tech industry. ",生普人 指住我 望住我 笑我 同我起花名 或影我相，時時提醒我，我係侏儒 
"So, in 2010, Steve Jobs, when he was releasing the iPad, described the iPad as a device that was ""extraordinary."" ",幾乎日日都有咁嘅事 
"The best browsing experience you've ever had; way better than a laptop, way better than a smartphone. 
It's an incredible experience. ",隨著社交媒體變得愈嚟愈廣泛 佢畀咗我個平台做博客同行動家 佢同樣令我緊張 喺無經我同意嘅情況下 我可能變成模因 又或者突然變紅 
"A couple of months later, he was approached by a journalist from the New York Times, and they had a long phone call. ",所以宜家我哋就用啲時間 講清啲事 
"At the end of the call, the journalist threw in a question that seemed like a sort of softball. ",「侏儒」係個貶義詞 
"He said to him, ""Your kids must love the iPad."" ",佢係從巴納姆嘅馬戲團 同畸形秀時代演變出嚟 
"There's an obvious answer to this, but what Jobs said really staggered the journalist. ",社會已經變咗 
"He was very surprised, because he said, ""They haven't used it. ",所以我咃嘅用詞要跟上 
"We limit how much technology our kids use at home."" ",語言係一個強大嘅工具 
This is a very common thing in the tech world. ,佢唔單止畀我咃社會名義 
"In fact, there's a school quite near Silicon Valley called the Waldorf School of the Peninsula, and they don't introduce screens until the eighth grade. ",佢仲塑造社會 
What's really interesting about the school is that 75 percent of the kids who go there have parents who are high-level Silicon Valley tech execs. ,因為軟骨發育不全症遺傳 成為矮人，我覺得好自豪 
"So when I heard about this, I thought it was interesting and surprising, and it pushed me to consider what screens were doing to me and to my family and the people I loved, and to people at large. ",我最自豪嘅就係身為西尼德 
"So for the last five years, as a professor of business and psychology, I've been studying the effect of screens on our lives. ",軟骨發育不全症係最常見嘅侏儒症 
"And I want to start by just focusing on how much time they take from us, and then we can talk about what that time looks like. ",又叫「冇軟骨形成」 
"What I'm showing you here is the average 24-hour workday at three different points in history: 2007 -- 10 years ago -- 2015 and then data that I collected, actually, only last week. ",我手短腳短 面部有軟骨發育不全嘅特徵 比如我嘅額頭同鼻 
And a lot of things haven't changed all that much. ,我兩隻手申唔直 但係我舔到自己嘅手肘 
"We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half to eight hours a day; some people say that's declined slightly, but it hasn't changed much. ",我係唔會秀畀你睇 
We work eight-and-a-half to nine hours a day. ,每約2萬名新生嬰， 就有一名患上軟骨發育不全症 
We engage in survival activities -- these are things like eating and bathing and looking after kids -- about three hours a day. ,80% 矮人嘅父母都係中等身高 
That leaves this white space. ,即係話任何人都有可能 生軟骨發育不全嘅BB 
That's our personal time. ,我係因為爸爸嘅遺傳 
That space is incredibly important to us. ,我畀你哋睇下我嘅全家福 
That's the space where we do things that make us individuals. ,我媽咪嘅身高中等 我爹地係矮人 我係最大嘅家庭成員 
"That's where hobbies happen, where we have close relationships, where we really think about our lives, where we get creative, where we zoom back and try to work out whether our lives have been meaningful. ",我有三個妹，一個細佬 
"We get some of that from work as well, but when people look back on their lives and wonder what their lives have been like at the end of their lives, you look at the last things they say -- they are talking about those moments that happen in that white personal space. ",佢哋都係中等身高 
So it's sacred; it's important to us. ,我好幸運生係一個 培養我嘅好奇心同韌力嘅家庭 喺陌生人嘅不友善對待， 同愚昧影響下保護我 令我能屈能伸， 有喺物理環境和社會生存 嘅創意同自信心 
"Now, what I'm going to do is show you how much of that space is taken up by screens across time. ",如果我講出我成功嘅一個因素 就係，我一直都係一個受寵愛嘅囡囡 一個牙尖嘴利嘅受寵愛囡囡 但無論係點，我都係被寵愛嘅 
"In 2007, this much. ",我畀咗你哋，一個我係邊個嘅睇法 我想畀你哋一個全新嘅視野 
That was the year that Apple introduced the first iPhone. ,我想要挑戰嘅概念係 設計係一個創造功能同美麗嘅工具 
"Eight years later, this much. ",設計對人嘅生活影響好大 所有人 
"Now, this much. ",設計係一種令我哋覺得 俾世界接納嘅方式 亦係一個維護尊嚴同人權嘅方式 
That's how much time we spend of that free time in front of our screens. ,設計同樣可以 傷害一個需要被忽視嘅群體 
"This yellow area, this thin sliver, is where the magic happens. ",所以，今日我想挑戰各位嘅觀念 
That's where your humanity lives. ,我哋設計冇考慮咩人？ 
"And right now, it's in a very small box. ",我哋點樣可以放大 佢哋嘅聲音同經驗？ 
So what do we do about this? ,下一步係咩？ 
"Well, the first question is: What does that red space look like? ",設計係個龐大嘅特權 亦係更加大嘅責任 
"Now, of course, screens are miraculous in a lot of ways. ",我想你哋擘大你哋嘅眼睛 
"I live in New York, a lot of my family lives in Australia, and I have a one-year-old son. ",多謝大家 
The way I've been able to introduce them to him is with screens. ,（拍手） 
I couldn't have done that 15 or 20 years ago in quite the same way. ,
So there's a lot of good that comes from them. ,幾年前，我聽過一個好有趣嘅傳言： 
One thing you can do is ask yourself: What goes on during that time? ,一間大型寵物食品公司嘅老總 會喺年度股東大會度 
How enriching are the apps that we're using? ,當眾食一罐狗糧 
And some are enriching. ,佢想通過呢種方式嚟說服股東 既然佢敢食狗糧 咁股東啲寵物就更加可以放心食 
"If you stop people while they're using them and say, ""Tell us how you feel right now,"" they say they feel pretty good about these apps -- those that focus on relaxation, exercise, weather, reading, education and health. ",呢種依家畀稱為「內部測試」嘅策略 已經成為商界嘅一種常用策略 
They spend an average of nine minutes a day on each of these. ,佢唔係叫大家都去食狗糧 係指商人會通過使用自己嘅產品 去證明同表明 佢哋對自己嘅產品有信心 
These apps make them much less happy. ,依家，呢種策略已經得到廣泛嘅應用 但係我覺得真正有趣嘅係 呢個策略唔係萬能嘅 因為有啲生意或者有啲商人 係唔用自己嘅產品 而且呢種情況仲喺一個產業中比比皆是 
"About half the people, when you interrupt them and say, ""How do you feel?"" ",甚至形成咗一種常態 講嘅就係以屏幕為基礎嘅科技產業 
say they don't feel good about using them. ,2010 年蘋果發佈會，喬佈斯 將 iPad 稱為一款「超凡」產品 
"What's interesting about these -- dating, social networking, gaming, entertainment, news, web browsing -- people spend 27 minutes a day on each of these. ",「你將體驗前所未有嘅 比手提、智能手機仲要好嘅瀏覽經歷 
We're spending three times longer on the apps that don't make us happy. ,暢快到令你難以置信。」 
That doesn't seem very wise. ,幾個月之後 一名來自紐約時報嘅記者去採訪佢 佢哋講咗好長嘅一通電話 
One of the reasons we spend so much time on these apps that make us unhappy is they rob us of stopping cues. ,電話結束之前 記者問咗啲一個好似放水嘅問題 
Stopping cues were everywhere in the 20th century. ,「你嘅細路仔一定好鍾意 iPad。」 
"A stopping cue is basically a signal that it's time to move on, to do something new, to do something different. ",答案似乎必然係肯定嘅 但喬佈斯嘅回答就令人大跌眼鏡 
"And -- think about newspapers; eventually you get to the end, you fold the newspaper away, you put it aside. ",佢反而覺得好意外 佢話「佢哋仲未用 iPad。 
"The same with magazines, books -- you get to the end of a chapter, prompts you to consider whether you want to continue. ",我哋屋企限制細路仔 接觸科技嘅時間。」 
"You watched a show on TV, eventually the show would end, and then you'd have a week until the next one came. ",呢種情況喺科技界好常見 
There were stopping cues everywhere. ,事實上，矽谷附近有間 叫做 Waldorf School of the Peninsula 嘅學校 學生直到八年級先至用觸屏產品 
But the way we consume media today is such that there are no stopping cues. ,有趣嘅係 其中有 75% 嘅學生家長 都係矽谷嘅技術高管 
"The news feed just rolls on, and everything's bottomless: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, email, text messaging, the news. ",所以當我聽聞呢件事之後 我覺得既有趣又驚奇 而佢又促使我去思考 到底觸屏產品對我 對我家人、我愛嘅人 對大部份嘅人到底有乜影響 
"And when you do check all sorts of other sources, you can just keep going on and on and on. ",所以喺過去五年間 作為一名商業同心理學教授 我一直喺度研究 觸屏產品對我哋生活嘅影響 
"So, we can get a cue about what to do from Western Europe, where they seem to have a number of pretty good ideas in the workplace. ",我先計下佢哋消耗咗我哋幾多時間 然後再討論我哋用呢段時間做咗咩 
Here's one example. This is a Dutch design firm. ,我哋就揀一個平常嘅工作日 按佢有 24 小時噉計 我哋揾咗三個嘅時間點 2007 年， 即係 10 年前 2015 年 同我上個星期啱收集咗數據嘅 2017 年 
And what they've done is rigged the desks to the ceiling. ,好多嘢都冇點變 
"And at 6pm every day, it doesn't matter who you're emailing or what you're doing, the desks rise to the ceiling. ",我哋仲係每日瞓大概 7 個半到 8 個鐘 有人話，睡眠時間輕微減少咗 但實際冇好大變化 
"(Laughter) (Applause) Four days a week, the space turns into a yoga studio, one day a week, into a dance club. ",我哋每日做 8 個半到 9 個鐘嘅工 
It's really up to you which ones you stick around for. ,仲有啲日常活動 譬如食飯、沖涼、湊細路仔 每日要花費三個鐘 
"But this is a great stopping rule, because it means at the end of the day, everything stops, there's no way to work. ",咁仲剩低一啲空間 
"At Daimler, the German car company, they've got another great strategy. ",我哋嘅個人時間 
"When you go on vacation, instead of saying, ""This person's on vacation, they'll get back to you eventually,"" they say, ""This person's on vacation, so we've deleted your email. ",呢段時間對我哋非常重要 
"This person will never see the email you just sent."" ",因為我哋可以做一啲個人嘅嘢 
"(Laughter) ""You can email back in a couple of weeks, or you can email someone else."" ",我哋可以因此培養興趣 發展親密關係 真正思考人生，變得富有創造力 自我反省，完善自身，解決問題 令我哋嘅人生變得有意義 
(Laughter) And so -- (Applause) You can imagine what that's like. ,當然，工作都有咁嘅作用 但係當人喺生命嘅盡頭 回顧自己嘅一生個時 佢哋臨終所講嘅 都同個人時間有關 
"You go on vacation, and you're actually on vacation. ",所以個人時間係好神聖嘅 對我哋好重要 
The people who work at this company feel that they actually get a break from work. ,依家，我要做嘅就係話畀你哋知 隨著時間嘅推移 觸屏產品佔用咗我哋幾多個人時間 
"But of course, that doesn't tell us much about what we should do at home in our own lives, so I want to make some suggestions. ",2007 年 係咁多 
"It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm, I'm going to not use my phone. ",呢年蘋果公司發佈咗第一部 iPhone 
"The problem is, 5 and 6pm looks different on different days. ",八年之後 係咁多 
"I think a far better strategy is to say, I do certain things every day, there are certain occasions that happen every day, like eating dinner. ",依家，係咁多 
"Sometimes I'll be alone, sometimes with other people, sometimes in a restaurant, sometimes at home, but the rule that I've adopted is: I will never use my phone at the table. ",呢啲就係我哋對住屏幕嘅時間 
"It's far away, as far away as possible. ",呢個黃色區域，條細銀線 係魔法發生嘅地方 
Because we're really bad at resisting temptation. ,代表住你本人嘅特質 
"But when you have a stopping cue that, every time dinner begins, my phone goes far away, you avoid temptation all together. ",依家，呢個區域好細 
"At first, it hurts. ",咁我哋要點做？ 
I had massive FOMO. ,第一個問題就係： 個紅色區域似咩？ 
(Laughter) I struggled. ,當然，觸屏產品宜家喺好多方面 都創造咗奇跡 
"But what happens is, you get used to it. ",我喺紐約生活 而我有好多親戚喺澳洲 我有個一歲大嘅仔 
"You overcome the withdrawal the same way you would from a drug, and what happens is, life becomes more colorful, richer, more interesting -- you have better conversations. ",佢通過屏幕嚟識得啲親戚 
You really connect with the people who are there with you. ,呢個係我 15 或者 20 年前 冇辦法做到嘅 
"I think it's a fantastic strategy, and we know it works, because when people do this -- and I've tracked a lot of people who have tried this -- it expands. ",觸屏產品確實帶來咗好多好處 
"They feel so good about it, they start doing it for the first hour of the day in the morning. ",你能夠做嘅一件事就係問自己： 喺嗰段時間到底發生咗咩？ 
They start putting their phones on airplane mode on the weekend. ,嗰啲應用程式到底 令我哋嘅生活豐富咗幾多？ 
"That way, your phone remains a camera, but it's no longer a phone. ",而有啲確實係嘅 
"It's a really powerful idea, and we know people feel much better about their lives when they do this. ",如果你喺人們用緊應用程式陣時 叫停佢哋，問 「話畀我知你依家覺得點啊？」 如果用緊有關放鬆、 鍛煉、天氣 閱讀、教育、健康嘅應用程式 佢哋會話感覺良好 
So what's the take home here? ,佢哋平均每日每個應用程式用九分鐘 
"Screens are miraculous; I've already said that, and I feel that it's true. ",而有啲應用程式就會令到佢哋冇咁開心 
"But the way we use them is a lot like driving down a really fast, long road, and you're in a car where the accelerator is mashed to the floor, it's kind of hard to reach the brake pedal. ",大概一半嘅人，當你打斷佢哋問： 「你覺得點啊？」 
You've got a choice. ,佢哋會講唔係咁開心 
"You can either glide by, past, say, the beautiful ocean scenes and take snaps out the window -- that's the easy thing to do -- or you can go out of your way to move the car to the side of the road, to push that brake pedal, to get out, take off your shoes and socks, take a couple of steps onto the sand, feel what the sand feels like under your feet, walk to the ocean, and let the ocean lap at your ankles. ",有趣嘅係，呢啲應用程式係有關 約會、社交網絡、遊戲 娛樂、新聞、網頁瀏覽 人們每日平均每個應用程式 用二十七分鐘 
"Your life will be richer and more meaningful because you breathe in that experience, and because you've left your phone in the car. ",我哋用多兩倍嘅時間嚟令到自己唔開心 
Thank you. ,咁似乎唔係咁明智 
(Applause) ,我哋之所以用咁多時間喺 令自己唔開心嘅應用程式 係因為佢哋令我哋停唔落嚟 
,停止信號遍佈 20 世紀嘅每一個角落 
"The philosopher Plato once said, ""Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything."" ",一個停止信號主要就係叫我哋 去做一啲新嘅、唔同嘅嘢喇 
Music has always been a big part of my life. ,你諗下，將份報紙睇到尾 你就折好份報紙，放埋一邊 
To create and to perform music connects you to people countries and lifetimes away. ,雜誌、書本都係咁 當你睇完一章內容 你就會去諗跟住要做啲乜 
"It connects you to the people you're playing with, to your audience and to yourself. ",你去睇電視，個節目會結束 你就要等成個星期先至有下一集 
"When I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm bored, when I'm stressed, I listen to and I create music. ",停止信號無處不在 
"When I was younger, I played piano; later, I took up guitar. ",但係我哋今日接觸嘅媒體 係冇停止信號嘅 
"And as I started high school, music became a part of my identity. ",動態消息不斷湧入 一切都變得無窮無盡： Twitter、Facebook、Instagram 郵件、短信、新聞 
"I was in every band, I was involved with every musical fine arts event. ",當你真係要睇曬全部來源嘅信息 你就會一直一直睇下去 
Music surrounded me. ,至於要點應對 我哋可以從西歐得到一啲啟示 佢哋似乎喺工作方面有一啲成效 
"It made me who I was, and it gave me a place to belong. ",舉一個例子 呢個係一間荷蘭設計公司 
"Now, I've always had this thing with rhythms. ",佢哋嘅做法就係 每日下午六點準時將辦公台升到天花板 
"I remember being young, I would walk down the hallways of my school and I would tap rhythms to myself on my leg with my hands, or tapping my teeth. ",無論你係發緊郵件或者咩 張辦公檯都會畀升到天花板 
"It was a nervous habit, and I was always nervous. ",（笑聲） （掌聲） 每個星期有四日 辦公室變成一個瑜伽館 每個星期有一日，辦公室變成舞吧 
I think I liked the repetition of the rhythm -- it was calming. ,由你嚟決定放工後參加咩活動 
"Then in high school, I started music theory, and it was the best class I've ever taken. ",但呢個真係一個好好嘅停止信號 因為咁意味住喺每日嘅結尾 一切都要停止，無辦法再去工作 
"We were learning about music -- things I didn't know, like theory and history. ",一間叫 Daimler 嘅德國汽車公司 採用咗另一種策略 
"It was a class where we basically just listened to a song, talked about what it meant to us and analyzed it, and figured out what made it tick. ",喺你度假個時 佢哋唔講「呢個人度緊假， 等佢返嚟就會回覆你。」 而係講「呢個人度緊假， 所以我哋刪咗你份郵件， 
"Every Wednesday, we did something called ""rhythmic dictation,"" and I was pretty good at it. ",佢永遠都唔會睇到你啱發嗰份郵件。」 
"Our teacher would give us an amount of measures and a time signature, and then he would speak a rhythm to us and we would have to write it down with the proper rests and notes. ",（笑聲） 「你可以幾個星期后再發一次， 或者乾脆發郵件畀其他人。」 
"Like this: ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta, ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a. ",（笑聲） 咁所以 （掌聲） 你可以想像一下呢種情況 
And I loved it. ,你去度假，咁你就係真真正正咁度假 
"The simplicity of the rhythm -- a basic two- to four- measure line -- and yet each of them almost told a story, like they had so much potential, and all you had to do was add a melody. ",呢間公司嘅員工覺得 佢哋係真正放低工作，得到休息 
(Guitar) Rhythms set a foundation for melodies and harmonies to play on top of. ,當然，我哋仲唔係好清楚 平時喺屋企要點做 我想畀大家一啲建議 
It gives structure and stability. ,好簡單，就係我打算下午五點到六點 都唔掂我部手機 
"Now, music has these parts -- rhythm, melody and harmony -- just like our lives. ",問題係，每日嘅下午五點到六點都唔同 
"Where music has rhythm, we have routines and habits -- things that help us to remember what to do and to stay on track, and to just keep going. ",我諗咗一個更好嘅策略 我每日都會做一啲嘢 而其中一啲係每日固定嘅 譬如食晚餐 
"And you may not notice it, but it's always there. ",有時我一個人食 有時同其他人一齊食 有時喺餐館食 有時喺屋企食 但係我嘅原則唔變： 絕對唔喺食飯時睇手機 
"(Guitar) And it may seem simple, it may seem dull by itself, but it gives tempo and heartbeat. ",要將部手機放遠啲 越遠越好 
"And then things in your life add on to it, giving texture -- that's your friends and your family, and anything that creates a harmonic structure in your life and in your song, like harmonies, cadences and anything that makes it polyphonic. ",因為我哋真係對誘惑毫無抵抗力 
And they create beautiful chords and patterns. ,但係你知要停低 所以每次晚飯開餐 我都會將部手機放到好遠 避免曬所有誘惑 
(Guitar) And then there's you. ,一開始好痛苦 
"You play on top of everything else, on top of the rhythms and the beat because you're the melody. ",因為我有好嚴重嘅「錯失恐懼癥」 
"And things may change and develop, but no matter what we do, we're still the same people. ",（笑聲） 我掙扎過 
"Throughout a song melodies develop, but it's still the same song. ",但最後我竟然習慣咗 
"No matter what you do, the rhythms are still there: the tempo and the heartbeat ... ",就好似戒毒時克服毒癮咁 然之後，生活就變得更加豐富多彩 更加有趣 你可以更加好咁溝通 
"until I left, and I went to college and everything disappeared. ",你真正同你身邊嘅人聯繫起來 
"When I first arrived at university, I felt lost. ",我覺得呢個係一個絕佳嘅策略 我哋知道咁樣有用，我追蹤過好多人 當佢哋咁做時—— 呢種作用仲放大咗 佢哋感覺非常良好 
"And don't get me wrong -- sometimes I loved it and it was great, but other times, I felt like I had been left alone to fend for myself. ",從每日早晨嘅第一粒鐘開始自律 
"It's like I had been taken out of my natural environment, and put somewhere new, where the rhythms and the harmonies and the form had gone away, and it was just me -- (Guitar) silence and my melody. ",佢哋開始喺週末將手機調到飛行模式 
"And even that began to waver, because I didn't know what I was doing. ",嗰時，你部手機就唔再係一部手機 而係一部相機 
"I didn't have any chords to structure myself, or a rhythm or a beat to know the tempo. ",咁真係一個好好嘅方法 我哋清楚大家會因此覺得生活更加美好 
(Guitar) And then I began to hear all these other sounds. ,咁到底重點係咩呢？ 
(Guitar) And they were off-time and off-key. ,我講過，觸屏產品係好神奇嘅 我都覺得確實係咁 
"And the more I was around them, the more my melody started to sound like theirs. ",但係我哋依家嘅處境就好似 開著一架車喺一條無盡頭嘅路上狂奔 似乎好難踩到刹車 
"And slowly I began to lose myself, like I was being washed away. ",你面前有兩種選擇 
But then the next moment -- (Guitar) I could hear it. ,你可以任由美景喺眼前飛逝 剩係講句「好靚嘅海景啊」 再透過車窗匆匆影幾張相 咁好容易 或者你可以離開公路，泊車埋邊 踩腳刹車 落車 除低鞋襪 喺沙灘上漫步 感受沙粒帶來嘅觸覺 走向大海 等海水纏繞你嘅腳踝 
And I could feel it. ,你嘅生活會變得更加豐富、有意義 因為你體驗咗新嘅經歷 因為你將部手機留喺架車度 
And it was me. ,多謝！ 
And I was here. ,（掌聲） 
"And it was different, but not worse off. ",
Just changed a little. ,哲學家柏拉圖曾經講過 「音樂賦予宇宙以靈魂， 心以羽翼， 想像以飛翔， 生活以一切。」 
Music is my way of coping with the changes in my life. ,音樂總係我哋生活嘅一大部份 
There's a beautiful connection between music and life. ,創作同表演音樂 聯結起不同國度同命運嘅人 
It can bind us to reality at the same time it allows us to escape it. ,聯結起你同你嘅玩伴 你嘅觀眾 同你自己 
Music is something that lives inside of you. ,每當我開心、悲傷 無聊，或者壓力大 我都會聽同創作音樂 
You create it and you're created by it. ,細個時，我彈鋼琴 長大啲，我彈吉他 
"Our lives are not only conducted by music, they're also composed of it. ",返高中嗰時 音樂就成為咗我命定之事 
"So this may seem like a bit of a stretch, but hear me out: music is a fundamental part of what we are and of everything around us. ",每個樂隊都有我份 每場音樂活動都有我嘅身影 
"Now, music is my passion, but physics also used to be an interest of mine. ",音樂包圍著我 
"And the more I learned, the more I saw connections between the two -- especially regarding string theory. ",令我成為自己 畀咗我歸屬 
"I know this is only one of many theories, but it spoke to me. ",我曾經做咩都好有節奏 
"So, one aspect of string theory, at its simplest form, is this: matter is made up of atoms, which are made up of protons and neutrons and electrons, which are made up of quark. ",我記得細個時 喺學校走廊度行時 我會摞手喺大骳度打節拍 呢個係緊張嘅習慣 
And here's where the string part comes in. ,而我成日都好緊張 
"This quark is supposedly made up of little coiled strings, and it's the vibrations of these strings that make everything what it is. ",我覺得我鍾意節奏嘅重複 佢會令我平靜 
"Michio Kaku once explained this in a lecture called, ""The Universe in a Nutshell,"" where he says, ""String theory is the simple idea that the four forces of the universe -- gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the two strong forces -- can be viewed as music. ",讀高中嗰時 我開始上樂理課 我覺得佢係我上過嘅最好嘅課 
"The music of tiny little rubber bands."" ",就同理論課、歷史課咁 我哋學一點我唔知係咩嘅嘢 
"In this lecture, he goes on to explain physics as the laws of harmony between these strings; chemistry, as the melodies you can play on these strings; and he states that the universe is a ""symphony of strings."" ",上課我哋基本上只係聽歌 討論歌曲對我哋嘅意義 再分析 搵到呢首歌好聽嘅原因 
These strings dictate the universe; they make up everything we see and everything we know. ,每週三，我哋就會做「節奏聽寫」 而我就做得好好 
"They're musical notes, but they make us what we are and they hold us together. ",我哋老師會畀我哋幾條樂譜線 一個節拍符號 之後佢就會講一段節奏 我哋就要用合適嘅記號記低 
"So you see, everything is music. ","就好似咁： ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a "
"(Guitar) When I look at the world, I see music all around us. ",我好鍾意咁 
"When I look at myself, I see music. ",節奏嘅簡單 基本嘅兩到四條樂譜線 幾乎一切都喺度講緊故仔 就好似有好多可能性咁 你再加上一段旋律就得喇 
And my life has been defined by music. ,（吉他聲） 節奏係旋律同音韻和諧嘅基礎 
I found myself through music. ,佢賦予咗結構同穩定 
"Music is everywhere, and it is in everything. ",音樂由三部份組成—— 節奏、旋律同和諧性 就好似我哋嘅生活咁 
And it changes and it builds and it diminishes. ,音樂有節奏 我哋有日常生活同習慣 我哋知道要做啲咩維持正常生活 之後繼續咁生活 
"But it's always there, supporting us, connecting us to each other and showing us the beauty of the universe. ",你可能冇注意到 但事實確實係咁 
"So if you ever feel lost, stop and listen for your song. ",（吉他聲） 等我嚟講得簡單啲 生活本身似乎好無聊 但係帶嚟咗節拍、心跳 
Thank you. ,再加埋你生活中嘅事 加啲質感 家人朋友 一切令到你生活和諧嘅嘢 而喺你嘅歌裏面 就係和聲 抑揚頓挫 一切多音調嘅因素 
(Applause) ,就創造咗優美嘅和絃同節奏 
,（吉他聲） 你就喺度 
Are you tired of your boss? ,你喺一切之上 控制韻律節奏 因為你就係旋律本身 
(Laughter) Are you tired of going to work and making money for other people? ,事物可能會改變、發展 但係無論我哋做咩 我哋本身都冇變到 
And who are those people anyways? ,就好似雖然旋律發生咗改變 首歌都仲係嗰首歌 
Those people that make money from your work. ,無論你做咩 節奏都伴隨著你 仲有節拍同心跳 
"Well, they're capitalists. ",我畢業之後 去咗大學 一切都消失咗 
"They have capital, and they use your labor to make more capital. ",當我啱到大學嗰時 我覺得好迷茫 
"So if you're tired of going to work and making money for other people, then you're probably like me -- just tired of capitalism. ",雖然有時我都幾鍾意大學生活嘅 但有時 我覺得自己好似被遺棄咗 只能夠自己照顧自己 
"Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist. ",就好似我從熟悉嘅環境 被流放到陌生環境 冇節奏、冇和聲 原來嘅生活不復返 剩低我自己 （吉他聲） 寂靜，同自己嘅旋律 
(Laughter) I own a small business -- Rco Tires in Compton. ,但呢一切都開始動搖 因為我唔知道自己喺度做緊咩 
"A few years ago, when I read Van Jones, and he wrote, ""Let's make green collar jobs in the hood,"" I took him really seriously. ",我冇任何自己嘅和絃 或者節奏 或者感知節拍嘅拍打 
"So I cofounded, own and operate a tire recycling company, and I'm really proud of what we've done. ",（吉他聲） 之後我開始聽其他聲音 
"So far, we've recycled a hundred million pounds of rubber. ",（吉他聲） 異常 跑調嘅音樂 
That's 21 million gallons of oil diverted from landfills into new products. ,而我聽得越多 我嘅旋律就越似佢哋 
"(Cheers) We also employ about 15 guys -- mostly people of color, most of whom are felons, and we pay above the minimum wage, and we are now proud members of the United Steelworkers Union. ",逐漸，我開始迷失自我 就好似我被海水沖走咗 
"(Applause) Now, Rco is not a cooperative now. ",之後下一刻 （吉他聲） 我可以聽到 
"It's a privately held company with community-minded ownership, but I would like it to become one. ",我感受得到 
I would like for them to fire the boss -- that's me. ,呢個就係我 
"(Laughter) And I'm going to tell you why, but first, let me tell you how we got started. ",我就喺度 
"So a lot of people ask, ""How did Rco come to be?"" ",我與眾不同 我冇頹廢 
And I have to be really honest. ,只不過發生咗啲改變 
I leveraged my white privilege. ,我通過音樂嚟處理生活中嘅變化 
"So, here's how white privilege worked for me and Rco. ",音樂同生活之間有種美妙嘅聯繫 
My white grandmother was born on her family's plantation in Arkansas in 1918. ,既可以通向現實 同時又可以逃離現實 
"She traveled with her white father west, following the oil boom. ",音樂係你嘅一部份 
"And he held various union oil jobs -- jobs which would have never been given to my black great-grandfather, had he lived here at the time. ",你同音樂相輔相成 
Granny became a hairdresser and then got a loan with her husband who built their home in West Los Angeles -- a loan which would never have been given to a black family at the time. ,音樂唔單止只指揮我哋嘅生活 而且仲「創作」埋 
"And after my grandfather passed away, my granny was able to keep that house because she had his pension and his health care from a state job which he held, which again, would have never been given to a black man before the anti-discrimination act of the 1960s. ",咁講好似有啲誇張 但係聽我講 音樂係我哋 同我哋周圍一切嘅基本 
"So, you fast-forward 30 years, and I graduate, and I want to start my own business with a pile of debt and a credit card, and no experience in the tire industry. ",音樂畀咗我激情 而物理曾經都係我嘅興趣 
But I had what most people didn't have. ,我學得越多 就發現越多佢哋之間嘅聯繫 特別係弦理論 
"I had a clean, safe, free place to live. ",我知道呢個只係眾多物理理論中嘅一個 但係佢話畀我知 
"I moved in with my grandmother, and I was able to rent our first warehouse, buy our first truck, pay our first employees, because I didn't have to worry about paying myself, because I didn't need to feed myself, because I am the direct beneficiary of generations of white privilege. ",弦理論嘅一方面，最簡單嘅方式 係呢個： 物質由原子組成 原子由質子、中子同電子組成 而佢哋又由誇克組成 
"Now, telling the story of white privilege is important because very often people say, ""Oh, we want more companies like yours. ",「弦理論」就係咁嚟噶喇 
"We want more Rco's, we want more black-owned businesses, female-led, triple bottom line, Ban the Box, green manufacturing companies,"" right? ",理論認為誇克係由細連續串組成 而呢啲連續串嘅震動就形成咗一切事物 
"But the question we have to ask is, where is the wealth? ",加來 道雄 曾經喺一個 叫做「果殼中嘅宇宙」 嘅講座中講過 「弦理論係最簡單嘅 宇宙嘅四種力 萬有引力、電磁力 強相互力、弱相互力 都可以睇成音樂 
Where is the money? ,細細個橡筋演奏嘅音樂」 
Where's the capital in our communities to build the types of businesses that we want? ,喺講座度，佢進一步解釋咗 物理就係呢啲「弦」嘅和諧法則 而化學，就好似呢啲「弦」嘅旋律 宇宙，就係「弦嘅交響樂」 
"And in telling a story of the white side of my family, I needed a dozen ways where blacks were excluded from the economy, whereas the white side of my family was able to gain access and traction, and build wealth ... ",呢啲「弦」支配著宇宙 組成一切我哋所見所知嘅嘢 
"Primarily because racism and capitalism are best homies, but -- (Laughter) but what that means is that when we ask ourselves, ""Why are our communities broke?"" -- Like, we're not just broke because we're broke; we're broke for a reason. ",佢哋係音符 但又創造、連接我哋 
Historical context really does matter. ,正如你所見 音樂無處不在 
But our history tells another story as well. ,（吉他聲） 當我望向世界 我見到音樂就喺我哋身邊 
"There's this incredible book called ""Collective Courage,"" which is the story of how thousands of African Americans have been able to build businesses and schools, hospitals, farming cooperatives, banks, financial institutions -- entire communities and sovereign economies, without a lot of capital. ",當我望向我自己 我見到音樂 
And they did it by working together and leveraging their community assets and trusting each other and putting solidarity first -- not just profits by any means necessary. ,而我嘅生活都被音樂定義咗 
And they didn't have to wait around for celebrities and athletes to bring their money back to the hood. ,我通過音樂搵到自我 
"However, if you are a celebrity or an athlete, and you're listening to this, please feel free to bring your money. ",音樂 無處不在 
"(Laughter) But they did it through cooperative economics, because they knew that capitalism was never going to finance black liberation. ",音樂會變化 增長或減少 
"So, there are so many great examples in this book, and I suggest that everybody just read it because it answers the question I asked earlier, which was where are we going to get the wealth to build the types of business that we want. ",但佢一直喺度 支持著我哋 將我哋之間聯結起嚟 畀我哋睇宇宙嘅美麗 
And the answer is going to have to be cooperative economics. ,所以如果你覺得迷茫 就停低聽你自己嘅音樂 
There's a lot of different versions of cooperativism. ,多謝 
What I'm talking about today is worker ownership. ,（掌聲） 
"You may not have heard of worker ownership, but it's been an incredible tool for black economic liberation for a century, and it's also working all over the world right now. ",
"You may have heard of Black Wall Street or maybe the Zapatistas, but I'll give you an example that's a little bit closer to home. ",你憎唔憎你老細？ 
"Right now, today, in South Bronx, is the country's largest worker-owned company. ",（笑聲） 你係咪好厭 同人打工？ 
"It's called Cooperative Home Care Associates, and it was founded by black and Latinx home care workers who are now able to pay themselves living wages, they have full-time hours, they have benefits and a pension, through their membership as a unit of SEIU. ",啲老細又係咩人呢？ 
"And these women owners now receive a dividend back on their ownership every year that the company has been profitable, which has been most years. ",佢哋用你嘅勞力來賺錢 
So they're able to really enjoy the fruits of their labor because they fired the boss. ,佢哋就係資本家 
They don't have any big investors. ,佢哋有資本 然後用你嘅工作成果來賺錢 
They don't have fat-cat CEOs or absentee owners taking the profit out of the company. ,所以，如果你唔想返工 幫人賺錢 你可能好似我噉 好憎資本主義 
"They each pay in about 1,000 dollars over time in order to gain ownership, and now they own their job. ",好諷刺，因為我係資本家 
"Now, there's hundreds of more examples of companies like this springing up all across the country. ",（笑聲） 我擁有一家小型企業 喺康普頓嘅 Rco 車呔回收公司 
"And I'm so inspired by what they're doing, because it really represents an alternative to the type of economy we have now, which exploits all of us. ",幾年前，我睇過范瓊斯寫嘅一本書 裡面講：「我哋應該喺貧窮社區 創造綠領工作機會。」 我好認真對待佢呢番話 
"It also represents an alternative to waiting around for big investors to bring chain stores, or big-box stores to our communities, because honestly, those types of developments, they steal resources from our communities. ",於是我同人創立 擁有同經營一間車呔回收公司 我以我哋嘅成就為傲 
"They put our mom-and-pop shops out of business, they make our entrepreneurs into wage workers, and they take money out of our pocket and send it to their shareholders. ",目前為止，我哋回收咗一百萬磅橡膠 
"So, I was so inspired by all these stories of resistance and resilience that I got together with a few people here in Los Angeles, and we created LUCI. ",將二千一百萬加侖嘅廢油 從垃圾崗回收去咗新產品度 
"LUCI stands for the Los Angeles Union Cooperative Initiative, and our objective is to create more worker-owned businesses here in Los Angeles. ",（歡呼聲） 我哋請咗大概十五名員工 多數係有色人種 多數有案底 我哋俾嘅人工多過法定最低工資 而且我哋好自豪 係美國鋼鐵工人聯合會嘅會員 
"So far, in the last year, we've created two: Pacific Electric, an electrical company, and Vermont Gage Carwash, which is right here in South-Central, some of you guys might be familiar with it. ",（掌聲） 到目前為止，Rco 唔係合作社 
"This long-time carwash is now owned and operated by its 20 workers, all of whom are union members as well. ",而係一家服務社區嘅私有公司 不過，我希望佢成為一家合作社 
"(Applause) So you might be wondering why the focus on union-worker ownership, but there's a lot of good reasons why the labor movement is a natural ally to the worker-ownership movement. ",仲希望佢哋會炒咗個老細 即係我 
"To build these companies that we want in our community, we need a few things. ",（笑聲） 我話俾你知點解 先講吓我哋係點開始 
"We're going to need money, people and training. ",有好多人問： 「Rco 係點嚟嘅呢？」 
Unions have all of those things. ,老實同你講 
"America's working class has been paying union dues for decades, and with it, our unions have been building dignified, decent, and democratic workplaces for us. ",我利用咗我嘅白人特權 
"However, union jobs are on the steep decline, and it's time for us to start calling on our unions to really bring all of their financial and political capital to bear in the creation of new, union, living-wage jobs in our communities. ",我點用白人特權呢？ 
"Also, union halls are full of union members who understand the importance of solidarity and the power of collective action. ",我嘅白人阿婆 1918 年 喺阿肯色州一個家族種植園度出世 
"These are the types of folks that want more union businesses to exist, so let's build them with them. ",因為石油業好旺，佢同佢爹哋 就搬咗去西部 
"Learning from our unions, learning from our past, learning from our peers, are all going to be very important to our success, which is why I'd like to leave you with one last example and a vision for the future ... ",太公做過各種石油工會裡邊嘅工 係我黑人太爺仲在生時 絕對冇得做嘅工 
"and that vision is Mondragon, Spain. ",我外婆做咗一名理髮師 然後同我阿公摞到 當時黑人絕對摞唔到嘅貸款 喺羅省西部起咗間屋住 
"Mondragon, Spain is a community built entirely around worker cooperatives. ",我阿公過咗身之後 我外婆仲可以繼續住喺嗰度 因為佢有阿公嘅 政府撫恤金同醫療福利 喺 20 世紀 60 年代 通過嘅反歧視法之前 黑人係冇相同嘅權益 
"There's 260-plus businesses here, manufacturing everything from bicycles to washing machines to transformers. ",之後 30 年 （即 90 年代） 我畢咗業 想自己創業 即使我成身債， 得一張信用卡 而且對車輪行業冇任何認識同經驗 
"And this group of businesses now employs 80,000 people and earns more than 12 billion euros in revenue every year. ",但係我有一樣好多人都冇嘅嘢 
And all of the companies there are owned by the people that work in them. ,我有個乾淨、安全、唔使錢嘅地方住 
They've also built universities and hospitals and financial institutions. ,我搬咗去同我阿婆住 我可以租到我哋嘅第一間倉庫 買我哋嘅第一部貨車 出糧俾我哋嘅第一批員工 因為我唔使擔心要自己出錢 因為我唔使養自己 因為我係代代白人特權嘅直接受益人 
"I mean, imagine if we could build something like this in South-Central. ",我講呢個白人特權嘅故事，係因為 好多人時常話 「我哋想要多啲好似你噉嘅公司。 
The late mayor of Jackson had a similar idea. ,我哋想要多啲 Rco。 我哋想要多啲黑人擁有嘅企業， 女人帶領嘅、三重底線嘅 『禁止查問（有冇犯罪紀錄）』嘅 綠色廠商。」 
"He wanted to turn his entire city into a Mondragon-like cooperative economy, calling his ambitious plan ""Jackson Rising."" ",不過我哋要問一下 啲財富喺邊度嚟嘅呢？ 
"And when I look at Mondragon, I see really what working-class people can do for ourselves when we work together and make decisions for ourselves and each other and our communities. ",啲錢喺邊度嚟嘅呢？ 
"And what's really incredible about Mondragon is that while we are dreaming about them, they are dreaming about us. ",喺我哋嘅社區創業 本錢喺邊度嚟嘅呢？ 
"This community in Spain has decided to launch an international initiative to create more communities like it all over the world, by linking up with unions, by supporting organizations like LUCI, and by educating folks about the worker-ownership model. ",我嘅白人親戚係度賺錢時 佢哋用咗好多方法 包括喺經濟上排斥黑人 來得到創業 同賺錢嘅機會 
"Now, here's what you can do to be a part of it. ",因為種族主義同資本主義係好兄弟 （笑聲） 既係話，我哋問： 「我哋嘅社區點解咁窮？」嗰時 我哋窮唔淨係因為我哋窮 我哋冇錢係有原因 
"If you're a union member, go to your union meetings, and make sure that your union has a worker-ownership initiative, and become a part of it. ",明白歷史背景真係好重要 
"If you're an entrepreneur, if you have a small business, or you're interested in starting one, then link up with LUCI or another organization like us to help you get started on the cooperative model. ",我哋嘅歷史仲有另一個故事 
"If you're a politician, or you work for one, or you just like talking to them, please get the city, state, federal and county legislation passed that we need in order to fund and support worker-owned businesses. ",有本好書，叫做《集體勇氣》 講成千上萬嘅美國黑人係點樣 唔使用好多錢 建立咗企業、學校 醫院、農業合作社 銀行、同金融機構 一個完整嘅社區同獨立嘅經濟體系 
"And for everybody else, learn about our history, learn about our models, and seek us out so can support us, you can buy from us, invest in us, lend to us and join us, because it's really going to take all of us in order to build the more just and sustainable and resilient economy that we want for ourselves and our children. ",佢哋之所以成功，係因為佢哋齊心合作 利用公有資產 互相信任 團結一致 而唔係不擇手段咁牟利 
"And with that, I would like to leave you with a quote from Arundhati Roy, and she writes ... ",佢哋唔使等娛樂圈同體育明星 帶啲錢返嚟社區 
"Our strategy should not be only to confront Empire, but to lay siege to it. 
To deprive it of oxygen. 
To mock it. 
To shame it. 
With our art, our literature, our music, our brilliance, our joy, our sheer relentlessness -- and our ability to tell our own stories. 
Not the stories that we're being brainwashed to believe. 
The corporate revolution will collapse if we refuse to buy what they're selling -- their ideas, their version of history, their wars, their weapons, their sense of inevitability. 
Because know this: They be few and we be many. 
They need us more than we need them. 
Another world is not only possible, she's on her way. 
And on a quiet day, I can hear her breathing. ",不過，如果你係娛樂圈或者體育明星 又喺度聽緊我講嘢 歡迎你隨時帶啲錢返嚟 
Thank you. ,（笑聲） 佢哋成功係透過合作經濟 因為佢哋知道 資本主義永遠都唔會喺經濟上解放黑人 
(Applause) ,呢本書有好多好正嘅例子 我建議大家讀呢本書 因為佢解答咗我之前嘅問題 就係問我哋想創立嘅理想企業 需要嘅本錢喺邊度 
,答案就係喺合作經濟嗰度 
Cities are like siblings in a large polygamous family. ,合作經濟形式都有好多種 
Each one has a unique personality and is headed in a distinct direction. ,今日我淨係講工人所有制 
But they all have somewhat shared origins. ,你可能未聽講過工人所有制 佢喺近百年嘅黑人經濟解放 有好大嘅作用 而且喺世界各地都有成效 
"Sometimes I think postcolonial cities are like the children of the two least-favorite wives, who are constantly being asked, ""Ah, why can't you be more like your sister?"" ",你可能聽過黑人華爾街 或者聽過薩帕塔民族解放軍 不過我嚟畀個近期啲，本國嘅例子 
"(Laughter) The ""why"" of cities is largely the same, no matter where they are: an advantageous location that makes trade and administration possible; the potential for scalable opportunities for the skilled and unskilled alike; a popular willingness to be in constant flux and, of course, resilience. ",宜家，喺南布朗克斯 有全國最大嘅工人擁有公司 
"The ""how"" of cities, however, is a whole other story. ",佢叫做居家護理夥伴合作社 由黑人同拉丁裔人創立 出嘅糧真係夠員工生活 員工個個可以做全職 佢哋作為服務行業雇員國際工會成員 有福利同退休金 
How are they run? ,佢哋每年公司分紅 人人有份 幾乎年年都有 
How do they grow? ,佢哋能夠享受自己嘅工作成果 因為佢哋炒咗個老細 
How do they decide who belongs and who doesn't? ,冇巨額投資人 
Lagos is my home. ,冇中飽私囊嘅 行政總裁或者業主 
"You can always find the Nigerians by following the noise and the dancing, right? ",每個人要分期畀總共一千蚊 先至入到股 佢哋宜家自己做老細 
"(Laughter) Like any major city, that place is a lot of things, many of which are highly contradictory. ",喺全國各地 有成百上千嘅例子 
"Our public transportation doesn't quite work, so we have these privately owned bright yellow buses that regularly cause accidents. ",我受佢哋嘅故事啟發 因為呢個模式真係可以取代 我哋現有嘅經濟制度 一個剝削我哋嘅經濟制度 
Luxury car showrooms line badly maintained and often flooded roads. ,佢又可以取代 巨額投資人，同喺我哋嘅社區 嘅連鎖店或者大商店 因為老實講，宜家嘅發展模式 喺度偷我哋社區嘅資源 
Street evangelism is only slightly less ubiquitous than street harassment. ,佢哋使家庭式小商店倒閉 將可以成為企業家嘅人變成廉價工 從我哋嘅褲袋 攞錢去佢哋嘅股東 
"Sex workers sometimes have two degrees, a bank job and a prominent role in church. ",所以呢啲抵抗同變通嘅故事啟發咗我 我喺羅省同一班人 創立咗 LUCI 
"(Laughter) On any given day, there can be either a party or a burned body in the middle of a street. ",即係：羅省工會合作社主動計劃 我哋嘅目的係 喺羅省創造更多工人擁有嘅企業 
"There is so much that is possible in Lagos and so much that isn't, and very often the difference between possibility and impossibility is simply who you are, and if you're lucky enough, who you're connected to. ",我哋上年已經喺羅省中南部 創立咗兩間企業 太平洋電力公司同埋 佛蒙特結志洗車場 在座幾位可能都聽過佢 
"Belonging in Lagos is a fluid concept determined by ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender, but most visibly and often most violently, class. ",呢家洗車場由 20 名工人擁有同運作 佢哋亦係工會會員 
"Before Nigeria became a country, fisherpeople from the inland creeks started to come down the Lagos lagoon and establish villages along the coast. ",（掌聲） 你可能會諗 點解將重點放喺工會工人所有制個度 因為勞工運動同工人所有制運動 相輔相承，理由有好多 
"About 60 years later, my grandfather, Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi, also arrived in Lagos. ",喺我哋嘅社區建立呢種公司 我哋需要幾樣嘢 
"Like me, he was an alumnus of the University of Ibadan, a young member of the educated elite in the independence era. ",金錢、人手、同培訓 
"Over time, he built an illustrious career as a land surveyor, mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods when they were just waist-high wild grass. ",嗰啲嘢工會都有 
He died when I was nine. ,美國嘅工人階級已經交工會會費 交咗幾十年喇 通過收費，工會為我哋建造 有尊嚴嘅、似樣嘅、民主嘅工作場所 
"And by that time, my family, like the families of those fisherpeople, knew Lagos as home. ",但係，工會工宜家少咗好多 宜家係時候叫我哋嘅工會 用佢哋所有嘅財務同政治資本 支持我哋嘅社區創建 新嘅同俾夠生活工資嘅工作 
"Among the Yoruba, we have a saying, ""Èkó gb’olè, ó gb’??l?,"" which can be translated to mean that Lagos will welcome anyone. ",仲有，好多工會 明白團結嘅重要性同埋 集體行動嘅力量 
But that saying is becoming less and less true. ,佢哋想有多啲工會企業 我哋應該同佢哋合作 
"Many Lagosians, including the descendants of those fisherpeople who arrived generations before my grandfather, are now being pushed out to make room for an emergent city that has been described as ""the new Dubai."" ",從工會 從過去嘅歷史 從我哋嘅同儕個度學嘢 都係我哋成功嘅關鍵 所以我想送畀大家最後一個例子 亦係我對未來嘅願景 
"You see, Lagos inspires big dreams, even in its leaders, and successive governments have declared aspirations towards a megacity where poverty does not exist. ",西班牙嘅蒙德拉貢 
"Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the eradication of poverty as you would expect, the strategy of choice focuses on eliminating the poor. ",蒙德拉貢係一個佢所有嘅公司都係 工人合作社嘅社區 
"Last October, the Governor announced plans to demolish every single waterfront settlement in Lagos. ",嗰度有 260 幾個企業 乜都生產，由單車到洗衣機到變壓器 
"There are more than 40 of these indigenous communities all over the city, with over 300,000 people living in them. ",呢批企業現時僱用八萬人 每年有超過一百二十億歐元嘅收益 
"Otodo Gbame, a hundred-year-old fishing village with a population about three-quarters that of Monaco and similar potential for beachfront luxury -- (Laughter) was one of the first to be targeted. ",嗰度所有嘅公司都係工人擁有制 
I first heard of Otodo Gbame after the demolition started. ,佢哋自己起埋大學、醫院、同金融機構 
"When I visited in November 2016, I met Magdalene Aiyefoju. ",如果我哋喺羅省中南部 建立類似嘅社區，有幾咁好 
"She is a now-homeless woman whose surname means, ""the world is blind."" ",已故前積臣市市長亦有噉嘅諗法 
"Magdalene's son Basil was one of over 20 people who were shot, drowned or presumed dead in that land grab. ",佢想將成個城市變成好似蒙德拉貢咁 將呢個宏偉嘅計劃叫做「積臣興起」 
"Standing outside her shelter, I saw the two white-sand football fields where Basil used to play. ",我睇見蒙德拉貢時 我好似見到我哋工人攜手合作 為自己、為彼此 為我哋嘅社區作出決定 我哋能夠成功嘅 
"Spread all around us were the ruins of schools, churches, a primary health center, shops, thousands of homes. ",蒙德拉貢最正嘅地方係 我哋夢想變成佢哋時 佢哋有諗住我哋 
"Young children enthusiastically helped to put up shelters, and about 5,000 of the residents, with nowhere else to go, simply stayed put. ",呢個西班牙嘅社區 決定推出一項國際倡議 喺世界各地創立多啲類似嘅社區 方法包括同工會聯手 支持LUCI 咁樣嘅組織 同埋畀更多人認識工人所有制 
"And then in April, state security personnel came back. ",你想參與，就應該做呢啲嘢 
"This time, they cleared the community out completely, with beatings, bullets and fire. ",係工會會員要去工會開會 確保工會有一項工人所有制嘅倡議 然後報名參加呢個項目 
"As I speak, there are construction crews preparing Otodo Gbame's beaches for anyone who can afford a multi-million-dollar view. ",係企業家嘅 仲擁有小企業嘅 又或者有興趣開創業嘅人 歡迎你同 LUCI 或類似組織聯手 嚟開間合作社 
"The new development is called ""Periwinkle Estate."" ",如果你係一名政客 或者你為一名政客打工 又或者你鍾意聯絡政客嘅話 請支援市級、縣級、州級、同聯邦級 相關法案嘅通過 嚟資助同支持工人擁有嘅企業 
"Forced evictions are incredibly violent and, of course, unconstitutional. ",至於在座嘅其他人 多學下我哋嘅歷史同經濟模式 多揾下我哋嘅企業，多多支持我哋 你可以參加、幫襯、投資同借貸畀我哋 因為要建立一個我哋同仔女想要嘅 更公平、更有持續性 更有適應能力嘅經濟制度 需要我哋所有人嘅力量去實現 
"And yet, they happen so often in so many of our cities, because the first thing we are taught to forget about poor people is that they are people. ",講到呢度 我最後想引用阿蘭達蒂．洛伊嘅文字： 
"We believe that a home is a thing a person absolutely has a right to, unless the person is poor and the home is built a certain way in a certain neighborhood. ",「我哋嘅策略唔單只要對抗帝國， 仲要包圍佢， 
"But there is no single definition of the word ""home."" ",使到佢冇氣唞， 
"After all, what is a slum besides an organic response to acute housing deficits and income inequality? ",要諷刺佢， 
And what is a shanty if not a person making a home for themselves against all odds? ,要羞辱佢。 
"Slums are an imperfect housing solution, but they are also prime examples of the innovation, adaptability and resilience at the foundation -- and the heart -- of every functional city. ",用我哋嘅藝術、 我哋嘅文學、 我哋嘅音樂、 我哋嘅才華、 我哋嘅喜樂、 我哋嘅鍥而不捨、 同我哋敘述自己故事嘅能力， 
You don't need to be the new Dubai when you're already Lagos. ,而唔係重覆用來洗我哋個腦嘅故事。 
"(Applause) We have our own identity, our own rhythm, and as anyone who knows Lagos can tell you, poor Lagosians are very often the source of the city's character. ",假如我哋抵制公司制度， 包括佢哋嘅主意、 佢哋所篡改嘅歷史、 佢哋嘅戰爭、 佢哋嘅武器、 佢哋嘅必然感， 公司制度就會崩潰。 
"Without its poor, Lagos would not be known for its music or its endless energy or even the fact that you can buy an ice cold drink or a puppy through your car window. ",因為你要知道： 佢哋人少，我哋人多。 
"(Laughter) The conditions that cause us to define certain neighborhoods as slums can be effectively improved, but not without recognizing the humanity and the agency of the people living in them. ",佢哋需要我哋多過我哋需要佢哋。 
"In Lagos, where public goods are rarely publicly available, slum dwellers are often at the forefront of innovating solutions. ",另一個世界同制度唔單只係可能， 佢都就嚟到喇。 
"After being disconnected from the grid for months because the power company couldn't figure out how to collect bills, one settlement designed a system that collectivized remittances and got everyone cheaper rates into the bargain. ",冇聲嘅時候 我聽到佢唞氣。」 
Another settlement created a reform program that hires local bad boys as security. ,多謝大家 
"They know every trick and every hideout, so now troublemakers are more likely to get caught and reported to police and fewer of the youth end up engaging in criminal activity. ",（掌聲） 
"Yet another settlement recently completed a flood-safe, eco-friendly communal toilet system. ",
Models like these are being adopted across Lagos. ,唔同嘅城市就好似 同父異母嘅兄弟姊妹 
Informal settlements are incorrectly named as the problem. ,個個有獨特嘅性格同發展方向 
"In fact, the real problems are the factors that create them, like the entrenchment of poverty, social exclusion and state failures. ",但係佢哋有共同嘅起源 
"When our governments frame slums as threats in order to justify violent land grabs or forced evictions, they're counting on those of us who live in formal housing to tacitly and ignorantly agree with them. ",有時我覺得後殖民城市 就好似兩個最唔受寵嘅妾侍 生嘅細路一樣 時時俾人問： 「你點解唔學下人呢？」 
"Rather, we must remind them that governments exist to serve not only those who build and live in luxury homes, but also those who clean and guard them. ",（笑聲） 無論地理位置，城市存在嘅理由 大致上係一樣： 為貿易同行政提供方便 畀有技術同冇技術工人發揮潛力嘅機會 推動社會演變 同埋加強社會抵禦逆境嘅能力 
"Our -- (Applause) our realities may differ, but our rights don't. ",但係，城市存在嘅方式 又係另外一回事 
"The Lagos state government, like far too many on our continent, pays lip service to ideas of inclusion, while acting as though progress can only be achieved by the erasure, exploitation and even elimination of groups it considers expendable. ",佢哋係點運作呢？ 
"People living with disabilities who hawk or beg on Lagos streets are rounded up, extorted and detained. ",佢哋係點發展呢？ 
"Women in low-income neighborhoods are picked up and charged with prostitution, regardless of what they actually do for a living. ",佢哋又點決定邊個可以立足 邊個要走人呢？ 
Gay citizens are scapegoated to distract from real political problems. ,拉哥斯係我嘅故鄉 
"But people, like cities, are resilient, and no amount of legislation or intimidation or violence can fully eliminate any of us. ",聽到噪音同舞樂聲 你就知道有尼日利亞人，係咪？ 
"Prostitutes, women and women who work as prostitutes still haven't gone extinct, despite centuries of active suppression. ",（笑聲） 同其他大城市一樣 拉哥斯有好多面 當中有幾面係自相矛盾 
"Queer Africans continue to exist, even though queerness is now criminalized in most parts of the continent. ",我哋嘅公共交通系統唔係咁得 於是我哋引入鮮黃色嘅私營巴士 但成日發生意外 
And I'm fairly certain that poor people don't generally tend to just disappear because they've been stripped of everything they have. ,豪華汽車陳列室隔籬 係保養惡劣同周時淹水嘅馬路 
"We are all already here, and that answers the question of whether or not we belong. ",喺街上嘅福音傳道同街頭嘅騷擾案 都一樣咁多 
"When those fisherpeople started to sail down the lagoon in search of new homes, it could not have occurred to them that the city that would rise up around them would one day insist that they do not belong in it. ",有啲性工作者 有兩個學位、有份工喺銀行 仲喺教會度好活躍添 
"I like to believe that my grandfather, in mapping new frontiers for Lagos, was trying to open it up to make room for other people to be welcomed by the city in the same way that he was. ",（笑聲） 喺任何一日 街頭上一係見到派對 一係見到燒燶嘅屍體 
"On my way here, my grandma called me to remind me how proud she was, how proud [my grandfather] and my mother would have been. ",喺拉哥斯，有好多事有可能 亦有好多事冇可能 好多時，可能同冇可能之間嘅差別 就睇你嘅身份、你嘅運氣 同埋人脈 
I am their dreams come true. ,能唔能夠喺拉哥斯立足有好多變數 譬如你嘅種族、性取向，同性別 不過最明顯同最強烈嘅因素係社會階層 
"But there is no reason why their dreams -- or mine, for that matter -- are allowed to come true while those of others are turned to nightmares. ",喺尼日利亞建國之前 嚟自內陸嘅漁民 開始遷移到拉哥斯潟湖 沿住岸邊起村莊 
And lest we forget: the minimum requirement for a dream is a safe place to lay your head. ,大約六十年後，我嘅爺爺 Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi 亦來咗拉哥斯 
"It is too late now for Basil, but not for Magdalene, not for the hundreds of thousands, the millions still under threat in Lagos or any of our cities. ",同我一樣，佢亦係伊巴丹大學嘅校友 係喺獨立時代 受過教育嘅年輕精英 
"The world does not have to remain blind to the suffering that is created when we deny people's humanity, or even to the incredible potential for growth that exists when we recognize and value all contributions. ",佢慢慢喺土地測量界創出成就 將生滿野草嘅爛地 規劃成繁榮嘅市區 
"We must hold our governments and ourselves accountable for keeping our shared cities safe for everyone in them, because the only cities worth building -- indeed, the only futures worth dreaming of -- are those that include all of us, no matter who we are or how we make homes for ourselves. ",佢過身嗰陣我先至九歲 
Thank you. ,嗰時，我嘅屋企人 就好似當初嘅漁民一樣 已經當拉哥斯係自己嘅家鄉 
(Applause) ,"我哋約魯巴人有句話： 「Èkó gb’olè, ó gb’ọ̀lẹ,」 可以翻譯為：拉哥斯歡迎任何人 "
,但係呢嗰句話越嚟越假 
I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. ,好多拉哥斯人 包括早過我爺爺好幾代 就來到拉哥斯嘅漁民嘅後裔 宜家正被趕走 因為一個就嚟成為「新杜拜」嘅城市 已經容唔落佢哋 
And I like to immerse myself in my topics. ,拉哥斯激發人有大夢想 甚至激發呢度嘅領袖 歷屆政府都有宏願 建立一個冇貧人嘅大城市 
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. ,唔好彩嘅係 政府嘅策略唔係幫窮人擺脫貧困 而係將窮人趕走 
And I see my life as a series of experiments. ,舊年十月，市長宣佈咗一啲計劃 要拆除拉哥斯 每一個沿岸嘅原住民貧民窟 
"So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago, I wrote an article called ""My Outsourced Life,"" where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India, to live my life for me. ",成個城市有超過四十個 噉樣嘅原住民社區 總共住咗三十幾萬居民 
"So, they answered my emails. ",Otodo Gbame 係一個擁有百年歷史嘅漁村 佢嘅人口大約係摩納哥嘅四分之三 而且有著開發成 摩納哥一樣豪華海濱城市嘅潛力 （笑聲） 佢係最先被拆除嘅目標 
They answered my phone. ,我第一次聽到 Otodo Gbame 嗰時 佢已經拆緊 
"They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories. ",我喺 2016 年 11 月去探訪嘅時候 識咗 Magdalene Aiyefoju 
"It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. ",佢宜家已經無家可歸 佢嘅姓氏意思係︰世界係盲嘅 
It was a wonderful experience. ,呢次抗議霸佔土地裡邊 有超過二十人 被射殺、浸死、或者被斷定死亡 其中包括 Magdalene Aiyefojue 嘅仔 Basil 
"More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called -- about radical honesty. ",我企喺佢嘅臨時棲身之所外邊 睇到 Basil 以前踼過嘅兩個白沙足球場 
"And this is a movement where -- this is started by a psychologist in Virginia, who says that you should never, ever lie, except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions. ",而周圍嘅學校、教堂、健康中心 商店同數以千計嘅房屋 已經變成廢墟 
"And, more than that, whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. ",細路仔好積極噉幫手搭臨時庇護所 大約五千名居民冇家可歸 亦冇處可走 
"So, I decided I would try this for a month. ",然後喺四月 州政府又派安全人員嚟 
This was the worst month of my life. ,呢次，佢哋打人、開槍，同放火 將全部人趕走曬 
(Laughter) I do not recommend this at all. ,就喺宜家，地盤工人正喺 Otodo Gbame 嘅海灘 起價值百萬嘅豪華海景屋 
"To give you a sense of the experience, the article was called, ""I Think You're Fat."" ",個新開發區叫「長春花豪宅區」 
"(Laughter) So, that was hard. ",呢種強硬同暴力嘅手段當然違反憲法 
"My most recent book -- my previous book was called ""The Know-It-All,"" and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending. ",但係呢種事件已經 喺太多嘅城市度發生 因為我哋第一件被洗腦嘅事就係︰ 窮人唔係人 
"(Laughter) It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it. ",我哋相信 除咗窮，或者起屋起得唔妥當之外 任何人都有權利擁有一間屋 
"But I love that one, because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb. ",但係「屋」嘅定義唔淨得一個 
"Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything. ",其實，貧民窟係咪就係 房屋短缺同收入唔平等咁簡單？ 
You can just Google it. ,簡陋乜唔係反映咗 窮人排除萬難幫自己起到間屋咩？ 
"So, I wasted some time there. ",貧民窟雖然唔係完美嘅住屋方案 但係有創新、適應力同韌力 呢三樣嘢 係每一個健全城市嘅核心 
"I love those experiments, but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible, ""The Year of Living Biblically."" ",我哋已經有拉哥斯嘞 所以就唔需要有第二個杜拜！ 
And I undertook this for two reasons. ,（掌聲） 我哋有自己嘅文化、自己嘅節奏 任何一個熟悉拉哥斯嘅人 都可以話畀你知 拉哥斯嘅窮人 係呢個城市嘅文化底蘊 
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. ,冇咗呢班窮人，拉哥斯就唔會有 遠近聞名嘅音樂 或者無限嘅活力 甚至冇人喺你嘅車窗 賣冰飲或者狗仔畀你 
"As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. ",（笑聲） 我哋可以幫手改善貧民窟環境 但係要認同裡邊嘅居民 同佢哋嘅自主權 
"(Laughter) So, not very. ",喺拉哥斯，公共資源通常好短缺 但貧民窟居民經常最先揾到解決辦法 
But I've become increasingly interested in religion. ,喺電力公司因為唔識收電費 就切斷供電幾個月嘅時候 一個貧民窟就集合每戶電費一次過交 仲幫大家爭取到更平嘅電費 
"I do think it's the defining issue of our time, or one of the main ones. ",另一個貧民窟聘用飛仔做保安 
And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him. ,因為飛仔最知壞人嘅路數 所以揾佢哋來捉賊最啱 而且仲會防止後生仔參與犯罪 
"So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible. ",仲有另一個貧民窟 近期完成咗一個又防水浸 又環保嘅廁所系統 
"The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism, and people who say they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls, as high as 45 or 50 percent of America. ",拉哥斯其他地區亦都開始採用呢個系統 
"So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally? ",非正式嘅貧民窟被視為係問題 
"I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally, without picking and choosing. ",事實上，問題嘅因由 先至係真正嘅問題 譬如根深蒂固嘅貧困問題 社會上對窮人嘅排斥 同埋國家功能嘅喪失 
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles. ,但我哋嘅政府將貧民窟當成係威脅 繼而強行搶佔窮人土地或強迫窮人遷移 但為咗合理化成件事 政府會叫我哋默許佢哋嘅所作所為 
I had Christian bibles. ,反之，我哋要提醒政府 唔應該只為起豪宅同住豪宅嘅人服務 政府亦應為 負責豪宅清潔同保安嘅人服務 
I had Jewish bibles. ,我哋嘅—— （掌聲） 我哋家境可能唔同 但係我哋嘅權利冇唔同 
"A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible, where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, ""The Lord is all that,"" as opposed to what I knew it as, ""The Lord is my shepherd."" ",拉哥斯州政府就好似非洲太多嘅政府噉 口口聲聲話包容 但係行動上就只會驅趕、剝削 甚至消滅一班認為可以犧牲嘅人 而取得所謂嘅進步 
"Then I went down and I read several versions, and I wrote down every single law that I could find. ",靠喺拉哥斯街頭兜售或 乞食維生嘅殘疾人士 被圍捕、勒索同拘留 
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules. ,住喺窮區嘅女性 不論佢哋嘅職業 都會被逮捕同被控賣淫 
"And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply. ",同性戀市民成為政治上 用來分散注意力嘅替死鬼 
So I wanted to follow those. ,但係人，就好似城市一樣 都有韌力 再多嘅立法、恐嚇同暴力 都唔會將我哋完全消滅 
"And actually, I take my projects very seriously, because I had twins during my year, so I definitely take my projects seriously. ",妓女、婦女，做妓女嘅女性 經過幾百年嘅壓制都仲未絕種 
But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible. ,即使非洲大部份地方將同性戀視為罪行 同性戀非洲人依然存在 
"There is the law in Leviticus, ""You cannot shave the corners of your beard."" ",我好肯定窮人唔會俾趕盡殺絕 
"I didn't know where my corners were, so I decided to let the whole thing grow, and this is what I looked like by the end. ",我哋嘅存在足以講明邊個屬於呢度 
"As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security. ",嗰啲漁民來到潟湖下游 搵新嘅地方落腳時 佢哋可能都諗唔到 呢個城市發展之後 會唔再認佢哋屬於呢度 
(Laughter) My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. ,我諗我爺爺喺度劃定拉哥斯嘅新邊界時 佢係想將個城市開放 來歡迎其他人來遷入 就好似佢曾經俾歡迎佢咁 
"So, certainly the challenge was there. ",喺我嚟呢度嘅路上 我嘅嫲嫲打電話畀我 同我講佢以我為傲 話如果我爺爺同媽咪仲在世嘅話 佢哋亦會以我為榮 
"The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers, so I thought, ""Sounds strange, but I'll try it."" ",因為我實現咗佢哋嘅夢想 
You only know if you try it. ,但係冇理由 佢哋同我可以實現夢想 而其他人嘅夢想就變成噩夢 
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts. ,我哋冇忘記： 冇落腳嘅地方就冇實現夢想嘅地方 
"The Bible says that if two men are in a fight, and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man, then her hand shall be cut off. ",對於 Basil 嚟講呢個已經太遲 但係對於 Magdalene 來講 對於數十萬、數百萬喺拉哥斯人 同其他城市裡邊 受到同樣威脅嘅人嚟講 仲未太遲 
"So, I wanted to follow that rule. ",呢個世界需要正視 我哋唔當窮人係人時 窮人所受嘅苦難 同埋需要正視 人人都可以貢獻嘅潛力 
"(Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip. ",我哋必須要求政府同埋自己 對城市裡面每一個人嘅安居負責 因為唯一值得建造嘅城市 又或者唯一可以講夢想嘅將來 就係會唔理身份 生活方式同經濟情況 去包容我哋所有人 
"(Laughter) So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. ",多謝大家 
"I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging. ",（掌聲） 
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging. ,
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. ,我想同大家講一啲關於我喜歡寫作嘅題材。 
"You know, I could spend a year not killing, but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying -- you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist, so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it. ",我都喜歡完全投入咁地研究我嘅題目。 
"But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress, because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts. ",我奮不顧身咁投入去仲變成白老鼠。 
"This was one of the huge lessons of the year, is that I almost pretended to be a better person, and I became a little bit of a better person. ",我當自己嘅人生係一連串嘅實驗。 
"So I had always thought, you know, ""You change your mind, and you change your behavior,"" but it's often the other way around. ","係咁嘅，先幾年我幫Esquire 雜誌社打工, 我曾經寫過一篇文章名叫做""我嘅外判生活"" 我係印度嘅Bangalore僱用咗一隊人 嚟替我生活。 "
"You change your behavior, and you change your mind. ",所以佢地替我回覆電郵。 
"So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate. ",佢地替我聽電話。 
"You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause. ",佢地幫我同老婆鬧交，幫我講故仔比個仔聽。 
"So, it really was cognitive psychology -- you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing. ",依個係我人生中最美好嘅一個月。 因為我只須要好悠閒咁坐底睇書同睇電影。 
"The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology, very primitive cognitive psychology. ",係一個美好嘅體驗。 
"In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier, which, as we know, is actually true. ",最近我幫Esquire 雜誌寫咗一篇文章叫做-- 有關徹底的誠實。 
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America. ,依個係一場行動-- 由一個在維珍尼亞州嘅心理學家所開始嘅。 佢話人永遠永遠唔可以講大話。 除咗玩卑牌同打高爾夫球例外。 
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. ,除此之外，當你個腦諗到任何嘢 應該大聲講出來。 
"(Laughter) But it's a big part of the Bible, so I figured I had to address it. ",我決定嘗試參加一個月。 
"So, I was able to stone one adulterer. ",依個係我人生中最差嘅一個月。 
"It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner. ",（笑聲） 我完全唔建議大家去試。 
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. ,我咁講你就會明白， 依編文章叫＂我覺得你好肥＂。 
"And this man came up to me and he said, ""Why are you dressed like that?"" ",（笑聲） 所以係好困難嘅。 
"And I explained my project, and he said, ""Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"" ","我最近出咗一本書叫""全部都知道"" 書中講述我用咗一年時間去睇大英百科全書 由A至Z去讀，為咗知道世界上所有嘅事。 仔細來講係從A-ak(一種東亞音樂)開始， 一路到Zwyiec,係一種...我唔想搞壞演講嘅結尾。 "
"And I said, ""Well, that would be great!"" ",（笑聲） 這是一個令人興奮嘅結尾，好似一本O.Henry嘅小說，所以我唔想搞壞佢。 
"(Laughter) And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks, hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles -- but he grabbed them out of my hand. ",不過我好喜歡依種想法 因為依個實驗係研究到底人的腦袋 能容納多少資訊。 
"He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know. ",雖然，根據Kevin Kelly 所講，做人唔駛記咁多嘢。 
"But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry. ",你用Google就可以啦。 
"He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could -- eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him. ",所以我係果度因浪費咗一啲時間。 
"So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues. ",我鐘意個果啲實驗。 但我認為我做過嘅實驗當中最有意義， 最能改變我一生嘅， 就係我最近完成嘅實驗。我用咗一年時間， 去嘗試遵守聖經上的所有規條。 生活在聖經中的一年 
"How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places, and yet so incredibly wise in others? ",我做依個實驗係有兩個原因: 
How should we view the Bible? ,第一係因為係我成長過程中一直冇接觸任何宗教. 
"Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible? ",正如我書中所講，話我係猶太人 就好似Olive Garden被當成義大利餐廳一樣 
How was the Bible written? ,（笑聲） 因此，當然唔係咁樣。 
"And actually, since this is a tech crowd, I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. ",但我對宗教愈來愈有興趣， 
And it's sort of evolved. ,我覺得依個係這現世代裏具有決定性嘅話題。 又或者係具中一個重要嘅話題。 
It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. ,同時，我有一個仔。我想知道要點樣教佢。 
"So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. ",所以，我唔理三七二十一就開始按照聖經來生活。 
"The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally. ","第二個令我咁樣做嘅原因係因為 我十分關注原教旨主義嘅興起, 宗教上嘅原教旨主義，很多人聲稱 佢地完全依照聖經生活，根據訪問，竟然 佔了美國人口的45到50%. "
"This became very, very clear, early on. ",所以我決定睇吓，如果你係按照聖經字面上的意思過活嘅話，會發生什麼事？ 
"Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person, and stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example. ","我決定要遵守佢同佢邏輯上嘅推論, 按照聖經字面上所有指示, 不去揀擇。 "
"Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. ",我做的第一件事就係搵一疊聖經。 
(Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it. ,我有基督教嘅聖經。 
"But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month, and more than that, you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat. ",我有猶太教嘅聖經。 
"And my wife thought this was very offensive, so she sat in every seat in our apartment, and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around. ","我有朋友寄咗一本叫＂a hip-hop bibile""嘅書比我。 其中詩篇第二十三節變改為，＂主是所有事情。＂ 相對我知道嘅＂主是我的牧人。＂節然不同。 "
"So, you know, I met with creationists. ",我繼續讀咗幾個版本。 並寫低我找到的嘅有規條。 
I went to the creationists' museum. ,係一個好長嘅清單，多過七百條規則。 
And these are the ultimate literalists. ,"並且包含一啲有名嘅律法同一啲我曾經聽過嘅-- ""十戒""、""愛你的鄰人""、""多結果子和生養眾多""。 "
"And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all. ",因此我要遵守依啲規條。 
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist. ,我好認真咁執行依個計劃。 因為果年我生咗雙胞胎， 所以我確實認真的執行這計劃。 
It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. ,但係我都想遵守其他數百條 係聖經裏令人費解同模糊嘅規則 
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. ,係利未記中有一條規條， 你唔可以剃去你鬍鬚嘅角位。 
"And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous. ","我都唔知道邊度係我啲鬍鬚嘅角位， 所以我決定留鬍鬚, 依張係我最後嘅樣。 "
They really did a fantastic job. ,你可以想像到，我係機場保安關卡用咗好多時間。 
"If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. ",（笑聲） 我老婆係最後兩個月裏唔肯錫我。 
"So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy -- they did a great job. ",亳無疑問，難度就一定有嘅。 
(Laughter) Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. ,聖經裡面話你唔可以不著混合纖維嘅衫， 所以我諗，＂聽落好奇怪，但我都會試吓。＂ 
"And this one was a big lesson because I was praying, giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic. ",你要試過先會明白. 
"But I was saying thanks all the time, every day, and I started to change my perspective. ",我丟晒所有半尼龍半綿嘅T恤 
"And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day, that I didn't even notice, that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong. ",聖經話如果有兩個男人打架， 如果其中一方嘅老婆抓住另一個男人嘅睪丸， 佢隻手將會被砍。 
"So, this is actually a key to happiness for me, is to just remember when I came over here, the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs. ",所以，我想遵守依條規則。 
It's a remarkable thing. ,（笑聲） 我用咗一 個方法去遵守依條規則-- 就係唔好同一個有老婆企係隔離嘅男人打架 而且佢隻手睇起來好很有抓勁。 
"Third, that thou shall have reverence. ",（笑聲） 所以--奧，依張相係影我啲鬍鬚嘅 
"This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic, and by the end of the year, I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love. ",我覺得係出人意表嘅一年 因為佢真係改變咗我嘅一生仲好有挑戰性添。 
And I'm trying to start it as a movement. ,有兩種規條特別困難。 
"So, if anyone wants to join, the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God, there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness, and that our rituals can be sacred. ",第一係避免一啲我地平日皆犯嘅小錯 
The Sabbath can be sacred. ,你知道，我可以一年都唔殺生， 但係一年內不講人壞話，唔偷睇，不講大話-- 要知道，我住喺紐約市，我嘅工作喺記者， 所以我每日嘅生活有75至80%都要做依啲嘢 
"This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life. ",但喺都幾有趣，因為我得到一啲進步， 由於我唔相信 我嘅行為可以改變多少我的思想。 
"So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God. ","依樣喺我依一年內學到最寶貴嘅一課之一, 我幾乎扮成一個好人， 我變得好人了一點點。 "
Thou shall not stereotype. ,"我以前曾經咁諗，""你改變你嘅思想， 然後行為先至會改變"",但其實經常相反。 "
This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey. ,你改變你嘅行為，然後你改變你的嘅思想。 
I wanted it to be about religion in America. ,"所以，你知道嘅,如果你想變得更有同情心， 你去醫院探訪病人嘅話， 然後你就會變得富有同情心。 "
"So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish. ",你為某件事捐款， 然後你就放感情晌果度. 
I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness. ,所以，依啲其實喺認知心理學-- 你知道，認知失調 -- 我正在經歷。 
"(Laughter) After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, ""I gotta go."" ","聖經嘅內容實際上喺是關於認知心理學, 最基礎嘅認知心理學。 "
"(Laughter) Oh, thank you very much. ",喺箴言裡面講述，如果你笑的話，你會變得快樂， 人人都知，喺真實嘅。 
"Thank you. Bless you, bless you. ",第二種困難去遵守的規則喺， 果啲規則會為我們帶來小麻煩 在21世紀嘅美國。 
"But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance, evangelical Christianity, and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it. ",可能最清晰嘅例子喺是向通姦嘅人丟石頭。 
"There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians, and they focus on the red words in the Bible, which are the ones that Jesus spoke. ",（笑聲） 但喺依樣喺聖經裏面好大嘅一部分。 所以我想我一定要回應依個問題。 
That's how they printed them in the old Bibles. ,"所以,我真喺囉石頭丟一個通姦者。 "
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality. ,"件事喺咁發生嘅--我當時喺公園裏頭，著住一身聖經式嘅裝扮-- 涼鞋同白色的大袍-- 你知道，頭先講過因為外在會影響內在嘅情況下, "
"They have a pamphlet that says, ""Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,"" and you open it up, and there's nothing in it. ",我想知道依一身聖經嘅衣著可以點樣改變我嘅思想。 
"So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts, helping poor people. ",然後個男人走過來同我講， ＂點解你要著成咁樣？＂ 
"So, this was very inspiring to me. ",然後我向佢解釋我嘅的計劃， 然後佢話，＂我喺一個姦夫，咁你會用石頭丟我嗎？＂ 
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo. ,然後我話，＂好!這當然最好不過啦!＂ 
"They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree with much of what they say. ",（笑聲） 於是我喺我個袋裡面囉咗幾舊石頭， 我已經隨身攜帶咗了好幾星期， 希望一有機會就--當然，果啲喺細石頭-- 但係個男人搶咗我手上嘅石頭。 
"Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational. ",佢其實係一個七十多歲嘅老人家， 
"This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. ",不過佢仍然係一個姦夫，而且係好嬲果種， 
"And the thing is, if they're not harmful, they're not to be completely dismissed. ",他搶去了我的石塊。 然後投擲在我的臉中，當時我覺得我可以－ 以眼還眼，我可以報復，所以投擲一塊於他身上。 
"Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I was doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals, separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people ""Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"" ",所以，這是我投石的經驗，這容許我 去用較嚴肅的方法去談及這些重要的課題， 
"And they said, ""We don't know, but it's just rituals that give us meaning."" ",為什麼聖經在某方面能這樣的蠻不講理， 但又在某些地方充滿智慧 
"And I would say, ""But that's crazy."" ",我們應該怎樣看待聖經？ 
"And they would say, ""Well, what about you? ",我們應該是從原意出發， 像是一種Scalia(美國大法官)式的聖經？ 
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. ,聖經是怎樣寫成的？ 
"If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense, but that guy's crazy?'"" So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational. ",但其實，由於這是一個科技的集會， 我書中曾提到聖經其實令我想起了 維基百科，因為它是由各種各樣的作者和編輯編成 在這幾百年裏。 
"So the key is to choose the right rituals, the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed. ",它還某程度上進化了。 
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. ,它並不是一本隨天上掉下來的書。 
And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible. ,所以我想我最後會告訴你， 是一些易於記住的重要道理， 我在這一年學到的。 
And I failed miserably. ,第一，你不應該硬性地跟隨字面上去理解聖經的意思。 
Because you can't. ,這很早就已經顯然易見。 
You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. ,因為你這樣的話，你會變成一個瘋漢， 投石於姦夫，又或是，再多舉一個例子， 
The key is to pick and choose the right parts. ,"好的,這是另一個--我真的用了一點時間去牧羊。 "
"There's the phrase called cafeteria religion, and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way, and they'll say, ""Oh, it's just cafeteria religion. ",（笑聲） 這是一個很輕鬆的職業。我大力推介。 
"You're just picking and choosing."" ","但這條規則－聖經說你不能觸碰女人， 於每個月的某些日子，還有, 你不能坐在曾經被經期婦女坐過的椅子。 "
"But my argument is, ""What's wrong with cafeterias?"" ","我的妻子覺得這很侮辱女人, 所以她把我們家的每個座位都坐了一遍。 我要在那一年中站了不少時間。 直至我買給自己可以隨身攜帶的椅子。 "
I've had some great meals at cafeterias. ,"所以,你知道的,我遇到一個創世論者. "
I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. ,我去了他們的博物館， 
"So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well. ",他們是終極的字面跟隨者， 
"So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it. ",這真令人眼界大開，因為他們根本不是蠢人來的。 
And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. ,我賭他們的智商跟相信進化論的人一樣。 
There's me reading the Bible. ,只是他們有很強烈的信仰， 執著於聖經上的字面解釋 他們扭曲所有的數據以滿足他們的模式。 
That's how I hailed taxicabs. ,他們通過這些令人驚訝的心理訓練來做到這一點。 
"(Laughter) Seriously, and it worked. And yes, that was actually a rented sheep, so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day. ","然而我要說的是,這博物館很華麗。 "
"So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak. ",他們真的做得很好。 
,"如果你到過肯塔基州, 就是這--你可以去看關於大洪水的電影, 他們在天花板上裝灑水器 當播放到洪水畫面時便淋水在你身上. "
I was six when I had the first chance to learn what patience means. ,"所以,不管你怎樣看待創世論者,我覺得他們很荒誕, 他們做得很好。 "
"My grandmother gave me a magic box as a birthday present, which neither of us knew would become a gift for life. ",（笑聲） 另一個道理是該感恩。 
"I became obsessed with magic, and at 20, I became an amateur dove magician. ",這是重要的一課因為我在禱告時， 我在感恩禱告，這是一件對於無神論者而言很怪的事情。 
This act of magic requires that I train my doves to sit and wait inside my clothing. ,"但我每天常常都在感恩,任何時間, 我開始改變了自己看事情的角度， "
"As a young magician, I was always in a rush to make them appear, but my teacher told me the secret to the success of this magical act is to make my doves appear only after they've waited patiently in my tuxedo. ",而且我開始了解身邊數以百計的小事情， 那些如意的事情，那些小得我不會發覺的事。 我把他們的發生當作理所當然的--但不是把視線集中於 少數不如意的事情。 
"It has to be a mindful kind of patience, the kind that took me some years to master. ",所以，這是我快樂的秘訣， 只是去記得我來會場的途中， 車子沒有翻掉，我沒有在上樓梯時滑倒， 
"When life took me to Shanghai seven years ago, the mindful patience I learned became almost impossible to practice. ",這是一件精彩的事。 
"In China, where everyone and everything is in a hurry, you need to outperform over 1.3 billion other people to build a better life. ",第三，你要尊敬別人， 
"You hack the system, bend the rules, circumvent the boundaries. ","這個是出人意表的因為我這年開始的時候， 是一個不可知論者，到了年末， 我變成一個給朋友叫作尊敬的不可知論者,我十分喜愛這個名稱。 "
It is the same when it comes to food ... ,我現在嘗試將這個活動變為潮流. 
"except that when it comes to food, impatience can have dire consequences. ","所以如果大家想參加的話， 最基本的概念是，無論有沒有神的存在， 總有一些重要和美麗的神聖的想法, 而且我們的儀式是很神聖的。 "
"In the haste to grow more, sell more, 4,000 years of agriculture in a country of rich natural resources is spoiled by the overuse of chemicals and pesticides. ",安息日是很神聖的。 
"In 2016, the Chinese government revealed half a million food safety violations in just nine months. ","我這年其中一樣美好的事，就是守安息日, 因為我是個工作狂，當我有了這樣的一天， 當不能工作--真的大大改變了我一生。 "
"Alarmingly, one in every four diabetics in the world now comes from China. ","所以,這是神聖的概念，無論有沒有上帝也好. "
"The stories around food are scary and somewhat overwhelming, and I told myself it's time to bring a mindful patience into the impatience. ",你都不應把它公式化。 
"When I say mindful patience, I don't mean the ability to wait. ",這種體會是因為我 用了很多時間跟隨了不同的宗教團體， 在美國各地。因為我想它 不只是我個人的旅程。 
I mean knowing how to act while waiting. ,我想探討美國的宗教， 
"And so, while I wait for the day when a sustainable food system becomes a reality in China, I launched one of China's first online farmers market to bring local, organically grown produce to families. ",因此我用了不少時間在福音派基督教、哈西德教派和阿米希教派。 
"When we went live, 18 months ago, the food we could sell then was somewhat dismal. ",我感到自豪因為 我覺得我是美國唯一一個 能在宗教討論時說服到一個耶和華見證。 
"We had no fruit and hardly any meat to sell, as none that was sent to the lab passed our zero tolerance test towards pesticides, chemicals, antibiotics and hormones. ",（笑聲） 在三個半小時後，他看一看他的手表， 他說，＂我不得不走了。＂ 
I told our very anxious employees that we would not give up until we've met every local farmer in China. ,（笑聲） 謝謝大家。 
"Today, we supply 240 types of produce from 57 local farmers. ",謝謝。祝福你，祝福你。 
"After almost one year of searching, we finally found chemical-free bananas grown in the backyards of villagers on Hainan Island. ",但這是很有趣的， 因為我有一些先入為主的思想，例如， 福音派基督教，我發現， 這次一個很廣泛的運動， 是很難一概而論的。 
"And only two hours away from Shanghai, on an island that even Google Maps does not have coordinates for, we found a place where cows eat grass and roam free under the blue sky. ",我認識一隊人叫紅字基督徒， 他們集中研究在聖經裏的紅字， 那些是耶穌所說的話-- 
We also work hard on logistics. ,在舊聖經中都是以紅色印上去的。 
"We deliver our customers' orders in as fast as three hours on electric vehicles, and we use biodegradable, reusable boxes to minimize our environmental footprint. ",他們的論點是耶穌從來沒有講過同性戀。 
"I have no doubt that our offerings will continue to grow, but it will take time, and I know a lot more people are needed to shape the future of good food. ","他們有一本小冊子說著, 這是耶穌曾就同性戀所說的話, 然而你把它打開,發覺當中空白一片。 "
"So last year, I founded China's first food tech accelerator and VC platform to help start-ups to shape the future of good food the way they want, be that through using edible insects as a more sustainable source of protein or using essential oils to keep food fresh for longer. ",所以，他們說耶穌曾說過很多有關幫助被抛棄的人的事， 幫助窮人的事。 
"So, you may still ask: Why are you trying to build a sustainable food system by driving a patient movement in a country where it's almost a crime to take it slow? ",所以這對我有很大的啟發。 
"Because, for me, the real secret to success is patience -- a mindful kind of patience that requires knowing how to act while waiting, the kind of patience I learned with my grandmother's magic box. ","我會推介Jim Wallace 和Tony Campolo, "
"After all, we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors. ","他們是非常鼓舞人心的領袖,縱使我不認同, 他們多數的言論。 "
We borrow it from our children. ,"還有,你不可以忽略不理性的事情. "
Thank you. ,"這個發現令我驚訝非常,因為,你們知道, 我從科學化的角度中成長, 然而我十分震驚的發現我的生命 是由非理性的力量所操控. "
(Applause) ,"還有的是,就算那些力量不是有害的, 他們不可以完全去除的。 "
,因為我學會了，當我在想－ 我做了這些儀式，這些聖經上的儀式， 區分羊毛和麻布質料。 我問那些虔誠的人， ＂為什麼聖經要我們做這些東西？為什麼上帝會注意這些事情？＂ 
I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper. ,"他們會回答，＂我們不知道, 但這些儀式給與我們某些特定意義。＂ "
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change; and like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. ,我會說，＂這是不可理喻的。＂ 
They're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science. ,他們回答，＂那麼你又怎樣？＂ 
"Recently, the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. ",你吹熄了生日蛋糕上的蠟燭 
"They wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic, and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers from 113 countries. ","如果火星來的人看見,他會說 有一個人正在吹熄了生日蛋糕上的火光。 對比於一個不穿混合纖維衣服的人， 火星人會不會說，＂這個人很正常，＂ ＂但那個人是變態的嗎？＂ 不是，所以我覺得那些儀式在自然層面來說，是不理性的。 "
"It's a big community; such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world. ",所以重點是要挑選正確的儀式， 那些無害的儀式--但是儀式本身 他們不會給忽略的。 
"Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. ",最後，我學到了大家應該有所選擇。 
"Every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. ",我學了這個因為 我嘗是跟迶聖經中的所有的事， 
"For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño Oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I study. ",但我淒慘地失敗。 
"And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules. ",因為你不可以， 
"And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. ",所以你要挑選，任何人要遵守聖經的話， 也要挑選。 
It's a small organic molecule. ,重點在於挑選正確的部分。 
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene. ,"有一個詞彙叫做""自助餐式宗教"" 基本主義的人會把它視為有詆毀性般去使用。 他們會說，＂這只是自坐助餐式宗教。＂ "
"But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. ",你只是在挑你喜歡的東西。 
It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. ,但我的論點是，＂自助餐又有什麼問題呢？＂ 
"And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system. ",我在自助餐廳有吃得很開心的經驗。 
"Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing. ",亦曾遇到一些難吃得令人噴飯的 
We blow it up and look at the pieces. ,"所以，這是關於怎樣挑選聖經裡有關同情心的部分， 有關包容，有關愛你的近鄰， 跟反對＂同性戀等於罪＂ 又或是不寬容，或暴力, 在聖經裡也相當的多。 "
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. ,所以我們要在這本書找出任何意義， 我們必須全身投入，並且奮戰不懈。 
"Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car. ",我想臨走前多給大家幾個例子。 
"But still, we look at the pieces. ",這是我正在閱讀聖經. 
We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do. ,這是我如何招呼的士。 
"Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales. ","（笑聲） 認真的，而且有效的--且是的, 那其實是一只租來的羊, 所以我必須在早上歸還牠,但是牠整天都被好好的照顧。 "
"It takes weeks to perform our integrations, and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening. ","所以,無論如何,謝謝你們讓我來演講。 "
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. ,
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia -- there are others. ,六歲個陣我第一次知道人要有耐性 
"We found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene and other things while we were there. ",我嫲嫲畀咗我一個魔术盒作為生日禮物 但係我哋都唔知佢會成為我一生嘅恩赐 
"This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above, and the tower from below. ",我開始沉迷魔術 20 歲，我成為一名業餘白鴿魔術師 
On part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us. ,呢種魔術表演需要我訓練我嘅白鴿 籬喺我件衫裏面等待 
"And this plane, the model BAe-146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people, so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today. ",因為後生衝動 我成日都急於將白鴿放出嚟 但係我嘅老師話 魔術藝術成功嘅秘訣 就係等我嘅白鴿 喺燕尾服裏面夠曬耐性 先放出嚟 
But we didn't just fly it. ,要做到咁需要極大嘅耐性 我用咗好多年先至做到 
We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff. ,當七年前我嚟到上海 我學識嘅極大耐心幾乎冇用 
We have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements; we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering; we need special flight clearance. ,喺中國，任何人任何事都好急 你想過好啲嘅生活 就要比其他十三億人做得更好 
"As you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs; the scientists must be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while on board. ",咁就會有人做黑客，違法規則 遊走於法律嘅邊緣 
"So as you can imagine, the inside of the aircraft doesn't look like one you'd take on vacation. ",甚至食品行業都係咁 
It's a flying laboratory we took to make measurements of this molecule. ,但唔同嘅係 冇耐性對食品嘅影響不堪設想 
We do all this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. ,因為急於生產同銷售 呢個國家四千年嚟嘅豐富農耕資源 都因濫用化肥、殺蟲劑被破壞 
"And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject. ",2016 年，短短九個月間 中國政府就頒佈咗 成百萬條食品安全條例 
And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules. ,值得擔憂嘅係 依家世界糖尿病人有四分之一係中國 
"As a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection, of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others. ",有關食品嘅事件 駭人聽聞又發人深省 我覺得係時候要畀啲耐性 
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. ,我講嘅「耐性」 唔係指「等得起」 
So you can imagine the scale of the effort. ,而係指「等個時要做啲咩」 
"In each one of the assessments we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience. ",所以，喺等待中國可持續食品體系 真正建立個時 我成立咗中國最早嘅其中一間 提供本地有機食品嘅網上農貿商城 
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these. ,但十八個月前，開始運行個陣 我哋搵唔到可以賣嘅食品 
Thank you very much. ,因為我哋送去實驗室檢驗嘅食品 冇一個可以通過殺蟲劑、化學品 抗生素、激素嘅零容忍測試 所以我哋水果、肉類都唔賣得 
,我哋員工都好心急，我同佢哋講 喺尋遍中國嘅每位農夫之前 我哋都唔會放棄 
"So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says, ""Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"" ",依家，五十七位本地農夫 同我哋供應兩百四十種產品 
"And you say, ""I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street. ",經過差唔多一年嘅尋找 我哋卒之喺海南島村民嘅後院度 搵到咗冇施化肥嘅香蕉 
"This is 26th, that's 27th."" ",喺距離上海兩粒鐘路程 一個穀歌地圖都冇顯示嘅島 我哋搵到咗一個 牛喺藍天之下自在食草、遊蕩嘅地方 
"He says, ""OK, but what is the name of that block?"" ",同時我哋都努力做好配送 
"You say, ""Well, blocks don't have names. ",我哋用電動車 做到三小時內送貨 我哋用可降解、可循環利用嘅快遞盒 嚟儘量減小對環境嘅破壞 
"Streets have names; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets."" ",我好肯定我哋嘅業務範圍會繼續擴張 但需要假以時日 我都知道優質食品嘅美好未來 需要好多人嘅共同努力 
"He leaves, a little confused and disappointed. ",舊年，我成立咗中國第一個 食品科技孵化器同風險資本平臺 幫助創業者以佢哋希望嘅方式 去塑造優質食品嘅未來 比如將可食用昆蟲 作為一種更可持續嘅蛋白質來源 或者用香精油延長食品保鮮 
"So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan, you turn to a person next to you and say, ""Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"" ",我諗你哋都仲係想問 點解我要喺一個放慢就等於犯罪嘅國家 嘗試以極大嘅耐性 逐步建立一個可持續食品體系 
"They say, ""Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."" ",因為我覺得 成功嘅真正秘訣就係耐性 嗰種需要喺等待時 知道準備要做咩嘅 極大嘅耐性 嗰種嫲嫲嘅魔術盒教識我嘅耐性 
"And you say, ""OK, but what is the name of this street?"" ",畢竟，地球唔係我哋從祖先手上傳承嘅 
"And they say, ""Well, streets don't have names. ",而係我哋從後代手中借嚟嘅 
Blocks have names. ,多謝 
"Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. ",（掌聲） 
"All of these blocks have names, and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks. ",
"And you say then, ""OK, then how do you know your home address?"" ",今日我想同大家講下 你哋喺報紙上見到嘅頭條 背後所投入嘅科研程度 
"He said, ""Well, easy, this is District Eight. ",好似呢個氣候變化嘅頭條 仲有呢個同空氣質量 或者霞氣有關嘅頭條 
"There's Block 17, house number one."" ",佢哋係大氣科學嘅唔同分支 
"You say, ""OK, but walking around the neighborhood, I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."" ",近排嘅頭條就好似呢個 當政府個氣候變化專門委員會 簡稱 IPCC 提交對大氣系統了解程度嘅報告 呢份報告由來自 40 個國家 620 位科學家共同撰寫 
"He says, ""Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built. ",寫咗近一千頁嘅報告 而每一頁又經過另外 400 幾位 來自 113 個國家嘅科學家 同審稿人審核先至發表 
The first house ever built on a block is house number one. ,呢一個係龐大嘅團隊嚟 事實上，佢大到令我哋嘅年會 變成咗世界上最大嘅科學家會議 
The second house ever built is house number two. ,"其中每年有超過 15,000 名科學家 會去三藩市參加年會 "
"Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."" ",而每一位與會者都嚟自 其中一組研究團隊 每一組研究團隊致力研究 一系列不同課題 
"So, I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had, and realize that the opposite of them may also be true. ",對於我所在嘅劍橋團隊 研究範疇從影響天氣同氣候嘅 厄爾尼諾現象 到衛星數據嘅同化 以至製造生物燃料嘅農作物嘅氣體排放 ——亦係我嘅研究內容 
"So, for example, there are doctors in China who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy. ",而喺每一個研究領域之中有好多 我同其他博士研究生 都係研究非常狹小嘅課題 專門到一小部分進程或者某幾個分子 
"So, any month you are healthy you pay them, and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick. ",而我研究嘅其中一個分子係異戊二烯 
"(Applause) In most music, we think of the ""one"" as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four. ",就喺呢度。佢係一個好細嘅有機分子 你可能從來未聽過 
"But in West African music, the ""one"" is thought of as the end of the phrase, like the period at the end of a sentence. ",一個曲別針嘅重量大概相當於 900×10^21 大約 10 嘅 21 次方個異戊二烯分子 
"So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music: two, three, four, one. ",雖然輕若無物 每年釋放到大氣中嘅數量 卻足以抵得上全人類嘅重量 
And this map is also accurate. ,數量之大同甲烷嘅重量相當 
"(Laughter) There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India, the opposite is also true. ",正因為咁 佢對大氣系統有舉足輕重嘅影響 亦係呢個嘅影響 
"So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else, that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear, that the opposite may also be true. ",我哋竭盡全力去研究佢 我哋將佢分解爆破再研究所得嘅碎片 
Domo arigato gozaimashita. ,呢個係位於西班牙嘅 EUPHORE 煙霧艙 
,雖然呢度大氣爆炸或者完全燃燒要比 
"So, basically we have public leaders, public officials who are out of control; they are writing bills that are unintelligible, and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity, which has a dramatically negative impact on our life. ",私家車慢 1.5 萬倍 
"If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits; if you're trying to get a small business loan, you face a blizzard of paperwork. ",但我哋仍然會分析呢啲碎片 
"What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity, transparency and empathy, building humanity into communications. ",我哋用超级電腦做大量嘅模型演算 呢個係我做嘅嘢 
I've been simplifying things for 30 years. ,我哋嘅模型用上成千上萬個 超級電腦嘅櫃 每個負責計算幾百個 以一分鐘為單位嘅變量 
I come out of the advertising and design business. ,整合呢啲數據需要幾個星期時間 而我哋要做幾十種整合 來了解發生緊嘅情況 
"My focus is understanding you people, and how you interact with the government to get your benefits, how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with, and how you view brands. ",我哋仲飛到世界各地去搵呢種分子 
"So, very quickly, when President Obama said, ""I don't see why we can't have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."" ",最近我就同其他人去咗馬來西亞考察 
"So, I locked myself in a room, figured out the content, organized the document, and wrote it in plain English. ",我哋喺嗰度設立咗一個 「全球大氣瞭望塔」 佢位於熱帶雨林嘅中央 我哋喺嗰度懸掛咗 價錢高昂嘅嘅科學儀器 用來尋找異戊二烯同其他嘢 呢個係從天空望落雨林中間嘅瞭望塔 
I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country. ,呢個係由下至上嘅角度 我哋仲為呢次嘅考察配備咗飛機 
This is a real thing. ,型號係 BA146 屬於 FAAM（氣測量飛行設備公司） 
"Now, I went one step further and said, ""Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document? Let's go online."" ",通常可以運載 120 到 130 人 你哋今天可能係坐類似嘅機型嚟呢度 
And many people might need help in computation. ,但係，我哋唔單止飛 我哋仲喺樹冠上空 100 米飛 
"Working with the Harvard Business School, you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment: If you spent 62 dollars for a meal, the longer you take to pay out that loan, you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents. ",就係爲咗測量分子，不過亦係危險行為 
How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people? ,我哋需要以特殊嘅傾斜角度飛行 來進行測量 所以聘請咗軍事飛行員 同測試飛行員來操作飛機 我哋需要獲得特殊飛行許可 當環繞呢啲山谷彎位飛行時 重力可達2G 
But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. ,所以科學家必須全程扣上安全帶 先至能夠喺飛行期間做測量工作 正如你所想像嘅 
"And what about terms like ""over the limit""? ",呢架飛機嘅內部 同你哋度假坐嘅嗰啲完全唔一樣 佢係一個飛行中嘅實驗室 
Perhaps a stealth thing. ,我哋用佢來測量呢一種分子 
Define it in context. Tell people what it means. ,我哋所做嘅一切都係爲咗 了解個分子嘅化學性質 
"When you put it in plain English, you almost force the institution to give the people a way, a default out of that, and not put themselves at risk. ",當好似我咁樣嘅學生對個分子 有咗某種想法或者了解之後 佢哋會以此為題寫一篇科學論文 從嗰次考察裏面我哋大概可以 
Plain English is about changing the content. ,就住幾個過程或者分子 而去寫幾十篇論文 而當知識量建立起 
And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM. ,佢就會成為好似 IPCC 評估嘅 一個副章節，或者副副章節 
"It's a grid, it's a calendar. ",當然我哋仲有其他評估 喺 IPCC 報告嘅 11 個章節當中 每一章都有 6 到 10 個副章節 
"At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities, you have responsibilities. ",咁樣你就可以想像 其中需要付出嘅努力有幾多 
Received very favorably by business. ,喺我哋撰寫嘅每一份評估當中 都會包含一個摘要 摘要係寫畀冇科學背景嘅讀者嘅 
And there is some good news to report today. ,我哋將摘要提供畀記者同決策者 用來做咁樣嘅頭條 
"Each year, one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS. ",多謝 （掌聲） 
There are 200 million letters that go out. ,
"Running through this typical letter that they had, I ran it through my simplicity lab, it's pretty unintelligible. ",想像你正企喺美國一條大街上 一個日本人行埋嚟問你 「唔該，請問呢個街區叫咩名？」 
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible. ,然後你話︰「呃，呢邊呢條叫橡樹街， 嗰邊嗰條叫榆樹街。 
"We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English. ",呢邊係第26街，嗰邊係第27街。」 
"When I run it through my lab, this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible. ",佢問︰「好，但係呢個街區叫咩名？」 
And the IRS has introduced the program. ,你答︰「呃，街區無名啵。 
(Applause) There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention. ,街就有名， 街區只不過 係街道之間無名字嘅空間。」 
"There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency, how to mandate simplicity. ",他於是帶著疑惑與失望咁離開咗 
"It's incumbent upon us, and this organization, I believe, to make clarity, transparency and empathy a national priority. ",好，宜家想像你自己 正企喺日本一條街上 你向路人甲問︰ 「唔該，請問呢條街叫咩名？」 
There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. ,佢會回答：「喔，嗰個係十七街區， 呢個係十六街區。」 
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. ,然後你會問：「咁呢條街叫咩名？」 
"Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority. ",佢會答：「呃，街無名咖， 
(Applause) ,街區就有名。 
,睇下谷歌嘅地圖。 呢個係14街區，15街區，16街區， 17街區，18街區，19街區。 
The Philippines: an idyllic country with some of the clearest water and bluest skies on the planet. ,所以街區都有名。 街道只係街區與街區之間 無名字嘅空間。」 
It is also the epicenter of one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the world. ,然後你會問： 「好，咁你點知自己嘅住址？」 
"On the surface, it seems as if we are just a late bloomer. ",佢話︰「簡單啦，呢個係第八行政區， 
"However, the reasons for our current epidemic are much more complicated and may foreshadow a global resurgence of HIV. ",第17街區，一號房。」 
"While overall new cases of HIV continue to drop in the world, this trend may be short-lived when the next wave of more aggressive and resistant viruses arrive. ",你話︰「唔，但係當我周圍行嘅時候， 我留意到啲街號毫無規則嘅。」 
HIV has a potential to transform itself into a new and different virus every time it infects a cell. ,佢話：「當然有規則啦， 佢哋係跟住興建嘅時間而編排號碼。 
"Despite the remarkable progress we've made in reversing the epidemic, the truth is that we are just a few viral mutations away from disaster. ",喺呢個街區第一間興建嘅就係一號， 
"To appreciate the profound way in which HIV transforms itself every time it reproduces, let's make a genetic comparison. ",第二間興建嘅就係二號， 
"If we look at the DNA variation among humans of different races from different continents, the actual DNA difference is only 0.1 percent. ",第三間就係三號，如此類推。」 
"If we look at the genetic difference between humans, great apes, and rhesus macaques, that number is seven percent. ",因此，我哋需要 到世界嘅角落 去搵返嗰啲我哋無形中先入為主嘅諗法 同時認識到相反嘅觀點可能都係啱嘅 
"In contrast, the genetic difference between HIV subtypes from different patients may be as much as 35 percent. ",又例如，喺中國，有啲中醫 相信保持你嘅健康係佢哋嘅職責 
"Within a person infected with HIV, the genetic difference between an infecting mother virus and subsequent daughter viruses has been shown to be as much as five percent. ",所以，當你健康時，你要畀錢佢哋 但係當你病嘅時候 你就一分錢都唔使畀 因為你病係佢哋失職 佢哋因你健康而發財 而唔係因為病而發達 
"This is the equivalent of a gorilla giving birth to a chimpanzee, then to an orangutan, then to a baboon, then to any random great ape within its lifetime. ",（笑聲） 喺大部分音樂 我們都會認為第一拍係重拍： 
"There are nearly 100 subtypes of HIV, with new subtypes being discovered regularly. ",一，二，三，四 但係喺西非音樂中 第一拍會被視為音樂段落嘅完結 就似句子嘅句號 
HIV in the developed world is almost all of one subtype: subtype B. ,所以，你唔單止可以從段落聽到 而且可以從佢哋數拍子睇到呢種唔同： 二，三，四，一 
"Mostly everything we know and do to treat HIV is based on studies on subtype B, even though it only accounts for 12 percent of the total number of cases of HIV in the world. ",呢幅地圖同樣係精準嘅 
"But because of the profound genetic difference among different subtypes, some subtypes are more likely to become drug-resistant or progress to AIDS faster. ",（笑聲） 有句俗語講，任何有關印度嘅事實 佢哋嘅反面都同樣係真嘅 
We discovered that the explosion of HIV cases in the Philippines is due to a shift from the Western subtype B to a more aggressive Southeast Asian subtype AE. ,因此，唔好忘記 無論喺TED或者其他地方 嗰啲你諗到嘅，或者聽到嘅正嘅諗法 佢嘅反面都好有可能係同樣正確 
We are seeing younger and sicker patients with high rates of drug resistance. ,（日語）多謝曬 
"Initial encroachment of this subtype is already occurring in developed countries, including Australia, Canada and the United States. ",
We may soon see a similar explosion of cases in these countries. ,而家我哋嘅領袖同政府官員 都好似中咗毒咁 啲法案畀佢哋寫到極之難明 裏面嘅條款細則可以有成四萬幾頁紙咁多 複雜到極 兼且對我哋生活造成嚴重不便 
"And while we think that HIV is done and that the tide has turned for it, just like with real tides, it can come right back. ",試想像你係個退伍軍人 喺伊拉克或者越南打過仗 要拎援助金嘅話 要先填好曬面前成疊文件 如果你想借錢搞生意 同樣畀疊文件點到你暈 
"In the early 1960s, malaria was on the ropes. ",對住疊文件，我哋究竟有咩符？ 我認為一切從簡 可以令所有嘢變得清晰、透明、人性化 務求整個溝通模式可以返璞歸真 
"As the number of cases dropped, people and governments stopped paying attention. ",我三十年嚟就係喺度將啲嘢簡化 
The result was a deadly resurgence of drug-resistant malaria. ,我做廣告設計出身 
"We need to think of HIV not as a single virus that we think we've figured out, but as a collection of rapidly evolving and highly unique viruses, each of which can set off the next deadly epidemic. ",我好想去了解你哋 了解你哋點樣同政府溝通 去爭取你應有嘅權益 了解你哋點樣同企業打交道 揀同邊個做生意 
"We are incorporating more powerful and new tools to help us detect the next deadly HIV strain, and this needs to go hand in hand with urgent research on the behavior and proper treatment of non-B subtypes. ",兼了解你哋點樣睇品牌 當其時奧巴馬佢咁樣講： 「我哋啲信貸合約點解唔可以一頁紙過， 
We need to convince our governments and our funding agencies that HIV is not yet done. ,兼易睇易明嘅呢？」 之後，我就決定閉關 度好個內容，執靚個排版 用好淺顯嘅文字寫掂佢 
Over 35 million people have died of HIV. ,我搵咗美國做消費信貸最勁嘅 兩個律師校閱過 
We are on the verge of an AIDS-free generation. ,呢樣係千真萬確㗎 
We need to pay attention. ,之後，我進一步話： 「點解下下都要靠班法律顧問呢？ 點解文件硬係得印刷本嘅呢？ 
We need to remain vigilant and follow through. ,不如擺上網啦！」 我知好多人計數唔多掂 
"Otherwise, millions more will die. ",我哋同哈佛商學院合作嗰時 有個方案係關於最低還款額 幅圖寫住：假設你一餐飯洗咗 62 美金 而你每個月齋畀最低還款額嘅話 嗰 62 蚊就要拖更耐先還得清 最後仲要畀成 99 蚊 1 毫 7 仙 
Thank you. ,你覺得銀行會將實情話你聽咩？ 
(Applause) ,點都好，圖文並茂確實好得 實際過計晒畀你睇 
,再睇睇呢個詞語：「超過信貸額度」 
"When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school. ",睇落好隱晦咁 
"And as a special treat, he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands. ",嘗試解釋下，等人知點解 
"And there it was, the seat of human consciousness, the powerhouse of the human body, sitting in my hands. ",當你簡化條文 就等於要求銀行一定要向公眾開誠佈公 以防大家誤踩地雷 
"And that day I knew that when I grew up, I was going to become a brain doctor, scientist, something or the other. ",所謂淺顯易明，就係重組內容 
"Years later, when I finally grew up, my dream came true. ",要數我其中最自豪嘅 一定係 IBM 嘅一份協議 
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D. ,佢用嘅係方格、日曆 
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today. ,寫住邊月邊日 IBM 有某啲職責，你又有某啲職責 
"It is estimated that one in six children, that's one in six children, suffer from some developmental disorder. ",而家業界都好歡迎呢款設計 
This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments. ,我今日有好消息想分享下 
Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder. ,每年，每十個納稅人 就有一個收到國稅局嘅通知書 
But here's what really perplexed me. ,同類信件全國有成兩億幾封 
"Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain, most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior. ",喺我哋個「化繁為簡實驗室」入邊 我哋處理咗呢堆信件 發現內容認真難明 
"But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms, without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart. ",紅色嗰啲，全部都好難明 
It seemed so intuitive to me. ,我哋著手改造呢一千款信件 呢拃信件涵蓋咗佢哋七成轉帳 
"To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately, it would be necessary to look at the brain directly. ",改造完，就經實驗室檢測 檢測完 熱點圖顯示所有字句一律清楚易明 
"Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading, picture of the child's problems. ",而家國稅局都引進咗呢個程式 
"Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology, the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited. ",（鼓掌） 我想帶大家睇下我哋著手做緊嘅嘢 
"And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it, instead of in brain research, towards diagnosing brain disorders in children. ",各界都討論緊係咪要 設立消費者金融保護局 討論緊點樣實踐化繁為簡 
"Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG, or the electrical activity of the brain, in real time, allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions: vision, attention, language, audition. ",眼見周圍都官樣文章 我相信我哋同呢個局都責無旁貸 要將化繁為簡睇為國家嘅優先政策 
A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain. ,我哋唔可以任得政府係咁同我哋打官腔 
"And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant, allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms. ",更唔可以由得企業 用埋晒啲咁隱晦嘅條款同我哋做生意 
"And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team, and we're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders. ",咁影響世界有啲咩方法呢？ 就係堅持清晰、透明同簡單嘅文字！ 
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India. ,多謝各位！ （鼓掌） 
"I'd like to tell you about one such child, whose story was also covered by ABC News. ",
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism. ,菲律賓係一個田園國家 擁有地球上最乾淨嘅水和最藍嘅天空 
"Like many autistic children, his mind was locked inside his body. ",同時都係世界上 HIV 傳染病例增長最快嘅重災區之一 
There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time. ,表面上睇，菲律賓 似乎只係一個遲爆發 HIV 嘅國家 
"And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially, and he would probably never have too much language. ",但係，事實上造成我哋疫情嘅原因 要複雜得多 而且疫情可能預示著 HIV 會再次喺全球爆發 
"When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain, the results were startling. ",但全球 HIV 總體新病例數 正持續下降 呢個趨勢可能唔會持續 但係，下一輪嘅病毒 將會更強烈、抗藥性更强 
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic. ,每當 HIV 侵染一個細胞 佢都可能將自己變異成一種新病毒 
"He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye, but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism. ",雖然我哋同 HIV 傳染病嘅仗 已經取得顯著進展 事實上，只要病毒再變異幾次 災難就可能會再次來襲 
"After Justin was given anti-seizure medication, the change in him was amazing. ",為咗更加清楚咁瞭解 HIV 每次增殖后顯著嘅基因變異 我哋嚟做一個基因對比 
"Within a period of 60 days, his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words. ",如果我哋去睇各個大洲 唔同人種之間嘅 DNA 多樣性 事實上只有百分之零點一嘅差別 
And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ. ,如果係人類、人科猿、 普通獼猴三者 基因差別係百分之七 
"Research shows that 50 percent of children, almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures. ",相比之下，喺唔同病人身上嘅 HIV 亞種 基因差別會高達百分之三十五 
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. ,同一個 HIV 患者身上 親代同子代病毒之間嘅基因差異 有百分之五噉多 
"All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation, language problems. ",親子代之間噉大嘅基因變異 就相當於大猩猩生黑猩猩 再生紅猩猩 然後生狒狒 又再喺生命之中生任何一種人猿 
"Instead, our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments. ",HIV 病毒有將近一百個亞種 仲有新亞種被持續發現 
So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment. ,發達國家嘅 HIV 幾乎 都係同一個亞種︰ B 亞種 
"For too long now, children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen. ",我哋對 HIV 一切嘅瞭解同治療 幾乎都係基於對 B 亞種嘅研究 雖然佢只占全世界 HIV 病例 嘅百分之十二 
"And for too long, these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. ",但由於唔同亞種之間 顯著嘅基因差異 一啲亞種產生抗藥性嘅可能性會更高 甚至會更快發展成愛滋病 
"But we are now in a new era of neuroscience, one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively, and find the true source of so many disabilities in children. ",我哋發現菲律賓嘅 HIV 病例嘅爆發 係由於西部 B 亞種 變異成一種更強勁嘅 東南亞 AE 亞種 
"So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder, then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved. ",我哋發現更後生、病情更嚴重嘅病人 有更高嘅抗藥性比率 
One more mind will be unlocked. ,呢個亞種已經入侵發達國家 包括澳洲、加拿大同美國 
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover. ,可能好快，類似菲律賓嘅 HIV 疫情 就會喺呢啲國家發生 
And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves. ,如果我哋以為 HIV 大潮已經退去 就錯啦 事實上佢會返嚟 就好似真正嘅潮水會回潮 
Thank you. ,十八世紀六十年代早期 瘧疾大潮消退 
(Applause) ,病例數下降 人們同政府轉移咗注意力 
,結果抗藥性瘧疾又捲土重來 
This is the ocean as I used to know it. ,我哋唔可以將 HIV 睇成 一種已經瞭解透徹嘅單一病毒 而係一系列進化快速、高度獨特嘅病毒 其中任何一種都有可能 引發下一次致命嘅疫情 
"And I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times, I really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now, no matter where I am, even where I know that none of the oil has gone, I sort of see slicks, and I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it. ",依家我哋藉助更強大、更新嘅工具 去檢測下一個致命 HIV 噉又需要同時進行 對非 B 亞種嘅緊急研究同適當治療 
"But what I want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context, not just about the oil eruption, but what it means and why it has happened. ",我哋需要令我哋嘅政府、基金會相信 人類同 HIV 嘅惡戰仍未結束 
"First, just a little bit about me. ",超過三千五百萬人死於 HIV 
"I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid, and because I did, I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved. ",我哋將邁入「零愛滋」嘅年代 
"And now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing, and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly. ",我哋需要時刻關注 
"Now we saw this graphic earlier on, that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it. ",我哋需要保持警惕，及時跟進 
It's like you dipped a marble in water. ,唔係嘅話，仲會有千千萬萬個人喪生 
"And the same thing with the atmosphere: If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball, you would get that little sphere of gas on the right. ",多謝 
"So we live on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine, a very sacred soap bubble, but one that is very, very easy to affect. ",（掌聲） 
"And all the burning of oil and coal and gas, all the fossil fuels, have changed the atmosphere greatly. ",
Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up. ,"我十岁果阵时, 我有个表哥带我参观咗佢返学嘅医学院 "
We're warming the climate. ,我仲得到特殊照顾 佢带我去咗间病理学实验室 然后攞出个真实嘅人类大脑 从一个罐入边 然后摆喺我手上 
So the blowout in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization. ,呢个就喺 人类意识嘅位置 人体躯干嘅发动机 摆喺我手上 
"Beyond warming, we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified -- and already measurably so, and already affecting animals. ","由果日开始 我知道我大个咗之後 我会去做一个脑科医生 或者喺科学家,或者其他相关嘅 "
"Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is not 8.1, which is the normal pH of seawater, but 7.5, it dissolves in about three days. ","过咗咁多年,当我终于大个女了 我嘅梦想实现咗 "
"If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1, put it in a pH of 7.7 -- not a huge change -- it becomes deformed and dies. ",然后当我修紧我嘅哲学博士学位 
"Already, commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places. ",喺关于对神经系统有問題 而造成阅读障碍嘅细路 我发现到一个惊人嘅事实 而今日我想将佢同大家分享下 
Coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem. ,"据估计,六分之一嘅细路 每六个细路就有一个 会有某种程度嘅发展障碍问题 "
So this really matters. ,呢种发展障碍 会阻住儿童嘅心智发展 并造成永久嘅精神损伤 
"Now, let's take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit. ",即喺话今日在座嘅每一位½ 都会认识起码一位细路 喺有发展障碍嘅 
"One of the things that really impresses me about the people in the Gulf: They are really, really aquatic people. ",但喺有一度令我搞唔明嘅地方 
And they can handle water. ,尽管事实上 每个发展障碍嘅个案 都系产生喺大脑之中 基本上呢啲紊乱 都喺简单嘅通过 观察患者基本嘅行为嚟诊断 
They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes. ,但喺诊断一种大脑紊乱 又唔去睇个大脑发生咩事 就好似医一个心脏病人 只根据简单嘅身体症状 而唔去睇心电图或者系X光胸透 嚟了解个心脏 
"When the water goes down, they know what to do. ",我觉得咁太依赖直觉喇 
"But when it's something other than water, and their water habitat changes, they don't have many options. ",要精确诊断同医好一种大脑紊乱 绝对要直接睇下个大脑 
"In fact, those entire communities really don't have many options. ","只喺睇病人嘅行为 有可能错过最重要嘅一塊拼图 同埋导致不完全,甚至喺错误解读 问题解决方案 "
They don't have another thing they can do. ,依家 尽管医疗科技进步咗好多 要诊断六分之一儿童嘅 大脑紊乱 条件都喺好有限嘅 
They can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community. ,后来我遇到一个哈佛大学嘅小组 佢哋用咗种好先进嘅医疗技术™ 并运用佢 唔单止做大脑研究 仲用佢诊断儿童嘅大脑紊乱问题 
"If you go to the Gulf and you look around, you do see a lot of oil. ","佢哋呢种创新嘅技术 可以记录EEG脑电图或者电流活动¾ 仲喺实时记录 咁样我哋就可以睇到 大脑执行不同嘅功能 然后检测出啲好细微嘅异常 喺呢啲功能之中 视觉,注意力,语言,发声 "
You see a lot of oil on the ocean. ,有一个项目叫做 脑电活动绘图 用三角定位的方式找出 脑部唔正常信号嘅来源 
"If you go to the site of the blowout, it looks pretty unbelievable. ",仲有一个项目叫做 统计几率绘图 佢可以执行数学运算 通过运算嚟决定呢啲反常 喺未临床特征 咁就比咗我哋一个更加之精准嘅 神经学诊断 对果啲儿童嘅症状 
"It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car, and you just dumped it in the ocean. ",所以我就做咗呢个团队 临床部分嘅神经生理学嘅负责人 同埋我哋依家终于可以用呢种科技 实实际际咁 去帮助大脑紊乱嘅小朋友 
"And one of the really most incredible things, I think, is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest. ",喺呢度我好开心咁同大家讲我哋依家 正在将呢种科技应用到印度 
Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic. ,我想同大家讲下一个小朋友 佢嘅故事美国广播公司都有介绍 
"You go in along the shore, you can find it everywhere. ",七岁嘅 Justin Seingar 嚟到我哋诊所 佢被人哋诊断到有好严重嘅自闭症 
It's really messy. ,好似好多自闭症儿童咁 佢嘅心智被自己嘅身体鎖住咗 
"If you go to the places where it's just arriving, like the eastern part of the Gulf, in Alabama, there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach. ",曾经有几次 佢自己一个人喺度发牛斗 
And they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach. ,个医生同佢父母讲 佢永远都唔可以 好似社交咁沟通同互动 佢可能永远唔会讲好多野 
They're not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand in a 50-gallon plastic bag. ,当我哋用呢个创新嘅脑电图(EEG)科技 去认真睇下Justin嘅大脑 结果系好出乎意料嘅 
They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags. ,结果显示Justin基本 完全无自闭症 
I don't know what they'll do with all that stuff. ,佢只系脑部疾病发作 而斋系用对眼系睇唔到嘅 但喺佢又喺会引起 好似自闭症咁嘅症状 
"Meanwhile, there are still people trying to use the beach. ",当Justin接受咗抗发作药物治疗之后 佢嘅改变喺十分惊人嘅 
"They don't see the sign that says: ""Stay out of the water."" ",喺60日嘅时间之内 佢嘅词汇从两三个单词 飞升到300几个 
Their kids are in the water; they're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals-- It's a mess. ,佢嘅沟通同社交 不可思议嘅提升到 可以去正常嘅学校返学 佢甚至变成咗一个空手道嘅冠軍 
"If you go to where the oil has been for a while, it's an even bigger mess. ",调查表明一半嘅儿童 接近一半 被诊断为自闭症嘅 其实系因为有隐藏住个大脑疾病 
"And there's basically nobody there anymore, a few people trying to keep using it. ",呢啲就喺我测试过嘅 小朋友嘅面容 就好似Justin嘅故事咁 
You see people who are really shell-shocked. ,"呢啲细路 嚟到我哋诊所之前被诊断为 自闭症,注意力缺陷紊乱 精神障碍,语言障碍 "
They are very hardworking people. ,"事实上,我哋嘅EEG脑电图扫描揭示佐 隐藏在大脑入边嘅特殊问题 呢啲问题本来喺无办法 用行为评估检测出嘅 "
"All they know about life is they get up in the morning, and if their engine starts, they go to work. ",所以EEG脑电图扫描 令到我哋可以向依啲小朋友提供一个 精确好多嘅神经生理学诊断 同埋更加之有针对性嘅治疗比呢啲小朋友 
They always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the Gulf. ,"好耐以嚟,有发展紊乱嘅小朋友 忍受住误诊 而真正嘅问题仲未被检测出嚟 而令到佢病情恶化 "
They're finding that their world is really collapsing. ,"一路以嚟,呢啲小朋友同佢哋嘅父母 忍受住過度嘅伤心同绝望 "
"And so you can see, literally, signs of their shock ... ","但喺我哋依家处于神经生理学嘅新时代 喺度我哋终于可以直接睇到 大脑嘅实时运行 而无风险同埋副作用,亦无侵略性 我哋可以搵到 令儿童们失常嘅真正原因 "
signs of their outrage ... ,所以如果今日我可以启发 就算只系你哋其中嘅一小部分人♪ 将呢种先进嘅诊断手法 分享比就算一个 患有大脑发展紊乱嘅儿童嘅父母 咁可能又一个 脑疾会被治愈 
signs of their anger ... ,又一个紧闭嘅大脑会被打开 
and signs of their grief. ,咁又一个被误诊 或者系用现在嘅系统无法诊断嘅儿童 终于可以发现佢嘅潜力 因为依家仲有时间 佢嘅大脑仲可以恢复翻 
These are the things that you can see. ,"而呢啲,只要简单嘅通过睇下佢嘅脑电波就可以做到 "
"There's a lot you can't see, also, underwater. ",多谢 
What's going on underwater? ,(掌声) 
"Well, some people say there are oil plumes. ",
Some people say there are not oil plumes. ,呢個就係我所認識嘅海洋 
"And Congressman Markey asks, you know, ""Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes?"" ",我發現 自從我去過墨西哥灣幾次之後 我好心痛 因為而家每次我見到個海 無論我係邊度 即使我知自己喺邊 啲油都仲喺度 我或多或少見到啲浮油 同埋我發現自己都幾 被呢件事折磨 
But I couldn't take a submarine ride -- especially between the time I knew I was coming here and today -- so I had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico. ,但我今日想同你哋講嘅係 有好多嘢 將所有嘢擺埋一齊 唔單止漏油 仲有呢件事表示乜嘢同埋點解發生 
So this is the Gulf of Mexico ... ,首先，少少個人簡介 
sparkling place full of fish. ,基本上我只係一個熱愛釣魚嘅人 細細個已經係咁 亦正因為咁 我唔再研究海鳥 留喺我好中意嘅沿海棲息地 
And I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. ,而家我主要寫書 講解海洋而家點樣變化 而海洋都當然變得好快 
"And I learned, in fact, I confirmed the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix ... ",而家我哋見到呢張啱啱見過嘅圖片 顯示我哋的確只係住喺一塊大理石上面 表面只有 少少水份 
until you add a dispersant ... ,就好似你將粒珠浸落水入面 
and then ... ,空氣都係同一道理 如果你將所有空氣抽出 再卷做一個波 就會得到右面嗰個小小嘅氣球體 
they start mixing. ,所以我哋係依賴緊 你想像中最脆弱嘅梘泡仔 非常稀有嘅梘泡仔 但非常、非常容易引起變化 
"And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves, and you get a big mess, a big mess that you can't possibly clean, you can't touch, you can't extract and, I think most importantly -- this is what I think -- you can't see it. ",所有燃燒嘅燃油、煤、燃氣 所有化石燃料 已經嚴重影響大氣層 
I think it's being hidden on purpose. ,二氧化碳水平越來越高 
Now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream. ,我哋喺度令氣候暖化 
"But as many people have said, there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on. ",所以墨西哥灣油井噴油 只係一件小問題 背後仲有更大嘅問題 就係我地利用能用維持社會運作 
"Personally, I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body, because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene. ",暖化問題以外 我哋仲面對海洋持續酸化嘅問題 問題已經明顯係咁 已經影響緊其他動物 
But you can see it. ,喺實驗室 你將隻蛤放落pH值 唔係8.1 呢個係一般海水pH值 而係7.5嘅液體裡面 隻蛤會喺三日內溶解 
"You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface, and then it is attacked, because they don't want the evidence, in my opinion. ",如果將條海膽幼蟲 喺pH 8.1捉出嚟 擺落pH 7.7 唔會變好多 -- 變形同埋死 
OK. ,有啲地方殖嘅人工蠔幼蟲 已經大規模地 
We heard that bacteria eat oil? ,死亡 有啲地方嘅珊瑚礁生得越來越慢 正因為呢個問題 
So do sea turtles. ,所以呢個問題真係好重要 
"When it breaks up, it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria. ",而家我哋參觀一下 墨西哥灣 
Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish. ,嗰度啲人令我印象深刻嘅其中一個地方 就係佢地真係屬於海洋 
These guys have to swim around through it. ,同埋佢哋能夠駕馭海洋 
I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here. ,佢地能夠駕馭來來往往嘅颱風 
"A writer named Ted Williams called me, and he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw, because he's writing an article for Audubon magazine. ",潮退嗰陣，佢哋知道要做乜嘢 
"He said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago; like about a week ago, and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what's going on. ",但當海洋以外嘅問題出現 或者佢哋嘅海洋變咗 佢哋就冇乜選擇 
That guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings. ,講真，呢啲社區 真係冇乜選擇 
He has no bookings left. ,佢哋冇其他嘢可以做 
"Everybody wanted their deposit back, everybody is fleeing. ",佢哋唔能夠 喺本土酒店業工作 因為佢哋嘅地區裡面根本冇呢種行業 
That's the story of thousands of people. ,你去墨西哥灣睇睇嘅話 你會見到好多石油 
"But he told Ted that on the last day he went out, a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat, and it was splattering oil out its blowhole. ",你會喺個海見到好多石油 你會喺海岸線見到好多石油 
"And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip, and he knew that the dolphins scare fish. ",去到漏油嗰度嘅話 成個畫面都幾令人難以置信 
"So he moved away from it, turned around a few minutes later, it was right next to the side of the boat again. ",望落就好似你將你架車嘅油底殼裡面啲油 倒晒落個海 
He said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that. ,我覺得，其中一樣最不可思議嘅事 就係嗰度冇人 會嘗試喺最多石油嘅地方 收返啲石油 
And he felt that -- (Sigh) he felt that it was coming to ask for help. ,嗰度有啲海面 望落同世界末日一模一樣 
"Now, in the Exxon Valdez spill, about 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months. ",沿住岸邊行嘅話 就會發現所有地方都係咁 
Their numbers have never recovered. ,真係好混亂 
So the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable. ,如果你去到一啲開始有油污嘅地方 例如墨西哥灣東面嘅亞拉巴馬州 啲人仲出海灘 但已經有人清潔緊海灘 
It's going to take longer for some things. ,但佢地清潔海灘嗰陣，會用一啲好怪嘅方法 
"And some things, I think, will probably come back a little faster. ",例如佢哋唔可以將超過十磅嘅沙 放落一個五十加侖嘅服袋裡面 
The other thing about the Gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year. ,佢哋有數以千計嘅膠袋 
So the Gulf is a really important piece of water -- more important than a similar volume of water in the open Atlantic Ocean. ,我唔知佢地用呢啲嘢嚟做乜 但同時仲有人出去海灘 
These tuna swim the entire ocean. ,佢哋連小小嘅信號都睇唔到 
"They get in the Gulf Stream, they go all the way to Europe. ",上面寫明「切勿下水」 
"When it comes time to spawn, they come inside, and these two tuna that were tagged, you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick. ",佢哋啲細路仲玩水 成身衫同拖鞋都係油，真係好亂 去到啲油污出現咗一排嘅地方 
"They're probably having, at the very least, a catastrophic spawning season this year. ",仲亂 
I'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water. ,呢啲地方基本上已經冇晒人 仲有好少人嘗試 利用個海 
They don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway. ,你會發現呢班好恐慌嘅人 
But these are really high-performance athletic animals. ,其實都係好勤力 
I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills. ,佢哋一向嘅生活就係大清早起身 引擎著咗就開工 
I don't know if it'll affect the adults. ,佢地永遠覺得自己可以依靠 大自然畀佢哋嘅信心 源於墨西哥灣嘅生態系統 
"If it's not, it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae, I would certainly think. ",佢哋覺得自己嘅世界真係崩潰緊 
"But if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down, that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades. ",講真，你會發現 佢哋恐懼嘅跡象 
"So while the oil spill, the leak, the eruption, is a catastrophe, I think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean, for a very long time. ",佢哋痛恨嘅跡象 
It's not like we're starting with something that's been OK. ,佢哋憤怒嘅跡象 
We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with. ,佢哋悲痛嘅跡象 
"If you look around at the birds, there are a lot of birds in the Gulf that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year, but then leave. ",呢啲就係你會發現嘅嘢 
And they populate much larger areas. ,仲有好多你見唔到嘅問題 喺海底 
"For instance, most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds. ",海底發生咩事？ 
"They were all on the Gulf in May, while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places. ",嗯，有人話 海底有油柱 
Down on the lower left there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings. ,又有人話冇油柱 
"They breed in the High Arctic, and they winter down in southern South America. ",你知唔知，眾議員馬基問過： 係咪要坐潛水艇 睇吓有冇油柱？ 
But they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the Arctic. ,但我坐唔到潛水艇 尤其當我要嚟到呢度嘅時候 我要 親自做個小實驗 睇睇墨西哥灣到底有冇石油 
"I saw birds that breed in Greenland, in the Gulf. ",呢個就係墨西哥灣 
So this is a hemispheric issue. ,一個多采多彩、有好多魚嘅地方 
The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways. ,我係嗰度 滴咗少少浮油 
The biological effects are certainly hemispheric. ,發現咗 -- 其實都證實咗我嘅假設 油同水係溝唔埋 
I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples of total unpreparedness that I can even think of. ,除非落分散劑 
"Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, at least they shot back. ",之後 
And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do. ,佢哋開始融合 
"There was nothing ready, and, you know, as we can see by what they're doing. ",如果令佢地郁少少 利用風同海浪 之後就會好麻煩 係超麻煩 就係你清理唔到 接觸唔到、提取唔到 同埋最重要 -- 我係咁諗 -- 就係你睇唔到 
Mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants. ,我覺得啲石油係故意被隱藏 
The booms are absolutely not made for open water. ,而家出現咗咁大嘅災難 媒體成日泄露消息 
They don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated. ,但正如好多人所講 有人極力隱瞞事實嘅真相 
They get near shore -- Look at these two boats. ,而我自己覺得 分散劑係 隱瞞事實嘅主要策略 因為我哋要兇手 負責處理案發現場 
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool. ,但你睇到呢點 
"And I think, you know, that's a great name for boats that think that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this, by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface. ",你睇到啲石油 係海面集中喺邊度 之後就有人喺度做手腳 因為佢地唔想留低證據，我係咁諗 
The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms. ,好啦 
The booms are only about 13 inches in diameter. ,有冇聽過食油嘅細菌 
So it's just absolutely crazy. ,其車海龜都係 
Here are shrimp boats employed. ,當啲油分解 就需要好長時間 先會輪到細菌 
There are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets. ,海龜都食，但啲油入晒魚鰓 
Here they are working. ,佢哋要喺附近游來游去 
You can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom. ,我今日聽到一個最神奇嘅故事 就係當我坐火車過嚟嗰陣 
All they're doing is stirring it. ,有位叫泰德威廉斯嘅作家叫我 問咗我幾條問題 問我見到乜嘢 因為佢為奧杜邦雜雜寫緊篇文章 
It's just ridiculous. ,佢話嚟左墨西哥灣一陣 -- 大概一個禮拜 -- 有個曾經係休閒釣魚導遊嘅人 帶佢睇吓佢嗰邊發生咩事 
"Also, for all the shoreline that has booms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline -- all of the shoreline that has booms, there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms. ",個導遊全年嘅預約 取消晒 
There is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them. ,佢冇晒預約 
"And that lower photo, that's a bird colony that has been boomed. ",個個都想拎返訂金，個個都逃之夭夭 
Everybody's trying to protect the bird colonies there. ,成千上萬嘅人都有同樣遭遇 
"Well, as an ornithologist, I can tell you that birds fly, and that -- (Laughter) and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it; it doesn't do it. ",但係佢同泰德講 係佢出海最後嗰日 有隻酒糟鼻海豚 忽然係隻船隔離出現 佢喺度整走 氣孔裡面啲油 
These birds make a living by diving into the water. ,之後導遊走咗 因為嗰次係 佢最後一次出海釣魚 同埋佢都知道海豚驚魚 
In fact ... ,所以佢離開隻海豚 走咗幾分鐘之後 隻海豚又係隻船隔離出現 
"really what I think they should do, if anything -- they're trying so hard to protect those nests -- actually, if they destroyed every single nest, some of the birds would leave, and that would be better for them this year. ",導遊話自己釣咗三十年魚 未見過有海豚咁做 
As far as cleaning them ... ,佢覺得 -- 佢覺得隻海豚係 喺度求救，真係可惜 
I don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds. ,今時今日喺埃克森漏油現場 大約三成殺人鯨 出世後幾個月內死亡 
"It's really, really important that we express our compassion. ",佢哋嘅數量從來未回復到以前嘅數字 
"I think that's the most important thing that people have, is compassion. ",所有嘢嘅回復率 都唔同 
It's really important to get those images and to show it. ,有啲需要長啲時間 
"But really, where are those birds going to get released to? ",而有啲我諗可能 回復得快啲 
"It's like taking somebody out of a burning building, treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building, because the oil is still gushing. ",另一樣嘢關於墨西哥灣好重要 就係有好多動物 聚居喺嗰度 喺年中某段時間 
I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident. ,所以墨西哥灣真係一片好重要嘅海洋 -- 比大西洋裡面同等面積嘅海洋 更加重要 
I think that this is the result of gross negligence. ,啲金槍魚游晒成個大西洋 
(Applause) Not just BP. ,嚟到墨西哥灣，跟住去歐洲 
BP operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could. ,要產卵嘅時候，佢哋就係入去 相中呢兩隻海豚 你哋見到佢哋係產卵場度 正正就係浮油集中嘅地方 
"And they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that is supposed to be our government, protecting us. ",最起碼佢哋今年好可能遇到 一個災難性嘅產卵期 
"It turns out that -- you see this sign on every commercial vessel in the United States -- you know, if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil, you would be in big trouble. ",我希望當中嘅大人會 避免接觸啲污糟水 
"And you have to really wonder who are the laws made for, and who has gotten above the laws. ",佢哋通常都唔鐘意落水 反正天色都唔太好 
And there are things that we can do in the future. ,不過佢哋係優秀嘅 運動型動物 
We could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need. ,我唔知啲石油入咗佢哋啲鰓之後會點 
"It would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making 30,000 holes in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil, oil might start coming out of one of them. ",都唔知啲大人會唔會受影響 
And you'd have some idea of what to do. ,就算唔會，啲油點都會影響 佢哋啲卵同小朋友，我真係咁諗 
That's certainly one of the things we need to do. ,當你見到條曲線不斷向下走 呢啲就係我哋對待呢種魚類嘅後果 呢幾十年嚟不斷捕魚嘅結果 
But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from. ,正當今次漏油 泄漏、噴出 係災難 我認為我哋要記住 我哋做過非常之多影響海洋生態嘅事 做咗好耐好耐 
"It really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government, meant to protect the larger public interest. ",我哋實在唔似開始做緊 一啲好事 
"So I think that the oil blowout, the bank bailout, the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause. ",反而開始做啲會帶嚟好多困難 同壓力嘅事 
"We still seem to understand that at least, we need the police to protect us from a few bad people. ",睇睇啲雀鳥 墨西哥灣有好多雀鳥 年中某段時間集中喺墨西哥灣 但之後就飛走 
And even though the police can be a little annoying at times -- giving us tickets and stuff like that -- nobody says that we should just get rid of them. ,但聚居面積更大 
"But in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least 30 years, there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from, buying the government out from under us. ",舉個例 圖入面大多數雀鳥都係候鳥 
"(Applause) Now this has been a problem for a very, very long time. ",佢哋喺五月喺晒墨西哥灣 同時某啲地方就有石油飄緊埋岸 
"You can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America, and even Thomas Jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country. ",睇睇左下角嘅 翻石鷸同三趾鷸 
"OK, people who say they're conservative, if they really wanted to be really conservative and patriotic, they would tell these corporations to go to hell. ",佢哋係北極一帶繁殖 冬天就喺南美洲南部度過 
That's what it would really mean to be conservative. ,但佢哋集中喺墨西哥灣 跟住遍佈成個北極 
"So what we really need to do is regain the idea that it's our government safeguarding our interests, and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost. ",我見過喺格陵蘭繁殖嘅雀鳥 住喺墨西哥灣 
I think there are signs of hope. ,所以呢個都係南北半球嘅問題 
We seem to be waking up a little bit. ,經濟衝擊 係國家層面上，好多方面都係排最後 
"The Glass-Steagall Act -- which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen, and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts -- that was put in effect in 1933, was systematically destroyed. ",對於生物嘅影響當然涉及南北半球 
"Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place, but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed. ",我覺得呢樣係其中一樣最 絕對令人震驚嘅 因為毫無防範嘅例子 喺我想像得到嘅事之中 
So it's a continued fight. ,就算當日本人炸珍珠港 起碼佢哋識得還擊 
It's a historic moment right now. ,而我哋而家就好似 唔知道下一步應該點做 
"We're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the Gulf, or we will make the moment we need out of this, as many people have noted today. ",所有嘢都未準備好 而家你睇到 我哋所作所為嘅後果 
There's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this. ,佢哋而家主要用緊嘅方法就係輸油管同埋分散劑 
We've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling. ,而啲輸油管絕對唔適用於空曠嘅水域 
The first offshore wells were called whales. ,佢哋甚至唔嘗試係最多油嘅地方 將啲油集合埋一齊 
The first offshore drills were called harpoons. ,而家啲石油越來越近岸邊，睇吓呢兩隻船 
We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time. ,右邊嗰隻叫做傻仔釣魚 
Now are we stuck with this? ,你知唔知，我覺得隻船個名改得好好 佢哋而家出盡辦法 引人注意，例如拖走啲輸油管 而家係墨西哥灣嘅幾平方里之內 有數以十萬計嘅船嘅表面 都有油污 
"Ever since we lived in caves, every time we wanted any energy, we lit something on fire, and that is still what we're doing. ",而啲分散劑將啲油沉喺輸油管之下 
We're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy. ,啲輸油管直徑大約 得十三寸 
And people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive. ,所以成件事絕對係荒唐 
Who says it's too expensive? ,而家我哋見到啲蝦艇 
People who sell us fossil fuels. ,佢哋用幾百隻蝦艇，唔係收網，而係收起輸油管 
"We've been here before with energy, and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch, because the cheapest energy was slavery. ",佢哋喺度做緊嘢 
Energy is always a moral issue. ,好容易睇到 全部有油污嘅水都走晒去輸油管後面 
It's an issue that is moral right now. ,啲油管只係攪緊啲油同水 
It's a matter of right and wrong. ,好荒謬 
Thank you very much. ,仲有，所有裝有輸油管嘅海岸 -- 上百里計嘅海岸線 -- 成線海岸線都有輸油管 而隔離有海岸係完全冇輸油管 
,有好大機會 畀啲油污同受污染嘅水流過去 
"Imagine, if you will -- a gift. ",喺下面張相，有片雀鳥棲息地被人裝埋輸油管 
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind. ,所有人都非常努力保護 嗰度嘅雀鳥棲息地 
It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball. ,嗯，有位鳥類學者 我話你知雀係識得飛，同埋 -- (笑聲) 喺雀鳥棲息地裝輸油管係 冇用；真係冇用 
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up. ,啲雀鳥係靠潛落水底搵食物 
"But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you. ",講真 
It will bring all of your family together. ,我覺得佢哋應該做啲乜，就係任何 -- 佢哋咁努力設法保護啲雀巢 -- 講真如果佢哋破壞啲巢 有啲雀鳥就係飛走 咁做對佢哋今年嘅生活都有益處 
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years. ,至於將佢哋清洗乾淨 
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you. ,我唔係要誹謗 
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. ,為雀鳥清潔嘅人 非常非常重要嘅一點 就係我哋展示同情嘅一面 
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith. ,我覺得人類擁有最重要嘅嘢 就係同情 
You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. ,我哋真係需要建立呢種形象 同埋展示出嚟 
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy. ,但講真，啲雀鳥會被放去邊？ 
"You'll expand your vocabulary, meet new people, and you'll have a healthier lifestyle. ",而家就好似喺火場救人出嚟 用濃煙救佢哋 跟住送返佢哋入火場，因為啲油仲漏緊 
And get this -- you'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing. ,我唔會承認呢件事 係等同於意外 
You'll eat countless gourmet meals. ,我認為呢個係粗淺而無知嘅結果 
Flowers will arrive by the truckload. ,(掌聲) 唔淨上英國石油 
"People will say to you, ""You look great. Have you had any work done?"" ",英國石油管理得 好草率同魯莽 
And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs. ,因為佢哋做得出 而且佢哋可以咁做 就係源於一個我哋以為 會保障我哋嘅政府 嘅疏忽同失策 
"You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled. ",最終局面係 -- 你會喺幾乎所有美國船隻上見到呢個標誌 -- 你知唔知，如果你漏咗幾加侖油 你會惹到一身蟻 
Your life will have new meaning. ,所以你真係要諗清楚 到底法律係為邊個而設 邊個凌駕於律法之上 
"Peace, health, serenity, happiness, nirvana. ",而家我哋可以為未來做啲嘢 
The price? ,我哋可以擁有真係需要嘅工具 
"$55,000, and that's an incredible deal. ",而唔再需要好多人 去參與 喺墨西哥灣嘅海床 掘三萬個窿搵石油 石油可能從其中一個窿走出嚟 
By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one. ,你可能已經知道我哋可以做乜嘢 
Does Amazon carry it? ,呢個絕對係其中一樣我哋要做嘅事 
Does it have the Apple logo on it? ,但我覺得我哋真係要理解清楚今次漏油事件 代表乜嘢 
Is there a waiting list? ,呢次事件意味著一個想法被瓦解 就係我哋嘅政府嘅成立 就係為咗保衛我哋 最大嘅公共利益 
Not likely. ,所以我認為漏油事件 拯救銀行計劃 次按危機等所有嘢 絕對係同一原因嘅 
This gift came to me about five months ago. ,徵兆 我哋似乎仍然認為 我哋起碼需要警察保護我哋 免受壞人傷害 
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty. ,即使警察有時都幾刻人憎 -- 例如抄牌之類 -- 但冇話過我哋應該炒晒佢哋 
"And this, and then this. ",但而家其餘所有嘅政府部門 喺過去最少三十年 出現一種違反規定嘅文化 係源於 我哋需要從佢地身上 得到保護嘅人 叛著我哋買起咗成個政府 
"It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving. ",(掌聲) 有個問題存在已久 
"And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you. ",你睇得出 有啲公司係美國建國嘅時候，犯過法 就算傑弗遜都抱怨過 當時佢地已經 對抗國家律法 
I'm not sure you'd want it. ,好喇，話佢哋 好保守嘅朋友 如果佢哋真係想 保守同愛國 佢哋會叫晒呢啲公司 去死 
But I wouldn't change my experience. ,呢啲先係保守 
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you. ,所以我哋要做嘅係 收復大眾覺得 呢個就係會 保衛我哋利益嘅政府嘅想法 同埋回復團結嘅意識 同已經被遺忘嘅 立國宗旨 
"So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain, consider that it just may be a gift. ",我覺得仲有希望嘅跡象 
(Applause) ,睇嚟我哋要醒一醒 
,格拉斯-斯蒂格爾法案 -- 就係旨於避免我哋遇到 會導致經濟衰退嘅事 1933年銀行倒閉 所有銀行都要求援助 -- 當時法案就出動 而家已經有組織地被廢除 
,而家坊間有種情緒想將份法案 恢復效力 但已經有說客係度 嘗試削弱條例 自從法例被通過後 
,呢場係耐力戰 
,而家已經到咗歷史性時刻 
,我哋一係會有個完全 冇緩和過嘅災難性 墨西哥灣漏油事件 一係喺事件上利用時機 正如而家好多人所講 
,我哋當然都有句口頭襌 話需要利用時機 
,我哋之前已經經歷過呢個階段 當我哋用緊其他方法離岸採油嗰陣 
,第一個海上油井叫鯨魚 
,第一台鑽台叫魚叉 
,當時我哋殺晒海裡面嘅鯨魚 
,而家又想重蹈覆徹？ 
,自從人類住喺山洞起 每當我哋想要任何能源 我哋起火採光，我哋而家仲係咁做 
,我哋仲係起火採光 每當我哋要能源 
,有人話 我哋冇得用潔淨嘅能源 因為太貴 
,邊個話大貴？ 
,有人向我哋賣化石燃料 
,人類有能源之前已經存在 有人話經濟 唔能夠承受轉變 因為最平嘅能源就係奴隸 
,能源永遠都係道德問題 
,而家呢個就係道德問題 
,一個關於對與錯嘅問題 
,多謝
