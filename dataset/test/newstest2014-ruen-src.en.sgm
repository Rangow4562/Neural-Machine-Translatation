<seg id="1">Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.</seg>
<seg id="6">How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.</seg>
<seg id="15">The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.</seg>
<seg id="28">The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="33">Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.</seg>
<seg id="34">While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.</seg>

<seg id="1">Girlfriend of dead soldier raises concerns over care for troops</seg>
<seg id="2">31 October 2013 Last updated at 20:21</seg>
<seg id="3">The girlfriend of a soldier found dead in an Army barracks has raised concerns about the care given to services personnel returning from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="4">L/Cpl James Ross of the 2nd Battalion the Rifles, and from Leeds, was found hanged in his room at Ballykinler base in County Down on 8 December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="5">His girlfriend, Sharon Lemon, had raised the alarm after he failed to answer her calls and texts.</seg>
<seg id="6">She said she had no idea he had any problems or was depressed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Speaking exclusively to BBC Newsline, she said: "With James, the type of personality that he had, I would never ever have imagined this.</seg>
<seg id="8">He never was down, he was always so happy, so loving, so caring.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no hints or clues that would have made me think he was depressed, let alone had PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).</seg>
<seg id="10">James had completed two tours of duty in Afghanistan and, according to Sharon, was looking forward to a third.</seg>
<seg id="11">She said: "He couldn't wait to go back [to Afghanistan].</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact he was wanting to learn the native language.</seg>
<seg id="13">He absolutely loved the Army, he loved it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Top priority</seg>
<seg id="15">L/Cpl Ross, 30, had been at a function in the officers' mess the night before his body was found.</seg>
<seg id="16">A second soldier, Rifleman Darren Mitchell, 20, was also found hanged at the base two months later.</seg>
<seg id="17">A military investigation into the two deaths at Ballykinler is nearing completion, and no one from the Army was available for comment.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, an earlier statement from the Ministry of Defence said "that the mental health of our personnel is a top priority which is why the government has committed £7.4m to ensure there is mental health support in place for everyone who needs it."</seg>
<seg id="19">Sharon Lemon said she believed there were problems concerning care for troops returning from tours of duty.</seg>
<seg id="20">Whenever you look at the grand scheme of things, yes there is a problem that needs sorting.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was Darren, there was James, there is obviously something going on," she said.</seg>
<seg id="22">What that reason is I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is it because of where the barracks are, the isolation factor, is it to do with that, I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="24">In all honesty I don't know what happened to James, I don't know why he did it and I don't think we'll ever know the answer, and it's the same with other soldiers as well, we will never know the true reasons because they didn't tell us.</seg>
<seg id="25">Built to fight</seg>
<seg id="26">In those kind of circumstances, if this is the ethos of 'you have to man up, you have to get on with things, you don't need help you just need to think about it and get on with it, go and do your duties', if this is what was going on in his head he wasn't going to ask for help.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wasn't going to go and speak to welfare, he wasn't even going to say to me because I was his girlfriend, they don't want to let their guard down.</seg>
<seg id="28">They're built to train and to fight and to kill but they're not built for coming home.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the ethos will never leave about manning up, but these soldiers need to feel encouraged that they can open up.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whether or not that is to their fellow comrades, or to the higher ranks and authorities, or to their welfare officer, they need to be readily available to get this help.</seg>
<seg id="31">I'm not sure if they themselves can recognise it.</seg>
<seg id="32">As far as I'm aware PTSD is something you don't recognise straight away and it takes months in order for it to be diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="33">So if people are confused about how they're feeling and they don't even know, how are they to go to a doctor and explain it?</seg>
<seg id="34">The higher ranks and authorities within the Army need to make sure that these guys feel they can go and talk to somebody about it, and that it is easily accessed.</seg>
<seg id="35">Little information</seg>
<seg id="36">But if the guys aren't going to speak about it what can we do?</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't know James had any issues and still to this day I don't know if this was what was going on in James's mind.</seg>
<seg id="38">Obviously there was something to make him do what he did but if they won't speak about it what can be done?</seg>
<seg id="39">She added: "I've had very little information from the Army, but in saying that I don't know how much information they have concerning it because we don't know the reasons why.</seg>
<seg id="40">They are doing their very best to try to get to the bottom of it with the inquiry and the inquest.</seg>
<seg id="41">Prof Siobhan O'Neill, an expert from the Bamford Centre for Mental Health at Magee College in Londonderry researching PTSD, said spotting the condition is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="42">She said: "Unfortunately a lot of people seem to think that coming forward to seek help is a sign of weakness and actually it's a sign of strength.</seg>
<seg id="43">Men in general are less likely to come forward for treatment or to acknowledge that they have mental health difficulties than women, and of course in the military environment we do have a predominance of men and a very macho environment which might in some ways discourage that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bashkiria can put grain up for tender no earlier than the beginning of 2014</seg>
<seg id="2">The Republic's Minister of Agriculture Nikolai Kovalenko believes that during government purchasing interventions Bashkiria can put grain up for tender no earlier than the beginning of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">As of today, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.</seg>
<seg id="4">So far the market price is higher, and there is demand.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is possible that grain will be put up for tender after the New Year," he announced at yesterday's press conference.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Minister recalled that this year sowing of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest made up 3.1 million hectares, including acreage of grain crops of 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% higher than last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the harvest of 2014, 550 thousand hectares have been sown (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).</seg>
<seg id="8">Acreage for winter wheat and triticale has been increased, rye remained at the previous level.</seg>

<seg id="1">Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and domains.</seg>
<seg id="2">The minister of foreign affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makei informed journalists about this at a press conference at the end of the meeting with the minister of foreign affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, reports a correspondent of BELTA.</seg>
<seg id="3">We are very happy that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and domains.</seg>
<seg id="4">Belarus on its part is also interested in this, therefore we agreed that the government administration agencies of the two countries will provide ubiquitous assistance and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves," noted Vladimir Makei.</seg>
<seg id="5">He underscored that the government of Belarus will create for that all necessary conditions and provide maximal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="6">The minister also reported that in Ankara was held the scheduled 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic committee according to the results of which a protocol was signed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The parties worked out a roadmap of Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and economic and investment domains, in spheres of industrial cooperation, transportation, agriculture, energy, as well as a search for new forms and areas of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The protocol of the last meeting was fulfilled in full, and I am convinced that the current protocol also will be fulfilled, because Belarus and Turkey see each other as reliable partners," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The minister of foreign affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutogu in turn reported that at the successful negotiations the heads of the foreign policy agencies of the two countries decided to also further develop mutually advantageous cooperation and implement various projects.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the minister, it is necessary to increase the trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, and drive it to an indicator of $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also Turkey is an important partner in the sphere of investment cooperation, which is necessary to develop further as well, since in this sphere there is unused potential, he believes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Relations between our countries were always very warm, and we hope that in the future they will strengthen and expand even more.</seg>
<seg id="13">And also all necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey will be created," noted Ahmet Davutoglu.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Changing Face of the US Oil Industry -- TORONTO, Oct.</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 /PRNewswire/ - PF Group Inc. is pleased to announce the results of its latest study.</seg>
<seg id="3">Data released by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) over the past several years have pointed to a compelling shift in the strategic context of US oil markets that may emerge in coming decades.</seg>
<seg id="4">The interwoven threads of pipelines, railways, carbon emissions, and political maneuvering are joined together in the loom of US refiners.</seg>
<seg id="5">Incremental increases in US refining capacity over the past twenty years have roughly kept utilization rates in the mid-80% range, with fewer than one million barrels per day of idle capacity, while at the same time that overall refiner output has grown by approximately 25%.</seg>
<seg id="6">This increase in output has roughly kept pace with population growth on a year-over-year basis.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the turn of the century the quality of crude oil used as feedstock for refineries, as measured by sulfur content and API gravity, has been relatively stable.</seg>
<seg id="8">Prior to this period, however, there was a material change in crude oil sourness and density, with average sulfur content rising by ~50% and API gravity falling by ~10%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although US crude oil production has increased since the mid-2000s, the EIA is forecasting crude oil production shortfalls of ten (currently) to twelve (after 2019) million barrels per day compared to US refining capacity; the US will demand substantial imported crude oil into the foreseeable future.</seg>
<seg id="10">Consequently, Canadian pipeline and railway access to the US will remain a major policy issue.</seg>
<seg id="11">If Canadian oil production doubles as projected, escalating conflict over transportation of Canadian crude oil may dominate Canada-US relations with a spillover effect into Canadian trade arrangements outside of North America.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, of more interest are the recent developments in US oil product end market sales.</seg>
<seg id="13">In particular, growth of US refinery output has outpaced US domestic demand for refined petroleum products, leading to a tripling of US petroleum product exports since the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">This suggests that US refineries supplying non-US demand for refined oil products are driving a portion of US oil import demand; compared to domestic demand, US refiners have excess capacity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Refining overcapacity may attract the attention of environmental constituents and become the new carbon battleground, displacing current attention focused on crude oil transportation.</seg>
<seg id="16">As long as US refiners have capacity and an end market they will demand crude oil.</seg>
<seg id="17">Combatting the transportation of oil to refiners, whether by pipeline, rail, or ship, is similar to squeezing a balloon full of water - market forces, like water, cannot be compressed and undue external pressure will cause them to expand outside of the pressure zones.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of fighting the multiple transportation effects of US refinery demand, the strategic context may shift to the single proximate cause, refining capacity itself.</seg>
<seg id="19">If refining capacity were to be statutorily limited to supply of domestic demand, either by limiting refined product export in the same manner as crude oil, or by decommissioning excess capacity (with the caveat that environmental and national security concerns could more directly collide), then there would be a ripple effect across global oil markets.</seg>
<seg id="20">In this scenario, as US import demand wanes a corresponding shortfall in accessible global refining capacity would increase the economic importance of non-US refining operations.</seg>
<seg id="21">To the extent that North American oil production quality deviates from that of imported oil, low quality North American oil production would become stranded or the cost of refined products would necessarily increase in dollar and carbon output terms.</seg>
<seg id="22">There may be other knock-on effects that are difficult to predict, similar to anticipating where exactly the water filled balloon will expand when squeezed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sound far-fetched?</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider the impact of Ultra-Low-Sulfur-Diesel (ULSD) legislation.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the implementation of ULSD in the US a decade ago, distillate production with sulfur content below 15 ppm has risen from 0% to over 90% of total distillate production, which has grown approximately in line with overall petroleum products.</seg>
<seg id="26">Any additional cost of refining lower sulfur distillates seems obvious, but there was also a knock-on effect that impacted global graphite markets and possibly electric car production.</seg>
<seg id="27">Increasing distillation to reduce sulfur content requires a heat source, and to minimize costs refiners cannibalized their production of marketable petcoke, effectively recycling a byproduct of the distillation process by feeding the petcoke back into refineries.</seg>
<seg id="28">Total petcoke production since ULSD has been relatively stable, but the amount of petcoke supplied to end markets has fallen dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="29">Marketable petcoke serves as a feedstock for synthetic graphite, which is used in multiple products including lithium-ion batteries.</seg>
<seg id="30">The negative supply shock in the synthetic graphite market caused a reciprocal demand shock in natural graphite markets, and a corresponding jump in natural graphite prices.</seg>
<seg id="31">Capital markets responded with a redeployment of capital to Greenfield graphite projects, and a simultaneous marketing effort that erroneously identified the demand shock culprit as demand from electric car producers.</seg>
<seg id="32">Ironically, the longer-term effect of reducing sulfur emissions may be to hinder more attractive electric car pricing, and thereby overall reduction in carbon output and fossil fuel reliance.</seg>
<seg id="33">What will be the ultimate impact of recent changes in US oil markets?</seg>
<seg id="34">Only time will tell, but historically change has signaled opportunity, with greater change opening the door to greater opportunity.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of American intelligence agencies who preferred to not disclose his name, claimed that the United States eavesdropped on the telephone conversations of high-ranking officials of Japan.</seg>
<seg id="3">This person confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several sites intended for eavesdropping.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, he noted that the U.S.A., Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand do not conduct reconnaissance operations against each other.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, such was formed during the Second World War when these countries were allies.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are targets for reconnaissance operations, reported the television channel NHK.</seg>
<seg id="7">Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.</seg>
<seg id="8">Let us recall that news of surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies against the chancellor of Germany emerged last week.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to data from German journalists, the NSA could have wiretapped the telephone of Merkel over a period of the last ten years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretaps rather painfully.</seg>
<seg id="11">She declared that such surveillance of a head of government by allies, who, according to her, Germany and the United States have been for decades, is unacceptable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road crash</seg>
<seg id="3">She was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry</seg>
<seg id="4">Firefighters abseil down cliff face to pluck the dog from certain death</seg>
<seg id="5">A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="11">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom.</seg>
<seg id="13">She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid.</seg>
<seg id="14">But she is fine now.</seg>
<seg id="15">She was eating biscuits afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was a very unusual call-out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a very lucky escape."</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.</seg>
<seg id="16">While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Double Down" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Possibly," Martin replied.</seg>

<seg id="1">Runner on the field during the "Shinnik" match</seg>
<seg id="2">Certain details have become known about the identity of the fan who ran onto the field during the Russian Cup 1/16 final match between Yaroslavl's "Shinnik" and Moscow's "Spartak".</seg>
<seg id="3">As the head of CDC RFU Artur Grigoryants stated  referring to data from the Interior Ministry, the fan is a Muscovite.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is currently detained.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In addition, Grigoryants told of how the fan managed to burst onto the field: "It emerged that this, let's call him spectator, got through to an ambulance in the accompaniment of two spectators citing heart problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">He approached the ambulance - the ambulance doctor confirmed this to us.</seg>
<seg id="7">And then he pushed away the two companions and ran to the field.</seg>
<seg id="8">He ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern stands to the corner of the Eastern and Northern stands.</seg>
<seg id="9">He ran across the entire field.</seg>
<seg id="10">The stewards are responsible for this.</seg>
<seg id="11">Before the law on sports goes into effect, this is the zone of operations of stewards - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.</seg>
<seg id="12">He ran to the stands, climbed over the Eastern stands.</seg>
<seg id="13">And at that time disruptions began in the Eastern stands and on the running lanes," stated the head of the CDC.</seg>
<seg id="14">Let us recall that by decision of the CDC Moscow's "Spartak" will play the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championships against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit" without spectators, and will pay a fine in the amount of 600 thousand rubles.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asteroid mining: space odyssey - FT.com</seg>
<seg id="2">There is something self-defeating about the desire to gather precious metals in outer space</seg>
<seg id="3">No one pays for what is merely useful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The money comes out for that which is useful and scarce.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shale boom has put the US on track to energy self sufficiency and boosted US manufacturing, for example, but undermined natural gas prices.</seg>
<seg id="6">So there is something self-defeating about the desire to gather precious metals in outer space.</seg>
<seg id="7">Platinum concentrations found in meteorite samples on Earth suggest some large (500km in diameter) asteroids in space could contain more than double the known world reserves of that metal.</seg>
<seg id="8">The scale of extraterrestrial iron ore deposits could be greater still.</seg>
<seg id="9">Watch out, Rio Tinto, if one day those deposits come to earth.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not a complete fantasy to suppose they could.</seg>
<seg id="11">Planetary Resources is raising funds to develop technologies to mine asteroids.</seg>
<seg id="12">Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google and Richard Branson are all investors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Another company, SpaceX, is developing a rocket to launch in 2014 that will slash the costs of taking a kilogramme of equipment to space to $2,200 - a fifth of the cost using traditional launch systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bernstein reckons that the cost to develop a space mine could be in the region of $150bn - the same as the cost to build the International Space Station, the infrastructure for which weighs roughly 450 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Not a crazy amount considering the $140bn the US spends on its oil and gas sector each year, notes Credit Suisse.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bold estimates imply that a rock 8 metres wide (the size of asteroid a current Nasa mission proposes to bring into lunar orbit by 2030) could have up to a 5 per cent platinum content or 10m ounces.</seg>
<seg id="17">On current prices, that amount of platinum would be worth about $14bn - a small reward considering the scale of the investment.</seg>
<seg id="18">More to the point, that equates to 1.5 times annual platinum supply, as Bernstein points out.</seg>
<seg id="19">Such a level of supply would send the price of platinum crashing.</seg>
<seg id="20">That does not look like a very good business proposition.</seg>
<seg id="21">Planetary Resources is not alone.</seg>
<seg id="22">The big miners, which continue to invest in adding big iron ore supply despite potentially weakening demand, could also pause and consider the power of scarcity.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Sport - Mike Phillips must get "his own house in order" - Rob Howley</seg>
<seg id="2">Rob Howley says scrum half Mike Phillips has to get "his own house in order" as Wales prepare to face the Springboks on 7 November.</seg>
<seg id="3">Phillips, 31, is in camp with the Wales squad following his dismissal by his club Bayonne who accused him of being drunk at a video session.</seg>
<seg id="4">Attack coach Howley said he could only judge Phillips on his time with Wales.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's up to Mike really to get his own house in order and focus on what he needs to focus on," said Howley.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phillips faces Welsh media after sacking</seg>
<seg id="7">We can only judge on how Mike is in our environment and as [Wales coach} Warren [Gatland] has said earlier on in the week he was great on the Lions tour.</seg>
<seg id="8">You have to act professionally on and off the field, and he has fallen short, hasn't he, on some occasions.</seg>
<seg id="9">[But] Mike Phillips is an outstanding player.</seg>
<seg id="10">He's been on two Lions tours, he's got experience and he is vital to our game.</seg>
<seg id="11">Having said that, wearing that national jersey is not a divine right.</seg>
<seg id="12">Your performance is judged when you come into training and when you put that national jersey on.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 77-times capped Phillips has instigated legal action in France following his sacking by Bayonne.</seg>
<seg id="14">He faced the media for the first time since departing from Bayonne, and said it was a relief to be back in the Wales squad.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's great to be back in the set up here with the boys and just knuckling down and training hard and making sure I'm in the best shape hopefully for next weekend," said Phillips.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just disappointed with the way it ended there, and that's that really.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don't really want to talk too much about it, my focus here is on Wales.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can't wait to get the kit on and get back out there for Wales.</seg>
<seg id="19">Phillips would not be drawn on his future in club rugby, but Howley believes the player has along term future with Wales provided he is playing regularly.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Looking forward over the next two years, we would like to think Mike Phillips will be available for World Cup 2015," Howley said.</seg>
<seg id="21">I think that is a realistic target for Mike, and for that to happen he needs to be playing at a club.</seg>
<seg id="22">The important void to fill is for Mike to play rugby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Whether that is in Wales, England or France, that his down to his agent and Mike.</seg>
<seg id="24">From our perspective, we want Mike to be playing week in, week out.</seg>

<seg id="1">All the Wrong Reasons: Slacker comedy meets high soap</seg>
<seg id="2">New Brunswick filmmaker Gia Milani has shown herself in the past to be a deft director of actors, and that talent almost enables her to clear the various hurdles and complications she sets for herself in the 20-something ensemble drama All the Wrong Reasons.</seg>
<seg id="3">But those contrivances ultimately prevail.</seg>
<seg id="4">Set in a big-box store, the story concerns James, an ambitious, likeably bland manager (played by the late Cory Monteith) and his strained relations with Kate, his intimacy-averse, PTSD-suffering wife (Karine Vanasse).</seg>
<seg id="5">She observes the world from the safely detached vantage of the store's closed-circuit surveillance system, but tentatively returns to the world of the flesh when confronted with a sensitive Irish firefighter, Simon (Kevin Zegers), who's dealing with his own form of trauma.</seg>
<seg id="6">And with Nicole (Emily Hampshire), a desperately struggling, sexually tactical single-mother cashier, you're left with an awful lot of explosive emotional material packed into one little movie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The result teeters uncomfortably between dead-end-job slacker comedy and high soap, but it shows enough potential to bode well for Milani's future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Labor stands by emissions trading scheme</seg>
<seg id="2">PRIME Minister Tony Abbott's plan to abolish the carbon tax may have to wait at least nine months after the Labor shadow cabinet agreed to block the bills unless the government moves to an emissions trading scheme in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says Labor will seek to amend the government's repeal laws after they are introduced in the first week of parliament starting on November 12.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The opposition will move amendments consistent with our pre-election commitments to terminate the carbon tax on the basis of moving to an effective emissions trading scheme," Mr Shorten said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Abbott argues his election win gives him a clear mandate to abolish Labor's carbon tax and associated climate change agencies and replace them with his Direct Action plan.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mr Shorten said Labor is not a "rubber stamp" for Mr Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We won't be bullied, and I won't be bullied by Tony Abbott merely because he doesn't accept the science of climate change," Mr Shorten said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Environment Minister Greg Hunt says the trading scheme is "exactly the same" as a carbon tax and the government would not support it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Hunt said repealing the carbon tax would save households $550 a year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Business Council of Australia chief Jennifer Westacott wants the opposition to support the coalition's legislation.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The last thing business and the economy needs is for actions by the parliament to lead to one of the world's highest carbon prices remaining in place for an extended and uncertain period," Ms Westacott said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under Labor's carbon pricing regime, big polluters paid a fixed price per tonne of emissions ahead of a planned shift to a market-based pricing mechanism in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new government has the numbers in the House of Representatives to pass its legislation but Labor and the Greens will amend the bills in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="14">The detail of Labor's amendments, which are yet to receive full caucus endorsement, will be released before parliament starts and the party will support a Senate inquiry into the bills.</seg>
<seg id="15">Labor's decision lays the groundwork for a possible double-dissolution election, which Mr Abbott has said is an option if he can't pass his bills.</seg>
<seg id="16">This could occur if the lower house fails to accept the Senate-amended bills, or the Senate rejects the bills outright, and the same thing occurs when they are reintroduced after a period of three months.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will not stop until the carbon tax is repealed," Mr Hunt said.</seg>
<seg id="18">We will take each step methodically and with complete intention until the carbon tax is repealed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The government is likely to get its way in the Senate after July 1 when conservative crossbench senators who oppose the carbon tax take up their seats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox says if governments and would-be governments want to reduce emissions, they need to adopt policies that operate at the least cost to preserve the competitiveness of trade exposed industry and provide a basis for long-term investment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Delaying the inevitable achieves nothing.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The parties should work together to remove the tax and to agree on how to meet their targets at least cost to the nation," Mr Willox said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="23">Australian Greens leader Christine Milne said now was not the time to delay with climate change and Labor should stand firm with her party and reject the repeal of the carbon tax.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The latest science is telling us we need to cut emissions much faster and much more deeply," she told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are calling on Labor to stop playing games with this.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."</seg>
<seg id="6">But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders are sceptical about this.</seg>
<seg id="17">Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.</seg>
<seg id="24">A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction."</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has always taken place.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.</seg>
<seg id="33">For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.</seg>
<seg id="35">Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="42">A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."</seg>
<seg id="43">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies."</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Union has a backup plan to supply Ukraine with gas and to reach an agreement with the IMF for an emergency loan if Russia undertakes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Negotiations are being conducted with the IMF for a standby loan, and another EU official who is directly involved in the negotiations has stated that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could also receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">Analysts surveyed by Reuters have doubts about whether Ukraine and the IMF can overcome their longstanding disagreements regarding the terms of financing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another organization that doubts the possibility of enacting the reforms required for such assistance is the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered Ukraine's sovereign credit rating by one level, from B to B-.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, representatives of the EU are saying that the IMF may show some flexibility in their loan terms after taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to its plan to support the country financially, the EU has a backup option to supply Ukraine with gas, most deliveries of which are currently coming from Russia.</seg>
<seg id="9">This could possibly include gas from Nord Stream or reverse deliveries from Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to officials, the latter option above would be the most feasible and acceptable method in case Russia "isolates" Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">Analysts believe that such a method involving reverse deliveries to Ukraine could only be used for a few weeks and would likely lead to reduced deliveries to other regions.</seg>
<seg id="12">"EU countries and the Ukrainians are conducting negotiations on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine could import gas from other sources instead of Russia, or from the same source but via other delivery routes," noted a source from Reuters.</seg>

<seg id="1">$325m rescue package for Tassie health</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state," Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.</seg>
<seg id="7">An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.</seg>
<seg id="8">There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little "unless it's followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing."</seg>
<seg id="14">He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list," Mr Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">what really goes on at inspections</seg>
<seg id="2">It would seem that many buyers, sellers, agents and neighbours have experienced some degree of open-house hysteria.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Fiona Morris</seg>
<seg id="4">For all the neatly angled flags, shining A-frame notices and freshly-stocked clipboards, the urban warfare of the Sydney open-house inspection has a slyly winking underbelly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Throwing the doors of our most valuable properties open to Joe Public has a way of bringing about the baddest of bad behaviour, from neighbourly sabotage to staged lunacy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Add to that the litany of minor accident booby-traps, alarm debacles and fiendish take-no-prisoners buying strategy, and the Saturday morning house-viewing session is ripe for drama - or slapstick at the very least.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those who should know how to avoid this better than anyone are the estate agents themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">Illustration: Cathy Wilcox</seg>
<seg id="9">One big operator in Sydney's blink-and-you're-gazumped property landscape laughs as he recalls a colleague's unfortunate first day on the job.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's this guy's first open inspection, he's got it all happening, the car's cleaned, brochures ready, clipboards ready.</seg>
<seg id="11">Achingly keen to please, the youngster bounds upstairs to check all is in place, connects with a low beam and half knocks himself out.</seg>
<seg id="12">The door bell rings and he's standing there with blood trickling down his head ... He left in an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="13">BresicWhitney director Adrian Oddi can only feel for the agent who turned up early to an open house in the inner west and, feeling a little frazzled, took a rest on the couch.</seg>
<seg id="14">He woke up half an hour later to a handwritten message on the coffee table: 'You looked tired, didn't want to wake you.</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm interested, so please give me a call."'</seg>
<seg id="16">Then there are the punters, from the voyeurs to the tyre-kickers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Take the eastern suburbs woman who recognised pictures and trophies from a rival school to her son's.</seg>
<seg id="18">She realised the resident boy had the medal for beating her son at a high-level inter-school final.</seg>
<seg id="19">She was tempted to steal the keepsake, but held back.</seg>
<seg id="20">Another recalls seeing framed photos of a former partner, and one buyer in Darlinghurst can't forget the time she was greeted with a sex swing.</seg>
<seg id="21">And let's not forget the inevitable calls of nature, a scatalogical stone best left unturned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Brad Pillinger, an estate agent since 1989, says the real fun begins when disgruntled tenants are involved in a sale.</seg>
<seg id="23">In one case of a flooded garden, "they 'accidentally' left the hose on outside"; pretended they weren't home - "I loudly declared I'd have to climb in through the window, and, suddenly, they miraculously 'heard' the doorbell," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">One agent tells of his associate calling him after walking in on a couple in flagrante delicto.</seg>
<seg id="25">"He's having a conversation with the guy while they're there, naked, like nothing was going on," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="26">I'll never forget that phone call.</seg>
<seg id="27">But thefts during open houses, it seems, have dwindled to an urban myth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The only post-inspection allegation of theft one agent said he had encountered was a tenant complaining that his marijuana had been pilfered.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police weren't called.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing, however, beats the odd moment of amateur dramatics.</seg>
<seg id="31">"There was a house in Rozelle that had a shared driveway," recounts an inner west agent.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The neighbour of the vendor would walk up and down the driveway and act a little bit loony, jump around and tell people 'You know this is mine, I can do anything I like."'</seg>
<seg id="33">He soon received a letter from a solicitor, threatening to sue him for the difference in house price and value should his behaviour affect the sale.</seg>
<seg id="34">We never heard from him again.</seg>
<seg id="35">And there isn't an agent or experienced seller in the land who is unfamiliar with the age-old trick of artful dissuasion.</seg>
<seg id="36">Lucy Macken, Title Deeds scribe at Fairfax Media's Domain, has heard every line in the book.</seg>
<seg id="37">"People who want to buy it often talk it down," she says.</seg>
<seg id="38">Look at these glass balustrades, oh, they're bad for kids.</seg>
<seg id="39">We'd have to spend a fortune on new windows/soundproofing/guttering.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash</seg>
<seg id="2">With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
<seg id="7">After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar</seg>
<seg id="2">English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="3">The exam will also feature "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading;</seg>
<seg id="4">A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped.</seg>
<seg id="5">From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will make changes in other core subjects next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.</seg>
<seg id="9">Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a "widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."</seg>
<seg id="10">Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="12">While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.</seg>
<seg id="13">The syllabus will place a greater focus on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Light and Dark of "A Midsummer Night's Dream"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sara Krulwich/The New York Times</seg>
<seg id="3">A scene from Britten's "Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Metropolitan Opera.</seg>
<seg id="4">It should not be strange to encounter any of Shakespeare's plays at any time of the year, so firmly ensconced are they in the canon.</seg>
<seg id="5">And yet there's something a little startling in the arrival of a production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" opening in November, as Julie Taymor's upcoming production at Theater for a New Audience will.</seg>
<seg id="6">The play is among Shakespeare's most beloved and most frequently produced, but it has mostly become a rite of summer, often performed outdoors, with picnickers sharing bottles of wine and children romping on grass.</seg>
<seg id="7">The title, naturally, has something to do with the play's usually being relegated to the sticky months.</seg>
<seg id="8">But "Dream" is also one of the most surefire comedies ever written, and it features not one, not two, not three, but four journeys (of sorts) ending in lovers" meeting.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shakespeare comedies often conclude with nuptials in the offing, but this play offers a stage full of contented lovers, gathering to watch a hilariously amateurish enactment of a love story - the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe - that ends rather more unhappily.</seg>
<seg id="10">That scene is among the most reliably hilarious in any Shakespeare play, and so is the scene in which Lysander and Demetrius, now both passionately declaring their love for a bewildered Helena, are joined by a dumbfounded Hermia, and a four-way game of verbal fisticuffs ensues.</seg>
<seg id="11">These passages rarely fail to engender merriment, which is another reason why "Dream" has become so popular: it's the rare production, amateur or professional, that doesn't nail at least these bits.</seg>
<seg id="12">Plus: fairies flitting around the stage, the wonderfully dopey Bottom, perhaps the greatest of Shakespeare's comic doofuses, and a fairly breezy running time.</seg>
<seg id="13">But what struck me most upon a recent re-reading of the play was not the dizzy joyousness of its comedy, and the sunlit ending, but instead the darkness from which all this benevolence emerges.</seg>
<seg id="14">"A Midsummer Night's Dream" may have earned its high berth on the Shakespeare hit parade because it's a bundle of high-spirited hijinks, but its view of love - the primary theme of the play - is decidedly divided.</seg>
<seg id="15">I noticed, among other things, how variations on the word "hate" recurs with startling frequency, and how each of the four romances depicted is shadowed by moments of betrayal, cruelty, deception - or worse.</seg>
<seg id="16">Consider the often-breezed-by opening moments, in which Theseus, the Duke of Athens, and his beloved Hippolyta, are preparing for their nuptial festivities.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rather bluntly, in what is just his second speech, Theseus recalls, "Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword, and won thy love doing thee injuries."</seg>
<seg id="18">Some versions of the story have Theseus capturing Hippolyta while waging war on the Amazons.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yikes!</seg>
<seg id="20">Not exactly what you'd expect a fellow to bring up during the wedding planning.</seg>
<seg id="21">Of course his next lines are a gallant vow to wed her in "another key," but the strange note of violence between men and women that has been so quickly struck will recur again and again throughout the play.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only moments later, in fact, that Theseus is threatening a young woman with death, when Egeus comes to the Duke to demand that his daughter Hermia obey his wish that she marry Demetrius, a desire she insists on flouting due to her love for Lysander.</seg>
<seg id="23">Love, it appears in this most love-struck play, can get you in deep, potentially fatal trouble.</seg>
<seg id="24">As in much of Shakespeare, the human heart and its movements are depicted as arbitrary, fickle, unreasonable and prey to outside influences.</seg>
<seg id="25">But few of his works offer as many and as memorable examples of the manner in which love can go awry.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the realm of the fairies, too, love is inconstant and inspires brutality when it is thwarted.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fairy king and queen, Oberon and Titania, are already mid-quarrel when they arrive on the scene.</seg>
<seg id="28">The primary beef between them is Oberon's rather arbitrary demand that Titania hand over one of her young attendants.</seg>
<seg id="29">The boy means much to her - in a moving, lyrical speech she describes how his mother, a great friend, died in childbirth - but Oberon's insistence on being given the "changeling boy" seems motivated only by a desire to assert his power.</seg>
<seg id="30">And of course the method by which Oberon punishes Titania for her refusal to grant his whim - by bewitching her into making love to an ass - is peculiarly perverse and humiliating (albeit, of course, very funny).</seg>

<seg id="1">Port Adelaide footy club offers Spring Gully help to get out of a pickle</seg>
<seg id="2">Power players Kane Mitchell and Tom Jonas with Spring Gully's Tegan Webb in the kitchen at Alberton yesterday.</seg>

<seg id="4">PORT Adelaide Football Club chief executive Keith Thomas knows exactly what debt-ridden SA family business Spring Gully is going through during its crisis.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year after the Power needed special financing from the AFL and SANFL to overcome its debt crisis, the AFL club next week will set about promoting the SA food producer before its critical meetings with creditors.</seg>
<seg id="6">Port Adelaide will give Spring Gully free advertising exposure on the two video screens and the boundary screens at AAMI Stadium during its next home game - against Richmond on Saturday week.</seg>
<seg id="7">Spring Gully, which is laden with $10 million of debt, also will be invited to load up a truck with company products to display at the West Lakes venue.</seg>
<seg id="8">The game will be played six days before an administrator decides if Spring Gully can continue.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have a lot of empathy for Spring Gully," Thomas said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have relied on support from others during difficult times - now we want to help an iconic South Australian company that has been a fantastic supporter of local sport.</seg>
<seg id="11">Power players Kane Mitchell and Tom Jonas enjoy sampling pickles with Spring Gully's Tegan Webb in the kitchen at Alberton.</seg>
<seg id="12">""Spring Gully has for a long time held up good values; it has made good products and we want to back them to continue doing such.""</seg>
<seg id="13">Thomas last month decided to have the AFL club back Spring Gully while meeting with SA Premier Jay Weatherill shortly after the company put itself under voluntary administration.</seg>
<seg id="14">""I said to Jay we don't want South Australian companies going under," Thomas said."</seg>
<seg id="15">""We have to do whatever we can to make sure Spring Gully doesn't fail.</seg>
<seg id="16">"They are thrilled and they are overwhelmed," he said of the company's reaction.</seg>
<seg id="17">Spring Gully family members Tegan and Russell Webb have described Port's offer as another sign of "fantastic support" from the community.</seg>
<seg id="18">Port is also dedicating its clash with Richmond to its charity arm, Foodbank, which will promote its End Hunger campaign during the match.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thomas hopes he can link Spring Gully and Foodbank together by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="20">That would be a great result if we can keep Spring Gully in business and then contributing food to the hungry through Foodbank.</seg>

<seg id="1">The speech gene has turned out to be a stimulator for the formation of synapses</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists from John Hopkins University and the School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have discovered a protein thanks to which the "speech gene" Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.</seg>
<seg id="3">The research has been published in Science, and its abstract can be read on the journal's website.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its role was able to be established in 2001 owing to the discovery of a family of several people who could not correctly pronounce words and sometimes even they themselves did not understand each other.</seg>
<seg id="6">Scientists ascertained that in members of the family the activity of the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted, though the manner in which it performs its function remained unknown.</seg>
<seg id="7">In new research, biologists have shown that Foxp2 performs at least a portion of its functions as a simulator of the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with speech formation.</seg>
<seg id="8">It does this owing to another gene, SRPX2.</seg>
<seg id="9">The latter was discovered as a result of a search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.</seg>
<seg id="10">SRPX2 proved to be one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, whereas only Foxp2 influences its activity.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fact that SRPX2 actually influences vocalization was confirmed by scientists in an experiment on mice.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the activity of the gene was artificially reduced in the animals, they screamed less when separated from mother.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of emitted sounds also was restored.</seg>
<seg id="14">Previously interconnection between vocalization and Foxp2 itself was also demonstrated on mice.</seg>
<seg id="15">Animals in which a human copy of the gene was introduced peeped more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus far, however, scientists do not know whether the function of Foxp2 and, consequently, of SRPX2 controlled by it, is linked with the purely "mechanical" properties of the formation of sounds or with more subtle processes.</seg>

<seg id="2">Flight Centre seem to be bucking the trend.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company has upgraded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="4">The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the $305 million to $315 million it previously forecast.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $290.4 million profit it achieved in 2011/12.</seg>
<seg id="6">Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-business travel.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Year-to-date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically our largest profit generators.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Australia the leisure business rebounded during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.</seg>
<seg id="10">Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less.</seg>
<seg id="11">Its US business had recovered its losses during its seasonally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Flight Centre shares were up 3c at $38.20 yesterday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Djokovic, Nadal, Federer, Ferrer Advance in Paris</seg>
<seg id="2">Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic overcame big servers Thursday to reach the Paris Masters quarterfinals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nadal beat last year's runner-up, Jerzy Janowicz, 7-5, 6-4, and Djokovic rallied from a set down to top John Isner 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-2.</seg>
<seg id="4">Roger Federer, defending champion David Ferrer, Juan Martin del Potro, Tomas Berdych, Stanislas Wawrinka and Richard Gasquet also won their third-round matches.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tournament has turned into a rehearsal for the ATP World Tour Finals, with the eight quarterfinalists also the eight players who qualified for the London tournament next week.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wawrinka and Gasquet grabbed the last two spots at the season ending-event when Berdych eliminated Milos Raonic of Canada 7-6 (3), 6-4.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nadal broke for a 6-5 lead before whipping a forehand winner down the line to take the first set.</seg>
<seg id="8">The top-seeded Spaniard and Janowicz traded breaks early in the second set before the Pole double-faulted to hand Nadal a 3-2 lead.</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. Open champion won when Janowicz's forehand sailed long.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I tried to move him, because if he plays in a good position, he has a great shot," Nadal said.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think for a moment my return was unbelievable today.</seg>
<seg id="12">I returned amazing balls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nadal will face Frenchman Gasquet, a 6-3, 6-2 winner over Japan's Kei Nishikori.</seg>
<seg id="14">Djokovic couldn't find a breakthrough in the first set as Isner saved six break points to force the tiebreaker and won it when Djokovic's backhand sailed wide.</seg>
<seg id="15">The second-seeded Serb raised his game in the second set, making only two unforced errors and breaking Isner twice.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I just needed to be very tough mentally and just believe I can make a break," Djokovic said.</seg>
<seg id="17">I knew as soon as I make a break I'm going to start playing better and relaxed in a way, so that's what happened.</seg>
<seg id="18">Djokovic won the last five games of the match, finishing off the American with a backhand volley.</seg>
<seg id="19">Djokovic stretched his winning streak to 14 matches after taking the China Open and the Shanghai Masters titles in October.</seg>
<seg id="20">"In China, I have had probably the best two weeks of the year, except at the beginning of the year, so it gives me a lot of confidence," Djokovic said.</seg>
<seg id="21">I feel that I'm back mentally where I need to be, and hopefully I can maintain this winning streak and I can kind of keep on playing better and better.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Australian Open champion will face Wawrinka, who beat Nicolas Almagro of Spain 6-3, 6-2.</seg>
<seg id="23">The seventh-seeded Swiss player overcame a 3-1 deficit in the first set and broke Almagro twice in the second.</seg>
<seg id="24">Federer also moved into the quarterfinals by dismissing Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 6-3, 6-4.</seg>
<seg id="25">The fifth-seeded Federer saved three break points and broke once in each set, improving his record against Kohlschreiber to 8-0.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I'm just really focused on trying to win as many matches as I can, get some momentum going, and getting in form," Federer said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I felt good again for the second straight day here in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's still early in the tournament, and it's a good thing that I feel so good so early.</seg>
<seg id="29">I hope to maintain this kind of a play, and if possible try to get just a touch better.</seg>
<seg id="30">Federer, who won the Paris Masters in 2011, will meet del Potro in a rematch of last weekend's Swiss Indoors final.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fourth-seeded Argentine overcame Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.</seg>
<seg id="32">Del Potro broke for a 5-4 lead in the deciding set before hitting a forehand winner on match point.</seg>
<seg id="33">Spain's Ferrer cruised past Gilles Simon of France 6-2, 6-3, to set up a match against Berdych.</seg>
<seg id="34">Berdych saved three set points in the tiebreaker against Raonic before firing a forehand winner to convert his sixth set point.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to the vice chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for informational and administrative issues Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the website was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our specialists quickly fixed everything, at this time operation of the site has been restored.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The damage inflicted on the ministry is minimal," Peterkop said to the publication Postimees.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Peterkop, so far it is early to talk about who organized the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and we will draw conclusions from that, but it is impossible to completely prevent similar incidents," he admitted.</seg>
<seg id="8">Let us recall that on November 1 the group Anonymous Ukraine posted an online message in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposed the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.</seg>
<seg id="9">We want the leaders of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.</seg>
<seg id="10">We must not be servants of NATO.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of member countries of NATO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ukraine does not need the NATO alliance.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ukraine does not need the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ukraine does not need Russia either.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ukraine must not be anyone's slave.</seg>
<seg id="16">We stand for an independent Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Hands off Ukraine," it says in the announcement of Anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="18">Previously the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that a marine company from the Feodosia detached battalion of marines will take part in command staff exercises of NATO reaction forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.</seg>

<seg id="1">Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</seg>
<seg id="2">19 October 2013 Last updated at 00:28 By Tim Harford & Ruth Alexander BBC News</seg>
<seg id="3">Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics.</seg>
<seg id="4">This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="5">Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune.</seg>
<seg id="6">His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother.</seg>
<seg id="7">He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="8">He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia.</seg>
<seg id="9">But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking.</seg>
<seg id="10">His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable.</seg>
<seg id="11">At first sight it's an odd idea.</seg>
<seg id="12">Why would the performance of a financial asset be random?</seg>
<seg id="13">The notion that, for example, regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke</seg>
<seg id="14">End Quote Eugene Fama</seg>
<seg id="15">But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that.</seg>
<seg id="16">Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's no economical model behind that.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The market will always be one step ahead of you.</seg>
<seg id="23">Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="27">People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do.</seg>
<seg id="28">So the market is always right.</seg>
<seg id="29">Or is it?</seg>
<seg id="30">A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT.</seg>
<seg id="31">He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true.</seg>
<seg id="32">His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news.</seg>
<seg id="33">"This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="34">I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this?</seg>
<seg id="35">I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect.</seg>
<seg id="36">And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles.</seg>
<seg id="37">It makes it into the heart of real world economics.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan.</seg>
<seg id="39">I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'</seg>
<seg id="40">The answer came that it was about 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="41">So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'</seg>
<seg id="42">Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous.</seg>
<seg id="43">"How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="44">Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="45">And they crashed too.</seg>
<seg id="46">Was he just lucky?</seg>
<seg id="47">What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble?</seg>
<seg id="48">Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price.</seg>
<seg id="49">What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio.</seg>
<seg id="50">They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="51">This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash.</seg>
<seg id="52">And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="53">So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time?</seg>
<seg id="54">There are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally</seg>
<seg id="55">End Quote Robert Shiller</seg>
<seg id="56">"I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says.</seg>
<seg id="57">And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right?</seg>
<seg id="58">Earnings are going up, prices are going up.</seg>
<seg id="59">But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="60">"The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says.</seg>
<seg id="61">I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="62">In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee.</seg>
<seg id="63">Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level.</seg>
<seg id="64">But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="65">We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="67">But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is the committee just hedging its bets?</seg>
<seg id="69">Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view.</seg>
<seg id="70">"It's a little bit like religion," he says.</seg>
<seg id="71">I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally.</seg>
<seg id="72">But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them.</seg>
<seg id="73">And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem.</seg>
<seg id="74">But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you?</seg>
<seg id="75">"I think there is room for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says.</seg>
<seg id="76">I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O leaving 2Day FM</seg>
<seg id="2">Kyle and Jackie O departure 'amicable'</seg>
<seg id="3">Kyle Sandliands and Jackie O have turned down 'a nice deal' to continue their breakfast show and are leaving 2Day FM after more than a decade on air together.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vision: Southern Cross Austereo</seg>
<seg id="5">PT1M59Shttp://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-2wol8620349November 1, 2013 - 11:50AM</seg>
<seg id="6">Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O are leaving 2Day FM at the end of the year after more than a decade on air together, Southern Cross Australia has announced.</seg>
<seg id="7">Contract negotiations between Australia's most successful FM radio duo have collapsed, with the pair not returning to the Austereo network in 2014, bringing to an end a decade of ratings dominance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Calling it quits: Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O. Photo: Lee Besford</seg>
<seg id="9">In a statement issued by the broadcaster on Friday morning, Southern Cross Austereo head of content Craig Bruce said: "We're proud that Kyle and Jackie have not only given Sydney radio audiences the most entertaining radio show ever, they have also raised millions of dollars for charities and those in need whilst also enthralling listeners with the world's hottest music artists and exclusive interviews with famous Hollywood celebrities.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They have certainly lived up to their show mantra "Breakfast with the Stars.""</seg>
<seg id="11">None of which could have happened without the strong and dedicated team working hard behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="12">There have been rumours that management for Sandilands and Jackie O (real name Henderson) had been locked in heated negotiations for the past two months as the pair attempted to increase their already significant pay deals with Southern Cross.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, recent years of controversy and increased frustration between management and the duo, particularly Sandilands, resulted in the contract impasse, culminating in this morning's announcement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their final show on the network is scheduled for November 29.</seg>
<seg id="15">A source close to the negotiations told Private Sydney this morning: "Kyle and Jackie were getting very frustrated by the negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="16">They were still football fields apart from each other after weeks of talks ... the weird thing is, I don't think they have any other place to go.</seg>
<seg id="17">Steve Allen, director of Fusion Strategy media marketing consultancy, said the show was the largest revenue generator in Australian radio, even eclipsing Alan Jones on 2GB, despite Jones having a larger audience.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Jones' audience isn't as attractive to advertisers as the ones tuning in to Kyle and Jackie O," Allen explained.</seg>
<seg id="19">Around $30 million worth of advertising a year is pumped into the show, according to research conducted by Fusion Strategy.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Advertisers are keen to target the youth market because they are considered a lucrative sector given their high discretionary income," Allen said.</seg>
<seg id="21">The pair also rank among the highest-paid voices on radio, their contracts worth around $1 million each, though heavy with bonus deals delivering lucrative incentives if the pair reach or improve on ratings targets.</seg>
<seg id="22">Southern Cross Austereo spokeswoman Lisa Schillaci says the network hasn't yet considered who might replace the popular breakfast duo.</seg>

<seg id="1">I know what you did continues.</seg>
<seg id="2">Once again, david muir.</seg>
<seg id="3">Reporter: When lieutenant john cleere re-opened the investigation into levi karlsen's death underneath that pickup truck, finding what he says is evidence his father was out for the insurance money, he never expected the dramatic turn.</seg>
<seg id="4">The case about to take all the way across the country, in a small mining town in the sierra foothills of california.</seg>
<seg id="5">And while you are investigating everything that happened here, you discover the story of his ex-wife.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reporter: Could you believe it?</seg>
<seg id="7">It certainly raised a lot of concerns.</seg>
<seg id="8">Reporter: The stunning discovery.</seg>
<seg id="9">Levi's mother christina, karl karlsen's first wife, died in a 1991 house fire.</seg>
<seg id="10">And who just happened to be the beneficiary of a $200,000 life insurance?</seg>
<seg id="11">Her husband, karl.</seg>
<seg id="12">She'd been a vibrant, doting mother.</seg>
<seg id="13">You can see her holding one of her three young children -- erin, levi and katie.</seg>
<seg id="14">We took walks.</seg>
<seg id="15">We went on picnics.</seg>
<seg id="16">We did crafts.</seg>
<seg id="17">You know, she taught me to cook, and was teaching me to sew.</seg>
<seg id="18">She literally did everything for me.</seg>
<seg id="19">She was just an amazing woman.</seg>
<seg id="20">Reporter: But erin claims her mother was trapped in that marriage.</seg>
<seg id="21">My father had a very horrible temper, and it didn't take an awful lot to set him off.</seg>
<seg id="22">And my mother would take the brunt of it.</seg>
<seg id="23">She would not allow him to, you know, to take it out on us.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reporter: The sister of that first wife remembers asking her the same question over and over.</seg>
<seg id="25">I kept asking her, you know, "why aren't you leaving him?"</seg>
<seg id="26">Why aren't you leaving him?</seg>
<seg id="27">And I almost had her convinced to leave.</seg>
<seg id="28">We were this close when the fire came through.</seg>
<seg id="29">Reporter: It was new years day 1991.</seg>
<seg id="30">The kids were napping.</seg>
<seg id="31">Christina was in the bathroom when their home suddenly lit up into a kerosene-fueled inferno.</seg>
<seg id="32">I remember waking up and going to my bedroom door, you know, could feel the heat.</seg>
<seg id="33">I saw the flames, so woke my sister up.</seg>
<seg id="34">My father, you know, bust through the window and, you know, got us out.</seg>
<seg id="35">Never once did he look panicked, or frantic, or frazzled.</seg>
<seg id="36">Not even confused.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was just very calm and "let's go."</seg>
<seg id="38">Reporter: In the fire report, karl karlsen told investigators that just three days before the fire, he'd repaired a broken window in the bathroom by boarding it up with a piece of wood and 17 nails.</seg>
<seg id="39">That window would have been his wife christina's only way out.</seg>
<seg id="40">And then, just a week after the fire, karl hit the road, leaving california with his three young children, returning to upstate new york to be near his family.</seg>
<seg id="41">And when he left, christina's sister says he took with him any chance of a thorough investigation into her sister's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">We all raised our concerns, that we thought the fire looked very suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="43">The sheriff's department didn't want to waste reeir sources.</seg>
<seg id="44">They let this guy walk out of the state of california and never went after him.</seg>
<seg id="45">Reporter: That was 17 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="46">Now two deaths, mother and son, each with a big payout for karl karlsen.</seg>
<seg id="47">Was he a man cursed with a family tragedies?</seg>
<seg id="48">Or was he murdering his own family members for money?</seg>
<seg id="49">A lot of people have said, when this guy needed money, a family member would die.</seg>
<seg id="50">There's definitely a pattern here.</seg>
<seg id="51">Reporter: Glenn coin, a reporter for the "syracuse post standard," has reported extensively on the case.</seg>
<seg id="52">20 days before christina dies, karl takes out a $200,000 life insurance policy.</seg>
<seg id="53">18-17 days before levi dies, karl takes out his $700,000 life insurance policy.</seg>
<seg id="54">According to the court records, he left both of them to die and walked away.</seg>
<seg id="55">Reporter: Tonight, authorities in california are now investigating too, after reopening the case of karl karlsen's first wife.</seg>
<seg id="56">And who was about to help investigate the take down?</seg>
<seg id="57">Karl karlsen's second wife, cindy.</seg>
<seg id="58">It would turn out his second and current wife, cindy, would play a critical role inhe arrest of her own husband.</seg>
<seg id="59">Reporter: You called his wife cindy.</seg>
<seg id="60">What did she say.</seg>
<seg id="61">Thank god you called.</seg>
<seg id="62">Reporter: She feared she could be next and moved out of their home she was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="63">Reporter: She was seeing a pattern.</seg>
<seg id="64">Was she convinced there was a killer in her home?</seg>
<seg id="65">I think she suspected it.</seg>
<seg id="66">She could there was an insurance policy on her.</seg>
<seg id="67">Reporter: On her, too.</seg>
<seg id="68">When you asked her to help her out.</seg>
<seg id="69">She agreed.</seg>
<seg id="70">Reporter: It was called operation abigail and went down at this local restaurant known for more its chicken wings than undercover stings.</seg>
<seg id="71">And "20/20" was taken right through it.</seg>
<seg id="72">So they walk in as a couple, and she's got the wire on where?</seg>
<seg id="73">Underneath her clothing.</seg>
<seg id="74">Reporter: And what does he think he's walking into?</seg>
<seg id="75">He thinks he's coming to talk to his wife about getting back together.</seg>
<seg id="76">Reporter: About reconciliation?</seg>
<seg id="77">Reporter: But she has no plans to get back together?</seg>
<seg id="78">Reporter: She's here for you?</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter: Cindy satown with her husband, that wire tap hidden, with one intention.</seg>
<seg id="80">To catch karl karlsen on tape confessing to levi's murder.</seg>
<seg id="81">A confession, she had told investigators, he had already made to her once before.</seg>
<seg id="82">They're sitting at a table, just the two of them.</seg>
<seg id="83">Reporter: And she's got a wire on the whole time?</seg>
<seg id="84">Reporter: As the couple is sitting here at the table, how many undercover investigators are sitting here in the restaurant?</seg>
<seg id="85">Four.</seg>
<seg id="86">And this is what they got.</seg>
<seg id="87">I mean you're sorry about it, right?</seg>
<seg id="88">Every minute of every day.</seg>
<seg id="89">I asked you if you pushed the truck, and you said yes.</seg>
<seg id="90">I didn't push the truck, i said.</seg>
<seg id="91">I said I had nothing to do, but I said I took advantage of the situation once it happened.</seg>
<seg id="92">And that is exactly what I said to you.</seg>
<seg id="93">Karl, you told me that you didn't set it up that way, but when you were in there you saw the opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="94">After it had happened.</seg>
<seg id="95">Then, I panicked and saw the opportunity to where like what you wrote, that's exactly what i said.</seg>
<seg id="96">One of the most significant remarks was that he took advantage of the opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="97">Reporter: Opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="98">A very strange word, for a father to use about a son's death.</seg>
<seg id="99">Yeah, I don't think a normal person would think of a death of their son as an opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="100">Reporter: A week later karl karlsen agrees to meet his wife again.</seg>
<seg id="101">But cindy and that team of investigators have other plans.</seg>
<seg id="102">So he thinks he's coming to meet her again?</seg>
<seg id="103">Reporter: But you're waiting for him this time.</seg>
<seg id="104">Reporter: And you haul him in for questioning.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asia factory sector upbeat, led by China</seg>
<seg id="2">BEIJING (Reuters) - Asian manufacturing activity picked up in October led by China, where factory sector growth hit its fastest pace in 18 months off the back of new orders, purchasing managers' reports showed on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The surveys provide a more upbeat view of world demand following a month in which a political standoff in Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling and the sixth straight cut in IMF global economic forecasts had raised fresh concerns about the health of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="4">China's official purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to 51.4 in October, up from 51.1 in September and above expectations for a reading of 51.2.</seg>
<seg id="5">A PMI reading above 50 suggests expansion from the previous month, while a figure below 50 points to contraction.</seg>
<seg id="6">"With global demand momentum likely to pick up gradually and domestic demand growth remaining solid, we expect GDP growth to comfortably exceed the government's bottom line in the coming quarters," Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS, said of the China PMI in a client note.</seg>
<seg id="7">The China PMI offered some support to weak Asian markets on Friday and data elsewhere in Asia also pointed to brighter economic prospects.</seg>
<seg id="8">The HSBC/Markit PMI for South Korea showed factory activity expanded for the first time in five months and separate data showed the country's exports in October handily beat expectations to hit a record high of $50.5 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">Factory activity in major exporter Taiwan, key to many global tech supply chains, was running at its fastest pace since March 2012, an HSBC/Markit PMI showed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan reported on Thursday that its factory activity grew at the fastest pace in more than three years as the Markit/JMMA PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.2, adding to hopes that the world's third-largest economy and home to big brand names like Sony and Toyota is pulling out of two decades of stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="11">PMI reports from India and the United States are expected later in the day.</seg>
<seg id="12">A euro zone PMI is due on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">The rise in China's official PMI offered some relief to the growth outlook for the economy after a disappointing run of data last month, which included an unexpected slide in exports.</seg>
<seg id="14">A breakdown of the sub-indexes showed that new orders in large industries reached 53.8, while for small industries the number was just 48.8, suggesting larger firms are benefiting more from the stabilizing economy.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The PMI data for October shows a continued increase, indicating a preliminary stabilization in the economy," Zhang Liqun, an economist at the cabinet think-tank Development Research Center, said in a statement released with the PMI.</seg>
<seg id="16">The foundation for a recovery is not yet solid.</seg>
<seg id="17">The HSBC/Markit PMI for China rose to 50.9 in October from 50.2 in September, suggesting factories were humming at their strongest pace in seven months.</seg>
<seg id="18">The figures showed a surprise jump in new export orders, with many factories reporting stronger demand from the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">Senate votes to oust Paraguay's president</seg>
<seg id="2">PARAGUAY'S Senate has voted to remove president Fernando Lugo from office.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a quick, five-hour trial, 39 senators voted to dismiss Lugo, while four senators voted against and two were absent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lugo will be replaced by Vice-President Federico Franco of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lugo moved quickly to accept the decision.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I subject myself to the decision of congress," Lugo said minutes after the legislature removed him from office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Today I say farewell as president of the Republic, but I don't say farewell as a Paraguayan citizen.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today it is not Fernando Lugo who has taken a blow," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is Paraguayan democracy that has been profoundly injured.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lugo called on his supporters to demonstrate their opposition to his dismissal, but he asked that they do so peacefully.</seg>
<seg id="11">Crowds of pro-Lugo protesters took to the streets condemning the impeachment trial and expressing support for the president.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in anti-riot gear drove them back on horseback and using water cannon.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Senate tried Lugo on five charges, including an alleged role in a deadly confrontation between police and landless farmers that left 17 dead.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lugo decided not to attend the trial, instead watching on television from the presidential palace while his lawyers spoke on his behalf.</seg>
<seg id="15">The impoverished, landlocked nation has a long history of political instability.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lugo was elected four years ago on promises of helping the South American country's poor, but his more moderate government allies have increasingly turned against him in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lugo's impeachment trial was triggered in part by an attempt by police to evict about 150 farmers from a remote, 4,900-acre (2,000-hectare) forest reserve, which is part of a huge estate owned by a Colorado Party politician.</seg>
<seg id="18">Six police officers, including the brother of Lugo's chief of security, and 11 farmers died in the clash last week.</seg>
<seg id="19">Lugo's political opponents blamed the president.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lugo has expressed sorrow at the confrontation and accepted the resignations of his interior minister and his chief of police.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we attempted to look at it in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="7">To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other</seg>
<seg id="10">Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.</seg>

<seg id="2">THE first catch of seafood from Japan's Fukushima coast since last year's nuclear disaster is being sold after passing radiation tests.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people</seg>
<seg id="5">Cast your vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="8">That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not easy," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people can die because they are waiting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.</seg>
<seg id="26">Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="29">And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their luck doesn't always hold out.</seg>
<seg id="33">They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We are receiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="38">They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This will change my future with my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I'm not sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.</seg>
<seg id="54">He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="57">That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.</seg>
<seg id="58">The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="59">But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He's a hero, without a doubt," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="61">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.</seg>
<seg id="62">For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.</seg>
<seg id="63">Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think about my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees what I am doing.</seg>
<seg id="67">To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.</seg>

<seg id="1">NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court froze court-ordered reforms to the New York City Police Department's controversial stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge who found the police tactic unconstitutional because she "ran afoul" of the judicial code of conduct.</seg>
<seg id="2">The three-judge panel said its ruling should have no impact on the merits of the case, but was a rebuke of Scheindlin, who became a hero of civil rights and civil liberties groups when, in August, she struck down parts of stop-and-frisk.</seg>
<seg id="3">The court's removal of U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin from the case was an exceedingly rare action and an indication of how displeased the judges were with her.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judges faulted Scheindlin for failing to appear impartial by making public statements about the case and by granting media interviews in which she answered critics of her ruling.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We could not be more pleased with the Court's findings," said Corporation Counsel Michael Cardozo, the city's chief attorney, who called Scheindlin's ruling "unjustified and deeply problematic."</seg>
<seg id="6">As part of her ruling, Scheindlin ordered a federal monitor to oversee changes to NYPD practices.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her ruling was widely celebrated by racial minorities in New York who complained that innocent people were being caught up in the police sweeps.</seg>
<seg id="8">The appeals court also took issue with how Scheindlin interacted with lawyers in a December 2007 hearing while she presided over another stop-and-frisk lawsuit involving some of the same lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good constitutional case, why don't you bring a lawsuit?</seg>
<seg id="10">Scheindlin asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">What I am trying to say - I am sure I am going to get in trouble for saying it - for $65 you can bring that lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="12">She said the lawyers could mark it as "related," ensuring that it would be assigned to her docket rather than to another judge at random.</seg>
<seg id="13">De Blasio, who said stop-and-frisk was evidence of "two New Yorks" - one for the privileged elite and another for the poor and disadvantaged - said he was "extremely disappointed in today's decision."</seg>
<seg id="14">"We have to end the overuse of stop-and-frisk and any delay only means a continued and unnecessary rift between our police and the people they protect," de Blasio said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Police supporters applauded the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="16">"That's great news," said former NYPD Commissioner Howard Safir.</seg>
<seg id="17">Stop-and-frisk is a legal tactic, not a policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">"What police are doing are stopping people based on victims' descriptions" of perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heather MacDonald, author of the book "Are Cops Racist?" and a vigorous defender of the NYPD's use of stop-and-frisk, also celebrated the ruling but said it was no indication the appeals court would overturn Scheindlin's ruling.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Appellate judges tend to take a deferential stance towards trial judges' fact-finding, and that's what a lot of this case hangs on," Mac Donald said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Luc Besson has attacked paparazzi in Taiwan for disrupting the shooting of his latest film by taking photographs of leading lady Scarlett Johansson.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a press conference in Taipei, the French film-maker said shooting had been "a nightmare" due to constant press intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I lost a bit of my concentration," admitted the Fifth Element director.</seg>
<seg id="5">Besson spent 11 days in Taipei filming Lucy, in which Johansson plays a drug mule endowed with superhuman abilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">It had been reported Besson's crew were nearly involved in a car accident last weekend with a vehicle driven by local press.</seg>
<seg id="7">The alleged incident led the city's mayor to call on the media to exercise restraint.</seg>

<seg id="9">Speaking to reporters on Friday, Besson said it was his right to keep such details as Johansson's hair style and wardrobe out of the public eye until his film was released.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We don't want pictures with new dresses of Scarlett," he said while denying reports he had wanted to leave Taiwan early in protest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Photos taken of the 28-year-old actress on set have shown her sporting a blonde bob, a leopard print jacket and a cowboy hat.</seg>
<seg id="12">No release date has been set for the movie, which will see Johansson appear alongside US veteran Morgan Freeman and South Korean star Choi Min-sik.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besson's crime comedy The Family, starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, is released in the UK on 22 November.</seg>

<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned of risks for the Russian economy</seg>
<seg id="2">Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks for the key driver of the fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is primarily a crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer loans and massive job cuts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our main concern now is not the slowing of growth, but rather the structure of that growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">Recently growth has been fully determined by consumption, which is seeing virtually no slowdown," said the chief economist for Goldman Sachs of Russia, Clemens Grafe while presenting the investment bank's quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Presently, the nominal growth of wages in Russia is around 10%.</seg>
<seg id="7">With 6% inflation, it could keep the future consumer demand at approximately the current level, anticipates Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the profitability of Russian companies is going down, therefore they will most likely begin optimizing personnel costs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today we are seeing substantial growth in the wage share of GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP grows only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.</seg>
<seg id="10">Companies have been confronted with reduced profitability.</seg>
<seg id="11">If it does not grow, this could lead to layoffs and growth of unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian business has no choice but to increase wages, comments the chief economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and CIS countries Vladimir Pantyushin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.</seg>
<seg id="14">In order to lure employees from outside or retain existing ones, employers have to raise wages.</seg>
<seg id="15">Consumption in Russia is supported also by a rapid growth of consumer loans.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of loan does not exert a multiplier effect on the country's economy.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have not seen any benefits to the economy from the growth in consumer loans, money is not distributed throughout the economy, but is returned to the same banks in the form of interests payments," said the economist.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the problem lies elsewhere- Goldman Sachs anticipates a growth in delinquency on unsecured loans.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are primarily taken out by modest-income people who have nothing to provide as collateral.</seg>
<seg id="20">The interest rates for such loans are high.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, they are more often not paid back," noted Mr. Grafe.</seg>
<seg id="22">Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured loans.</seg>
<seg id="23">The director of the Banking Institute of the Higher School of Economics Vasiliy Solodkov is now already seeing signs of an imminent banking crisis.</seg>
<seg id="24">Minor credit organizations that do not have the same access to cheap resources as state banks were forced to attract funds from the general population at high interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="25">In response, state banks went on the warpath and began to reduce lending rates, continues the economist.</seg>
<seg id="26">Minor credit organizations cannot offer loans with those same interest rates, otherwise they would have a negative interest margin.</seg>
<seg id="27">If state banks do not forgo dumping, Russia will face a full-scale banking crisis, supposes Vasiliy Solodkov.</seg>
<seg id="28">The economist considers the revocation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks to be a harbinger of a massive crash.</seg>
<seg id="29">"State banks themselves will not be able to handle such a situation: the endowment insurance system was not initially designed to handle a systemic crisis," warns the head of the institute.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, the growth of consumption will slow even without a non-payment crisis, they propose in the investment bank - due to the refusal to adjust the wages of government employees and military personnel pledged in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">Partially, the blow on consumption will be softened by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by reducing inflation).</seg>
<seg id="32">But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no preconditions for that so far - see the reference), growth of consumption will nevertheless be slowed, they are confident at Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="33">Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital so far sees no preconditions for the actualization of pessimistic scenarios.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The main risk is still a drop in the price of oil," he says.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to his assessment, Russia's economy will begin to contract at an oil price lower than 90 dollars per barrel.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Goldman Sachs they have also noted that the Central Bank is so far unable to reduce interest rates in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="37">A paradoxical picture is being observed: inflation decreased, but banks began to raise rates.</seg>
<seg id="38">This could mean that they did not believe the Central Bank when it announced the transition to inflation targeting," said Clemens Grafe.</seg>
<seg id="39">The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not influence market rates, it influences only the rates of interbank lending.</seg>
<seg id="40">"For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hope," assessed Clemens Grafe.</seg>
<seg id="41">Money obtained at Central Bank auctions are not used by banks to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity</seg>
<seg id="42">As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, this means that funds attempt to escape to speculations against the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Sooner or later, Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work," said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the government plans to "free float" the ruble by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, they must either do this sooner, or raise the key rate of Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to his assessment, the exchange rate of the ruble is currently artificially elevated by 10%.</seg>
<seg id="46">The ruble has only one way out - to weaken, - concludes the expert.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if Central Bank instills in financiers even a shadow of doubt that liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy for weakening of the ruble, this could bring down the ruble much more strongly.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC News - Doing church without God</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 09:56 By Robert Pigott Religious affairs correspondent, BBC News</seg>
<seg id="3">Watch: Inside a meeting of The Sunday Assembly</seg>
<seg id="4">St John the Evangelist in Leeds can rarely have hosted such an ungodly meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sunday Assembly - dedicated to providing "the best of church but without God" - was on the latest stop of its UK tour.</seg>
<seg id="6">Spilling out through the open door of the 400-year-old church came voices united in a rendering of Queen's Don't Stop Me Now.</seg>
<seg id="7">Inside, a couple of hundred people - average age about 35 - clapped rhythmically, swaying in the venerable pews.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for the choice of music it was just like a certain sort of church.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jesus jokes</seg>
<seg id="10">There was an overhead projector, a small team to lead the singing and a charismatic figure using his rangy body to urge on the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="11">He is one of two stand-up comedians who co-founded the Sunday Assembly - Sanderson Jones.</seg>
<seg id="12">Compared to the big zero that awaits, a cup of coffee can be transcendental, the touch of a lover's hand can be mystical</seg>
<seg id="13">End Quote Sanderson Jones Co-founder of the Sunday Assembly</seg>
<seg id="14">During the evening I asked him whether having this long-haired, bearded figure at the front, calling on people to follow him reminded audiences of anyone.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had long hair and a beard long before starting the Sunday Assembly," said Mr Jones.</seg>
<seg id="16">But it does mean that Jesus jokes do get made.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is something vaguely messianic about Sanderson Jones and his humanist project.</seg>
<seg id="18">He talks about its mission statement - to live better, help often and wonder more - with proselytising zeal.</seg>
<seg id="19">He wants to raise half a million pounds to spread the word throughout the world, starting hundreds, or even thousands, of assemblies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We come from nothing and we go to nothing," he insists.</seg>
<seg id="21">Compared to the big zero that awaits, a cup of coffee can be transcendental, the touch of a lover's hand can be mystical.</seg>
<seg id="22">If you don't believe in God that just makes life even more precious.</seg>
<seg id="23">The inherent preciousness of life, and the human capacity to do and experience good without contact with the divine, breathe through the programme.</seg>
<seg id="24">The event is a brazen copy of a church service.</seg>
<seg id="25">As well as emotional and uplifting songs, there was a talk from a woman who had turned her life around by volunteering, another from a scientist about the human propensity to misperceive reality and a minute's silent reflection.</seg>
<seg id="26">During a rendering of Dire Straits' Walk Of Life a collection was taken.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We both wanted to do something like church but without God and we just nicked the order of service," admits Mr Jones.</seg>
<seg id="28">People want to think about improving themselves and helping other people and doing all of that in a community where you forge strong relationships.</seg>
<seg id="29">I mean what a package.</seg>
<seg id="30">Why on earth wouldn't you nick it?</seg>
<seg id="31">The project is designed to appeal not just to atheists but also to agnostics, or the "spiritual seekers" that churches may find difficult to hold on to.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of the organisers, Andy Nightingale, belongs to what he said was a conservative Baptist church in Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="33">He said fellow Baptists would understand his active role in the Sunday Assembly and had been happy to lend their overhead projector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"They wouldn't be surprised," said Mr Nightingale.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Sunday Assembly doesn't dismiss the church, it welcomes people from all faiths.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's really important to spend time understanding people who have different views.</seg>
<seg id="37">Sitting discreetly near the back was the only person present wearing a clerical collar.</seg>
<seg id="38">Canon Adrian Alker's job is to attract people like Andy to the Church of England by fostering imaginative new ways for it to practise and explain Anglican Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="39">He accepted that many in the Church's target audience have become disenchanted with what they perceive to be compulsory but dubious doctrines - such as a belief in the birth of Jesus to a virgin and that Jesus was physically resurrected from the dead.</seg>
<seg id="40">Canon Alker said the answer was not for the Church to place less emphasis on God, but actually to make more effort to explain a more nuanced idea of what God was.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I think doctrine does develop," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">It wasn't born in Palestine 2,000 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="43">I think there should be open discussion, and [there] often is, about these core elements of the Christian faith.</seg>
<seg id="44">Sanderson effect</seg>
<seg id="45">After a final song, nearly everyone stayed for superior tea and cake, served at the back of the church.</seg>
<seg id="46">The verdict was overwhelmingly positive.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I didn't know what to expect," said one 20-something woman, "but it's something I've been looking for for a while.</seg>
<seg id="48">So I think I'll be coming again.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I've said it before, that I wish there was a church I could go to, but I don't believe in God," said another.</seg>
<seg id="50">Because they used humour I think that made it really accessible.</seg>
<seg id="51">The Sunday Assembly - a brand its creators are determined to protect - is to continue meeting in Leeds, although I could not help feeling they would miss the "Sanderson effect" - the warm energy emanating from the front of the church.</seg>
<seg id="52">For Sanderson Jones himself, the end of his UK tour signals the start of a more ambitious overseas project starting in the US.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the very moment public trust in religious institutions is wavering, this irreligious movement is building an institution of its own.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Buzz: Richmond star Jack Riewoldt must get on with playing good footy</seg>
<seg id="2">Richmond star Jack Riewoldt has mixed his form during the first five weeks of the season.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: The Australian</seg>
<seg id="4">JACK Riewoldt plays his football as if the world is against him.</seg>
<seg id="5">His running battle with the umpires barely ceases, he plays for free kicks just a little too often, and his body language guarantees he is the centre of attention.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the dual Coleman Medallist is flying for marks and dominating opponents it is just the fun of the fair, theatrics which guarantee the spectacle is enhanced.</seg>
<seg id="7">But when Richmond loses a critical game by less than a goal - and Riewoldt kicks a solitary goal - it becomes way more than a sideshow.</seg>
<seg id="8">Riewoldt the Great has turned into Petulant Jack again, and it's time for his coach and fellow leaders to pull him back into line.</seg>
<seg id="9">He play-acted, bayed for frees and generally acted the fool on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the bigger problem was he refused to fly for marks or lead up at the ball, content to let an elite opponent in Luke McPharlin - and the fact he was outnumbered by Docker defenders - ruin his day.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twice in the last 96 seconds of the game, with Richmond searching for the match-winning goal, he was outmarked or failed to bring the ball to ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">If he busted a gut and got rolled by a better player then so be it, but the theatrics made you feel he was content to wait for another day and an easier opponent.</seg>
<seg id="13">It mirrored his performance against the Western Bulldogs, when he kicked three of his five goals in junk time, was defended against claims he was "petulant" by Damien Hardwick and somehow got a vote from one of the two coaches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Triple premiership forward and former Carlton captain Mark Maclure was particularly blunt on the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jack Riewoldt.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fair dinkum.</seg>
<seg id="17">What a prima donna.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's about time he actually stood up himself and did something," was Maclure's assessment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Buzz went to Maclure again yesterday in search of a remedy and he raised a comparison that should stop Riewoldt's silliness in its tracks.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has to be fixed by his peers.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's his biggest problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">Are they strong enough to control him? ...</seg>
<seg id="23">He is totally in control of that club.</seg>
<seg id="24">(Brett) Deledio and (Trent) Cotchin have to handle this bloke.</seg>
<seg id="25">"They have to change this guy and they have to make him one of them, because at the moment he's not," Maclure said.</seg>
<seg id="26">He reminds me of someone else I know.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is the path they go along and it all ends in tears.</seg>
<seg id="28">Seven years on we are still seeing this.</seg>
<seg id="29">""That's the syndrome of a poor club, and Carlton were a poor club when it happened with (Brendan) Fevola.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it reflects on coaching staff, management and the players.""</seg>
<seg id="31">Riewoldt only has to rewind five weeks to turn this latest episode full circle.</seg>
<seg id="32">The man, who in 2010 flipped the bird against Hawthorn and berated his own teammates, was lauded for a 0.4 game in which he selflessly led into space.</seg>
<seg id="33">Then he starred with seven goals against St Kilda, repeatedly jumping at the ball whether the Sherrin stuck or not.</seg>
<seg id="34">Maclure says Riewoldt needs to be more selfless when an opponent is on top, or believes Richmond will never achieve true success.</seg>
<seg id="35">""The players have got to pull him in and say, 'Come with us, or we are going to cut you free.'</seg>
<seg id="36">They will never win one the way he is going.</seg>
<seg id="37">Who does he kick his goals against?</seg>
<seg id="38">Against the s--- clubs.</seg>
<seg id="39">He is a flat track bully who doesn't kick them against the big teams.</seg>
<seg id="40">(Against McPharlin) he didn't go at the ball.</seg>
<seg id="41">You have to open up space, and that was Jack's job.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had to take opponents away from (Tyrone) Vickery and instead he blued when people didn't kick it on his chest.</seg>
<seg id="43">You don't see Tom Hawkins, or Harry Taylor, or James Podsiadly carrying on like that, because they come from an elite club and an elite culture.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's time for Riewoldt to forget the distractions and take on the Cats on Saturday night in what is a huge game for his side.</seg>
<seg id="45">Bulldog Brett Goodes in action.</seg>
<seg id="46">SEEN a bloke called Brett Goodes play?</seg>
<seg id="47">He kicks it like a dream, gets physical at every opportunity, and altogether looks like he is making up for the decade of AFL football denied him through various circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="48">If there was ever a pin-up boy for the mid-season draft, the Western Bulldogs footballer is it.</seg>
<seg id="49">In a week where Adelaide's premiership hopes went one ugly snap of Tex Walker's anterior cruciate ligament, discussion about the mid-season draft has again been raised.</seg>
<seg id="50">Yet why does the AFL continue to pay lip service to the notion, floating it sporadically yet never fully committing, when it seems such a no-brainer?</seg>
<seg id="51">As recently as this year's equalisation talks the option of a mid-season trade or draft period was raised by the AFL as one way of keeping teams even.</seg>
<seg id="52">Yet the salary cap ramifications of trading highly-paid ageing stars for the trade of an early draft picks or 21-year-old kids immediately puts the kybosh on the trade option.</seg>
<seg id="53">How could Collingwood or Hawthorn afford to replace an injuried star with another from a lowly-placed club mid-year: it just can't work.</seg>
<seg id="54">When the Buzz went asking clubs about the potential for the mid-season draft raised in those equalisation talks just days later. most clubs couldn't even remember it being mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="55">It seems it is a perennial distraction thrown around at times when attention is turned to other more nefarious subjects.</seg>
<seg id="56">So how could the mid-season draft actually work in the AFL, as distinct from some ambit claim that drags in radio talk-back callers.</seg>
<seg id="57">The AFL does allow clubs to hold open one rookie spot on their list until the end of the pre-season, then fill it for a need.</seg>
<seg id="58">But clubs almost never take up the option, aware that player must train with them all summer without even the promise of a spot on a rookie list.</seg>
<seg id="59">Most clubs don't know by March that all three of their ruckmen will fall over, or that one star forward will leave in a blaze of salary-cap cheating and the other will do his ACL, neither of them to be adequately replaced.</seg>
<seg id="60">The only way the mid-season draft would work is if each of the 18 clubs could add one player to their list from a state league in around June each season if the need arose.</seg>
<seg id="61">It would work for a team like Collingwood, aware that as much as they will try to paper over holes they have no player on their list to fill the small defender role of Alan Toovey.</seg>
<seg id="62">It would allow Adelaide to consider the best SANFL prospect already overlooked if they felt that player was a better fit than Shaun McKernan, Walker's nominal backup.</seg>
<seg id="63">Think of the romance of a player like Andrew Krakouer, setting the WAFL afire in 2010, being injected into an AFL team destined for glory.</seg>
<seg id="64">Or what it would do for the standard in any of those state-based competitions if the prize for domination could be mid-season elevation to the big time.</seg>
<seg id="65">If only one player was available per team, it would not ravage the state-based leagues of talent but rather add a frisson of excitement to weekly proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="66">What if a club so desperate for forward options and with a coach on the brink of survival plucked Brendan Fevola from bush footy in desperation?</seg>
<seg id="67">It might be totally outlandish, but in a sporting realm that dines out on rags-to-riches sagas, the AFL has that epic sagas in short supply.</seg>
<seg id="68">James Podsiadly, Michael Barlow, Orren Stephensen, Alex Silvagni, Nick Duigan, Sam Rowe, Nick Kommer, Aaron Davey and more could all have been plucked a year or more early from their state-based leagues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Flight diverted to Phoenix after undisclosed threat</seg>
<seg id="2">Thu Oct 31, 2013 10:16pm EDT</seg>
<seg id="3">(Reuters) - A United Airlines commuter flight carrying 47 people from San Francisco to San Antonio was diverted to Phoenix on Thursday after an undisclosed threat was made against the plane, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">After making the unscheduled landing at about 4:45 p.m. local time, the plane was sent to an isolated portion of the airport, where its passengers were evacuated while local police investigated, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The threat, which came on Halloween, was found on the plane, said Sergeant Steve Martos, a spokesman for the Phoenix police department.</seg>
<seg id="6">He did not release further details.</seg>
<seg id="7">An initial search of the aircraft by investigators and police dogs did not turn up any dangerous materials, Martos said.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he said further investigation by his department's bomb squad was still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="9">The FBI will investigate the threat, Martos added.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julie Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, said that no flight delays or roadway restrictions were expected as a result of the unscheduled landing or the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Perth Wildcats overcome Wollongong thanks to Jermaine Beal's outside shooting</seg>
<seg id="2">Jermaine Beal was a shining light in Perth's win over Wollongong.</seg>
<seg id="3">A THREE-point shooting barrage from Jermaine Beal in the first quarter helped the Perth Wildcats kill off Wollongong early on their way to an 87-47 rout at Perth Arena.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Cats celebrated their 500th all-time home game in style with a thumping win in front of a packed crowd to underline their status as title favourites early in the season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The win saw the Wildcats equal their best start to an NBL campaign and remain clear at the top of the table with a 6-0 record.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perth outplayed, outworked and outclassed the Hawks in every department, most notably shooting, with the home side registering a 46 per cent clip from the field and 50 per cent from long range.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hawks could only manage a 30 per cent effort from the field, were smashed 47-26 in the rebound count, and suffered multiple shot-clock violation turnovers to leave coach Gordie McLeod frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="8">Beal splashed five first-term triples in a scintillating outside shooting display to give Perth a double-digit buffer it would never relinquish.</seg>
<seg id="9">The import guard also connected on a tough connected layup in the third term to add further polish to his 21-point effort, which came on the back of two standout performances last week on the road.</seg>
<seg id="10">Damian Martin provided fine support for Beal's early blitz, with the Wildcats skipper scoring 13 of his 16 points before half time.</seg>
<seg id="11">Martin added five points in the final 30 seconds of the first half, including a running floater as time expired to give the home side a 20-point cushion at the main break.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Cats" dominant first half display came despite a quiet start from October's NBL Player of the Month James Ennis, who was scoreless in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the import refused to stay quiet for long, finishing with 17 points, nine rebounds, and throwing down a ferocious one-handed slam.</seg>
<seg id="14">In contrast, Hawks counterpart Kevin Tiggs had a night to forget.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tiggs had just six points, including a botched dunk attempt and a pass to a phantom teammate in the second term.</seg>
<seg id="16">Veteran Oscar Forman (12 points) was the only Hawk to reach double-digits in a forgettable display from the foundation club.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perth will enjoy a rare weekend off next week, while Wollongong must regroup quickly ahead of a home date with reigning champs New Zealand on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Friday's other game, Brad Hill scored the game-winning basket with just four seconds remaining to help Sydney edge Townsville 88-86.</seg>

<seg id="1">Suspect charged in connection with four deaths in Pennsylvania</seg>
<seg id="2">AN Allentown, Pennsylvania, man was charged today in the stabbing deaths of four people in Northampton, Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Morning Call said Michael Eric Ballard, 36, was charged with four counts of criminal homicide.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three bodies were found yesterday in the living room of the Northampton home - about 150km west of New York - and a fourth was found in the basement, Lehighvalleylive.com reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli described the scene as "very bloody."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I've been DA 18 years, and I've never seen anything like this in my life," Mr Morganelli said.</seg>
<seg id="7">MMr organelli said the bodies of the Northampton victims were found after a car crashed in a wooded area.</seg>
<seg id="8">Police said a man involved in the car wreck told officers about the stabbings while he was held in custody.</seg>

<seg id="1">Where Horses Wet Their Whistles</seg>
<seg id="2">Museum of the City of New York</seg>
<seg id="3">Draft horses at one of New York's many fountains in 1913, by which time the automobile was coming up fast from behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">So, with both main mayoral candidates opposed to allowing horse-drawn carriages in the streets, a major chapter in the history of New York may be about to close.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first horses served man here no later than the 1620s, and since then they have pulled, plodded, trotted and galloped in our service.</seg>
<seg id="6">True, they have endured many horrors under the human hand, but we have not been entirely ungrateful, and John Hooper's monumental 1894 fountain at West 155th Street and St. Nicholas Place is a moving tribute, even if it has no customers.</seg>
<seg id="7">New York in the 19th century was an astonishingly cruel place - for children, for the poor, for the sick.</seg>
<seg id="8">So it was not hard to turn a blind eye to even the most ghastly kinds of animal cruelty, even after Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in 1866.</seg>
<seg id="9">Horses were routinely turned out into the street to collapse and die, days later.</seg>
<seg id="10">Drivers mercilessly beat their animals, or ran them lame, with open sores, in all weather.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clay McShane and Joel A. Tarr's 2007 book, "The Horse in the City: Living Machines in the 19th Century" (Johns Hopkins University Press), suggests that the larger companies relying on horses had great incentive to treat them well.</seg>
<seg id="12">For instance, in 1874 the horsecar lines began stopping only at corners, rather than wherever they were hailed, because it was easier on the horses.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were then about 40,000 horses in New York City.</seg>
<seg id="14">The industry calculated that 2.5 miles per hour was the optimum speed for horses, because they could pull a heavy load much farther at that rate than at 10 miles per hour.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many street railway companies restricted a horse's time on the street to five hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a parallel horse community in New York: the animals of the rich, which were brushed and washed and bedded down on thick straw in sumptuous private stables, including the block on 73rd from Lexington to Third Avenue in Manhattan; and, in Brooklyn, Vanderbilt and Waverly Avenues, which are the flanking service streets to the mansions of Clinton Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="17">Few of those horses felt the lash, or suffered bleeding wounds, or endured thirst on hot days.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the others, public fountains were erected at least as early as the 1860s, often in conjunction with those for dogs and humans.</seg>
<seg id="19">The businessman John Hooper left $5,000 in his will for what one of the most elaborate troughs in the city, at West 155th Street, designed by George Martin Huss and completed in 1894.</seg>
<seg id="20">Centered on a stone shaft, it has a wide circular basin on one side for horses, small ground-level bowls for dogs and, on the other side, a drinking tap for humans.</seg>
<seg id="21">Atop the stone shaft is a pierced metal globe, illuminated from within.</seg>
<seg id="22">This elegance formed a strange counterpoint to continued, regular cruelty to animals.</seg>
<seg id="23">For instance, among those arrested in 1893 was a driver who beat his draft horse with a whip handle so hard that the animal lost an eye; in 1894 a Columbus Avenue expressman was arrested for stabbing his horse to get him going.</seg>
<seg id="24">Few city fountains had the architectural ambition of Hooper's, but there are still about a dozen similar to the simple troughs on Central Park South at Fifth and the Avenue of the Americas now used by the carriage horses.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to research conducted by Michele Bogart, a professor at Stony Brook University who has written widely on civic art, the A.S.P.C.A. alone had put up more than 100 such fountains by the early 1900s.</seg>
<seg id="26">This burst of civic empathy took place just as the horse's place in the economy of the city was waning.</seg>
<seg id="27">According to "The Horse in the City," streetcar interests calculated in 1890 that electric streetcars cost 2 cents a mile, whereas horsepower cost 4 cents a mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">After 1900 the advent of steam and gasoline vehicles forecast the end of the horse's utility.</seg>
<seg id="29">In 1931 The New York Times reported that 8,000 horses were resident in Manhattan, served by 44 fountains and watering troughs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Horse-drawn vehicles still delivered milk, ice and other items, since the horse could proceed on its own to the next delivery point, while the driver made the drop.</seg>
<seg id="31">In August of 1946 The Times profiled John Gauci, who served as the A.S.P.C.A's inspector of watering troughs, fending off people who used them as ashtrays, oceans for toy boats or basins for washing laundry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr. Gauci, the newspaper reported, "frequently finds dead fish in the troughs," which "horses don't like any better than you do."</seg>
<seg id="33">That summer the A.S.P.C.A. operated a horse-watering truck, but it and Mr. Gauci's position were on their way out.</seg>
<seg id="34">The present controversy turns not just on the driving of carriages in Central Park, but also on the distance that the approximately 200 carriage horses must travel through heavy traffic from their stables on the Far West Side.</seg>
<seg id="35">Nineteenth-century New Yorkers would be astounded at the idea that such a modest trip constitutes a hardship, but over the years, the concept that carriage operations amount to cruelty has gained ground, and the mayoral candidates, Joseph J. Lhota and Bill de Blasio, have both called for the end of the practice.</seg>
<seg id="36">It appears that the sound of clip-clopping hooves, except for those of police horses, may soon vanish from the streets of New York, just as the private stables were long ago converted to studios and garages.</seg>
<seg id="37">The drinking troughs on Central Park South may go dry; you can't lead a horse to water if there's no horse.</seg>

<seg id="1">After being accused of bad taste Evgenia Vasilyeva began to talk</seg>
<seg id="2">Evgenia Vasilyeva, whose persona has riveted the close attention of the media for almost a year, until now has not once commented on the multiple publications in the press about embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense as well as about her personally - relations with former defense minister Anatoliy Serdyukov, her poetry and passion for valuable things.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, on November 1 the figurante in the "Defense service" affair broke her silence.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with Life News Vasilyeva stated: "From the beginning, of course, there was exactly one objective: pry from me any negative information in relation to the former defense minister."</seg>
<seg id="5">There was blackmail in respect to the fact that I have to give testimony, otherwise they will send me to prison.</seg>
<seg id="6">Presently those threats have ceased.</seg>
<seg id="7">Next we are going to court, we will prove our innocence.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are 100 percent sure of victory.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, from the interview one can conclude that, perhaps, Vasilyeva was most offended by words to the effect that she has poor taste.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is probably in reference to the statement of the official representative of the RF Investigative Committee Vladimir Markin that fakes were detected in the collection of paintings collected by the figurante in the "Defense service" affair.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the proprietress, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, a fine art appraisal appointed by investigators after the arrest of the paintings established that they have no artistic value and, to put it plainly, are cheap fakes," noted Markin in the beginning of October.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...</seg>
<seg id="14">Then they nevertheless admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, and also said that I have poor taste.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss certain personal aspects?</seg>
<seg id="16">In my opinion, this is simply an outrage," Vasilyeva says.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, in response to the question, does she admit her guilt in even one of the 12 criminal counts imputed to her, Vasilyeva stated: "Of course not.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is really nothing to admit.</seg>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, the damage to the Russian Federation at issue does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are simply deceiving the people, end of story.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, in response to today's announcement by the RF Investigative Committee that Vasilyeva is evading familiarization with materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the figurante declared that the "investigator is not letting him and his client familiarize themselves with the materials of the case."</seg>
<seg id="22">What was the reason for the revelations by Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest and until now had not communicated with the press?</seg>
<seg id="23">Is it possible that as a woman she couldn't not answer the accusation of bad taste?</seg>
<seg id="24">Or are the "Komsomolka" journalists right, asserting a couple of days ago that she "fell into an even deeper trance under house arrest" due to the news of the reconciliation between Anatoliy Serdyukov and his wife and his return to the family bosom?</seg>
<seg id="25">The well-known military columnist of "KP" Victor Baranets in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative during questioning."</seg>
<seg id="26">Previously Vasilyeva assumed responsibility for several accusations of unlawful sale of real estate property of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>

<seg id="1">Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents</seg>
<seg id="2">The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
<seg id="5">Google is accused of infringing seven patents.</seg>
<seg id="6">The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</seg>
<seg id="7">Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</seg>
<seg id="8">Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="11">After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe," the lawsuit said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.</seg>

<seg id="1">Missouri court deciding if man injured by hot dog can sue baseball team</seg>
<seg id="2">If it had been a foul ball or broken bat that struck John Coomer in the eye as he watched a Kansas City Royals game, it's unlikely the courts would have forced the team to pay for the surgeries and suffering he's endured.</seg>
<seg id="3">But because it was a hot dog thrown by the team mascot - behind the back, no less - he just may have a case.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Missouri Supreme Court is weighing whether the "baseball rule" - a legal standard that protects teams from being sued over fan injuries caused by events on the field, court or rink - should also apply to injuries caused by mascots or the other personnel that teams employ to engage fans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because the case could set a legal precedent, it could change how teams in other cities and sports approach interacting with fans at their games.</seg>
<seg id="6">Coomer, of Overland Park, Kan., says he was injured at a September 2009 Royals game when the team's lion mascot, Sluggerrr, threw a 4-ounce, foil-wrapped wiener into the stands that struck his eye.</seg>
<seg id="7">He had to have two surgeries - one to repair a detached retina and the other to remove a cataract that developed and implant an artificial lens.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coomer's vision is worse now than before he was hurt and he has paid roughly $4,800 in medical costs, said his attorney, Robert Tormohlen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Coomer, 53, declined to discuss the case.</seg>
<seg id="10">His lawsuit seeks an award of "over $20,000" from the team, but the actual amount he is seeking is likely much greater.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tormohlen declined to discuss the actual amount.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Jackson County jurors who first heard the case two years ago sided with the Royals, saying Coomer was completely at fault for his injury because he wasn't aware of what was going on around him.</seg>
<seg id="13">An appeals court overturned that decision in January, however, ruling that while being struck by a baseball is an inherent risk fans assume at games, being hit with a hotdog isn't.</seg>
<seg id="14">The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments last month, but didn't indicate when it might issue its ruling.</seg>
<seg id="15">Few cases had addressed the level of legal duty, or obligation, a mascot owes to fans, so Coomer's case is being closely watched by teams throughout the country, said Tormohlen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If a jury finds that the activity at issue is an inherent and unavoidable risk, the Royals owe no duty to their spectators," Tormohlen said.</seg>
<seg id="17">No case has extended the no-duty rule to the activities of a mascot.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Royals, whose spokesman declined to comment on the case while it is pending, have argued that the hotdog toss has been a popular fan attraction at Kauffman Stadium since 2000 and is as much part of the game experience as strikeouts and home runs.</seg>
<seg id="19">From mascot races and T-shirt cannons to free Wi-Fi and stadium sushi stands, teams have been doing everything they can to convince fans that the live experience is worth the high ticket and concession prices and is better than watching games on television.</seg>
<seg id="20">"You have this competition with teams engaged in pushing the envelope trying to make the experience at the event better than what you can experience at home," said Jordan Kobritz, a professor in the Sports Management Department at SUNY Cortland.</seg>
<seg id="21">You also have the fan mentality in which risk today is more tolerable than it's been in our history.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ruling in Coomer's favour, or one that at least assigns partial blame to the mascot, could force teams to rethink their promotions, or at least take additional measures to keep spectators safe, Kobritz said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bob Jarvis, a sports law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida, said a 1997 California case set an important precedent when a state appeals court ruled that mascots are not an essential part of a baseball game.</seg>
<seg id="24">In that case, a minor league baseball team's dinosaur brushed against a fan, distracting him right before he was struck by a ball that broke several bones in his face.</seg>
<seg id="25">The court said mascot antics aren't essential or integral to the playing of a game.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, not all courts have treated the baseball rule as sacrosanct.</seg>
<seg id="27">Earlier this year, the Idaho Supreme Court allowed a fan who lost an eye to a foul ball at a minor league baseball game to proceed with his lawsuit against the team.</seg>
<seg id="28">The court said that since baseball fan injuries are so rare in Idaho, there didn't seem to be a compelling reason for the court to step in.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the Kansas City case, a ruling in the Royals" favour would indicate that mascots are, indeed, an essential part of the game experience, Jarvis said.</seg>
<seg id="30">If that happens, the Kansas City case would likely supplant Lowe's as the one attorneys look at when deciding whether to file a lawsuit on behalf of an injured fan.</seg>
<seg id="31">"If you could get a court to go the other way and say in-game entertainment is a natural part of playing baseball in the U.S. in the 21st century, that would be a tremendous precedent that could cut off future lawsuits," Jarvis said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The "Russian march" is becoming more popular</seg>
<seg id="2">On November 4, on National Unity Day, the Russian march approved by the mayor's office will take place in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a survey by "Levada-center", support of "Russian marches" is growing - already 40% of citizens to various degrees approve the idea of their implementation.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to "Levada-center", 40% of citizens to various degrees approve the staging of "Russian marches": of them 11% perceive such actions definitively positive and 29% - "mostly positive".</seg>
<seg id="5">The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006 only 14% of Russians welcomed these actions, but in December of 2010 already twice as many citizens (28%) supported the staging of such events.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only 7% of Russians perceive the "Russian marches" "definitively negative", "mostly negative" - 19%.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another 35% could not formulate their stance on this action.</seg>
<seg id="8">This year, the mayor of Moscow approved the staging of the "Russian march" numbering up to 15 thousand people in Lyublino, this was reported today by the head of the capital's security department Aleksei Mayorov.</seg>
<seg id="9">This action of nationalists takes place every year on National Unity Day since 2005.</seg>
<seg id="10">In response to the question of sociologists "Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia "Russian marches" are carried out under slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia? three-quarters (75%) of citizens answered negatively.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now only every fifth Russian (20%) knows about this action.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is noteworthy that in December of 2010 almost a third of citizens (31%) had heard about the "Russian marches".</seg>
<seg id="13">Let us recall that three years ago on December 11 on Manezhnaya Square there was a spontaneous rally of nationalists that degenerated into mass riots.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Levada-center" also asked Russians about which holiday is celebrated on November 4.</seg>
<seg id="15">In two years the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, only 15% of citizens intend to celebrate this holiday.</seg>
<seg id="17">Approximately just as many (17%) intend to celebrate November 7 October Revolution Day.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most citizens (62%) do not intend to celebrate any one of these holidays.</seg>
<seg id="19">How the mayor's office approved the "Russian march" in Lyublino</seg>
<seg id="20">On October 28 the capital's authorities approved the staging of a "Russian march" on November 4 in Lyublino.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was reported by the leader of the "Russians" association, march organizer Dmitry Demushkin.</seg>
<seg id="22">Besides the procession in Lyublino, on National Unity Day a rally and rock concert by the group "Kolovrat" will take place, also approved by authorities.</seg>
<seg id="23">How "Russian march-2012" went</seg>
<seg id="24">On National Unity Day in 2012 nationalists moved in procession from Yakimanskaya Embankment to the Central House of the Artists where the rally took place.</seg>
<seg id="25">Organizers estimated the number of attendees at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs gave the number 6 thousand.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stunning form the evidence of Wingard's wizardry</seg>
<seg id="2">Port Adelaide's Chad Wingard shows his fine balance and skills.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Sarah Reed Source: The Advertiser</seg>
<seg id="4">CHAD Wingard is The Natural.Port Adelaide's teenage sensation is in rarefied company despite showing scant interest in the AFL until he was drafted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only Carlton champion Chris Judd has averaged more Champion Data rankings points in his second AFL season than Wingard.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judd averaged 110 with West Coast in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wingard is averaging 109 in five games with the Power this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Judd has gone on to win two Brownlow Medals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whether Wingard can go close to reaching those heights remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="10">But his potential is great.</seg>
<seg id="11">Of drafted players, few have as big an upside as him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Port's forward line wizard has revealed until he was drafted at pick six 18 months ago he had little or no interest in the AFL.</seg>
<seg id="13">While most AFL players are hooked on the sport from a young age, Wingard - born and raised at Murray Bridge - only ever watched two AFL games.</seg>
<seg id="14">And both were forced upon him.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first was between the Power and North Melbourne at AAMI Stadium when, as a 13-year-old, he represented Murray Bridge in an exhibition game at half-time.</seg>
<seg id="16">The other was the 2009 grand final between Geelong and St Kilda when he was a member of the AIS-AFL Academy squad which attended the clash as part of its education.</seg>
<seg id="17">Wingard cannot ever recall watching more than "five minutes here and there" of any AFL game on television.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he didn't listen to any games - AFL or SANFL - on radio either.</seg>
<seg id="19">He had no football heroes, although he admired the Kangaroos' Daniel Wells after meeting him at the North-Port clash, and he didn't know too many players names.</seg>
<seg id="20">The wonderful skills which have helped ignite the Power's shock 5-0 start to the season do not come from studying Judd, Hawthorn's Cyril Rioli and Lance Franklin, Collingwood's Dale Thomas and Wells.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are the product of countless hours of "mucking around for fun" with balls of all shapes and sizes in the back yards of his and his best mate's (Sean Samblich) Murray Bridge homes.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I wasn't interested in watching footy, I didn't like it too much," said Wingard, 19.</seg>
<seg id="23">Dad (Trevor) played a lot of (country) footy but when I tagged along with him I'd spend the whole day doing my own thing on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="24">And when Dad, who was a big Crows fan, watched footy on television and used to get quite up-tempo and loud in the loungeroom, I'd go and play a bit of Pokemon or something.</seg>
<seg id="25">If I wasn't doing that I was outside playing with a ball.</seg>
<seg id="26">I was more into basketball and didn't really understand too much about footy, so me and Sean (who now plays football for Sturt) used to catch up and just throw different balls around.</seg>
<seg id="27">I guess that's where my journey started.</seg>
<seg id="28">Like the famous Michael Jordan's Playground video, Wingard honed his exceptional skills away from the bright lights.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Whether it was basketball, football or cricket, me and Sean used to try everything," Wingard said.</seg>
<seg id="30">We'd shoot for goal, dribble from the boundary line, juggle, basically do anything to make a competition of it.</seg>
<seg id="31">You name it, we tried it.</seg>
<seg id="32">We learnt a lot from each other and that's why we're still such good mates.</seg>
<seg id="33">Being a country boy, Wingard, at age 11, felt obliged to play football for his local club, Imperials.</seg>
<seg id="34">But basketball was more important to him.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, his brilliant skills quickly shone out in both sports.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was chosen as captain of SA's under-16 basketball and football teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">If he was taller, Wingard would have pursued basketball as his No.</seg>
<seg id="38">1 sport.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike football, he does have basketball heroes - Miami Heat superstar LeBron James and San Antonio Spurs' Australian ace Patrick Mills.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at just 181cm, football became the better option to showcase his enormous sporting talent.</seg>
<seg id="41">He soon captained the SA under-18 team and debuted at league level for Sturt.</seg>
<seg id="42">When GWS surprisingly overlooked him with the first five selections at the 2011 national draft, Port pounced because of his incredible skill level.</seg>
<seg id="43">"He's capable of doing some freaky things and making things happen for his team," Power recruiting manager Geoff Parker said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="44">SA under-18 coach Brenton Phillips describes Wingard as one of the most naturally gifted athletes he has seen.</seg>
<seg id="45">"He's unique and is just one of those rare kids who is able to pick things up relatively easily," he said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Wingard is so highly-skilled his trick shots, including kicking footballs into basketball rings and garbage bins, have been posted on YouTube by local company Spimoni Productions.</seg>
<seg id="47">"Previous coaches have told me I've got a fair bit of natural talent, that a lot of skills seem to come naturally to me," he said.</seg>
<seg id="48">I'm lucky in that way.</seg>
<seg id="49">But I've still worked very hard - and I'm very competitive.</seg>
<seg id="50">I try to do things better than the next person with everything I do in life, including my football.</seg>
<seg id="51">As for watching the game, Wingard's perspective hasn't changed.</seg>
<seg id="52">"I'm happy to play, I love it, but I still don't like watching," he said.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that's unusual but it's just the way I am.</seg>
<seg id="54">And, given Wingard's on-field exploits so far this season, excited Power fans aren't complaining.</seg>

<seg id="2">Crows star Patrick Dangerfield bursts away on his way to booting four goals against the Dogs.</seg>
<seg id="3">COMETH the hour, cometh the man.</seg>
<seg id="4">Patrick Dangerfield ignited the Crows' form turnaround and his teammates followed.</seg>
<seg id="5">With struggling Adelaide in desperate need of a win in a match inaugural captain Chris McDermott dubbed a mini-final, the Crows' best player stood tall.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clearly battling a knee injury and the affects of some bone-crunching hits in the opening three rounds, explosive midfielder Dangerfield - playing primarily as a forward - turned it on at the start to give Brenton Sanderson's outfit the ascendancy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dangerfield produced some of his renowned magic to kick the Crows' first three goals in the wet and all but one of their goals in the first half.In the second half, his teammates followed his lead and raised their games.</seg>

<seg id="9">Picture: Sarah Reed Source: adelaidenow</seg>
<seg id="10">With the club already walking the finals tightrope with a 1-2 record and needing to quickly get their season back on track, midfielders Richard Douglas, Scott Thompson and Rory Sloane took over from where Dangerfield left off.</seg>

<seg id="15">His four goals and 21 disposals came despite the close checking of Dogs' master taggers Nick Lower and Liam Picken.</seg>

<seg id="17">"It was a fairly hard slog early, especially given the conditions, and Patty really turned it on for us," veteran defender Ben Rutten said."</seg>

<seg id="19">Thompson (29 disposals), Sloane (28) and Douglas (25) won the midfield battle, despite Dogs Brownlow Medallist Adam Cooney (30 possessions), Tom Liberatore (33) and veteran Matthew Boyd (28) winning their share of the ball.</seg>

<seg id="25">In other positive signs for Adelaide, defensive debutant Rory Laird did not look out of place on the big stage while second-gamer Sam Kerridge was given a shutdown role on Dogs playmaker Ryan Griffin and kept him to a modest 15 disposals before he was forced from the field in the final term with a shoulder injury.</seg>

<seg id="27">On a day Sanderson threw his side around, he surprised by starting small forward Jason Porplyzia as the sub.</seg>

<seg id="29">The elusive Porplyzia had been their most influential forward in their past eight games against the Bulldogs, kicking 13 goals.</seg>
<seg id="30">The wet conditions should have suited him but Sanderson opted to play the taller Tom Lynch as his extra forward, with Dangerfield the player he tried to isolate.</seg>
<seg id="31">It took Dangerfield only 58 seconds to start the ball rolling for the Crows.</seg>
<seg id="32">He broke clear of Lower to swoop on a loose ball and run into an open goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">With heavy rain turning the contest into a slog, Dangerfield's class again stood out as he capitalised on Adelaide's inside-50 dominance to boot the home side's second major.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Dogs were held goalless for the first 25 minutes but they then bagged two goals in a minute - courtesy of classy finishes from Boyd and Cooney.</seg>
<seg id="35">Coach Brendan McCartney turned to Picken to stop Dangerfield's influence but it was to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="36">The 23-year-old quickly turned him inside out to kick his and the Crows' third goal - the 100th of his already-stellar career.It took the Dogs until time-on in the final term to register their third goal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Growing older sooner</seg>
<seg id="2">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent</seg>
<seg id="4">There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys</seg>
<seg id="7">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are important, too.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, "suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are varying explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Who'd have thought it?</seg>
<seg id="3">James Horwill, the high-calibre lock whose iron will just about held the Wallabies together during the summer series with the Lions until the tourists broke them in the final half-hour of the deciding Test, has been relieved of the captaincy ahead of the meeting with England at Twickenham.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the coach, Ewen McKenzie, the Queenslander needs to concentrate on rediscovering the best of himself rather than waste his energy trying to bring the best out of everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ben Mowen, the excellent Brumbies back-rower, will be captain, with - wait for it - Quade Cooper as vice-captain.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yes, that's the same Quade Cooper branded as "toxic" by McKenzie's predecessor, Robbie Deans.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was a bit speechless," the outside-half admitted after being told of his promotion.</seg>

<seg id="9">Cooper played no part in the Lions series, despite straining every sinew and ransacking his box of tricks on behalf of Queensland in an early tour match.</seg>
<seg id="10">"When I was out of the team I looked at the things that are most important in my life and where rugby sat in it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">How you act as a person away from the game, how you act as a family man... those things roll into how you act as a player around the team.</seg>

<seg id="13">It has to be an ongoing process.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad</seg>
<seg id="2">And now - news from across the ocean, and particularly - from Syria, where, as we became aware of today, Israel launched a strike against rockets of Russian manufacture, which, according to reports, were intended for "Hezbollah".</seg>
<seg id="3">Today Syria fulfilled an important condition - destroy its production of chemical weapons by November 1.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through the mediation of Russia and allowing the U.S. to not conduct a military operation to which they came close this summer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our chief international correspondent Richard Engel will tell more about the weapons and about what all of this means for the Syrian president.</seg>
<seg id="6">Washington declared that the Assad regime will be punished for this.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, perished in August from poisonous gas.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the punishment came.</seg>
<seg id="9">But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal arranged by Assad's friend - Vladimir Putin.</seg>
<seg id="10">Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.</seg>
<seg id="11">And today - a major milestone.</seg>
<seg id="12">A group of international experts reported that Syria has disabled its declared factories producing chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="13">A more long-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and its components.</seg>
<seg id="14">As we understand, this is approximately a thousand tons.</seg>
<seg id="15">Previously Washington said that Assad's days are numbered.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think that Assad should resign.</seg>
<seg id="17">The question is not if this will happen, but when it will happen.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is no longer legitimate and must resign.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Assad remains.</seg>
<seg id="20">And feels even more confident.</seg>
<seg id="21">His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.</seg>
<seg id="22">His enemies are divided and poorly armed.</seg>
<seg id="23">His people involuntarily abandon their homes, many are starving.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have to feed themselves with leaves and cats.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.</seg>
<seg id="26">They are calling the agreement on chemical weapons a diplomatic success, inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself gave the impression of a person willing to cooperate.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today in Washington the U.S. ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.</seg>
<seg id="28">When a child dies from hunger, his mother is hardly comforted by the fact that they did not kill him using chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="29">Assad for now is holding on.</seg>
<seg id="30">And is exchanging weapons for power.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama aides considered replacing Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton during 2012 campaign</seg>
<seg id="2">A copy of the new book was leaked to the New York Times, which confirmed the potential Clinton plan with Wililam Daley, Mr Obama's former chief of staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">"You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, â Holy Christ, what do we do?â "" Mr Daley said, referring to September 2011 when Mr Obama's approval ratings were sinking in the midst of stuttering economic recovery.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is not clear whether Mr Obama knew about or approved of the research into bringing Mrs Clinton onto the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="5">The book also details Mr Obama's ambivalent relationship with Bill Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="6">The current president kept his distance from his Democratic predecessor during his first term but eventually accepted the need to harness Mr Clinton's popularity.</seg>
<seg id="7">The two men went golfing together in 2011 and as Mr Obama walked off the course he reportedly told an aide: "I like him... in doses."</seg>
<seg id="8">Later Mr Clinton is said to have "held Obama captive in the presidential limo" in New York, grabbing his hand as the president tried to reach for the door handle.</seg>
<seg id="9">But over the course of the 2012 campaign, Mr Obama grew increasingly reliant on the popular former president, dispatching him on the campaign trail and giving him a prime-time slot at the Democratic convention.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Mitt Romney finally conceded defeat on election night, Mr Obama is reported to have immediately called Mr Clinton to thank him for his efforts.</seg>
<seg id="11">The book focuses on Mr Obama's victorious campaign but also offers insights into the losing Republican side.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Romney is reported to have considered Chris Christie, the abrasive governor of New Jersey who looks set for an easy re-election next week, as a potential running mate.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, Romney aides reportedly had too many unanswered questions about Mr Christie, including about the heavily overweight man's health.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed</seg>
<seg id="2">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough</seg>
<seg id="3">The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="4">Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
<seg id="5">A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.</seg>
<seg id="7">The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="14">Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.</seg>
<seg id="18">Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.</seg>
<seg id="20">The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.</seg>
<seg id="32">He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will find you and put you before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.</seg>
<seg id="43">On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Young women increasingly trapped in low pay, says TUC</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 11:39</seg>
<seg id="3">Young women are increasingly likely to be trapped in low-paid jobs such as shelf-stacking, the TUC has said.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to a TUC report, the proportion of 16 to 24 year-old women doing low-skilled work has tripled over the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, official figures indicate that young women are better qualified than young men.</seg>
<seg id="6">The government says it is trying to tackle the problem through extra apprenticeships and work placements.</seg>
<seg id="7">The TUC report, written by the Work Foundation, said that in 1993 just 7% of young women worked in low-paid jobs, but by 2011 that had increased to 21%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The jobs involved include waitressing, cleaning and social care.</seg>
<seg id="9">Such work typically pays just over £14,000 a year, barely half the national average.</seg>
<seg id="10">"While there has been a welcome rise in the number of females gaining qualifications, many still find themselves trapped in low-skill, low-wage jobs," said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), young women have better qualifications than men at both A level and degree stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Glass ceiling</seg>
<seg id="13">One reason being given for the trend is the reduction in the number of better-paid jobs, including roles in administration or manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, the number of young women working in skilled trades has declined.</seg>
<seg id="15">Twenty years ago, 3% of them were employed doing jobs such as bar managers, IT engineers, or chefs.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, by 2011 that proportion had fallen to just 1%.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast, the number of young men working in skilled trades such as plumbing or plastering remains around 20%.</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite some evidence of women breaking through the glass ceiling, the proportion of young women working as managers or senior officials has also declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1993, 6% of young women were working as managers, whereas in 2011 the number had fallen to 4%.</seg>
<seg id="20">In response, the government said it was increasing the number of apprenticeships and work experience opportunities through its Youth Contract programme.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We are absolutely determined to do everything possible to help young people into work and give them the best chance in life so they can fulfil their potential," said a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions.</seg>
<seg id="22">The TUC report also said that schools needed to do more to challenge traditional gender roles, and that companies that win big public contracts needed to provide more training opportunities for both men and women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Floods forecast for weekend following one of mildest Octobers on record</seg>
<seg id="2">Last month was one of the mildest Octobers on record.</seg>
<seg id="3">But despite being the seventh warmest in 100 years, parts of the UK also saw some of the wettest weather for the time of the year, and further flooding is expected this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="4">The national weather service has issued a warning for southern England, alerting the public to the risk of localised flooding today and Sunday as heavy rain hits the coast and more stormy weather blows over the country, the Met Office has said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The areas worst hit by last Sunday and Monday's powerful St Jude storm - which was the worst in 26 years and killed five people - will once again bear the brunt of the bad weather, with close to one inch of rain predicted in the South East.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gemma Plumb, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said the new month will bring "drier and chillier weather as would be expected in November" while October was the mildest the UK has seen since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="7">The South West, south Wales and Midlands saw the highest above average temperatures, at 1.5C warmer than is usual for the month.</seg>
<seg id="8">But although it was milder than usual, it was also the least sunny October since 2005 and the wettest in England and Wales since 2000, Ms Plumb said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many areas of the UK will see showers and high winds today and tomorrow, with gusts of up to 60mph predicted in Wales.</seg>
<seg id="10">The stormy weather will strengthen on Sunday when the worst of the weather arrives and the risk of flooding will be at its highest following days of rain.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are fears the latest spell of disruptive weather will hamper recovery efforts following this week's storms, although it is not expected to be anywhere near as bad.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tim Fields of the Energy Networks Association said: "A lot of the places that are still without power are quite remote, with small numbers of people where there are downed power lines."</seg>
<seg id="13">""All the network operators will be in close contact with the Met Office during the weekend and we hope to have everyone back on supply by the end of next week.</seg>
<seg id="14">Flooding does not normally present a huge threat to the energy infrastructure but extensive flooding would definitely pose a risk.</seg>

<seg id="3">US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.</seg>
<seg id="5">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="9">They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We don't want to charge that," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.</seg>
<seg id="30">It will still give away water.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.</seg>

<seg id="9">By Simon Tomlinson and Tom Gardner</seg>
<seg id="10">Soldiers pause for a moment as they dig a mass grave to bury the bodies of 92 migrants who died of thirst trying to cross the Sahara.</seg>
<seg id="11">These new photographs show the horrifying scene which confronted the first people to discover the trail of decomposing corpses of men, women and children, found in Niger's desert north.</seg>
<seg id="12">All died in early October after a failed attempt to reach Algeria that began in late September - just a few kilometres from the border of Algeria, their planned destination.</seg>
<seg id="13">Horror: Volunteers and soldiers pause while digging graves to inter the bodies of migrants who died of thirst after their the truck they were traveling in broke down in the Sahara Desert north of Arlit, Niger</seg>
<seg id="14">Grim task: The bodies of 92 migrants, who died of thirst while trying to cross the Sahara desert have now been discovered and buried, officials confirmed</seg>
<seg id="15">The bodies were in such a terrible condition, many eaten by jackals and decomposed, that officials had to bury them where they lay.</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the photographs shows half a dozen covered corpses just a few feet from the abandoned wreck of a pick up truck that was part of a caravan of vehicles which broke down carrying the migrants across the forbidding desert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Almoustapha Alhacen, from local aid organisation Aghir In'man, confirmed the death toll and gave a graphic account of discovering the bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">'The corpses were decomposed. it was horrible,' he said.</seg>

<seg id="20">Burial: Soldiers walk away from the freshly dug grave, after burying bodies of migrants who died of thirst when their the truck broke down in the Sahara Desert north of Arlit, Niger</seg>
<seg id="21">We found them in different locations in a 20km (12-mile) radius and in small groups, often under trees, or under the sun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sometimes a mother and children, but some lone children too.</seg>
<seg id="23">The bodies were buried according to Muslim rites, 'as and when they were found,' added Alhacen.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Alhacen said that because so many of the dead were children or teenagers, it was possible they were heading for low paid jobs in Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="25">Death in the desert: A graphic showing where the bodies of 87 migrants were found in Niger after two vehicles taking them to Algeria broke down before reaching the border</seg>
<seg id="26">Treacherous: The seven men, 32 women and 48 children died of thirst in early October after walking for days in the Sahara desert (above, file picture)</seg>
<seg id="27">Nigerien officials said on Monday that dozens of migrants, most of them women and children, had died of thirst in the Sahara desert earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Two vehicles were carrying the migrants when they broke down, one about 83 kilometres (51 miles) from the city of Arlit, northern Niger where they had set off from, and another at 158 kilometres (98 miles), a security source said.</seg>
<seg id="29">The first vehicle broke down.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second returned to Arlit to get a spare part after getting all the migrants it was carrying to alight, but it too broke down,' said the source.</seg>
<seg id="31">'We think that the migrants were in the desert for seven days and on the fifth day, they began to leave the broken down vehicle in search of a well,' said the source.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, 21 people had survived, the source said, including a man who walked to Arlit and a woman who was saved by a driver who came across her in the desert and took her to the same city.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes a mother and children, but some lone children too</seg>
<seg id="34">Aid worker</seg>
<seg id="35">Nineteen others reached the Algerian city of Tamanrasset, but were sent back to Niger, the source added.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the lucrative business of transporting Africans fleeing conditions at home for what they hope will be a better life elsewhere, traffickers quite frequently abandon their human cargo in the desert, leaving them to near certain death.</seg>
<seg id="37">Azaoua Mamane, who works for the non-governmental organisation Synergie in Arlit, said the group left behind consisted of 'entire families, including many children and women, who departed for Algeria, where they hoped to beg for their keep'.</seg>
<seg id="38">Niger is one of the world's poorest countries and has been hit by successive food crises.</seg>
<seg id="39">Libya, rather than Algeria, is more frequently the favoured country of transit for west Africans making the journey across the continent, many of whom aim to travel on to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="40">The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that at least 30,000 economic migrants passed through Agadez, northern Niger's largest city, between March and August of this year.</seg>
<seg id="41">These migrants often look to Europe as their final destination, a security source told AFP, and use Libya as a jumping off point amid the relative chaos in the North African country since the fall of Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="42">Humanitarian agencies say nearly 20,000 migrants have perished while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">The death of more than 300 Africans in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month has recently pushed the issue to the top of Europe's political agenda.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joyce McMillan: Freedom is what keeps us all safe</seg>
<seg id="2">Politicians fail to recognise our fundamental interests are as important as their own self interests, writes Joyce McMillan</seg>
<seg id="3">A couple of weeks ago, a strange straw in the wind drifted across my desk, in the shape of a column written for the Independent by the company's group content director, Chris Blackhurst.</seg>
<seg id="4">In it, he described a recent chance encounter in a corridor at Westminster with a senior Labour woman politician, whom he described as being "incandescent" with rage over the Guardian newspaper's decision to publish material made available by Edward Snowden, the analyst for a private intelligence contractor who was so shocked by the extent of US government surveillance of personal communications, both within the US and worldwide, that he leaked a substantial tranche of information to the media, before fleeing the country.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a slightly convoluted piece, Blackhurst expresses his opinion that the ex-minister's rage was real, although he fails to explain why her "incandescence" and her "genuine anger" had taken no less than five months to develop, since the Guardian first published material leaked by Snowden in May.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then, instead of defending the Guardian against the grandstanding of politicians whose own scrutiny of the security services has been neither very effective nor very transparent, Blackhurst writes the following sentence: "If the security services insist something is contrary to the public interest, and might harm their operations, then who am I to disbelieve them?"</seg>
<seg id="7">The short answer, of course, is that he is a senior journalist in a supposedly free society, with an obligation to freedom of speech and open public debate that should override any automatic duty of compliance with government and its agencies.</seg>
<seg id="8">And as this week at Westminster unfolded, it became increasingly apparent that, behind the high-profile row about the government's proposal to set up a new press regulator under Royal Charter - a confused measure that will probably have little impact on the operation of most newspapers - something much more threatening to media freedom was brewing around parliament, in the shape of an aggressive fightback by the security services against the allegation that they have been exceeding their powers.</seg>
<seg id="9">It clearly took the security establishment some months to work out how to react, while the Snowden revelations about the monitoring of billions of day-to-day phone and e-mail communications - and, last week, about the hacking of the private telephones of major allies, including that of the German chancellor Angela Merkel - continued to raise concern about the mushrooming scale of their activities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, though, it seems they have concluded that the best form of defence is attack; and they have begun to allege that all those who publish leaked material about their activities, including the Guardian's editor Alan Rusbridger, are personally to blame for recklessly undermining national security, and increasing our exposure to terrorist attack.</seg>
<seg id="11">The woman politician Chris Blackhurst met at Westminster, with her sudden "rage" five months after the fact, was clearly echoing this line of argument, acting out with added vigour the series of reactionary attitudes Labour politicians now have to demonstrate if they want to be taken seriously at Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="12">And the same line was repeated word for word, in the Commons this week, by the Prime Minister, who came perilously close to threatening that media freedom, in future, may be conditional on compliance with whatever the government defines as "responsible" behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now, of course, we have seen plenty of examples of media irresponsibility in Britain in recent years, although not, I would argue, in this area; and of course, there are detailed aspects of the activity of security services which should not be revealed, for fear of directly undermining operations.</seg>
<seg id="14">What is staggering, though, is the assumption of the security establishment - and increasingly, it seems, of many politicians - that senior journalists and editors have no significant role in holding security services to account, and should essentially just do as they are told by government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a fascinating discussion on BBC Radio 4"s The World Tonight, on Wednesday, leading establishment figures Dame Pauline Neville Jones and David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, could be heard arguing that Britain's parliamentary and judicial scrutiny of the security services is so perfect that the press should simply leave them to it; while Kirsty Hughes of Index On Censorship, and the UN rapporteur on freedom of expression Frank La Rue, expressed mounting shock that a country which once prided itself on the defence of freedom could have travelled so far down the road of simply accepting that the "war on terror" justifies whatever the security services choose to do - even when, as with the spying on Angela Merkel, what they do bespeaks a very strange mindset indeed.</seg>
<seg id="16">And as for the politicians on whom we rely for proper scrutiny of our security services, in those areas which genuinely cannot be made public, it has to be said that over the past two decades, our political class have shown themselves ever more incapable of making rational risk assessments about the dangers we face, and of balancing the demands and recommendations of the booming security sector against the obvious damage done to the fabric of our society by aggressive, uncivil and hugely costly security measures.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of course, it is true that most voters care not a jot about these issues, so long as they are left in peace to get on with their lives.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the end, though, every society has to face the truth that freedom matters, as does the the privacy and dignity of the individual citizen; and that it underpins everything that makes a society worth defending.</seg>
<seg id="19">Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Germany under the relentless gaze of the Stasi, knows that.</seg>
<seg id="20">And like many observers across the international scene, she will also know, from her own experience, that the language now being used by some senior British politicians, and by leading members of the security establishment on both sides of the Atlantic, is not the language of freedom and democracy; but the age-old language of authoritarian government, telling ordinary citizens to accept what they are told by those who know best, and using the threat of unnamed enemies to seek to stifle the criticism, the exposure and the questioning of power that is the very lifeblood of a free society.</seg>

<seg id="1">Swansea tyre fire: Bosses who stored waste without permit jailed</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 16:37</seg>
<seg id="3">Two company directors have each been jailed for six months for storing more than 5,500 tonnes of waste tyres without a permit at a factory where a fire burned for three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="4">The blaze at the former Mettoys site in Fforestfach, Swansea, happened in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="5">Globally Greener Solutions directors Scott Phillips and Peter Thomas pleaded guilty in June before they were due to stand trial at Swansea Crown Court.</seg>
<seg id="6">The cost of the blaze and removing all the tyres is estimated at £2.6m.</seg>
<seg id="7">Judge Paul Thomas said: "Both of you bore onerous responsibilities, both of you plead ignorance, ignorance of course is no excuse, in offence it's an aggravating feature."</seg>
<seg id="8">""Only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no room for recklessness in this sphere.""</seg>
<seg id="10">The court heard that the likely cause of the fire was accidental although arson could not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The fire had created a "plume of smoke which had a serious impact on air quality" and the water used to fight the fire had polluted the nearby River Llan and Fforestfach stream."</seg>
<seg id="12">""There was also "major traffic disruption" and congestion on the westbound carriageway of the M4 motorway.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nicholas Jones, prosecuting, said the shredded tyre material was around "10-12ft thick in places" and posed a "significant fire risk."</seg>
<seg id="14">A local firm - Tyregenics - had paid Globally Greener Solutions just over £260,000 to deposit the material at the building in Fforestfach.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fire burnt for 23 days and around 58 fire appliances were needed in total to deal with the blaze, along with 45 fire fighters.</seg>
<seg id="16">The court was told Phillips, 44, from Neath, and 66-year-old Thomas from Swansea, both admitted knowing or causing controlled waste to be deposited without an environmental permit.</seg>
<seg id="17">They had planned to recycle the tyre waste into gravestones and bollards by adding a polymer to it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The court heard that the Environment Agency had been tipped off about the tyre waste and were aware that it was being stored at the building in Fforestfach.</seg>
<seg id="19">A plan had been prepared by the fire service and the Environment Agency in case the waste caught fire.</seg>
<seg id="20">The probable cause of the fire on 16 June 2011, was an "accidental ignition source by persons unknown."</seg>
<seg id="21">A unit next to the old Mettoys factory and also under the control of Globally Greener Solutions, contained hundreds of tonnes of mixed waste and dangerous chemicals which greated an "increased risk of further fire."</seg>
<seg id="22">The operation to extinguish the fire had cost £1.6m and the cost of disposing of the shredded tyre waste, which is now being stored at Tata Steel in Port Talbot, was yet to be determined, but it has previously been estimated to be around £1m.</seg>
<seg id="23">A third director, Dorothy Thomas, had formal not guilty verdicts recorded against her at an earlier hearing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Q&A: East Turkestan Islamic Movement</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 11:04</seg>
<seg id="3">China's top security official has linked Monday's deadly crash in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The BBC looks at what is known about the group.</seg>
<seg id="5">Q: Who are the East Turkestan Islamic Movement?</seg>
<seg id="6">The East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is a small Islamic separatist group said to be active in Xinjiang province in western China.</seg>
<seg id="7">The province is home to China's ethnic minority Uighur Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="8">East Turkestan is what many Uighurs call Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="9">The US state department described ETIM as "the most militant of the ethnic Uighur separatist groups" in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is said to want to establish an independent "East Turkestan" in China.</seg>
<seg id="11">ETIM was reportedly founded by Hasan Mahsum, an Uighur from Xinjiang's Kashgar region.</seg>
<seg id="12">Listed as China's most-wanted terrorist, he was shot dead by Pakistani troops in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="13">The group was later led by Abdul Haq, who was also reportedly killed in Pakistan in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="14">Q: What has ETIM done?</seg>
<seg id="15">The scope of ETIM's activities is not clear.</seg>
<seg id="16">Information from Xinjiang is tightly controlled, particularly concerning incidents that occur there.</seg>
<seg id="17">China often blames ETIM or ETIM-inspired groups for outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang, but details are hard to confirm.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sometimes differing accounts of the cause of the violence - that point to ethnic and religious tensions rather than extremism - emerge subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="19">Uighur groups, meanwhile, claim China exaggerates the threat from ETIM to justify repressive security in the province.</seg>
<seg id="20">Violent attacks attributed to ETIM tend to be small-scale, and correspondents say that there are questions about the group's capacity to organise any serious acts of terror in China.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to UN and US reports, ETIM was responsible for several bomb attacks in Xinjiang in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2002, two ETIM members were deported from Krygyzstan to China for plotting to attack the local US embassy, US reports say.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the US State Department's 2011 country terror report, ETIM claimed responsibility for an attack that year on a police station in Xinjiang's Hotan that killed four people, and a series of bomb and knife attacks that killed at least 12 in Kashgar.</seg>
<seg id="24">Q: How dangerous is ETIM?</seg>
<seg id="25">China describes ETIM as a violent separatist group and a terrorist organisation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following the Tiananman car crash, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called the group "the most immediate and realistic security threat in China."</seg>
<seg id="27">It and other organisations "have long been engaged in central, east and west Asia, and have colluded with other international terrorist organisations," she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, Michael Clarke, a professor at Griffith University in Sydney who has written about Xinjiang, told AFP news agency: "It's not that China shouldn't be concerned [about ETIM's ties to Pakistan and central Asian countries], but the core issue is that the linkages have been exaggerated by the Chinese government."</seg>
<seg id="29">ETIM is designated as a terrorist group by the US under Executive Order 13224, an order designed to block financial transactions with groups linked to terrorism, and the US Terrorists Exclusion List, which allows the US to prevent individuals linked with terrorist organisations from entering the US.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it is not listed as a terrorist group on the State Department's main list of Foreign Terrorist Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="31">US reports on terrorism have noted that: "China does not always distinguish between legitimate political dissent and the advocacy of violence to overthrow the government, and it has used counterterrorism as a pretext to suppress Uighurs."</seg>
<seg id="32">"China's government characterised Uighur discontent, peaceful political activism, and some forms of religious observance as terrorist activity," it added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Govt declares sea change in boat battle</seg>
<seg id="2">Australia is gaining the upper hand in its fight against people smugglers, with no asylum seeker boats arriving in the past week, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has declared.</seg>
<seg id="3">People smugglers now face enhanced co-operation between Australia and Indonesia following ministerial talks held recently in Jakarta, Mr Morrison told journalists in Sydney on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his weekly briefing to media, Mr Morrison said there had been no boat intercepts in the week ending October 31, while only five boats carrying 339 asylum seekers were intercepted for the month.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last time fewer than five boats had arrived in Australia in a month was March last year.</seg>
<seg id="6">"There is a sea change, there is a shift ... in the level of activity coming to Australia," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the first time in five years we are now getting the upper hand over the people smugglers and we do not intend to yield this ever again.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is not due to any one measure, or any one policy, but the combined effects of all measures, the professional and swift implementation of those measures and the strong resolve of this government on our borders that does what it says.</seg>
<seg id="9">Operation Sovereign Borders commander Lieutenant General Angus Campbell confirmed no boats had arrived in Australian waters in the week up to 9am (AEDT) Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Morrison said the people smuggling trade was now highly vulnerable to the cooperative approach of Indonesia and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="11">But he expected there would be more boat arrivals going into the monsoon season.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Morrison recently returned from Jakarta after holding talks with its minister for law and human rights Amir Syamsuddin and attending meetings with 40 senior officials from key Indonesian agencies.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was a follow-up to the meeting between Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in late September.</seg>
<seg id="14">While Mr Morrison wouldn't go into the detail of the discussions, he said he was extremely optimistic about what could be achieved in the future to fight the people smuggling trade.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said both countries had a shared interest in resolving the problem, and that Australia remained committed to maintaining a "no surprises" communication policy with Indonesia with "direct and private dialogue" at an operational level.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This co-operation carries a very strong message all on its own," Mr Morrison said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Smugglers and their passengers face a combined effort from the governments of Indonesia and Australia to prevent them entering and leaving Indonesia to get to Australia by boat.</seg>
<seg id="18">An Iraqi man will face court for allegedly organising three boats to take 763 people from Indonesia to Australian waters in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="19">Two federal police were sent to pick up Sayed Omeid in Kuala Lumper last week before flying him to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is expected to face court in Perth on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far 1137 people are being detained at offshore processing centres at Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, with 591 on Nauru.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since Operation Sovereign Borders began a little over a month ago, a total of 67 people have voluntarily returned to their country of origin from offshore processing centres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.</seg>
<seg id="6">We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."</seg>
<seg id="12">Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.</seg>
<seg id="14">Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.</seg>

<seg id="1">The goalkeeper of "Chicago" Nikolai Khabibulin emphasized: he understands that he must play better.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at practices.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the last two meetings of the "Hawks" Khabibulin initially let through six pucks from "Tampa Bay", and then four from "Ottawa", though in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.</seg>
<seg id="4">We have to play good, and in the last two games I was not able to do that, - CSN Chicago quotes Khabibulin.</seg>
<seg id="5">- I need to find confidence at practices, probably it's worth approaching them like games, and try to achieve the best result.</seg>
<seg id="6">You have to study your past games and work on those flaws that were present.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are several small components that I need to improve, but at practices I feel pretty good.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for some reason after several goals everything turns into a kind of snowball.</seg>
<seg id="9">Possibly I need to relax a little.</seg>
<seg id="10">Goalkeepers - I don't think that I am the only one - always strive to play a perfect game.</seg>
<seg id="11">If I miss four, five, six, I am not delighted.</seg>
<seg id="12">It does not matter what happens in front of my goalposts.</seg>
<seg id="13">I still work on myself in order to not miss so many pucks.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is great that my teammates are supporting, but essentially everything is simple: I have to play better.</seg>
<seg id="15">Two games - it is not the entire season, but I wanted to play them much better.</seg>
<seg id="16">But what happened did happen.</seg>
<seg id="17">I have to put that aside.</seg>

<seg id="1">China expands naval forces to protect African resources</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- China disclosed this week that its nuclear submarines have started regular sea patrols, underlining Beijing's plans to build a powerful naval force to protect the strategic Indian Ocean shipping lanes that carry the oil and raw materials from the Persian Gulf and Africa that fuel China's expanding economy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The official Xinhua news agency released photographs of what appeared to be Xia-class subs that will extend Chinese naval operations.</seg>
<seg id="4">These are China's first-generation of nuclear-armed submarines and are now decades old.</seg>
<seg id="5">Xinhua said they were being "declassified" for the first time, probably because they're being replaced by more advanced Jin-class boats.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the open display of the Xia-class subs, which Xinhua said "would gallop to the depths of the ocean, serving as mysterious forces igniting the sound of thunder in the deep sea," reflects the growing assertiveness of China's military forces, notably in the disputed oil-rich South China Sea.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time, China's been substantially extending its stake in Africa's oil and gas fields and the continent's other strategic minerals, and the Indian Ocean ports along the East African coastline.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Indian Ocean has long been dominated by the U.S. Navy and its aircraft carrier battle groups, and the Americans are unlikely to relinquish control of that vast maritime region, so vital to Beijing's strategic planning, anytime soon.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, India, China's longtime rival which is now hunting the same resources that China is so avidly pursuing, is also building up its naval forces to limit Chinese encroachment.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to some estimates, at least 60 percent of the oil exported by the Persian Gulf producers, including Iran, now goes to Asia, primarily China, India and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="11">That makes the Indian Ocean a possible arena of conflict at some point.</seg>
<seg id="12">U.S. President Barack Obama has unveiled his "Asian pivot," refocusing U.S. military power to meet the Chinese challenge in the Pacific.</seg>
<seg id="13">Beijing says it wants a new world order in which it would be on an "equal footing" with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Beijing has long recognized that any confrontation with the U.S. would inevitably lead to major economic crises ... and possibly a global war against the U.S.," the Defense and Foreign Affairs Group of Virginia observed in a recent analysis.</seg>
<seg id="15">To sustain this global conflict, the PRC would need huge quantities of hydrocarbons, rare materials, other natural resources and even agricultural products; and these could only be secured for it as a result of a China-dominated Africa.</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the most important elements in Beijing's master plan has been to focus the flow of oil, gas and minerals from Africa to a single hub on the Indian Ocean for shipping direct to China.</seg>
<seg id="17">Increasingly, that focus is on a proposed megaport at Lamu on Kenya's northern coast, a giant complex with 32 berths and three international airports along with a 1,000-mile railroad system and 1,100-mile road network that would transport oil and other resources from Sudan, Ethiopia and other regions in East and Central Africa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The vast emerging gas fields off Tanzania and Mozambique to the south would also feed into this centralized node, which would include a large new oil refinery near Lamu.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eventually, this complex, officially tagged the Lamu Port and New Transport Corridor Development to Southern Sudan and Ethiopia, or LAPSSET, would connect with a similar project on Africa's Atlantic coast.</seg>
<seg id="20">That would embrace Nigeria in the west and Angola in the southwest.</seg>
<seg id="21">These are the major oil producers in sub-Saharan Africa.</seg>
<seg id="22">All told, this massive endeavor would channel African oil production south of the Sahara eastward and give the Chinese effective control of much of the continent's hydrocarbon exports.</seg>
<seg id="23">As the Americans withdraw from a 12-year conflict in Afghanistan, the United States' longest war, the Chinese are already moving into the region as part of a plan to protect their resource links.</seg>
<seg id="24">China reportedly is taking over the new deepwater port at Gwadar on Pakistan's Indian Ocean coast, a $200 million facility Beijing built near the Persian Gulf, supposedly as the starting point for more secure overland oil and gas pipelines to western China.</seg>
<seg id="25">That's just one of several maritime centers, no doubt with naval bases attached, that Beijing is acquiring around the Indian Ocean, a chain of ports, intelligence facilities and listening posts dubbed China's "string of pearls."</seg>

<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- French energy company Total said it decided to proceed with an investment in an oil sands project in Canada, that is expected to yield 180,000 barrels per day.</seg>
<seg id="3">Total said it expected to spend more than $13.5 billion in the four years it should take to develop the Fort Hills oil sands mining project in Alberta, approximately 55 miles north of Fort McMurray.</seg>
<seg id="4">"With an expected mine life in excess of 50 years based on current planned production rates, Fort Hills represents more than 3 billion barrels of resources and strengthens Total's global portfolio by adding geographic diversity and long-plateau production with limited geosciences risk," Yves-Louis Darricarrere, president of upstream operations for Total, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Total has been involved in Canadian operations for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last year, it was associated with the production of about 12,000 barrels of oil per day in the country.</seg>

<seg id="3">WHILE most of the talk in the super industry is about possible changes to the Future of Financial Advice regime brought in on July 1, most of the action is in bringing consumer technology into at least the last decade of the 20th century, says Rainmaker's Alex Dunnin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The big retail banks have been working to combine their mobile web banking applications with their MySuper products and the results look likely to put them ahead of the industry funds," says Dunnin, who as an information supplier is closer to being an independent than most people in the industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">Banks have been developing web banking internet applications since the internet began to be commercialised in the late 1990s and the lead they have over industry funds which have under-invested in this type of technology is unassailable, although this was largely due to their desire to hold fees low.</seg>
<seg id="6">They can catch up some of this ground but they've given the retail superannuation sector, and banks in particular, an amazing head start.</seg>
<seg id="7">He believes that the bulk of superannuation fund members, notorious for not being closely engaged with the status of their superannuation accounts, will be amazed at how much easier it soon will be to get that information if they are using retail or corporate super products.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the deep penetration of online banking, smartphones and tablets for accessing the internet, these are the tools consumers are going to want to use to interact and transact with their superannuation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because banks know how to build and use them, it will give them a massive strategic advantage.</seg>
<seg id="10">He says the new capability to distribute retail superannuation products "isn't just a threat to industry funds, it's a threat to anyone in the value chain unable to adapt their business model to complementing this technology; for example, advisers that have resisted FoFA reforms such as fee for services, lower costs or those unable to justify their value proposition."</seg>
<seg id="11">On the matter of whether FoFA should change, as the Coalition would like to see, "FoFA's playing catch-up, as the law usually does."</seg>
<seg id="12">He adds that as long as planners act in the best interests of their clients, as FoFA now officially requires, "you can basically ignore the other 98 per cent of the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="13">That's easier said than done, however, since there are moves afoot to amend the "best interest" test and delete the "opt in" requirement, and the two groups that recently forged an alliance, the retail industry's FSC and the Industry Funds' ISA, have differing views on both.</seg>
<seg id="14">John Brogden, chief executive of the retail industry's Financial Services Council, agrees with Dunnin that the best interest duty "is what underpins the whole of FoFA" and says there is only one of seven clauses in the legislation that the FSC opposes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's called 'little g'," he says, "and it's a catch-all that allows regulator ASIC to include anything else in the duty that it chooses to include."</seg>
<seg id="16">The clause states that the provider of advice must have "taken any other step that, at the time the advice is provided, would reasonably be regarded as being in the best interests of the client, given the client's relevant circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="17">His beef is that the industry is seeking certainty and that "little g" will have the opposite effect, by leaving a question mark over how the law will be interpreted.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Getting rid of little 'g' was part of the Coalition policy that Mathias Cormann announced before the election," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Robbie Campo, deputy chief executive of Industry Super Australia, sits on the other side of the fence and wants the legislation left as it is.</seg>
<seg id="20">There cannot be a qualified best-interests test.</seg>
<seg id="21">You either act in someone's best interests or you don't," she says.</seg>
<seg id="22">Meanwhile, the opt-in arrangement forces financial advisers to be formally re-engaged by clients every two years and is aimed at weeding out the advisers who are still picking up trailing commissions for offering advice, often years ago, to clients who may not even be aware the commissions are being paid.</seg>
<seg id="23">Brogden makes it clear that FSC was only a reluctant supporter of the opt-in proposal when FoFA was drafted and he'd like to see it unwound now.</seg>
<seg id="24">We fought to stop it being an annual event and it's currently every two years.</seg>
<seg id="25">We had come to terms with the fact that under the previous government it was a reality but the Coalition wants to remove it and we believe the government has a mandate to do that, so we support that move.</seg>
<seg id="26">Campo quotes a submission that her organisation has just made to the Senate's review of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission, noting "the opt-in requirement is a compromise to prevent asset-based fees from replicating all the problems caused by commissions, including conflicted advice and consumers paying for advice that they do not receive.</seg>
<seg id="27">ISA estimates that 2.8 million Australians are paying commissions and ongoing fees for advice they do not receive.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arthur Sinodinos hasn't laid out exactly what he is planning in relation to FoFA although the Assistant Treasurer told a conference last month that there were elements of "regulatory overreach" in the legislation and that he will produce a discussion paper on the issue before year's end.</seg>
<seg id="29">Dunnin has seen legislative proposals come and go and believes it's not so much the legislation as how it's applied by ASIC, that will affect how the industry moves forward and in particular whether it will move the retail advisory industry more towards consolidation or fragmentation.</seg>
<seg id="30">"To date, the banks have done brilliantly out ot FoFA," he says, adding that in recent years they have assembled vast wealth management arms, "and lots of shoe leather to distribute products" while the global financial crisis has driven lots of supersavers straight into their control.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this legislation, depending on how much it's followed through, may turn planners into individual fiduciaries, and individuals can never outsource the trustee-fiduciary role.</seg>
<seg id="32">In other words, advisers could find themselves bound by the processes and rules of a big organisation but still retaining individual responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="33">The regulator may ask planners to prove why they are putting clients into a product that is issued by their parent organisation and those planners would have to be able to put their hand on their heart to explain the full rationale for their advice.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fee-for-service fiduciary model may produce an endgame where there is a fragmentation of the planning industry and indeed we're already seeing that in some instances where financial planners are finding their organisation has been taken over by one of the big banks, over their heads, but they can actually go out and get an Australian Financial Services Licence for themselves, ironically because of the advances in technology.</seg>
<seg id="35">We're seeing that already in the proliferation of smaller adviser groups which have gone up from around 650 to close to 800 in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="36">That way they can get away from the perception of having a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="37">And what about self-managed super funds?</seg>
<seg id="38">Are they going to take over the superannuation world?</seg>
<seg id="39">"We're still getting the hang of SMSFs but it was worrying to note how many trustees involved in the Trio-Astarra collapse were unaware that SMSFs are not regulated and therefore not protected like the pooled funds are," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some of those cases are tragic.</seg>
<seg id="41">He says he has been a bit startled recently to hear a senior executive from the ATO say that "90 per cent of SMSF trustees are trying to do the right thing."</seg>
<seg id="42">"On that arithmetic, with almost 500,000 SMSFs out there, that means there are 50,000 whose trustees aren't even trying to do the right thing," he says.</seg>
<seg id="43">"If even 1 per cent of pooled funds were doing wrong, it would be classified as a national scandal," he says, adding that even if 1 per cent of SMSFs do the wrong thing, "that's 5000 funds on the wrong side of the law."</seg>
<seg id="44">"If funds are unregulated, and they are, of course this is going to happen," he says, making it clear that we'll probably have a fresh batch of tragic SMSF tales to exchange before long.</seg>
<seg id="45">And that suggestions of the eclipse of pooled superannuation funds are entirely fanciful.</seg>

<seg id="2">A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image, leading to an acquittal.</seg>

<seg id="6">Traditional GCSE alphabetic grades are to be replaced with a numerical system to make a clean break with the current discredited qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="7">The A* to G system will be axed in favour of numbers from one to nine, with nine being the highest, say exam watchdogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other changes include an end to different papers for pupils based on ability, except in subjects where they are considered necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">'I got a nine!': Traditional GCSE alphabetic grades are to be replaced with a numerical system to make a clean break with the current discredited qualifications, which are being totally revamped</seg>
<seg id="10">Exam regulator Ofqual will also confirm today that end-of-course exams are to become the "default method of assessment," killing off modular tests in most subjects.</seg>
<seg id="11">They will generally be sat in the summer, ending the merry-go-round of pupils entered early or multiple times in the hope that they eventually score a good grade.</seg>

<seg id="14">Chief regulator Glenys Stacey admitted the move would be "challenging" but added: "The changes will make sure they are better qualifications - better assessed and more resilient so that everyone can have greater confidence in the results."</seg>
<seg id="15">The reputation of GCSE has collapsed amid concern about grade inflation, easy modular assessments, dumbed down content and endless retakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">The nine numerical grades - one more than the current alphabetic system - will provide a clear distinction between middle and higher grades, Ofqual said, and reduce "bunching" around the B, C and D grades.</seg>
<seg id="17">The extra grade is also intended to "signal that new GCSEs are new qualifications."</seg>
<seg id="18">However, making nine the highest grade will fuel speculation that there is room to add more in future - in a similar way that a star was added to A grades.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs Stacey insisted this was unlikely but refused to rule it out.</seg>
<seg id="20">She added: "People will want to make comparisons between the new and old grading scales and to know which new grade is the same as an existing C grade, for example."</seg>
<seg id="21">It all rides on this: Exam regulator Ofqual will also confirm today that end-of-course exams are to become the 'default method of assessment'</seg>
<seg id="22">Governments of all political stripes have spent almost 100 years tinkering with the exam system.</seg>
<seg id="23">From 1918, 16-year-olds sat the School Certificate, in which candidates had to pass maths, English and three other subjects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was abolished in 1951 when O-levels were introduced.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pass grades of A-E were developed for the predominantly exam-based qualification, although some boards used 1-6.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fails were shown by a U grade or 7-9 respectively.</seg>
<seg id="27">From 1975, all boards adopted the letter-based system.</seg>
<seg id="28">CSEs were available from 1965 for less able pupils, with a Grade 1 the equivalent to a C at O-level.</seg>
<seg id="29">Students last sat the exams in 1987, and they were replaced the following year by GCSEs.</seg>
<seg id="30">The new qualifications made widespread use of coursework and controlled assessments and were graded A to G, with a U for fails.</seg>
<seg id="31">A* grades were first used in 1994 to show the highest level of achievement.</seg>
<seg id="32">But dumbing down and grade inflation under Labour led to many public schools ditching GCSEs in favour of alternatives such as IGCSEs, which have an option to do no coursework.</seg>
<seg id="33">Since the Coalition came to power, attempts have been made to restore their reputation.</seg>
<seg id="34">Grade inflation was suppressed and other changes included giving more marks for correct spelling, grammar and punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="35">Plans are also under way to change the curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="36">Both the English and maths exams are tiered at the moment, with foundation papers available for weaker pupils.</seg>
<seg id="37">In future, all candidates will sit the same exams in English literature and language, giving everyone the chance to achieve top grades.</seg>
<seg id="38">Maths will remain tiered, however, reflecting a huge difference in ability among candidates.</seg>
<seg id="39">To avoid cherry-picking results, anyone who retakes a subject will have to sit all the exams again.</seg>
<seg id="40">Only having end of year assessments could also help boys, who are outperformed by girls in almost every subject but are believed to perform better under exam conditions.</seg>
<seg id="41">But Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the changes would be confusing to the public.</seg>
<seg id="42">Labour schools spokesman Kevin Brennan said it was "odd" that the Conservatives wanted more rigorous exams when they allowed unqualified teachers in some schools.</seg>
<seg id="43">And Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers" union, claimed the reforms had been "rushed through at breakneck speed, driven on by a political imperative, rather than the needs of pupils."</seg>
<seg id="44">Pupils first sat GCSEs in 1988, replacing the old two-tier assessment structure of O-levels and CSEs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall</seg>
<seg id="2">Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.</seg>
<seg id="5">Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
<seg id="12">But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.</seg>
<seg id="15">Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.</seg>
<seg id="19">That will happen all through the flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15," said Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="25">Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.</seg>
<seg id="30">The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="35">The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the U.S. it will be possible to use mobile devices during airplane takeoff and landing.</seg>
<seg id="2">New rules for safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of an airliner have been approved in the United States, reports the telecorporation BBC.</seg>
<seg id="3">As expected, American airline companies will permit passengers to use smartphones and tablets during the entire flight, the new rules will take effect by the end of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nonetheless, Internet connection to receive and send email will be prohibited during flights at a height lower than 3 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the danger of the emergence of interference of radio equipment of planes, cellular voice communications will be banned as before.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thus, aircraft passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to test the safety of using electronic devices during a flight.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, airline companies will have to convince the U.S. federal aviation administration that they will be able to handle the presumptive impact of mobile devices on aviation equipment and airplane control devices.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law</seg>
<seg id="2">"It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government "a stranglehold over the media," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "dealt a major blow" and lambasted the bill as "draconian."</seg>
<seg id="7">The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.</seg>
<seg id="10">Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."</seg>
<seg id="13">It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."</seg>
<seg id="14">By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.</seg>
<seg id="18">In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax on foreign property owners to burst London's bubble</seg>
<seg id="2">The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Cook said: "Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system."</seg>
<seg id="5">"But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning "domestic market" with the city's south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills.</seg>

<seg id="1">Father who looks at baby daughter he adores and aches for her lost twin</seg>
<seg id="2">By Ben Falk</seg>
<seg id="3">The cursor blinked on the computer screen, as I sat staring blankly at my emails.</seg>
<seg id="4">Earlier that day, I had returned from yet another scan with my wife, Christina, who was 32 weeks pregnant with our twin daughters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It had been a troubled pregnancy, and we had long prayed that this moment would never come.</seg>
<seg id="6">But now it was time to convey to our friends the most heartbreaking news - one of our babies had died.</seg>
<seg id="7">We had already told our family and closest friends in a series of shattering phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="8">And though it felt impersonal to send an email to others, we were emotionally exhausted and couldn't bear to keep repeating aloud the details of our sorrow.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ben Falk, with wife Christina and daughter Hannah, says he felt helpless and all he could do was try to be supportive and not fuss during the difficult pregnancy</seg>
<seg id="10">That evening, as I attempted to make supper, I broke down and sobbed into Christina's shoulder as she calmly stroked my head.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her strength then - as now - had been superhuman.</seg>
<seg id="12">That bleak day seemed such a stark contrast to the joyous one six months previously when we'd been excitedly telling friends our happy news.</seg>
<seg id="13">Losing a child in the womb is virtually impossible for any parent to bear, especially the mother.</seg>
<seg id="14">For fathers, though, it is a singular sort of grief.</seg>
<seg id="15">Physically detached from the baby, but just as desperate to feel and understand every stage of the pregnancy, it is hard for a man to process that a child that was once there, is gone.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was, without doubt, the worst experience of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Christina and I had been trying for children for more than three years.</seg>
<seg id="18">We'd met at a mutual friend's Christmas party in 2008 and were engaged nine months later.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Valentine's Day 2010, five months before our wedding, we decided Christina would come off the Pill.</seg>
<seg id="20">We dreamed of being able to stand up at the wedding and announce we were expecting.</seg>
<seg id="21">How naive we were.</seg>
<seg id="22">Christina simply couldn't get pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="23">We assumed it would happen fast, but it didn't.</seg>
<seg id="24">We still don't know why.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hannah Valentine Emilie Falk arrived just after 5pm on Wednesday June 12, weighing 7¿lbs.</seg>
<seg id="26">We¿d named her long ago, just as we had her sister, who we called Rose</seg>
<seg id="27">So when, in September 2012, Christina came into our bedroom to tell me her pregnancy test was positive, I didn't believe her, even asking her to take it again.</seg>
<seg id="28">She did so the next day, and it was still positive.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were even more thrilled when at our ten-week scan (we were scanned early because of our problems conceiving) we saw two little heartbeats on the monitor.</seg>
<seg id="31">Not only this, but our twins were identical (monochorionic, meaning they were sharing a placenta).</seg>
<seg id="32">We were stunned.</seg>
<seg id="33">In our most wistful moments, we had spoken of wanting a family with two children.</seg>
<seg id="34">And after so long, here we were with all our dreams coming true at once.</seg>
<seg id="35">The timing seemed perfect.</seg>
<seg id="36">I was 37, we owned our North London home, we were happy in our jobs - I'm a writer and Christina, 34, is an archive producer - and we had a great circle of friends.</seg>
<seg id="37">And then things started to go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="38">When we returned to our local Whittington Hospital for a scan at 16 weeks, the obstetrician performing the procedure told us of complications that could occur with identical twins.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because Hannah was very ill, Christina only got to hold her for a brief time before she was rushed off to the neonatal intensive care baby unit</seg>
<seg id="40">"I'm afraid one of the babies is pushed right to the top corner of Christina's womb and has minimal amniotic fluid," she said.</seg>
<seg id="41">I'm afraid it's twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome [TTTS].</seg>
<seg id="42">This was a disorder that can affect monochorionic twins.</seg>
<seg id="43">The obstetrician explained that one baby was unknowingly taking nutrients and blood from the other in the womb.</seg>
<seg id="44">TTTS means that the twins are disproportionate in size.</seg>
<seg id="45">A myriad other medical issues can also arise, such as heart conditions in the larger baby.</seg>
<seg id="46">Many twins who share a placenta don't get TTTS at all.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some get it late in the pregnancy when it doesn't particularly matter.</seg>
<seg id="48">But some cases are incredibly serious.</seg>
<seg id="49">This was the case with our children.</seg>
<seg id="50">Their TTTS was severe.</seg>
<seg id="51">I gripped Christina's hand tightly.</seg>
<seg id="52">One moment, we'd been thinking about baby names, the next we were told both of our children might die.</seg>
<seg id="53">Our best chance was to have laser surgery immediately to split the placenta, hopefully meaning that both babies could develop independently.</seg>
<seg id="54">Without it, there was a 90 per cent chance both babies would never be born.</seg>
<seg id="55">Even with it, there was only a 30 per cent chance that both would survive.</seg>
<seg id="56">I did what I normally do when in shock - started making lists about what we needed to do.</seg>
<seg id="57">Christina didn't speak, but I could see the fear in her eyes.</seg>
<seg id="58">Despite the stark statistics, one positive thing did come from that scan.</seg>
<seg id="59">The doctor revealed that our babies were girls.</seg>
<seg id="60">Christina and Ben had dreamed of being able to stand up at the wedding and announce they were expecting - but it took time to conceive</seg>
<seg id="61">The next day, sick with fear, we arrived at King's College Hospital, South London, and sat in the waiting room, trying to act normally.</seg>
<seg id="62">Professor Kypros Nicolaides is one of the leading specialists in this procedure.</seg>
<seg id="63">If anyone could save our babies, he could.</seg>
<seg id="64">Christina was awake throughout the treatment, and I held her hand tightly as the professor pushed a needle into her abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="65">Within 15 minutes it was over and he waved a scanning wand over Christina's stomach.</seg>
<seg id="66">"They're both alive," he said, before rushing out of the room to his next patient.</seg>
<seg id="67">The next hour, in which we had to wait for a second scan, was torture.</seg>
<seg id="68">But the results promised much.</seg>
<seg id="69">Two heartbeats.</seg>
<seg id="70">Our babies had made it.</seg>
<seg id="71">But this was just the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="72">We would have fortnightly scans, on constant alert for anything that might go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="73">Our nightmare brought us closer together.</seg>
<seg id="74">For the first time, we were genuinely going through something monumental together.</seg>
<seg id="75">We didn't discuss worst-case scenarios with anyone, even though I know both of us were thinking about it.</seg>
<seg id="76">As a man, I felt rather helpless at times.</seg>
<seg id="77">All I could do was try to be supportive and not fuss - a difficult task when you're scared or upset.</seg>
<seg id="78">All I could do was try to be supportive and not fuss - a difficult task when you're scared or upset'</seg>
<seg id="79">One of the hardest things was the waiting.</seg>
<seg id="80">For husbands, a pregnancy already feels interminable.</seg>
<seg id="81">The weeks tick by at a crawl.</seg>
<seg id="82">While your wife can feel it happening, I simply had to watch, never knowing what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="83">By 19 weeks, there were already signs that the smaller twin was not thriving.</seg>
<seg id="84">By 22 weeks, it was revealed that the bigger one appeared to be showing some kind of cardiac problem, the muscle of the heart too large as it desperately tried to pump blood round her system.</seg>
<seg id="85">Our obstetrician said there was nothing we could do but wait.</seg>
<seg id="86">It was up to nature.</seg>
<seg id="87">Just once, before we'd discovered about the twins" condition, we'd visited John Lewis to scout for prams and baby things.</seg>
<seg id="88">This was the start of family life and it felt thrilling.</seg>
<seg id="89">Now we sat quietly at home, not daring to think about changing the spare room into a nursery, refusing to buy baby clothes and gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="90">At the 25-week scan, the doctor began preparing us for the worst.</seg>
<seg id="91">The smaller twin simply wasn't growing.</seg>
<seg id="92">She didn't expect her to make it.</seg>
<seg id="93">Still, somehow, we forced ourselves to hope for the best.</seg>
<seg id="94">The next appointment, at 32 weeks, brought terrible news.</seg>
<seg id="95">By this stage, we'd had more than 20 scans.</seg>
<seg id="96">As the obstetrician moved the paddle over Christina's swollen stomach, we held our breaths.</seg>
<seg id="97">The doctor looked grave.</seg>
<seg id="98">"I'm sorry," she said and, at that moment, our lives changed forever.</seg>
<seg id="99">One of our babies had died.</seg>
<seg id="100">The doctor couldn't tell us precisely when we had lost her, but thought it was probably around 29 or 30 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="101">So that was that.</seg>
<seg id="102">I wouldn't get to meet one of my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="103">Her mother would never get to hold her.</seg>
<seg id="104">Her sister wouldn't play with her.</seg>
<seg id="105">Oddly, I felt blank, like my emotions had fallen into some sort of black-hole.</seg>
<seg id="106">I held my wife as she wept.</seg>
<seg id="107">That evening, I had to write that stark email to our friends.</seg>
<seg id="108">Only then did I break down.</seg>
<seg id="109">We knew we couldn't dwell on our loss.</seg>
<seg id="110">It was crucial that Christina try to stay in as positive a frame of mind as possible for the other baby.</seg>
<seg id="111">We would have to grieve later.</seg>
<seg id="112">Nearly five months on, we have struggled to process our simultaneous emotions of grief and joy</seg>
<seg id="113">When there had been two babies, doctors talked of inducing around 32 weeks, even though it had emerged that the bigger twin had a life-threatening condition called pulmonary stenosis, an obstruction of the artery that carries the blood to the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="114">Soon after she was born, she would need an operation on her heart to insert a balloon into her pulmonary valve to open it up and allow oxygenated blood to flow freely around her system.</seg>
<seg id="115">But after losing one child, the doctors wanted to wait another six or so weeks before inducing to allow the surviving baby the best change of life.</seg>
<seg id="116">Six days before the re-scheduled induction, and ten days before her actual due date, Christina woke up worried that she hadn't felt the baby moving.</seg>
<seg id="117">We rushed to the hospital, but luckily our daughter started kicking again soon after we arrived.</seg>
<seg id="118">Nevertheless, our doctor took one look at our strained, terrified faces and decided it was time for our daughter to come into the world.</seg>
<seg id="119">"Enough stress," she said.</seg>
<seg id="120">Let's get it done.</seg>
<seg id="121">Hannah Valentine Emilie Falk arrived just after 5pm on Wednesday June 12, weighing 7 lbs.</seg>
<seg id="122">We'd named her long ago, just as we had her sister, who we called Rose.</seg>
<seg id="123">Because Hannah was very ill, Christina only got to hold her for a brief time before she was rushed off to the neonatal intensive care baby unit.</seg>
<seg id="124">Rose was delivered soon afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="125">She was tiny, only about 250 grams.</seg>
<seg id="126">We had agreed that we didn't want to see her.</seg>
<seg id="127">We had never met her and wanted to remember her as we'd seen her on the scan, when there was excitement and possibility and joy.</seg>
<seg id="128">The doctors and midwives were wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="129">They asked us carefully about our wishes beforehand, and whisked Rose away once she was born.</seg>
<seg id="130">One of them thoughtfully took a print of Rose's tiny hand and footprints for us.</seg>
<seg id="131">We subsequently framed it and today we keep it in our sitting room, a very private reminder of our little girl.</seg>
<seg id="132">Today, I'm glad we decided not to see her.</seg>
<seg id="133">Now I have a sense of Rose in my head, without any pain attached to my memory.</seg>
<seg id="134">Instead, she is this beautiful idea of a person.</seg>
<seg id="135">Anyone who's been through the excitement and chaos of a birth knows that your head is all over the place.</seg>
<seg id="136">We were so ecstatic about Hannah arriving that it was difficult to think about anything else.</seg>
<seg id="137">Rose was always in the back of our minds, of course, but she was out of our control.</seg>
<seg id="138">At that moment, Hannah was the priority.</seg>
<seg id="139">Two days later, Hannah was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for her heart operation.</seg>
<seg id="140">Christina was stuck at the Whittington because they were worried she had picked up a bacterial infection.</seg>
<seg id="141">It was awful for her to be separated from her daughter and I sent her constant pictures of Hannah by mobile phone, which she loved.</seg>
<seg id="142">I walked with Hannah as they wheeled her down to the operating theatre, her tiny body so innocent and vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="143">I kissed her forehead as she was given gas to knock her out and I was ushered out of the room.</seg>
<seg id="144">Back upstairs, I sat alone and wept.</seg>
<seg id="145">I wish I could take her place!</seg>
<seg id="146">I sobbed.</seg>
<seg id="147">I'd only met Hannah two days ago, so it felt strange to love someone so much.</seg>
<seg id="148">But in hindsight I can see that wasn't true.</seg>
<seg id="149">From the minute we found out Christina was pregnant, Hannah and I had known each other.</seg>
<seg id="150">Even when she was in the womb, I was her Dad, trying to help her, trying to protect her.</seg>
<seg id="151">Finally, Christina managed to get to Great Ormond Street, having told her doctors she was going whether they liked it or not.</seg>
<seg id="152">For an hour, we sat and hugged and cried and held hands so tightly, they turned white.</seg>
<seg id="153">An eternity later, the surgeon walked in.</seg>
<seg id="154">"It went well," he said and I heard Christina breathe out loudly.</seg>
<seg id="155">She's in recovery, you should be able to see her soon.</seg>
<seg id="156">Small and wan, with eyes that were blue like mine and almond-shaped like her mother's, Hannah blinked up at us from her hospital cot.</seg>
<seg id="157">Her oxygen levels were still low and would remain that way for a while.</seg>
<seg id="158">And she would need another heart operation at some point in the future.</seg>
<seg id="159">But she was beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="160">And she was ours.</seg>
<seg id="161">We brought her home the next week.</seg>
<seg id="162">Rose's funeral took place a fortnight later at the same church where Christina and I were married.</seg>
<seg id="163">At the funeral, I said a few strangled words with our close family standing beside us.</seg>
<seg id="164">Rose was cremated and placed in the same plot as my sister, Anna, who had died in 1980 of cancer when she was four months old.</seg>
<seg id="165">It was important for Christina and me that Rose shared her space with another little girl.</seg>
<seg id="166">After all, she was used to being next to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="167">Anna could keep her company.</seg>
<seg id="168">Nearly five months on, we have struggled to process our simultaneous emotions of grief and joy.</seg>
<seg id="169">We plan to tell Hannah about her sister.</seg>
<seg id="170">By sharing this story, we hope it might help us come to terms with what has happened, and maybe even help couples going through the same situation.</seg>
<seg id="171">Despite all the turmoil, we'd still love to have another child.</seg>
<seg id="172">Sometimes we worry we aren't thinking about Rose enough.</seg>
<seg id="173">It's very hard to grieve for someone you never met.</seg>
<seg id="174">But despite never being born, she did amazing things in the 30 or so weeks she was alive.</seg>
<seg id="175">She made people happy.</seg>
<seg id="176">She made people sad.</seg>
<seg id="177">She was a sister.</seg>
<seg id="178">I'll certainly remember her this way, one of two human-shaped figures in those fuzzy black-and-white scans.</seg>
<seg id="179">It makes me smile to think that on those ultrasounds, she was always on top, looking down at Hannah, making sure she's alright.</seg>
<seg id="180">And then I look at Hannah, as she giggles at us dancing around the kitchen, or laughs while she splashes in the bath and I realise that she's also our reminder of the little girl we lost.</seg>
<seg id="181">And what a magnificent one she is.</seg>

<seg id="3">RICKY Stuart has begun his new era at the Raiders in style, signing star youngster Jack Wighton for a further two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="4">The talented outside back was already committed to the Green Machine for 2014 and has now extended his deal until the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="5">Still just 20, Wighton made his representative debut for Country Origin in 2013 and has already played 27 NRL matches since making his debut for the Raiders in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">New coach and Canberra prodigal son Stuart conducted his first training session with the squad on Thursday, 15 years after leaving the club as a player for the Bulldogs.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Getting back to pre-season training yesterday and seeing all the boys faces made my decision really easy as I love this group of boys and can't wait to play alongside them for the next few years," Wighton said.</seg>
<seg id="8">I made a phone call to my Pop and he gave me some advice in that I should remain loyal to the team that gave me a chance to start my career and I took that on board as well.</seg>
<seg id="9">Having the leg injury at the end of the year got me down a bit but I realised it's something I can come back from and I can't wait to put in a big effort this pre-season and get back on the field.</seg>
<seg id="10">There's a really good feeling at the club at the moment and we're looking at building a strong culture.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stuart will now turn his attention to retaining young gun Anthony Milford, who has been offered a $1m-a-year contract to stay at the Raiders and turn down a bid from the Broncos.</seg>

<seg id="2">Brad Arthur at Parramatta offices yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="3">NEW Eels coach Brad ­Arthur has come out swinging, declaring: "We definitely won't be getting another wooden spoon."</seg>
<seg id="4">In his first sit-down interview since being appointed Parramatta coach, Arthur told News Limited his team would play next season with "an attitude of win-at-all-costs.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's a new time for Parramatta.</seg>
<seg id="6">Arthur said he was keen to make the Eels a rugby league powerhouse again.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reminded Parramatta had claimed two successive wooden spoons, Arthur said: "Yeah, well we won't be getting three . . . we definitely won't be getting three wooden spoons."</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked how he could be so certain, Arthur said: "Number one, the young blokes that are here who have come through the club in the last 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then we have the new players like Nathan Peats, Corey Norman, Lee Mossop and Will Hopoate.</seg>
<seg id="10">And then you mix that with Jarryd Hayne, who has averaged 12 or 14 games over the past couple of years.</seg>
<seg id="11">We want to make sure we get him nice and fit, nice and strong and playing his best footy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Timmy Mannah, Joseph Paulo, Luke Kelly - there's good talent already here.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will be training all pre-season with a positive attitude and come round one we are in the same position as everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="14">Everyone is fighting to make the top eight and our goal won't be any different.</seg>
<seg id="15">We want to make sure we are taking the field with an attitude of win at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="16">I know we won't win ­every game but we need to make sure we have a winning attitude.</seg>
<seg id="17">Daily Telegraph sports editor-at-large Phil Rothfield says he is disgusted with the behaviour of Sam Burgess and the inconsequential penalty handed to him for his hit on Sam Thaiday.</seg>
<seg id="18">We want the fans to know that every week we will be playing with passion and that we're playing for our logo and our fans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Parramatta players have been sapped of confidence in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="20">Aside from wooden spoons, despondent players have been forced to contend with sacked coaches, axed CEOs and fractured boards.</seg>
<seg id="21">Arthur said the club is now only looking forward.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We have new players, it's a new time for Parramatta, a new coach and I have my own philosophies and style," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">I know we won't be re-living or talking about what has happened here in the past.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's about what is going to happen and everything is going to be positive from here on.</seg>
<seg id="25">Parramatta are classic under-achievers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Four premierships in 66 years - all crammed in six years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Everyone is asking me why do I want to go back to Parramatta," he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">The obvious answer to people is that I want to coach an NRL team.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's more than that.</seg>
<seg id="30">I played all my juniors here, I played SG Ball here, under-21s, a bit of reserve grade.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cancel bonfire night parties as safety not guaranteed due to strike</seg>
<seg id="2">He said the service would have to "prioritise calls, and obviously those that involve a threat to life will be given the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of the Fire Brigade Union (FBU) will strike between 18.30 and 23.00 on Friday and for a further two hours on Monday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The union held a four-hour stoppage across England and Wales in September and was set for further strike action two weeks ago, but this was called off at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute is over Government plans to raise the age of retirement for fire fighters from 55 to 60, and the pension scheme for retired members.</seg>
<seg id="6">Union leaders say the Government is ignoring the physical demands of firefighting and threatening to sack employees who do not pass fitness tests as they aged.</seg>
<seg id="7">But ministers claim firefighters already have one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector.</seg>
<seg id="8">Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said members were not trying to scare the public by striking on what could be the busiest night of the year.</seg>
<seg id="9">We don't want to freak people out.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We want the Government to return to the negotiating table," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Asked whether he had any doubts about calling a strike on the weekend leading up to bonfire night, Mr Wrack said: "I have doubts about calling any strike action."</seg>
<seg id="12">It's something that firefighters don't want to do at all.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is very much the last resort for firefighters.</seg>
<seg id="14">It does hopefully demonstrate to people how angry firefighters are, how frustrated that having presented evidence after evidence after evidence to the Government to see that evidence dismissed and ignored.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fire minister Brandon Lewis said: "We offered fire fighters similar fitness principles to those the FBU accepted in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="16">The FBU should reconsider their decision to strike, announced just four days into discussions, and work for a resolution to this dispute.</seg>
<seg id="17">The public will be baffled by the FBU's course of action when they hear that the deal being offered to firefighters gives them one of the most generous pension schemes in all the public sector.</seg>
<seg id="18">The union rejected the minister's claims as a "myth."</seg>

<seg id="1">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings powers back to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels" regulatory approach.</seg>

<seg id="1">French politician Marine Le Pen hints that hostages may have been radicalised</seg>
<seg id="2">French far-right FN party president Marine Le Pen gives a press conference last month.</seg>

<seg id="4">Paris: French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has sparked a furore by questioning why four Frenchmen held captive by an al-Qaeda offshoot for three years sported beards and wore "strange clothing" after they were freed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The remarks by the head of the anti-immigration National Front party drew immediate condemnation on social media networks and from politicians, leading Ms Le Pen to backtrack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ms Le Pen appeared to hint that the four men - who were freed on Tuesday in west Africa and arrived home a day later - may have been radicalised during their captivity.</seg>
<seg id="7">Former French hostage Daniel Larribe (R) is welcomed by relatives on the tarmac upon his arrival at Villacoublay military airport, near Paris.</seg>
<seg id="8">They were kidnapped in Niger in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms Le Pen said the men's manner and appearance - including their clothing and facial hair - had left her "sceptical."</seg>
<seg id="10">I felt uncomfortable and I think I wasn't the only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"That is what many French people felt," she said on Europe 1.</seg>
<seg id="12">French President Francois Hollande, second from right, addresses the media alongside released French hostages Daniel Larribe, third from right, Pierre Legrand, second from left, Thierry Dol, right, and Marc Feret, left, shortly after their arrival at the Villacoublay military air base, outside Paris.</seg>
<seg id="13">Photo: AP</seg>
<seg id="14">The hostages looked gaunt in television images.</seg>
<seg id="15">Three of them sported beards and one had a scarf covering his face.</seg>
<seg id="16">One had a feeling of seeing men who were very reserved, that's the least that one can say.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The two men had trimmed beards in a strange manner and their clothing was strange," Ms Le Pen said.</seg>
<seg id="18">When pressed by an interviewer whether she thought they had become radicalised - in a plot reminiscent of the US television series Homeland - Ms Le Pen said it was "not her role" to comment.</seg>
<seg id="19">But she added: "This hostage with a scarf covering the face... all this merits some explanations on the hostages' part."</seg>
<seg id="20">French government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem slammed the comments as "incredibly indecent."</seg>
<seg id="21">"One has the impression that Madame Le Pen is so blinded by her hate of Muslims that she cannot share the nation's joy," said Eduardo Rihan-Cypel, spokesman for the ruling Socialist party.</seg>
<seg id="22">The mother of the youngest hostage Pierre Legrand, 28, said the hostages sported beards and scarves to express their solidarity with other hostages still in captivity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Abandon all hope, ye who venture here</seg>
<seg id="2">In our descent though the rings of the alternative investment universe, we have found that hedge funds are zombies and David Swensen is a mythic superman.</seg>
<seg id="3">So what then to make of venture capital?</seg>
<seg id="4">The Wizard of Oz revealed, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="5">The WSJ spotted the latest report on VC returns from Cambridge Associates:</seg>
<seg id="6">Their U.S. Venture Capital Index, which is based on data compiled from 1,439 venture capital funds, shows venture capital funds outperforming indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average only in the short term (the three months to June 30) or the long term (15 or 20 years).</seg>
<seg id="7">For the periods in between, you'd have been better off parking your money in an index fund, although at the ten-year horizon, everyone is about equal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Venture capitalists say the nature of their funds and the way they enter and exit investments means their returns are best judged over longer time periods - five years and upward.</seg>
<seg id="9">Actually, if you compare the VC performance to a proper index, it is even worse than that.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cambridge Associates, which advises and manages money for endowments, presents the VC fund returns as end-to-end Internal Rates of Returns.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it also uses its modified version of the Public Market Equivalent to compare those apples with the oranges of stock market investments.</seg>
<seg id="12">The mPME takes the cash flows into and out of VC funds, and attempts to measure what would have happened were they invested in a public market index instead.</seg>
<seg id="13">From the report (click to enlarge) the difference is the value-add:</seg>
<seg id="14">Compare the VC industry as a whole to the Russell 2000, an index of small US companies that is a better comparison to risky start-ups than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and it is not until you go back 15 years - capturing the listing of start-ups into the once-in-a-generation insanity of the dotcom boom - that the VC industry has added value.</seg>
<seg id="15">On a ten year basis it trailed by more than 2 percentage points a year, and it gets worse the closer to the present you look.</seg>
<seg id="16">Two things spring to mind.</seg>
<seg id="17">One is the brilliant and honest examination by the Kaufman Foundation, last year, of the triumph of hope over experience in its own record as an investor in venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">Looking at its own investments in more than 100 VC funds over 20 years, now worth $250m, the foundation concludes:</seg>
<seg id="19">Venture capital (VC) has delivered poor returns for more than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="20">VC returns haven't significantly outperformed the public market since the late 1990s, and, since 1997, less cash has been returned to investors than has been invested in VC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The problem, as ever, is not the individual funds.</seg>
<seg id="22">Venture capitalists, like hedge fund managers and private equity barons, are doing their best and responding to clear incentives.</seg>
<seg id="23">No, the problem that Kaufman finds is that of itself and other sophisticated investors sitting on big pots of money.</seg>
<seg id="24">Our research suggests that investors like us succumb time and again to narrative fallacies, a well-studied behavioral finance bias.</seg>
<seg id="25">We found in our own portfolio that:</seg>
<seg id="26">Only twenty of 100 venture funds generated returns that beat a public-market equivalent by more than 3 percent annually, and half of those began investing prior to 1995.</seg>
<seg id="27">The majority of funds - sixty-two out of 100 - failed to exceed returns available from the public markets, after fees and carry were paid.</seg>
<seg id="28">There is not consistent evidence of a J-curve in venture investing since 1997; the typical Kauffman Foundation venture fund reported peak internal rates of return (IRRs) and investment multiples early in a fund's life (while still in the typical sixty-month investment period), followed by serial fundraising in month twenty-seven.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only four of thirty venture capital funds with committed capital of more than $400 million delivered returns better than those available from a publicly traded small cap common stock index.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of eighty-eight venture funds in our sample, sixty-six failed to deliver expected venture rates of return in the first twenty-seven months (prior to serial fundraises).</seg>
<seg id="31">The cumulative effect of fees, carry, and the uneven nature of venture investing ultimately left us with sixty-nine funds (78 percent) that did not achieve returns sufficient to reward us for patient, expensive, long-term investing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Investment committees and trustees should shoulder blame for the broken LP investment model, as they have created the conditions for the chronic misallocation of capital.</seg>
<seg id="33">Part of that blame rests on an acceptance of "inconsistent and not fully informative VC performance reporting," which brings us to our second conclusion, that too much alternative investment exists in a closed loop of information.</seg>
<seg id="34">As Kaufman concludes, most reporting based on vintage years and performance quartiles is somewhere between incomplete and downright misleading.</seg>
<seg id="35">In spite of its horrible record it was placed in the top quartile of VC investors by Cambridge Associates as recently as 2009.</seg>
<seg id="36">Private funds report information when and to whom they please.</seg>
<seg id="37">Databases offer conflicting and incomplete snapshots, and investment consultants are themselves self-interested parties who would make little money advising on portfolios of index funds.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, as with the misleading presentation by Yale of its private equity and venture capital investment record, it can take many years for a true picture to start to emerge.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is then a very reasonable case for regulators to insist on greater, more uniform, and more useful disclosure.</seg>
<seg id="40">The charitable status of endowments and foundations, and the public policy importance of pension funds, provide a clear rationale for them to do so.</seg>
<seg id="41">Delaying such disclosure of portfolio-level investments, fees and returns for a year or two should also be sufficient to protect commercial interests, while still providing investors and academics with a clear picture of the private investment industry.</seg>
<seg id="42">Such a suggestion has already been made by Luigi Zingales of Chicago, an economist with impeccable right-wing credentials, who compared the current situation to that in the stock market prior to regulation FD, when public company executives could announce the earnings on a small conference call with a select group of analysts.</seg>
<seg id="43">He proposed three goals for regulation, the third of which was "reducing the regulatory gap between public markets and private markets."</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent trend of migration from the former to the latter suggests that this differential is excessive.</seg>
<seg id="45">This migration should be stopped not only by deregulating the public market, but also by introducing some disclosure standards in the private one.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the public market, the empowerment of institutional investors will make it possible to transform some of the mandatory regulation into optional rules, following the British comply-or-explain system.</seg>
<seg id="47">On the private market front, there are compelling reasons to mandate a delayed disclosure provision in which hedge funds, private equity funds, and even companies private equity funds invest in report information and performance with a 1 to 2 year delay.</seg>
<seg id="48">This delay has the benefit of reducing the competitive cost of disclosure, while at the same time allowing for a serious statistical analysis of this market, which will improve allocation of savings.</seg>
<seg id="49">And who could argue against a more efficient allocation of savings?</seg>

<seg id="1">Trainers Aren't Helping as Drugs Damage Sport</seg>
<seg id="2">Jae C. Hong/Associated Press</seg>
<seg id="3">The trainer Bob Baffert at Santa Anita Park for the Breeders" Cup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His horses average one drug violation every 545 starts.</seg>
<seg id="5">ARCADIA, Calif. - The Breeders" Cup World Championships are milestone days for a sport that can't get out of the way of itself for 363 days a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are two days of full fields of the finest American racehorses and a European or South American invader or two.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are multimillion dollar purses, and Santa Anita Park, with its palm trees swaying in the sunshine and the San Gabriel Mountains standing guard, burnishes horse racing with some old-time glamour.</seg>
<seg id="8">The stars also come out, sort of.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not the caliber of Bing Crosby, Spencer Tracy and Errol Flynn during Santa Anita's heyday.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the supermodel Kate Upton and the reality star Rob Dyrdek are signed on as Breeders" Cup ambassadors.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are signs of economic life in racing as well: The Keeneland September Sale took in nearly $220 million, jumping 28 percent from last year, for the seventh-highest total since the September sale was inaugurated in 1953.</seg>
<seg id="12">The movement to restrict drugs and make the sport more humane to both the human and equine athletes has caught some wind.</seg>
<seg id="13">It took congressional hearings and national shaming, but state after state has followed the lead of New York, Maryland and several mid-Atlantic states and tightened rules and demanded better testing.</seg>
<seg id="14">But no one has to look far to see how badly the sport is ailing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Look southwest to Hollywood Park, where one of the most beautiful tracks in the world is closing at year's end.</seg>
<seg id="16">Or look at Santa Anita on Friday and Saturday, when one of the smallest contingents (16) of European horses in Breeders" Cup history will compete.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was the year the Breeders" Cup was supposed to ban the race-day medication furosemide, sold as Lasix, in all of its races to get American racing in step with the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 2-year old races were run without it last year and will be again this year.</seg>
<seg id="19">But horsemen, led by the Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert and some of his prominent owners, threatened lawsuits and hinted at a boycott, which forced the Breeders" Cup to abandon the wider plan.</seg>
<seg id="20">"To use Lasix, or pretty much anything else, challengers from Europe face an uphill struggle," wrote Garry Owen of Scotland's Daily Record and Sunday Mail.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's a huge ask for our horses to compete with the "septic tanks" in their own back yard, and I'm convinced the only rule in U.S. racing is there are no rules."</seg>
<seg id="22">Last year, a New York Times investigation identified the nation's most dangerous racetracks; showed how a pervasive drug culture put horses and riders at risk; and found that 24 horses a week die at America's tracks, a rate greater than in countries where drug use is severely restricted.</seg>
<seg id="23">But of the top 20 trainers in the United States by purses won this year, only one - Graham Motion - has never been cited for a drug violation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Nearly all have horses competing here, and some have run afoul of the rules far more frequently than others.</seg>
<seg id="25">Baffert averages one drug violation every 545 starts, and Doug O'Neill averages one every 640.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both have won the Kentucky Derby - Baffert three times.</seg>
<seg id="27">In May, Shug McGaughey won his first Derby with Orb.</seg>
<seg id="28">He has one medication violation in his Hall of Fame career of 8,109 starts, according to records compiled from the Association of Racing Commissioners International and entered in a database.</seg>
<seg id="29">There's also a feeling of uneasiness here as horsemen wait for the California Horse Racing Board to release the results of an inquiry into the acute deaths of dozens of horses.</seg>
<seg id="30">Among them, over a 16-month period, were seven belonging to Baffert.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I know I did nothing wrong," Baffert said.</seg>
<seg id="32">My barn did nothing wrong.</seg>
<seg id="33">The C.H.R.B. has to explain it.</seg>
<seg id="34">I can't explain it.</seg>
<seg id="35">The board has conducted drug tests and environmental toxicology sampling, and scoured necropsy reports.</seg>
<seg id="36">Its spokesman, Mike Marten, said it hoped to have a report and make a public statement in mid-November.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter the outcome, that decision will be met with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Jockey Club released polling data in August showing how far public confidence has fallen in the sport even among its biggest bettors.</seg>
<seg id="39">Nearly four in five bettors - 79 percent - factored in the possibility of illegal drug use when handicapping races at certain tracks or in certain states.</seg>
<seg id="40">By a 9-to-1 margin, bettors said they bet less, not more, as a result.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's clear needles and drugs are draining the sport's bottom line.</seg>
<seg id="42">It's clear that horsemen can stop it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Why don't they?</seg>

<seg id="5">For ardent bibliophiles, a shopping trip to this book shop must be close to a spiritual experience.</seg>
<seg id="6">Broerenkerk, the famed 15th century Dominican church in Zwolle, Netherlands, has been transformed into a stunning modern book store.</seg>
<seg id="7">Architects BK.</seg>
<seg id="8">Architecten were allowed to radically redesign the interior of the 547-year-old Gothic building on the strict condition they left the original features, such as the pipe organ, stained glass windows and decor intact.</seg>
<seg id="9">Transformation: A collection of book stands now fills the void beneath the stunning vaulted ceiling of the 15th Century cathedral in Zwolle, Netherlands</seg>

<seg id="11">Architecten were allowed to radically redesign the interior of the 547-year-old building on the strict condition they left the original features, such as the pipe organ, intact</seg>
<seg id="12">The tight building conditions and regulations associated with this unique project means designers had to come up with clever solutions in order to maximise the use of space.</seg>
<seg id="13">Designers have managed to squeeze three floors of retail space into the lofty wings of the cathedral by installing a freestanding and temporary structure.</seg>
<seg id="14">It can be removed at a later date so that the church can be returned to its original purpose.</seg>
<seg id="15">The shop, Waanders in de Broeren, opened earlier this summer and so far has welcomed tens of thousands of shoppers through the grand entrance.</seg>
<seg id="16">Spiritual experience: Architects tried to retain the character of the majestic medieval cathedral, leaving the stained glass window, pipe organ and decor unchanged</seg>

<seg id="18">The architects said: 'We wanted all the additions made to the church to be sober, in respect to the church, modest.'</seg>
<seg id="19">They have now incorporated more than 700 square meters of shopping space - including a restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Broerenkerk church was part of the Dominican monastery founded in 1465.</seg>
<seg id="21">The monastery was closed in 1580 and the monks were expelled.</seg>
<seg id="22">From 1640 until 1982 the church was used for Protestant services.</seg>

<seg id="2">The studio Blizzard released its 1994 platformer Blackthorne for PC free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is reported by WoW Insider.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to its data, the game became available on Battle.net in the classic games section of Blizzard.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, some gamers note that presently only those users whose accounts are linked to the American portion of the service can download it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The game is also still inaccessible for Russian users.</seg>
<seg id="7">As the media reports, the version that Blizzard just released for PC by appearance does not differ from the original version of the game.</seg>
<seg id="8">The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="9">The platformer Blackthorne, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, initially came out for SNES consoles.</seg>
<seg id="10">Its events were set on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.</seg>
<seg id="11">One day the dark ruler Sarlac decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle who was saved from death by being sent to Earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Twenty years later he returned to Tuul in order to battle against the henchmen of Sarlac and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.</seg>
<seg id="14">The original Blackthorne became the first game that the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="15">Before that it was called Silicon & Synapse.</seg>
<seg id="16">The publisher of Blackthorne was the company Interplay.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme</seg>
<seg id="2">Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters stood to personally benefit from policies.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.</seg>
<seg id="10">Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting?</seg>
<seg id="11">"We need to have a better system," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Why is it that we shouldn't have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night?</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't like it?</seg>
<seg id="15">In this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take "very seriously" his new job.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public office is about public service.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Georgia teen who died in 'freak accident' believe son was murdered</seg>
<seg id="2">The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They absolutely think their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.</seg>
<seg id="8">They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="11">What was the cause of death?</seg>
<seg id="12">Was his death the result of a crime?</seg>
<seg id="13">Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will follow the facts wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="15">My objective is to discovery the truth.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists" for a formal investigation, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."</seg>
<seg id="18">A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.</seg>
<seg id="21">A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="22">A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Queensland century-maker Peter Forrest overcame illness and South Australia's bowlers to steer the Bulls to first innings points in the Sheffield Shield match in Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forrest battled a virus sweeping through the Bulls but batted all but nine overs of Friday's third day of play, as Queensland reached 7-400 at stumps, 13 runs ahead of SA.</seg>
<seg id="4">Forrest, who made 129, vomited frequently at Glenelg Oval due to a stomach virus crippling the Queenslanders.</seg>
<seg id="5">The latest victim is Test paceman Ryan Harris, who spent Friday at the team hotel and is unlikely to bowl again in the match.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bulls coach Stuart Law says no-one knows the origin of the illness, which is affecting players for 48 hours and causing vomiting and diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus forced captain James Hopes to be a late withdrawal from the match and has also hit Ben Cutting, Greg Moller, Chris Hartley, Forrest and now Harris.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Who knows what it is ... the doctor here doesn't know what it is," Law said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Forrest was curled up asleep on the dressing room floor after his gallant knock.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They say mind or matter, and he was just focused on one thing, his batting," Law said.</seg>
<seg id="11">About 3 o'clock this morning he started, it was coming out of both ends - there is no pretty way to say it.</seg>
<seg id="12">""It was a tough ask but he dug in and did us proud.""</seg>
<seg id="13">Forrest combined with fellow virus victim Hartley for a defining 194-run partnership for the fifth wicket which ensured the visitors banked first innings points.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hartley, who left the field after lunch on the Wednesday's opening day and didn't return until he came to the crease before lunch on Friday, compiled an invaluable 89.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both Forrest and Hartley were often on their haunches between balls and spent drinks breaks sitting down with towels draped over the heads.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the hardships, Law was rapt to take innings points.</seg>
<seg id="17">""With the effort we have had to put in, and have basically half a team that is feeling anywhere near decent, it's monumental effort really," he said."</seg>
<seg id="18">Law had a dig at the flat pitch which was proving difficult for batsmen to score freely and for bowlers to take wickets.</seg>
<seg id="19">""Cricket Australia wanted super-flat wickets," he said."</seg>
<seg id="20">""I'm not blaming anyone.</seg>
<seg id="21">But cricket wickets need a bit of grass on them for batters to score runs and for bowlers to take wickets.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president</seg>
<seg id="2">Russia intends to carry out informational provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and countries of the Eastern partnership - such an announcement to the BNS agency was made in the department of state security of the republic (DGB).</seg>
<seg id="3">Information about this was published on the DELFI portal.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the report, in particular Moscow intends to "slander" the president of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents supposedly found in a Russian state archive that concern facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to an intelligence agency, preparation of the informational attack is led by the department of analysis of public processes of the directorate of the administration of the president of Russia concerning interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">The structure is headed by Evgeniy Umerenkov who repeatedly visited Lithuania and took part in a meeting of the Lithuanian People's Party.</seg>
<seg id="7">Department employee V. Smirnov is also allegedly a participant of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="8">As asserts the intelligence agency, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work, regularly came to Lithuania until the end of 2012 and made contact with local politicians, political scientists and representatives of the media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now Smirnov has been barred entry into the territory of the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the previous day the president of Lithuania Grybauskaite announced that she knows about the information attack being prepared against her.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to her, the main reason is the successful chairmanship of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and the "striving of the country toward energy independence"</seg>
<seg id="12">The Lithuanian leader previously repeatedly criticized the actions of Russian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, she stated that in the Kremlin they treat Lithuania "without due respect".</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, Grybauskaite accused the head of the RF Vladimir Putin of pushing "only demands" toward Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let us recall that in September Rospotrebnadzor suspended imports of Lithuanian milk into Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was reported that the quality of the products do not conform to sanitary and epidemiological norms.</seg>
<seg id="17">At that time the leader of Lithuania declared that if Russia does not withdraw the ban, the administration of the country must prepare an address to the WTO.</seg>

<seg id="2">September 16, 2013: Heavily armed U.S. marshals walk from the Washington Navy Yard after a shooting by gunman Aaron Alexis.Reuters</seg>
<seg id="3">The independent contractor that hired Washington Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis knew he was showing signs of mental illness, but failed to report the finding - despite rules requiring them to do so, according to congressional testimony Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stephen Lewis, a Deputy Director for the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that it was determined that the company, The Experts, was well aware of Alexis's mental instability and failed to report the information.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, the contractor failed to seek out a copy of a police report for a 2004 arrest in Seattle when Alexis allegedly shot out the tires of a car in what was described as a rage "blackout."</seg>
<seg id="6">However, his employer was not obligated to seek out the report under current criteria for background checks on an individual.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not in our view, a case of malfeasance on the part of the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They did what they were supposed to do," Brenda Farrell, Director of Defense Capabilities and Management at the Government Accountability Office said during her testimony.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thursday's hearing was meant to examine the adequacy of background checks and the security clearance system for federal employees and contract workers.</seg>
<seg id="10">It comes as officials investigate how Alexis, a 34-year-old defense contractor, was able to acquire and maintain a secret clearance despite a series of violent outbursts, repeated brushes with the law and concerns about his mental health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The former Navy reservist killed 12 people inside the Navy Yard building where he worked Sep.</seg>
<seg id="12">16 before being fatally shot by police.</seg>
<seg id="13">He entered the property with a valid security badge.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Barack Obama has also ordered the White House budget office to examine security standards for government contractors and employees across federal agencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Concerns about weaknesses in the security clearance system have surfaced not only with Alexis, but also with National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and Army Pvt. Bradley Manning, currently imprisoned for leaking classified documents.</seg>
<seg id="16">One revision discussed Thursday is the process by which security clearance holders are re-investigated.</seg>
<seg id="17">That currently happens every five years for those with top secret clearances and every 10 years for holders of secret clearances.</seg>
<seg id="18">A new tool emerging from an executive order would allow that review to happen at any time, including automated records checks of government and commercial databases, said Brian Prioletti, an assistant director in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="19">Defense officials have said that when Alexis applied for security clearance with the Navy, he lied about the 2004 arrest in Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="20">An FBI fingerprint check revealed the arrest, but an investigative report from an Office of Professional Management contractor omitted the fact that Alexis had fired shots, court records in Seattle did not detail the circumstances of the arrest, and no charges were filed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Alexis was granted a secret clearance in 2008 and held onto it despite multiple subsequent encounters with police, including a 2010 arrest in Texas, where a neighbor told police she was nearly struck by a bullet fired from his downstairs apartment.</seg>
<seg id="22">No charges were filed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Elaine Kaplan, acting director of the OPMt, said her staff has advised her that Alexis's file "complied with all applicable standards," but that OPM's office of internal oversight and compliance is reviewing the matter.</seg>
<seg id="24">One month before the Navy Yard shooting, Alexis called police in Rhode Island to the hotel where he was staying and complained about voices wanting to harm him, according to the police report.</seg>
<seg id="25">The FBI has said he believed he was being bombarded with extremely low frequency radio waves.</seg>

<seg id="2">The vice governor of the Moscow region Yuriy Oleynikov stated that almost a third of rural villages in the Moscow region are fully subsidized</seg>
<seg id="3">In total 187 villages out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2013 187 villages out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="5">The proportion of subsidies within the amount of budget revenues of 122 rural villages exceeds 50%, and 83 are one hundred percent subsidized.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within the scope of fiscal capacity, around 25 billion rubles is directed from the regional budget," said Oleynikov.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vice governor also noted that for only three municipal villages - Mytischi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the amount of budget revenues amounts to over 1 billion rubles for 2013.</seg>
<seg id="8">The revenues of rural villages of many regions are less than 3 million rubles, "this is not nearly enough".</seg>
<seg id="9">Expenses on maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 villages of the Moscow region amount to more than 70%, "moreover a reduction in quality of services is observed", noted Oleynikov.</seg>
<seg id="10">Previously he ordered the heads of municipal formations of the Moscow region before the end of November to think about which villages require integration, incorporation into municipal districts or a change in the administrative management system.</seg>
<seg id="11">These proposals will be processed by the end of January.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before that, the governor of the Moscow region announced that within the scope of administrative reform, in the Moscow region it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also in Mozhaysk, Kashirsk, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensk districts, Lyubertsi and Kotelniki there is demand for consolidation of municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="14">Discussion of this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.</seg>
<seg id="15">Chairman of the Moscow Regional Duma Igor Bryntsalov also announced that in total they plan to consolidate around 30 rural villages and 12 districts of the Moscow region as part of the forthcoming administrative reform.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is associated with the fact that of 178 rural villages in the Moscow region less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 are subsidized.</seg>

<seg id="1">An Obama voter's cry of despair</seg>
<seg id="2">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
<seg id="3">He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism</seg>
<seg id="4">Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.</seg>
<seg id="11">The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.</seg>
<seg id="18">Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was simply nothing I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of "don't ask don't tell," to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.</seg>
<seg id="22">But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.</seg>
<seg id="23">I've reached a point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="27">It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is what troubles me most of all.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.</seg>
<seg id="40">At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We've got to remember who we are.'</seg>
<seg id="43">It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.</seg>
<seg id="44">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

<seg id="2">Reporter: Months go by, and those nomadic electricians in the room next door have long since departed texas.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now, convinced that greg fleniken was killed by a bullet fired from the neighboring hotel room -- where three electricians from wisconsin were staying -- detective scott apple and private eye ken brennan travel there for a new round of interviews.</seg>
<seg id="4">They meet up at a local police department with electrician tim steinmetz, who once again appears courteous and curious.</seg>
<seg id="5">So what happened to this guy?</seg>
<seg id="6">Did you guys ever find out?</seg>
<seg id="7">Reporter: Time and time again, they ask him what he remembers.</seg>
<seg id="8">You didn't hear anything?</seg>
<seg id="9">You don't know anything that went on?</seg>
<seg id="10">Absolutely no idea?</seg>
<seg id="11">No idea.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporter: Steinmetz sticks to his original statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">That he, lance mueller and trent pasano did nothing out of the ordinary that night.</seg>
<seg id="14">No mention of any gunshots.</seg>
<seg id="15">And steinmetz doesn't just tell that story, he swears to it in writing.</seg>
<seg id="16">I said, "let's get a notary as well, and have it notarized."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it looks even that much more official.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do you swear everything in this statement is the truth, the whole truth, so help you god?</seg>
<seg id="19">Reporter: But just when he thought he was off the hook, investigators pull him back in.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was their plan all along.</seg>
<seg id="21">Is that it?</seg>
<seg id="22">Hang on a second.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was until you signed that statement.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now you got a problem.</seg>
<seg id="25">You don't think that we know the story, that we don't know what the hell went on here?</seg>
<seg id="26">Of course we know.</seg>
<seg id="27">What are you, a moron?</seg>
<seg id="28">You just made a false police report that's why.</seg>
<seg id="29">You want to go to jail for that?</seg>
<seg id="30">Tim, we know what happened.</seg>
<seg id="31">We know everything that happened.</seg>
<seg id="32">And I realize you're trying to be noble and protect a friend.</seg>
<seg id="33">But you're about to get your whole family in a bind, and it's not worth it.</seg>
<seg id="34">And after the guy started thinking about that, and he says, "okay, I'll tell you the truth."</seg>
<seg id="35">No, I don't want to go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then tell us what happened!</seg>
<seg id="37">Reporter: Steinmetz begins to reveal the pieces of the puzzle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Explaining how the evening was fueled by alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="39">Steinmetz and fellow electrician lance mueller entering the hotel with that beer.</seg>
<seg id="40">They are later joined by electrician trent pasano.</seg>
<seg id="41">And the heavy drinking begins next door in room 349.</seg>
<seg id="42">It was an accident.</seg>
<seg id="43">It really was.</seg>
<seg id="44">Reporter: It turns out mueller has a handgun in his truck and at some point, for some reason, steinmetz says the third electrician, trent pasano goes to fetch it.</seg>
<seg id="45">We were in the room, and trent brought lance's freaking gun up there.</seg>
<seg id="46">And lance was around with that gun.</seg>
<seg id="47">And he went and loaded it.</seg>
<seg id="48">Pulled the fricking trigger, and the gun went off.</seg>
<seg id="49">Reporter: Later that day, they track down the third electrician, and trent pasano corroborates the story.</seg>
<seg id="50">Listen as he explains how he nearly became the victim in this case.</seg>
<seg id="51">Saying the bullet just missed him.</seg>
<seg id="52">And he goes, bam!</seg>
<seg id="53">And I went like this.</seg>
<seg id="54">Son of a .</seg>
<seg id="55">And I looked there was a hole, and it was smoking.</seg>
<seg id="56">Reporter: It turns out that private eye was right.</seg>
<seg id="57">The bullet slicing through the wall in room 349 and heading directly for fleniken, striking him in the groin area and shooting straight up to his heart.</seg>
<seg id="58">All while he was sitting there watching "iron man 2."</seg>
<seg id="59">All of that internal damage caused by a single shot from the nine millimeter hand gun.</seg>
<seg id="60">Afterward, mueller quickly packing up the gun and returning it to his truck.</seg>
<seg id="61">Exiting the hotel with a bag then returning moments later without it.</seg>
<seg id="62">And never telling anyone.</seg>
<seg id="63">Those electricians try to cover both their tracks and that bullet hole.</seg>
<seg id="64">And what was it they put in there?</seg>
<seg id="65">Toothpaste.</seg>
<seg id="66">Reporter: They put toothpaste in the hole.</seg>
<seg id="67">Mm-hmm.</seg>
<seg id="68">Reporter: Thinking no one would ever notice.</seg>
<seg id="69">Exactly.</seg>
<seg id="70">No one went to check on greg.</seg>
<seg id="71">No one alerted the front desk.</seg>
<seg id="72">Never bothered to knock, never bothered to put their ear to the door.</seg>
<seg id="73">If they heard any moanin' or anything, nothing.</seg>
<seg id="74">Reporter: And the next day, even when they see the guest carried out on a gurney from the room next door, they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="75">This is not an accident, you know?</seg>
<seg id="76">This is a murder!</seg>
<seg id="77">He pulled that frigging trigger.</seg>
<seg id="78">I sat right there and watched him do it.</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter: The only man missing at confession central was the shooter himself.</seg>
<seg id="80">Watch as apple and brennan have steinmetz call the gunman.</seg>
<seg id="81">Steinmetz urges mueller him to turn himself in.</seg>
<seg id="82">I said they probably are going to come and get your .</seg>
<seg id="83">But, now that they know the truth and everything, you should probably try to make some kind of effort, you know?</seg>
<seg id="84">Reporter: Listen in as mueller realizes they figured it out.</seg>
<seg id="85">Oh .</seg>
<seg id="86">I mean, they're gonna come and get me.</seg>
<seg id="87">Reporter: He pleads no contest to a charge of manslaughter.</seg>

<seg id="5">Has decided to stay off-air following publicity around arrest</seg>
<seg id="6">By Stephen Wright and Anna Edwards</seg>
<seg id="7">Paul Gambaccini has confirmed he was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences as part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree investigation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The veteran BBC broadcaster has denied all allegations, a spokesman for the BBC broadcaster said tonight.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 64-year-old radio and TV presenter was held on suspicion of sexual offences by officers working on Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree.</seg>
<seg id="10">Detectives did not disclose details of the allegations facing Gambaccini, but it indicated in a statement that he is not suspected of committing offences with paedophile Savile.</seg>
<seg id="11">Paul Gambaccini has been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences under Operation Yewtree</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC broadcaster Gambaccini denied the claims, saying in a statement: 'On Monday night, 28 October, I attended an excellent production of the Kander and Ebb musical, the Scottsboro Boys, at the Young Vic theatre.</seg>
<seg id="13">It concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely accused of sexual offences.</seg>
<seg id="14">Within hours, I was arrested by Operation Yewtree.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music.</seg>
<seg id="16">Radio 2 DJ Gambaccini, dubbed the "Professor of Pop" because of his encyclopaedic knowledge of music, was arrested at his home in the South Bank area of south London.</seg>
<seg id="17">Gambaccini, who is in a civil partnership with his actor/model boyfriend Chris Sherwood, was questioned by detectives for several hours before being released late on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for Gambaccini said: 'Mr Gambaccini was interviewed by Operation Yewtree officers about historic allegations.</seg>
<seg id="19">He answered their questions and was co-operative.</seg>
<seg id="20">He denied all allegations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Paul Gambaccini was questioned by detectives for several hours before being released late on Tuesday</seg>
<seg id="22">He has also decided to stay off-air following the publicity around his arrest.</seg>
<seg id="23">A BBC spokesman told ITV: 'Paul Gambaccini has decided that, in light of today's media attention, he would rather not be on-air at present and we respect that decision.</seg>
<seg id="24">Therefore, Paul will not be presenting on BBC Radio in coming weeks and replacement programmes for the period will be announced soon.</seg>
<seg id="25">The replacement show on Radio 2 tomorrow will be 'Johnnie Walker Meets Art Garfunkel'.</seg>
<seg id="26">A report on the BBC website stated: 'BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini has been arrested on suspicion of historical sexual offences as part of Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was held at his home in south London on Tuesday morning and questioned in police custody before being released on bail.</seg>
<seg id="28">Yewtree has been investigating claims of historical sexual abuse since the Jimmy Savile scandal broke in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="29">There has been no response from the BBC but a statement is expected later.</seg>
<seg id="30">Paul Gambaccini, pictured in 1980 boxing with a kangaroo at Eastbourne circus, has had a long and varied career</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Gambaccini was arrested under the strand of Operation Yewtree known as "others," meaning the arrest is not connected to the Jimmy Savile investigation.</seg>
<seg id="32">The other two strands of Yewtree concern the actions of Savile, and allegations against Savile and others.</seg>
<seg id="33">Gambaccini, who has dual US and British nationality having become a British citizen in 2005, was a BBC Radio 1 presenter for 16 years, including 11 years at the helm of a Billboard Top 30 countdown show.</seg>
<seg id="34">A regular contributor to BBC Radio 4"s long-running arts programme Kaleidoscope, he was a long-time TV morning show correspondent for British television, and makes regular appearances on other British TV magazine shows.</seg>
<seg id="35">He was the host of the 12-part Classic FM series Paul Gambaccini's Hall of Heroes, and is currently the chairman of the Radio 4 music quiz Counterpoint.</seg>
<seg id="36">Inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame in 2005, Gambaccini is the author of more than 15 books.</seg>
<seg id="37">Paul Gambaccini, seen with David Hamilton & Mike Read on Top Of The Pops, was dubbed the 'Professor of Pop' because of his encyclopaedic knowledge of music</seg>
<seg id="38">Both his brothers - one based in New York, the other in Switzerland - declined to comment.</seg>
<seg id="39">Yewtree was set up to investigate claims of historical sexual offences since the Jimmy Savile scandal broke last year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Gambaccini was the 15th suspect to be arrested by officers on Operation Yewtree.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scotland Yard said Gambaccini, which it did not name, was one of two suspects detained by Yewtree officers earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">It said: "On Tuesday, 29 October a man ('Yewtree 15' - 64 years old) was arrested."</seg>
<seg id="43">The man was arrested at an address in south London on suspicion of sexual offences and taken into police custody.</seg>
<seg id="44">He falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'others'.</seg>

<seg id="1">Life in prison for Camille Cleroux who 'wanted a better view'</seg>
<seg id="2">A CANADIAN serial killer has been sentenced to life in prison for bludgeoning his two former wives to death with a rock, and killing his neighbour for her apartment with "a better view."</seg>
<seg id="3">Former diner dishwasher Camille Cleroux, 58, admitted to killing his ex-wives Lise Roy and Jean Rock and neighbour Paula Leclair over a two decade period beginning in 1990, and burying all three women in shallow graves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ontario Superior Court Justice Lynn Ratushny who sentenced Cleroux to 25 years in jail, according to local media, said Cleroux's motive "to kill these cherished women just to get them out of your way" was "stomach churning."</seg>
<seg id="5">Leclair's body was found in a wooded area near old train yards in Ottawa in June 2010.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cleroux had told her son who was checking on the 64-year-old that she had gone on a trip and had left the apartment to him.</seg>
<seg id="7">He later confessed that when Leclair refused to hand over her apartment, Cleroux invited her for a walk in May 2010, killed her and buried her in a shallow grave.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cleroux told police that he wanted to move in to his neighbour's apartment because it was bigger and "had a better view," the court reportedly heard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Roy's body was found buried in the backyard of the couple's former home.</seg>
<seg id="10">He confessed to hitting her with a rock after a heated argument in 1990, then concocted a story that Roy left him.</seg>
<seg id="11">He similarly dispatched Rock in 2003, but twice dug up her bones fearing they would be discovered, rolled them in a shopping cart and dropped them in a mesh onion bag weighted down with rocks into the Rideau Canal - a UNESCO World Heritage site.</seg>
<seg id="12">Meanwhile, Cleroux paid a friend to write letters to Rock's family explaining in her handwriting that she had left Cleroux to live with a truck driver named Pierre.</seg>

<seg id="1">The affair they didn't expose: Phone hacking trial reveals that Rebekah Brooks and News of the World successor Andy Coulson had secret six year relationship</seg>
<seg id="2">On day three of the trial, the court heard that the secret affair began in 1998 and ended in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="3">Andrew Edis, QC, the prosecution's leading counsel, told the court that the relationship spanned "the whole conspiracy period" and was central to the charges the pair are now facing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"What Mr Coulson knew, Mrs Brooks knew too," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">And what Mrs Brooks knew, Mr Coulson knew too.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is the point.</seg>
<seg id="7">The relationship was discovered when officers from the Metropolitan Police, investigating the re-opened hacking case in 2011, searched Mrs Brooks" London home and found a laptop in a cupboard.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Edis said an emotional letter to Mr Coulson written by Mrs Brooks was found on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The jury was told that it was unclear whether or not it had ever been sent.</seg>
<seg id="10">The letter outlined Mrs Brooks" response to a request from Mr Coulson that their relationship needed to end.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the fact that the affair was apparently over and the discussion of agreed new "rules" for the future, Mrs Brooks nevertheless openly declared her love for Mr Coulson and admitted she was worried about how she would cope without him.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a highly emotional passage she wrote: "The fact is you are my very best friend."</seg>
<seg id="13">I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you.</seg>
<seg id="14">We laugh and cry together... in fact without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope.</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm frightened to be without you.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mrs Brooks edited the News of the World between 2000 and 2003, when she left to edit The Sun.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Coulson, who had been her deputy at the NOTW, then moved into the editor's chair.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mrs Brooks married the actor Ross Kemp in 2002, while Mr Coulson and his wife Eloise were married in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Edis explained to the jury that he was not deliberately intruding on their private lives, or making a moral judgment on their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="20">Instead he said the key issue about the relationship concerned the criminal charges they both faced.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "[They] are charged with conspiracy and, when people are charged with conspiracy, the first question a jury has to answer is how well did they know each other?"</seg>
<seg id="22">How much did they trust each other?</seg>
<seg id="23">And the fact that they were in this relationship, which was a secret, means that they trusted each other quite a lot with at least that secret, and that's why we are telling you about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson, along with the former managing editor of the NOTW Stuart Kuttner, and the paper's former news editor Ian Edmondson, are charged with conspiracy to illegally intercept mobile phone messages.</seg>
<seg id="25">The charge against them relates to the period from October 2000 to August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="26">Three other former NOTW newsdesk journalists, Neville Thurlbeck, Greg Miskiw and James Weatherup, have already pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge.</seg>
<seg id="27">Eight defendants in the trial, which is expected to last until Easter, are facing a total of seven counts involving conspiracy to phone hack, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and making corrupt payments to public officials.</seg>
<seg id="28">Not all of the defendants face the same charges and all have pleaded not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="29">The disclosure of the Coulson-Brooks affair came as the prosecution outlined the evidence it intends to present concerning the hacking of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's phone.</seg>
<seg id="30">Glenn Mulcaire, the specialist investigator tasked by the NOTW to access private voicemails, pleaded guilty at an earier stage of the proceedings to hacking her phone in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Edis said that if it is proved that Mr Kuttner, Mrs Brooks or Mr Coulson were involved in the commissioning of Mulcaire at that time, "then that is enough to convict them [on the conspiracy to hack charge]."</seg>
<seg id="32">He told the jury: "This is important."</seg>
<seg id="33">The jury were told that, following a campaign by the NOTW to publicise the names and addresses of convicted paedophiles after the killing of seven-year-old Sarah Payne in 2000, Mrs Brooks took a personal interest in the Dowler case.</seg>
<seg id="34">The prosecution stated that the NOTW had developed a relationship with Surrey Police, who were investigating the murder, and that following the commissioning of Mulcaire to access the schoolgirl's phone, Mr Kuttner had contacted the investigation team telling them that the paper had a tape containing voicemails from her mobile.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr Edis said: "Surrey Police took no action about that at the time."</seg>
<seg id="36">It's common ground [agreed between prosecution and the defence teams] that [they] should and could have investigated when it came to their attention.</seg>
<seg id="37">But perhaps at that time they may have thought it was really more important to find Milly.</seg>
<seg id="38">The jury had earlier been told that Mr Kuttner was "not just a bookkeeper" but had been a journalist who regularly attended editorial meetings and had been the paper's main link and liaison and senior police officers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The jury also heard that Mr Kuttner's own notebooks showed that he had contacted senior officers in charge of the Dowler investigation.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mr Edis told the court that only hacking Milly Dowler's phone could have given the NOTW the specific information that it published in its first edition on 14 April 2002.</seg>
<seg id="41">The court heard how this article contained the contents of voicemails from Milly's phone, but was later pulled from subsequent editions.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Mrs Brooks was on holiday in Dubai during the week leading up to the publication of the story, the jury was told that Mrs Brooks" calls and texts to the NOTW increased in frequency significantly as the Saturday night publication deadline approached.</seg>
<seg id="43">Mr Edis said the relationship between Mr Coulson and Mrs Brooks was crucial to understanding the background to the key editorial decisions that had been made inside the NOTW on the night the paper published the Dowler story.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was alleged that Mr Kuttner, Neville Thurlbeck and others inside the paper had been aware of where the information about the Dowler story had come from.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was phone hacking - and was not much of secret.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Everyone seems to have known," Mr Edis told the court.</seg>
<seg id="47">He asked the jury to consider "whether the [information] had been kept from the editor and the deputy editor."</seg>
<seg id="48">And why on earth would it [have been]?</seg>
<seg id="49">Mr Edis told the jury that Mrs Brooks knew about the "practice" of phone hacking, saying that she was heard in 2010 to say that it was, in the late 1990s, "widespread across the whole newspaper industry" and that "no one thought it was wrong at that time."</seg>
<seg id="50">Mr Edis said that the jury would be told how, at a lunch in the autumn of 2005, Mrs Brooks revealed to Eimear Cook, the former wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, that hacking was a simple process and only required the person's mobile phone number and a factory pin code.</seg>
<seg id="51">Mr Edis said that Ms Cook had been given an example by Mrs Brooks of a story "that had come from phone hacking" which related to Sir Paul McCartney, his former wife Heather Mills and an engagement ring.</seg>
<seg id="52">In 2002 the NOTW published an article about the couple headlined: "Macca throws Heather's ring out of hotel window."</seg>
<seg id="53">Exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="54">Mr Edis said that if Ms Cook was right: "That was an account by Mrs Brooks of that story during her editorship having being produced by phone hacking."</seg>
<seg id="55">The crown is expected to continue its opening address on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="56">The letter: What Brooks wrote to Coulson</seg>
<seg id="57">..."Finally and the least of our worries, but how do we really work this new relationship?"</seg>
<seg id="58">There are a hundred things that have happened since Saturday night that I would normally share with you..some important, most trivial.</seg>
<seg id="59">The fact is you are my very best friend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We laugh and cry together...infact without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope.</seg>
<seg id="61">"I'm frightened to be without you...but bearing in mind "the rules" you will not know how I am doing and visa versa."</seg>
<seg id="62">The thought of finding out anything about you or your life from someone else fills me with absolute dread.</seg>
<seg id="63">Also you said I had to email you if anything important happened..like if I was ill?</seg>
<seg id="64">I don't understand this...we are either there for each other or not surely?</seg>
<seg id="65">Anyway, that really isn't where I am confused.</seg>
<seg id="66">I know what horror it means and I know why we have to stick to it.</seg>
<seg id="67">But for example, how does this work thing manifest itself.</seg>
<seg id="68">Do we limit contact until we absolutely have too...like leaving our execs to sort run of the mill joint stuff?</seg>
<seg id="69">I don't want to get this wrong.</seg>
<seg id="70">I hope that I've managed to put your mind at rest about Les..and that you two now have a better relationship.</seg>
<seg id="71">On KRM, well he's not bollocking you must not brood on lack of calls.</seg>
<seg id="72">Obviously I can't discuss my worries, concerns, problems at work with you anymore..and visa versa..but I'll assume unless I hear different that we keep our professional relationship to the minimum..and avoid if possible without it being in any way awkward.</seg>
<seg id="73">If it is necessary or more importantly right that we two editors should deal with it, then we will.</seg>
<seg id="74">If either of us feels that we are not striking this balance then we must say..??</seg>

<seg id="1">Fancy a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?</seg>
<seg id="2">A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.</seg>
<seg id="4">He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">So each scoop costs me around £140.</seg>
<seg id="13">It tastes pretty good though.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists</seg>

<seg id="1">Amnesty questions Qld G20 evictions</seg>
<seg id="2">PLANS to evict people from their homes if they fail federal criminal background checks during the G20 summit next year have been questioned by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="3">The human rights charity says the G20 (Safety and Security) Act, passed by the Queensland government on Tuesday, goes too far.</seg>
<seg id="4">The law allows police to evict people living inside security zones in Brisbane and Cairns during the November 2014 summit if they fail criminal record checks.</seg>
<seg id="5">They and their dependents, including children, will be barred from entering the secure areas and paid $200 towards accommodation elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Amnesty's legal spokeswoman Katie Wood told AAP that while it understood the need for security it was concerned there seemed to be no way to challenge a failure to pass the background checks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"On its face, this enhanced power to forcibly evict people - even though alternative accommodation would be provided - seems to be a case of overreach," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The consequences for this person may be significant - an unchallenged, possibly groundless eviction would inevitably lead those in the neighbourhood around the person to think less of that person or worse, believe that the person had some kind of criminal connection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Queensland Police Minister Jack Dempsey this week said background checks would be based on local and international intelligence and would only affect a handful of people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We are expecting 99 per cent of people will be able to go freely once they have had their crim history checked," he told reporters on Wednesday."</seg>

<seg id="1">Review: Lexus IS300h is on the next level</seg>
<seg id="2">FOR SOME, the transformation of the gas-guzzling, planet-choking motor car of the 20th century to the supposedly virtuous, fume-free vehicle of the 21st century is progressing at an unacceptably slow pace.</seg>
<seg id="3">While the likes of the Nissan Leaf and Renault Zoe demonstrate admirable but marginalised commitment to the search for cleaner motoring (forgetting for a moment that, in the UK at least, much of our electricity is generated by coal), car manufacturers seem understandably reluctant to jump in with both feet.</seg>
<seg id="4">This might be frustrating for advocates of electric motoring, but as the inventors of New Coke will tell you, consumers can be skittish creatures, who freak out and disappear like startled antelopes at the slightest whiff of change.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is where cars like the Lexus IS300h come in.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's a thrusting, virile-looking executive cruiser with a hybrid petrol-electric engine.</seg>
<seg id="7">While it looks like a traditional powerful motorway-guzzler, with the electric motor taking some of the strain, the official average fuel consumption is a decidedly wholesome 60.1mpg.</seg>
<seg id="8">The swooping, angled bonnet, which leads down to that pinched, aggressive snout gives the Lexus IS300h a snarling, purposeful appearance, but it has a gentle heart.</seg>
<seg id="9">The version we drove, the Premier, comes bristling with an armoury of luxury touches and gadgets such as heated and ventilated seats, reversing camera and a simply wonderful 15-speaker Mark Levinson surround sound system.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are also highly addictive electrostatic, touch-sensitive metal temperature sliders, reminiscent of those touch-sensitive Sony television buttons from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="11">They're a joy to use but, like dad's old Sony, I wonder if they will start to behave a little erratically after five years of continuous use.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of more concern is the fiddly little joystick which controls the media and GPS systems.</seg>
<seg id="13">One can only imagine this was the idea of a particularly scary, high-up manager at Lexus and nobody on the development team was brave enough to pipe up and point out that, while driving, successfully reaching the OK button on this infernal control system is like trying to thread a needle while on a rollercoaster.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's a shame, and it's bewildering, because in every other department, the IS300h is all about ease, practicality, safety and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="15">There's plenty of room behind the electronically-adjustable steering wheel for the driver, and generous space in the back (apart from the short-straw holder who gets to sit in the middle, where the raised portion of floor gets in the way a bit), while at 480 litres, the boot is more than big enough for most.</seg>
<seg id="16">The drive is smooth and refined, as a cruiser should be, offering a bit of poke when needed.</seg>
<seg id="17">I enjoyed throwing it about at low speed, and for a car with such virtuous fuel consumption figures, it seems surprisingly agile, managing the 0-62mph sprint in 8.3 seconds on its way to a top speed of 125mph, although at the motorway cruising speed which the IS300h is made for, there will be a bit of a hum from the engine.</seg>
<seg id="18">You will get used to it though.</seg>
<seg id="19">At £38,495 on the road, it's cheaper than some of its rivals, but the running costs beat them into a cocked hat thanks to its hybrid make-up.</seg>
<seg id="20">The luxury Premier incarnation boasts CO2 emissions of just 109g/km, but other models in the range put out just 99g/km.</seg>
<seg id="21">The IS300h is impressive, imperious and imposing.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's also practical, frugal and well-meaning.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's a baby step towards less oil-dependent motoring, but it's another step nonetheless.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brazil's Eike Batista: From billionaire to bankruptcy</seg>
<seg id="2">SAO PAULO, Brazil - A little over a year ago, Brazilian playboy Eike Batista was reputed to be the seventh-richest man in the world and was in the habit of boasting loudly that he'd soon be No.</seg>
<seg id="3">By this week, he had become one of the world's biggest paupers.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Wednesday, his flagship oil company, OGX, filed for bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="5">A personal fortune once valued at $30 billion had collapsed into a personal debt estimated at more than $800 million.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some Brazilians, long since soured on his cocky persona, responded with glee on social networks to the news that Batista's yacht, the Pink Fleet, would soon be sold for scrap.</seg>
<seg id="7">No one wanted, or could afford, the $19-million boat intact.</seg>
<seg id="8">Batista's spectacular fall may say more about his personal failings, and what Alan Greenspan called the "irrational exuberance" of the market, than it does about Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="9">It turned out that his much-hyped empire was built on vastly overconfident assumptions - in particular, oil deposit estimates that bore no relationship to reality.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He ended up swallowed by his own myth," columnist William Waack wrote for Brazil's Globo media group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Still, as Brazil's economy sinks back to reality after boom-time highs, his implosion has served as a warning to investors, and to Brazilians at large, that much of the fabulous wealth that was on the horizon so recently was based on little more than promises.</seg>
<seg id="12">Batista "is vain."</seg>
<seg id="13">"And at a certain point his vanity prevailed over common sense," said Adriano Pires, director of the Brazilian Infrastructure Center, an energy consulting firm in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="14">The case of Batista is not just bad for him and the companies around him, it is very bad for all of Brazil, especially in a moment when we need international investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is blemishing Brazil's credibility a little all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Batista grew up the son of Brazil's wealthy former minister of mines and energy.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a country famous for corruption and nepotism, it seemed a bit more than coincidental when the younger Batista literally struck gold in the mining industry in the 1980s, despite the assertion in his autobiography, characteristically titled "The X Factor: The Path of Brazil's Greatest Entrepreneur," that his fortune was the result of hard work and ingenuity.</seg>
<seg id="18">He acquired government licenses to exploit some of Brazil's newly discovered offshore oil reserves, and created an interconnected set of energy, mining and logistics companies based around the wells.</seg>
<seg id="19">He cashed in big from international investors, selling stock at a moment when the world believed more than ever in a Brazilian boom and, after the shock of the U.S.-based financial crisis, was looking for a new place to invest.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was a heady time for Batista and for Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy was in rapid expansion, the government was extremely popular, and a rising middle class was euphoric with higher wages.</seg>
<seg id="22">Certifying the country's ascendance, Brazil was awarded the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="23">Amid assurances of big gains - each of his companies had the letter X in its title, signifying multiple returns - his personal fortune soared, even as the companies brought in little revenue.</seg>
<seg id="24">After he tapped equities markets for all they were worth, he turned to debt markets, borrowing even more to pump up his companies.</seg>
<seg id="25">"He built his empire based on what have now been proven to be very unrealistic expectations," said Tony Volpon, a New York-based economist for international bank Nomura Securities.</seg>
<seg id="26">He made the cardinal sin of using debt to finance what were very risky exploratory activities in oil, and no one does that.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He didn't understand that oil and gas projects are high-risk ventures," said Pires, of the energy consulting firm.</seg>
<seg id="28">In this business there is no certainty, just probability.</seg>
<seg id="29">He went around preaching and promising.</seg>
<seg id="30">Batista branched out into luxury hotels, rock festivals, restaurants, soccer and ultimate fighting, all without much economic logic behind them, Pires added.</seg>
<seg id="31">Things began to fall apart last year in dramatic fashion.</seg>
<seg id="32">His bodybuilder son, Thor, struck and killed a cyclist while speeding in a million-dollar Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren that the Batistas had been in the habit of keeping on display in their living room.</seg>
<seg id="33">The public was shocked by Eike Batista's response, as he took to Twitter to blame the "carelessness" of the cyclist, an impoverished cargo worker who had to commute by bike on a dangerous highway.</seg>
<seg id="34">Soon after, it became clear that some OGX wells wouldn't hit production targets, and the money began to fall away.</seg>
<seg id="35">Batista again took to Twitter, this time to attack those who didn't believe in him.</seg>
<seg id="36">After deposits he valued at more than a trillion dollars turned out to be woefully small this year, his company lost more than 96% of its value and has been unable to pay back creditors.</seg>
<seg id="37">Brazil's state-run banks, which had supported Batista's companies, backed away.</seg>
<seg id="38">Though analysts put the lion's share of the blame on Batista, he sold his projects to investors who were willing to believe him.</seg>
<seg id="39">Brazil seemed to be experiencing a once-in-a-generation moment when its deep social and infrastructure problems were forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="40">Stock investments were soaring across the board as the value of Brazil's currency was pushed up to what economists warned were unsustainably high levels.</seg>
<seg id="41">After growing more than 7% in 2010, Brazil's economy nearly ground to a halt in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="42">Then the social questions again came to the fore in what is one of the world's most unequal countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">Though inequality dropped dramatically and most Brazilians are better off than ever - the economy is expected to rebound modestly this year, wages continue to rise, and unemployment is still low - the ruling Workers' Party, during its decade in power, has not invested in much-needed transportation, healthcare or education to adequately satisfy the demands of a new and dynamic middle class.</seg>
<seg id="44">After a police crackdown on a protest against a bus fare hike, protesters with wide public support filled the streets in June, demanding better public services, and demonstrators still take aim at symbols of capitalist excess.</seg>
<seg id="45">Among the targets of their rage have been the windows of Batista's office building.</seg>
<seg id="46">Batista's fall seems, at least to some, to be a reflection of Brazil's torn social fabric.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I never liked Eike, since I don't believe it's possible to get so rich like that, especially in Brazil today, without infringing on the rights of the poorest," said Erica Alves, a 26-year-old teacher from Rio de Janeiro who is active in left-wing organizations.</seg>
<seg id="48">He became rich 'winning' rights from the government to exploit the country's resources.</seg>
<seg id="49">I wasn't surprised by his fall, because fast and easy wealth can't be sustained.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Brazil's new, more austere and more politically conscious moment, Eike Batista has had little to say.</seg>
<seg id="51">His once-active Twitter account has been dormant for 126 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip</seg>
<seg id="2">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive special adviser," Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say," Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.</seg>
<seg id="9">What about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">Does he know about phone hacking?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says he doesn't, we say "Oh yes, he did".</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projects."</seg>
<seg id="15">During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fahrenheit 45-Fun - NYTimes.com</seg>
<seg id="2">I help run a college TV network that recently held a promotional event where we destroyed a large number of VHS tapes to celebrate an upgrade.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tapes were all either ours (and already digitized) or donated explicitly for the purpose of destroying them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some people were upset, even publicly comparing it to a book burning.</seg>
<seg id="5">Does it make sense to see a book burning as wrong but a tape smashing as acceptable?</seg>
<seg id="6">Is there a moral component to destroying one's own property?</seg>
<seg id="7">The people who compared your promotional event to a book burning were being either sarcastic or incredibly stupid.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is no relationship between these two activities, outside of how they might appear to a space alien.</seg>
<seg id="9">When people burn books in public, they are symbolically destroying the books" content.</seg>
<seg id="10">Book burning is not problematic because it results in the destruction of paper - it's problematic for advancing the argument that certain ideas should not be allowed to exist.</seg>
<seg id="11">You were not taking a political stand against the use of VHS tape; you were just (playfully) annihilating something that no longer had practical utility.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some might argue that this kind of promotional event is offensive for thoughtlessly satirizing the dark history of book burning, but - here again - such an argument requires a lot of irony or a lot of idiocy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your second question is a little more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="14">Owning something usually gives you the right to destroy it.</seg>
<seg id="15">No one can stop you from doing so.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the time, this is no great loss (because most objects are replaceable).</seg>
<seg id="17">But if something is extremely rare and has value to the rest of society, it's immoral to destroy it without justification.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, if you came into possession of one of the four original versions of Edvard Munch's "Scream" and decided to burn it for the perverse pleasure of obliterating something precious, you would be acting unethically (and, I suppose, pretty punk rock).</seg>
<seg id="19">You would be destroying something that technically belongs to you alone, but symbolically belongs to the culture at large.</seg>
<seg id="20">The literal destruction of the object itself would create a deeper kind of loss.</seg>
<seg id="21">Obviously, that argument can't be applied to the VHS tapes you smashed, unless one of those tapes contained footage that was aesthetically or socially meaningful, unique to that specific tape and (for whatever reason) impossible to convert into another medium.</seg>
<seg id="22">But I don't think that's what happened.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think you just destroyed a bunch of crap you were never going to use again.</seg>
<seg id="24">I have done a lot of things to the outside of my home to make a burglar look elsewhere for a likely target.</seg>
<seg id="25">I just realized that this means I'm hoping my efforts will make him choose another house in the neighborhood instead of mine.</seg>
<seg id="26">I'm beginning to wonder if this is ethical.</seg>
<seg id="27">If what you've done includes a note that opens, "Dear anonymous criminal: Here is the pass code for my neighbor's home-security system and a schematic blueprint of his residence," then, yes, that's unethical.</seg>
<seg id="28">If you've merely made your home look more forbidding than it actually is (by adding a "Beware of Dog" sign or a motion-sensitive light or a series of N.R.A. placards), you've done nothing untoward to anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="29">You seem to be working from the supposition that there's a 100 percent chance someone on your block is going to be burglarized, and that your protective measures will automatically (and unjustly) shift the crime elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="30">But even if that were true, what would be the moral alternative?</seg>
<seg id="31">Convincing everyone on your street to unilaterally lock and unlock their doors at the exact same time?</seg>
<seg id="32">It's not unfair to be extra cautious.</seg>

<seg id="2">General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury," according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.</seg>
<seg id="7">GM's truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="8">GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October.</seg>
<seg id="9">NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1">BHP likely to refocus its oil business</seg>
<seg id="2">Petroleum is the least understood of BHP Billiton's four businesses or "pillars."</seg>
<seg id="3">So when its chief executive Andrew Mackenzie presents a review of the division in Houston next month, there will be understandable interest from shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="4">Over the past two years, the performance of the BHP's petroleum division has deteriorated, with marked declines in returns and cash flow.</seg>
<seg id="5">In part this reflects heavy investment in US shale, where BHP has spent $20bn acquiring assets, but also disappointing production volumes from conventional fields.</seg>
<seg id="6">IN The Commodities note</seg>
<seg id="7">To address this weak performance analysts expect Mr Mackenzie and new petroleum boss Tim Cutt to refocus the business and offload non core assets.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, Mr Mackenzie has already dropped some hints, suggesting during a recent meeting with analysts that BHP is seeking a simpler oil and gas portfolio.</seg>
<seg id="9">BHP has also put up for sale half of its oil and gas acreage in the US Permian basin.</seg>
<seg id="10">BHP has a tail of petroleum assets and joint ventures which sit awkwardly with the company's philosophy of investing in projects that are "large, long life, low-cost, expandable" (and preferably located in OCED countries).</seg>
<seg id="11">These include the Liverpool Bay operation in the UK, the Pyrenees oilfields in Australia as well as assets in Algeria, Trinidad and Tobago and Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="12">A sale of these assets could generate $6bn-$7.7bn according to analysts at Morgan Stanley and the proceeds could be used to either pay down debt, reinvest in existing business or returned to shareholders - or a combination.</seg>
<seg id="13">Arguably it will be decisions like this, as much as cost-cutting or productivity initiatives that will determine the winner and losers in the mining sector in the future.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many investors have lost track of the fact that mega miners will generate significant amount of cash over the next five years as non core assets are sold, spending on new projects and expansions declines while production increases and new supply comes on line.</seg>
<seg id="15">Macquarie estimates BHP and Rio Tinto will generate almost $80bn of cash flow between now and the end of the decade (assuming commodity prices don't collapse).</seg>
<seg id="16">"Aside from uncontrollable macro swings, we believe it will be capital management, rather than ongoing cost cutting or productivity initiatives which will be the single biggest driver of shareholders returns going forward," says the bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">However this potential won't be reflected in share prices until investors are sure mining companies won't blow the lot on big, bold projects and acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Shareholders want to see it invested wisely or returned to them via share buybacks or increased dividends.</seg>
<seg id="19">And they are yet to be convinced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Which brings us back to BHP.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are already gripes from analysts that BHP is investing too much money in US shale and a Canadian potash project.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Even for a company the size of BHP Billiton, putting nearly half of capex in assets [during 2014-15] where return expectations are poor, is too much in our view," says Morgan Stanley.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Mackenzie is well qualified to oversee changes to the way the petroleum division is run given his oil and gas background - he worked at BP for 22 years before the joining the mining industry.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Cutt, also a former oil man from ExxonMobil, has already separated BHP's capital intensive US shale operations, which he sees as the division's growth engine, from its conventional oil and gas interests.</seg>
<seg id="25">This he says will ensure BHP is focused on both businesses.</seg>
<seg id="26">Just how focused, investors will find out in December.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tunnel for Smuggling Found Under Border</seg>
<seg id="2">Immigration and Customs Enforcement, via Agence France-Presse - Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="3">A tunnel under the United States-Mexico border equipped with electricity, ventilation and an electronic rail system was shut down by federal authorities in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marijuana and cocaine were confiscated, and three people were taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="5">SAN DIEGO - A deep tunnel snaking nearly 600 yards from Mexico under the border and into a San Diego warehouse is one of the most sophisticated underground drug smuggling passageways ever discovered, complete with electricity, ventilation and an electronic rail system, federal authorities said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="7">Mexican security officials stood guard Thursday outside a factory in Tijuana where the tunnel's starting point was discovered.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tunnel, which was shut down Wednesday night after several weeks of surveillance, took about a year to build, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Three people were taken into custody, and federal agents seized eight tons of marijuana and 325 pounds of cocaine they said was connected to the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">As security at the border - both at the ports of entry and between them - has heightened in recent years, drug cartels have increasingly sought other avenues, including tunnels, maritime smuggling and ultralight aircraft, to move drugs into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="11">This was the fifth large-scale drug smuggling tunnel discovered in the San Diego area since 2010, the authorities said, and the eighth since 2006, when the Sinaloa drug cartel took firm control of the smuggling corridor along this section of the border.</seg>
<seg id="12">"These cartels have spent years and tens of millions of dollars trying to create a secret underworld of passages so they can move large quantities of drugs," said Laura Duffy, the United States attorney for the San Diego region.</seg>
<seg id="13">Derek Benner, special agent in charge for Homeland Security Department investigations in San Diego, said sophisticated tunnels like the one found here - which required not only laborers to build but also architects and engineers, and could cost upwards of $1 million to construct - were an investment only a well-financed cartel could afford to make.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said the tunnel - like the two most recent "supertunnels" in the region, which were discovered in late 2011 - was shut down before any narcotics reached the market in the United States, which he called a major blow to the cartel.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This serves as yet another warning to these organizations that mistakenly believe that tunnels will be their ticket to success," Mr. Benner said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was the first time cocaine had been seized in connection with a tunnel operation, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They're desperate," said William R. Sherman, special agent in charge for the Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="18">We're starting to see them try to move cocaine through these tunnels, which we've never seen before.</seg>
<seg id="19">We're seeing them try to move cocaine through ultra-lights into the desert, which we've never seen before.</seg>
<seg id="20">And those are simply acts of desperation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tunnels have also been found around the Nogales area in Arizona, where cartels make use of underground drainage canals.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the San Diego-Tijuana corridor has remained popular for tunnel construction because the clay-like soil is easy to dig and less susceptible to cave-ins, Mr. Benner said.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, the warehouse districts on both sides of the border offer cover for the drug smuggling operations.</seg>
<seg id="24">The tunnel discovered on Wednesday was about four feet high and three feet wide, the authorities said, and zigzagged on its way across the border at about 35 feet underground, likely because the builders veered off course several times during construction.</seg>
<seg id="25">The authorities insisted that no drug smuggling tunnels in the San Diego area were currently in operation.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have the border underground fairly well monitored," Mr. Sherman said.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you're building a tunnel, we know about it.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is the third once since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="29">We've found them all before they could successfully get any drugs into the United States.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony corporation, having completed the previous quarter with a net loss in the amount of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, has curtailed the forecast regarding profit for the current financial year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sony's results for the period from July through September of 2013 turned out to be more dismal than expected, which is attributable to the drop in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sony's television business, which in the 2nd quarter brought the company its first operating profit in three years in the amount of 5.2 billion yen, in the accounting period has again dropped to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Japanese market of consumer electronics is experiencing hard times, especially due to the reduced demand for televisions.</seg>
<seg id="6">And while competitors are striving to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.</seg>
<seg id="7">For example, one of Sony's main competitors, Panasonic corporation, is recently shifting its focus to industrial components: here company sales are growing at high rates, especially owing to automobile systems and environmentally friendly technologies.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March of 2014, Sony anticipates receiving 179 billion yen of operating profit versus the previously expected 230 billion yen.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, based on data from the agency Thomson Reuters, analysts have proposed that the given indicator will be significantly higher and will amount to 221 billion yen.</seg>
<seg id="10">In an effort to recover from the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the middle of this month was announced the beginning of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation that have been equipped with a number of popular functions that help eliminate the need to retrieve a smartphone from your pocket 100 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="12">After Sony curtailed the annual forecast of profit and earnings, company shares in the morning at the start of trading in Tokyo dropped in price by more than 11%, descending to the level of 1,668 yen per share.</seg>

<seg id="1">CDC issues children's allergy guidelines for schools</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.</seg>
<seg id="4">One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="6">The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.</seg>
<seg id="8">State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.</seg>
<seg id="9">The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kids may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels like there is hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."</seg>

<seg id="1">Serious Danger of Blood Clots Halts Sale of Leukemia Drug</seg>
<seg id="2">Sales of a promising leukemia drug, Iclusig, are being suspended because of "the risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels," the Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The drug, also known as ponatinib, has been linked to severe and sometimes fatal heart attacks and strokes, blindness and loss of blood flow in the extremities serious enough to require amputation.</seg>
<seg id="4">In some cases, the problems or deaths occurred as soon as two weeks after patients began taking the drug, the agency said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It also said some of the people affected had no risk factors for heart disease, and some were in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="6">Iclusig was approved less than a year ago to treat chronic myeloid leukemia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The risk of blood clots was known, and the label carried a warning.</seg>
<seg id="8">But over time, the problems turned out to be much worse than they appeared in the studies performed before the drug was approved.</seg>
<seg id="9">In those studies, 8 percent of people taking the drug had serious blood clots in their arteries, and 3 percent had blood clots in veins.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, the F.D.A. reports, 24 percent of patients studied a median of 1.3 years and 48 percent studied a median of 2.7 years had "serious adverse vascular events."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Those are pretty significant numbers," Stephanie Yao, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said.</seg>
<seg id="12">We can't let a drug continue to be marketed with that profile.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms. Yao said the drug was not being permanently withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said the F.D.A. would work with the company to try to identify certain types of patients who might still benefit from the drug.</seg>
<seg id="15">Chronic myeloid leukemia can be fatal, and Iclusig may be able to keep some people alive when nothing else works.</seg>
<seg id="16">For now, patients who wish to keep taking the drug can do so, Ms. Yao said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are about 5,000 new cases of chronic myeloid leukemia in the United States each year, and 600 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="18">Iclusig, made by Ariad, in Cambridge, Mass., costs more than $100,000 a year, and patients were expected to need it for life.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was part of a revolution that transformed the disease from a death sentence to a chronic disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">The revolution began with another drug, Gleevec, which was intended to fight a specific genetic defect.</seg>
<seg id="21">Iclusig was meant for patients with a mutation that made their cancer resistant to Gleevec and related drugs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Policeman may have contributed to pensioner's death, inquest hears</seg>
<seg id="2">Cardiology consultant Professor George Hart said: "Severe stress can be linked to an increased risk of a heart attack and as Mr Harris was already in a precarious medical state the interview could be sufficient to be associated with his heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="3">But I must stress that this cannot be separated from his pre-existing poor medical condition and other factors and, in my view, it is more likely that he would have died in hospital anyway.</seg>
<seg id="4">PC Reese claimed he got permission to question Mr Harris from a nurse at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, but could not remember their name.</seg>
<seg id="5">He claimed he carried out the interview due to concerns Mr Harris might get behind the wheel again, despite his injuries.</seg>
<seg id="6">But deputy Gloucestershire coroner David Dooley challenged him: "You had concerns that he might shortly be released and drive again.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what is the reality of a man with serious injuries including a broken arm and with a car which is written off driving again?</seg>
<seg id="8">PC Reese denied that he threatened Mr Harris, a retired police mechanic, with prosecution but admitted he told him his sister was "very poorly."</seg>
<seg id="9">Robin Vick, a retired policeman who represented Mr Harris' family at the inquest, asked him: "Did it not occur to you that Mr Harris was not in a fit state to be interviewed - he was wearing an oxygen mask and his arm was in traction?"</seg>
<seg id="10">PC replied that had interviewed "numerous" people in oxygen masks before.</seg>
<seg id="11">The inquest heard how Mr Harris' twin sister Shirley was in the passenger seat of his Skoda Fabia when he crashed into a tree in June 19 last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The inseparable siblings, who had lived together in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, for 56 years, both suffered multiple injuries, but Mrs Harris eventually recovered.</seg>
<seg id="13">A post-mortem examination found that Mr Harris died from a heart attack and crash injuries.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, coroner Mr Dooley said: "I don't think conducting an interview under caution was appropriate and there is no record of permission being sought for the interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless the stress of the interview is the same as the other contributing factors in this case, such as Mr Harris' injuries and his serious heart condition, and cannot be blamed for his death.</seg>
<seg id="16">Gloucestershire Constabulary said it was common to interview people in hospital following a serious crash and this case had been authorised by PC Reese's supervisor and a nurse and was very brief.</seg>
<seg id="17">A spokesman said after an investigation PC Reese was given advice on note-taking but no further action was taken.</seg>

<seg id="1">Queen prays in N Ireland</seg>
<seg id="2">THE Queen has prayed with Catholic and Protestant leaders from across Northern Ireland as this long-divided land demonstrated its rising faith in a shared future - and braced for a peacemaking milestone that has been a quarter-century in the making.</seg>
<seg id="3">The British monarch visited the lakeside town of Enniskillen, scene of one of the Irish Republican Army's most shocking atrocities, for events symbolising how far Northern Ireland has come from its darkest days of bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tomorrow she's expected to meet and shake hands with Martin McGuinness, former commander of the dominant Provisional IRA faction, in what many see as the symbolic conclusion to a four-decade conflict.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their first-ever contact, long avoided by Mr McGuinness' Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, follows the Provisional IRA's killing of some 1775 people since 1970, including the Queen's own cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten - a 1979 assassination that IRA experts said Mr McGuinness himself sanctioned.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr McGuinness today is the senior Catholic in Northern Ireland's unity government, an institution forged following the Provisionals' 2005 decision to renounce violence and disarm.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fears that a future IRA might rise out of alienated Catholic districts were nowhere to be heard overnight in Enniskillen as the Queen arrived in a 10-car motorcade for an ecumenical church service in honour of her 60th anniversary on the throne.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sinn Fein members stayed away from the event.</seg>
<seg id="9">She and Prince Philip received a standing ovation as she visited the town's Catholic cathedral, her first visit to a Catholic church in her 20 visits to Northern Ireland as Queen.</seg>
<seg id="10">And in the neighbouring Protestant cathedral, a veritable who's who of Northern Ireland religious life and politics gathered to pray for continued peace.</seg>
<seg id="11">Church leaders praised the contribution of the Queen, who last year made her first tour of the Republic of Ireland to broad public support.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sinn Fein was heavily criticised for boycotting her visit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Archbishop Alan Harper, leader of the Anglican-affiliated Church of Ireland, said in his sermon that the Queen's tour of the Irish Republic "was an occasion of profound significance and deep emotion" that signalled an era of genuine peace "perhaps for the first time ever in the recorded history of this island."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Queen greeted some of the thousands of locals who had spent hours standing on the packed, narrow footpaths of Enniskillen's Church Street.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a private meeting at a Protestant clergyman's home, she met survivors of the Provisional IRA's bomb attack on the town 25 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wayne Bennett declares he will remain coach of the Newcastle Knights amid speculation linking him with the Cowboys</seg>
<seg id="2">Beaten Newcastle coach Wayne Bennett is refusing to put an end to rumours that he'll leave the club to join North Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="3">EXCLUSIVE: Newcastle's heartbreaking finals weekend has ended on a high with supercoach Wayne Bennett confirming he will stay at the club.</seg>
<seg id="4">Just 24 hours after his team and club legend Danny Buderus were knocked out of the finals, Bennett told The Daily Telegraph on Sunday night he was not going anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">And the seven-time premiership winning coach declared his commitment to the Knights, with or without struggling owner Nathan Tinkler.</seg>
<seg id="6">"You people in the media started all this speculation," Bennett said.</seg>
<seg id="7">I haven't said anything because I don't comment on rumours in newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wayne Bennett watches on at Knights training.</seg>
<seg id="9">I've never said I was going anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="10">We've finished the season good but the job's not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm staying.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tinkler's well-publicised financial problems led to speculation the Knights could no longer afford Bennett's annual salary of more than $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="13">He told reporters last week: "I can't give you an iron-clad guarantee of anything in this game."</seg>
<seg id="14">What I can say is right now I am the coach here.</seg>
<seg id="15">If that changes at any stage, then I will let you know.</seg>
<seg id="16">The NRL 360 boys discuss Wayne Bennett's future after the Newcastle coach wouldn't guarantee he'll stay at the Knights.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bennett on Sunday night insisted Tinkler's financial position would have no bearing on his future at the club.</seg>
<seg id="18">"That's never been an issue with me," he said, "I've always been paid on time."</seg>
<seg id="19">Even at his press conference after Saturday night's loss to the Roosters, Bennett would not discuss his immediate future.</seg>
<seg id="20">The 63-year-old is two years into a four-year contract with the Knights.</seg>
<seg id="21">Overall the deal is worth up to $5 million with bonuses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Newcastle coach Wayne Bennett won't guarantee that he'll see out his four-year contract at the Knights.</seg>
<seg id="23">The former Broncos and St George Illawarra coach had been linked to the North Queensland Cowboys in recent weeks because of their delay in naming a replacement for dumped coach Neil Henry.</seg>
<seg id="24">Speculation increased over the weekend when Cowboys chief executive Peter Jourdain said the appointment would not be made until after the Grand Final because the new coach might be involved.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bennett's public commitment to the Knights is a massive boost for the club, not that the Knights were overly concerned he would be leaving.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It's all pure, utter rubbish and absolute bulls..." said Hunter Sports Group boss Troy Palmer in The Sunday Telegraph.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bennett remains confident he can deliver a premiership in Newcastle and become the first coach to win titles at three different clubs.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We're building towards where we want to be," he said.</seg>

<seg id="5">BILLIONAIRE aspiring prime minister Clive Palmer will launch a television advertising blitz next week, insisting he wants to keep his campaign positive and steer clear from negative personal attack ads.</seg>
<seg id="6">Professor Palmer has released a series of clips promoting his United Australia Party which he says will run on commercial television networks from Monday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mining magnate declined to detail the budget for the campaign or how long the ads would continue for but insisted he would campaign until September 14 and do "whatever it takes for people to have an alternative."</seg>
<seg id="8">While he criticises the major parties' involvement with lobbyists, the short ads mainly feature Professor Palmer looking relaxed, calling for support, talking about how he will unite Australians, promoting his website and talking about his desire to cut taxes.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although they are light on policy detail, Mr Palmer said he wanted to get the basic themes of his party out there after its recent launch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Palmer said he did not know how much of his own money had been given to the party but that there were other contributes as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">"There is a party executive and a committee," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">I do contribute but it's not all my money.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he said he would not participate in the vicious attacks ads that the major parties relied on during campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I can't see us doing that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our basic philosophy is that politics should be about ideas, not attacking people.</seg>

<seg id="1">7 Ways to Keep Alcohol From Wrecking Your Diet</seg>
<seg id="2">Don't Let Booze Be Your Diet Downfall</seg>
<seg id="3">Over the years, many of my clients have confided that too many cocktails on the weekend, followed by alcohol-induced overeating, cancels out their work-week healthy eating efforts.</seg>
<seg id="4">And as a result, instead of seeing results, they remain "stuck" in a weight loss plateau.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sound familiar?</seg>
<seg id="6">This trend is supported by a new UK survey, which found that in a single evening out on the town, 40 percent of women consume about 1,000 calories in alcohol alone.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, more than half say that imbibing makes them hungrier, and four in five admit that drinking diminishes their willpower, causing them to indulge in foods like burgers, pizza, and chips.</seg>
<seg id="8">If alcohol is your diet downfall, try putting these seven tips into action.</seg>
<seg id="9">How to Keep Alcohol From Wrecking Your Diet</seg>
<seg id="10">Eat before you drink</seg>
<seg id="11">When your stomach is empty, alcohol is absorbed quickly, which means you'll feel the effects within minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">But eating something rich in lean protein and/or good fat, which are both digested and absorbed slowly, creates a buffer.</seg>
<seg id="13">So to curtail your tipsiness, nibble on something like a golf ball-sized portion of nuts, or fresh guacamole with veggies before you take your first sip.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hangover Remedies that Work</seg>
<seg id="15">Count your drinks correctly</seg>
<seg id="16">If you count one drink as one of what you're served, you may be greatly underestimating your intake.</seg>
<seg id="17">Technically, 12 oz of light beer (one bottle or can), 5 oz of red or white wine (a little smaller than a yogurt container), and 1 shot of liquor all pack about the same amount of alcohol, and each contains roughly 100 calories.</seg>
<seg id="18">But one study found that wine and liquor served at restaurants are about 40 percent larger than these standard drink portions.</seg>
<seg id="19">Another report, out last week, found that beer and wine contain higher alcohol levels these days, so when you order a drink out, you may be getting 50 percent more alcohol than you think.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, if you order a pint of beer (16 oz), you'll get four extra ounces than one standard drink, and then there are mixed drinks that contain more than one shot (like those illustrious Long Island Iced Teas!).</seg>
<seg id="21">The lesson: if you underestimate your intake, you may be far tipsier than you think.</seg>
<seg id="22">That means not only more alcohol calories than you counted on, but also a loosier goosier state of mind than may seriously affect your appetite.</seg>
<seg id="23">25 Ways to Cut 500 Calories a Day</seg>
<seg id="24">Slim down your drink order</seg>
<seg id="25">If you're a beer drinker, the type you order can have a big impact on your nutritional bottom line.</seg>
<seg id="26">A bottle or can of ultra low carb beer contains about 3-4 grams of carbs.</seg>
<seg id="27">But a regular version packs at least 10 grams, about as much as 10 mini pretzels.</seg>
<seg id="28">That means three a week adds up to an extra 1,560 grams of carb per year, the equivalent of nearly five loaves of bread.</seg>
<seg id="29">Drinks made with mixers are even bigger carb and calorie traps.</seg>
<seg id="30">Just four ounces (a half cup), of a sweetened mixer will cost you a whopping 25 grams of carb (about 14 gummy bears worth), and decadent drinks like a mudslide can contain over 500 calories, more than the amount a slice of chocolate cake.</seg>
<seg id="31">Slow your pace</seg>
<seg id="32">One of the biggest culprits in alcohol-driven overeating is getting too tipsy, too fast.</seg>
<seg id="33">To slow down the rise in your blood alcohol level, order a tall glass of water with every alcoholic drink.</seg>
<seg id="34">Alternate sips, and be sure to finish at least 12 ounces of H2O for every cocktail.</seg>
<seg id="35">This simple strategy may cut your total consumption in half.</seg>
<seg id="36">27 Mistakes Healthy People Make</seg>
<seg id="37">Prevent mindless munching</seg>
<seg id="38">If you're at a bar with free happy hour apps, or one that serves up goodies, like popcorn or nuts, turn your back on the free fare, or place them out of arm's reach.</seg>
<seg id="39">Research shows you'll mindlessly munch if food is right in front of you, without even realizing it, and even if you aren't hungry.</seg>
<seg id="40">But if it's out of sight, you're much less likely to seek it out.</seg>
<seg id="41">Pre-plan your post-drink meal</seg>
<seg id="42">Alcohol can indeed act as an appetite stimulant.</seg>
<seg id="43">And we all know it lowers inhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="44">So if you don't want to give in to eating things you wouldn't touch if you were sober, create a pre-drinking strategy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stash something in your bag, like an all natural energy bar, so you won't grab a greasy slice of pizza.</seg>
<seg id="46">Or scope out restaurants nearby where you're going out, so if your friends want to grab a bite, you can suggest a spot where you know you can order a healthier option.</seg>
<seg id="47">Finally, strategically place some light snacks within sight at home, like pre-popped organic popcorn on the countertop, or cut fruit and fresh veggies and hummus front and center in the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="48">If you get a case of the munchies before bed, you're much more likely to grab what's readily available, rather than digging for something like chips or cookies.</seg>
<seg id="49">Volunteer to be the designated driver</seg>
<seg id="50">The best way to prevent alcohol from derailing your diet is to avoid drinking altogether.</seg>
<seg id="51">One tactic is to save your group taxi or ride-sharing costs by offering to drive (stick with naturally calorie-free club sodas with lime all night).</seg>
<seg id="52">While it may not be as fun as indulging with your group, you're the one who'll wake up the next day without a food or alcohol hangover, and that feels pretty darn good.</seg>

<seg id="1">RBS suspends two forex traders</seg>
<seg id="2">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader.</seg>
<seg id="8">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.</seg>
<seg id="12">UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
<seg id="13">At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market.</seg>
<seg id="14">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Banks are scouring through years" worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="16">News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks" increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that "you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices."</seg>
<seg id="19">The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained," Credit Suisse said.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.</seg>
<seg id="2">The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together."</seg>
<seg id="4">Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."</seg>
<seg id="11">We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" back Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch</seg>
<seg id="2">At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there," Mrs Amirthalinga says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.</seg>
<seg id="12">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">People are saying "the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="21">Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs," says Ms Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2">LONDON (Reuters) - After a sticky start following his return to Chelsea, life suddenly looks pretty good for Jose Mourinho with his side breathing down the necks of Premier League leaders Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chelsea can go top for a few hours at least with victory at Newcastle United on Saturday, having reached the League Cup quarter-finals in midweek with a 2-0 victory at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="4">With 13 points from the last 15 available, striker Fernando Torres looking rejuvenated, options all across the pitch and an empty treatment room, Chelsea are clearly hitting their stride.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet, the form of his squad is causing Mourinho a few headaches, especially when it comes to deciding which players must be consigned to the substitutes' bench or the stands.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It's not easy for me to leave players at home and on the bench because everybody deserves to play," said Mourinho, who was given a reminder of Juan Mata's quality in midweek when the Spaniard, who has not always started this season, dazzled at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I'm unfair with the players I am not selecting because they are doing everything to play," Mourinho told a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a difficult feeling for me.</seg>
<seg id="9">All of my players have a collective soul at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="10">That's the most important thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mourinho has a full squad to choose from on Saturday for a fixture that has not always been kind to him.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have one of the most difficult matches of the whole season at St James' Park but we want to try and keep winning," Mourinho, whose only victory there was in the 2006 League Cup, told a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="13">October was magnificent for us but to be top or not to be top is a question in this moment of one point, two points and that is not very important.</seg>
<seg id="14">""Of course it's better to be first than be fifth, that's obvious but no problem for us.""</seg>
<seg id="15">Torres embodies the improvement in Chelsea and his performance against Manchester City last weekend, when he scored a late winner having set up the first goal, was arguably his best since joining in a 50 million pounds ($80.3 million) deal from Liverpool in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">""I feel he's just giving his best every game," Mourinho said."</seg>
<seg id="17">""When he's the man of the match against Manchester City or when he's not the man of the match, or when he's on the bench and he comes on, I just feel he gives his best, always, and that's the most important thing.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't like this history of one day the player is a disaster, the next day the player is phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't think Fernando is a kid to be influenced by these wins, so I want him to be stable, I want him not to be too much worried about proving himself, or not to prove, or scoring or not scoring.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian lawyer says Snowden to start website job</seg>
<seg id="2">By Steve Gutterman</seg>
<seg id="3">MOSCOW (Reuters) - Former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden has found a job working for a website in Russia, where he was granted asylum after fleeing the United States, a Russian lawyer helping him said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Edward starts work in November," lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said, according to state-run news agency RIA.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He will provide support for a large Russian site," he said, adding that he would not name the site "for security reasons."</seg>
<seg id="6">Snowden, 30, a former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed secret U.S. internet and phone surveillance programs, fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">President Vladimir Putin rejected U.S. pleas to send Snowden home to face charges including espionage, and the temporary asylum he was granted in early August can be extended annually.</seg>
<seg id="8">Snowden's location in Russia has not been disclosed and since July he has appeared only in a handful of photographs and video clips from a meeting this month with visiting former U.S. national security officials who support his cause.</seg>
<seg id="9">Putin, a former KGB spy, said repeatedly that Russia would only shelter Snowden if he stopped harming the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kucherena cited that condition as one reason Snowden would not answer questions from foreign investigators looking into allegations that the United States spied on leaders of allies.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Snowden lives in Russia under Russian laws, he cannot leave the country as he would lose his current status," the Interfax news agency quoted Kucherena as saying.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also, under agreements, he cannot reveal secret information while he is in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany's parliament plans to hold a special session on reports the United States tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone and left-wing parties have demanded a public inquiry calling in witnesses including Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite Putin's warning, Russian state media have treated Snowden as a whistleblower and the decision to grant him asylum seemed to underscore Putin's accusations that Washington preaches to the world about freedoms it does not uphold at home.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin has dismissed the widespread assumption that Russian intelligence officers grilled Snowden for information after he arrived, and Kucherena has portrayed him as trying to live as normal a life as possible under the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said earlier that he hoped Snowden would find a job because he was living on scant funds, mostly from donations.</seg>
<seg id="17">A tabloid news site on Thursday published what it said was a photo of Snowden on a Moscow river cruise this summer, and the same site earlier published a photo of a man who looked like Snowden pushing a shopping cart in a supermarket parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kucherna did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Michael Kirby: "Nothing is impossible to the human spirit."</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Randy Larcombe</seg>
<seg id="4">I never thought I would write this column, but I am because of Michael Kirby.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's about 10 years ago, and I am sitting in the third row of the second tier of the Sydney Football Stadium - the best place in the world to watch footy, and the stadium where I have watched so much of it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rugby league grand finals.</seg>

<seg id="11">Photo: Andrew Campbell</seg>
<seg id="12">This time, though, I am not watching sport.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am 26.</seg>
<seg id="14">I am confused.</seg>
<seg id="15">I am angry.</seg>
<seg id="16">Actually, I am pissed off.</seg>
<seg id="17">I'm not entirely sure who with.</seg>
<seg id="18">I am at war with the world and myself and terrifying everyone who knows me because they fear the unaccountable and loose behaviour from their colleague, their mate, their brother, their son for the past year or so is likely to kill someone, and that person is likely to be himself.</seg>
<seg id="19">On this night at the SFS, I am at the opening of the Gay Games and Michael Kirby, the Honourable Justice of the High Court of Australia, is about to deliver a speech that stays with me today.</seg>
<seg id="20">One line stands out.</seg>
<seg id="21">Little did my partner Johan and I think, 30 years ago, that we would be at the opening of a Gay Games with the Queen's representative and all of you to bear witness to such a social revolution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Never did we think we would be dancing together in a football stadium.</seg>
<seg id="23">And with the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="24">And that the Governor would be a woman.</seg>
<seg id="25">If an angel had tapped us on our youthful shoulders and told us of tonight we would have said 'impossible'.</seg>
<seg id="26">Well, nothing is impossible to the human spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">The words hit me like a bolt of lightning.</seg>
<seg id="28">A few days later, I write a letter to Justice Kirby to tell him how profound they had been; how they came at the precise moment when I needed to hear them, because the past year had been a living hell.</seg>
<seg id="29">That past year had started one Saturday morning, sitting on the couch, watching Rage on TV, considering two alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="30">One was to jump off the balcony; forever run away from the shame of the dark secret I had known since I was a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="31">That option had run through my mind for years.</seg>
<seg id="32">I had sat in my car, parked at The Gap, tears streaming down my face, thinking of my family, thinking how selfish it would be to end it.</seg>
<seg id="33">This seemed like the easy option.</seg>
<seg id="34">The alternative was tougher.</seg>
<seg id="35">So I stared at the white blank wall in front of me, and then I said the words that changed my life forever.</seg>
<seg id="36">Changed my life?</seg>
<seg id="37">It sounds utterly ridiculous to explain it like that now.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those words didn't change me.</seg>
<seg id="39">They saved me.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mate.</seg>
<seg id="41">You are f---ing gay.</seg>
<seg id="42">Then I laughed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Then I shook my head.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then I cried, for the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="45">A few months after sending the letter to Justice Kirby, one came back bearing a High Court letterhead.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I hope you will spare a little of your time to speak of your own journey, Andrew," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="47">If only everyone affected, including the families, did so, all this rubbish would evaporate and truth and science would take its place.</seg>
<seg id="48">I'm not writing this to be a martyr, nor am I looking for sympathy.</seg>
<seg id="49">Believe me, the easier option would be to not write anything at all.</seg>
<seg id="50">But if getting this down can help evaporate some of this rubbish we are continually fed about same-sex marriage, it can only be for the better.</seg>
<seg id="51">I wrote this column about 13 months ago, and it was put on ice on the advice of others, but when Newcastle Knights player Ryan Stig compares homosexuality to the work of Satan, as he did a week ago, it's time to roll.</seg>
<seg id="52">Stig wrote, in a post on Twitter: "Satan has worked so hard throughout culture and society to remove the belief in a Creator ... Same-sex marriage laws starting to be passed in this country are a good indicator of this ... One thing we are hearing more is that homosexuality can be genetically traced.</seg>
<seg id="53">Well, if that is the case, there's as much proof of alcoholism, yet there are no parades for alcoholic pride.</seg>
<seg id="54">I've never felt the need to walk in a parade, although I'm certain the devil is responsible for several hangovers.</seg>
<seg id="55">Did Satan force me to be gay?</seg>
<seg id="56">The Knights' limp response - "These comments are the personal opinion of Ryan Stig" - and the NRL's lack of one completely does not surprise.</seg>
<seg id="57">Would the game have been so silent if such discriminatory remarks were made about indigenous Australians?</seg>
<seg id="58">Or women?</seg>
<seg id="59">The reassuring part is that Stig does not represent rugby league.</seg>
<seg id="60">I could count on one hand the number of times I've heard smart-arse, derogatory remarks from a player.</seg>
<seg id="61">I've lost count of the times when past and present players, coaches and officials have put an arm around me in the last 13 or so years and told me they could not care less.</seg>
<seg id="62">Last year, the bill to legalise gay marriage was defeated in the House of Representatives 98 votes to 42.</seg>
<seg id="63">Gay rights activists have said since that it's just another step in the process, on the long march to equality.</seg>
<seg id="64">I'm sorry but that is not good enough.</seg>
<seg id="65">No march.</seg>
<seg id="66">No more debate.</seg>
<seg id="67">No more bulls--t.</seg>
<seg id="68">I've heard it too many times, from too many people, that gay marriage is not an important issue.</seg>
<seg id="69">Is that the society we truly covet?</seg>
<seg id="70">Where basic rights, the simplest form of equality, are considered an afterthought?</seg>
<seg id="71">We are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="72">This isn't a debate about religion or law.</seg>
<seg id="73">It is not about tax benefits and superannuation.</seg>
<seg id="74">This comes down to a simple premise about what's right and wrong.</seg>
<seg id="75">It comes down to whether you think I am good enough to be married to the person I love.</seg>
<seg id="76">It comes down to whether you think I deserve to have the same privileges in life, just like you.</seg>
<seg id="77">It comes down to the indisputable fact that sexuality is not a choice.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a lifestyle decision.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is who you are.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wallabies forward David Pocock doesn't know how much of a hero he really is.</seg>
<seg id="81">He and his partner Emma have vowed not to get married until same-sex marriage is recognised.</seg>
<seg id="82">That is admirable but it's the reason he proffers that makes the real difference.</seg>
<seg id="83">"The biggest thing in this debate is that we're dealing with people here," he has said.</seg>
<seg id="84">And how can you blame someone for what they are?</seg>
<seg id="85">People don't choose their sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="86">With one remark, Pocock summed up my entire life.</seg>
<seg id="87">He summed up the plight of every gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual person who deserve exactly the same slice of the world and respect as everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="88">Opponents of gay marriage should be mindful of how difficult the journey can be - for some, for many - as they work out who they are.</seg>
<seg id="89">And how many deny it, pushing it to the recesses of their mind, and if they can't figure it out they end their lives.</seg>
<seg id="90">That is not being dramatic, that is fact.</seg>
<seg id="91">Because I was that same bloke.</seg>
<seg id="92">I was just lucky enough to listen to Michael Kirby, who taught me that nothing is impossible to the human spirit.</seg>

<seg id="11">The PC council must vote for the structures of PSC in 43 regions of the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than a thousand hopefuls seek the 1800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria they could not organize competitions due to lack of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="13">The PC promises to organize additional recruitment for the vacant seats.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Moscow PC is one of a few committees with a competition, despite the fact that instead of 20 there will be 40 participants in the new structure.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Borschev, in the current structure of the capital's committee are 11 human rights activists and 9 security officials, and in the version that is up for vote in the PC, the ratio is changing to 17 to 23.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moreover, 30 human rights activists wanted to get on the capital's committee.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, representative of "Brothers in Arms" Vyacheslav Kalinin can once again enter the new structure.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was a member of the PSC for three years, but did not once visit prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Borschev believes that security agencies, by appointing their PSC representative, will be able to make the work of human rights activists unbearable, therefore human rights activists do not rule out a collective withdrawal from the committee.</seg>
<seg id="20">In their opinion, the advancement of security agencies is coordinated by PSC member Anton Tsvetkov who heads "Officers of Russia" - an organization advocating the interests of security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I don't eat babies for breakfast," declared Anton Tsvetkov to RBC daily.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denies that he lobbies for the advancement of any kind of lists and says that he does not intend to hinder human rights activists from visiting arrested opposition members.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list they are voting on now in the PC.</seg>
<seg id="24">He considers the information publicized by Borschev as a form of pressure.</seg>
<seg id="25">A possible success of human rights activists is the planned replacement of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk PSC.</seg>
<seg id="26">Its former leaders will be dismissed due to last year's Kopeisk riots.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Public Chamber they came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local committee ignored the problems of inmates.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, the Rostov-on-Don PSC could shift from human rights activists to security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="29">The human rights activist-chairman of the local committee "vanished" from the new lists, yet one of his opponents turned up despite the fact that in May of 2013 the federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.</seg>
<seg id="30">Borschev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov committees "revenge for Kopeisk".</seg>
<seg id="31">The denunciation of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not influence the Mordovia PSC, which they consider to be "security": only one human rights activist wanted to make it into the new structure, and they did not even accept her documents for the competition.</seg>
<seg id="32">PC council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC Daily that he voted against the proposed list because the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don troubles him.</seg>
<seg id="33">He circulated his opinion to other members of the council.</seg>
<seg id="34">His PC colleague Pavel Gusev says that he voted in favor because he likes the proposed Moscow list.</seg>
<seg id="35">Deputy secretary of the PC Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the Scientific Research Institute for the Federal Corrections Service, coordinated the compilation of the lists of the PSC.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grib told RBC Daily that he does not consider it right to divide candidates into human rights activists and security agencies and does not agree that chairmen of the committees have sufficient authorities to hinder the work of its members.</seg>
<seg id="37">Grib declines to forecast the voting results of the PC council.</seg>
<seg id="38">If the proposed list today will be rejected, in coming days an amended version will be brought up for a vote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Federico Fellini: 5 Reasons He Still Matters</seg>
<seg id="2">Mondadori via Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="3">Cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno next to the Fellini (seated), while shooting 'Amarcord,' Italy, 1973</seg>
<seg id="4">As filmmakers, Federico Fellini and Spike Lee are about as far apart as, well, Rome and Brooklyn, but when the maestro died 20 years ago this week (on October 31, 1993), even Lee acknowledged his vast influence.</seg>
<seg id="5">He eulogized the Italian director by recalling the lesson of the first Fellini film he ever saw, back in high school.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It really just for me emphasized . . . what you could do," Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are no boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are no limits.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two decades later, is Fellini's legacy in danger of being forgotten?</seg>
<seg id="10">A generation of moviegoers has grown up without wondering what brilliant, mad vision he'd unleash next.</seg>
<seg id="11">The European art cinema with which his name was once synonymous has long been eclipsed by Hollywood's aesthetic.</seg>
<seg id="12">And you no longer have to be a universally acclaimed auteur to get your name before the title, not when Tyler Perry and even the obscure-until-three-months-ago Lee Daniels can do it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Still, Fellini's influence remains so pervasive we barely even notice it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="14">We toss around the word "paparazzi" and forget that it originated as the name of a pushy celebrity photographer character in La Dolce Vita.</seg>
<seg id="15">High schools across America stage the musical Sweet Charity without knowing that it's based on Nights of Cabiria, a Fellini movie about a prostitute.</seg>
<seg id="16">And TV and movie audiences everywhere watch directors dip into hallucinatory dreams or warm childhood memories without recognizing that Fellini tapped those wells first.</seg>
<seg id="17">Here, then, are five arenas where Fellini set the standard, lifted the curtain, and opened the doors for us all to parade through.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Party</seg>
<seg id="19">For all his later surrealism, it's easy to forget that Fellini started out as a documentary-style realist, writing scripts for Roberto Rossellini.</seg>
<seg id="20">Open City, with its depiction of the privations of Roman street life as World War II ended, was the young screenwriter's first Oscar nomination and became a cornerstone of Neorealism, a raw and unpolished style for depicting the harsh day-to-day realities of life that flourished in Italian movies and resonates to this day, particularly in the cinema of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="21">But Fellini's early realism also included depictions of people having fun, falling in love, or simply growing up.</seg>
<seg id="22">He perfected the mix in his early feature I Vitelloni, a story about a group of aimless young men who are small-town pals, a movie that pretty much invented the group coming-of-age story as we know it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Movies from Diner to Swingers to even The Hangover owe I Vitelloni a debt.</seg>
<seg id="24">For these guys, life is a party, an endless set of dinners where jokes are traded and wine is sipped.</seg>
<seg id="25">Like all parties, it has to end sometime (the crashing comedown would be more the focus of La Dolce Vita), but for now, it means immaturity can be prolonged for one more night.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Circus</seg>
<seg id="27">Nobody worked the "life is a circus" metaphor harder than Fellini, a guy who made a whole movie about clowns (this at a time when he feared that the absurdity of modern life had outstripped the ability of clowns and comedians to satirize it).</seg>
<seg id="28">The carnival pervades nearly every film he directed, though with many shades of variation, from the ragtag performers of Variety Lights to the cruel social Darwinism of strongman and waif in La Strada to the total debauchery of Satyricon and Casanova.</seg>
<seg id="29">He was the ringmaster of a sideshow of freaks, seductresses, brutes, and troubadours, and you were free to indulge or skip each act along the way.</seg>
<seg id="30">Provided that you pay; everything comes with a price.</seg>
<seg id="31">Like the party, the circus has to pack up eventually, but while the big top is still standing, why not have a good time?</seg>
<seg id="32">It's that joyous rhythm of the circus musicians that rouses Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) from his existential moping during the celebrated climax of 8 ½, ultimately pulling the whole cast into a circle of dancers.</seg>
<seg id="33">The scene seems to be an answer to the one at the end of Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, but instead of a dance of death and resignation, Fellini's is unequivocally a celebration of life.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Dream</seg>
<seg id="35">Fellini had a pipeline to his own subconscious like few other filmmakers before or since.</seg>
<seg id="36">(Maybe Luis Bunuel, David Lynch, and Tim Burton come closest.</seg>
<seg id="37">And you know where Lynch's dancing dwarfs and lipsticked grotesques come from, right?).</seg>
<seg id="38">About a decade into his career, he started reading Carl Jung and abandoning realism for surrealism.</seg>
<seg id="39">Pretty soon, he was abandoning narrative structure altogether and just presenting vignettes.</seg>
<seg id="40">A whole movie could be a dream (like City of Women, below), and you wouldn't feel cheated or surprised.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you wanted, you could parse the imagery for literary symbolism, or to psychoanalyze the filmmaker - or you could just let it wash over you, like a real dream.</seg>
<seg id="42">New Yorker Films / Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="43">The Women</seg>
<seg id="44">For all the libertinism on display in his films, Fellini was often a moralist, hinting at his disapproval of the empty hedonism he saw in society and depicted in movies from La Dolce Vita (below) to Casanova.</seg>
<seg id="45">Which is another way of saying he had respect for women, however patronizing.</seg>
<seg id="46">He was married just once, for five decades (until his death), to Giulietta Masina, who was his muse and who starred in several of his movies, but it's clear from the films that even she remained elusive to him.</seg>
<seg id="47">Hulton Archive / Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="48">He found women mysterious - indeed, his alter ego, played in several movies by Mastroianni, often seemed to be drowning in a sea of women, unable to figure out what they wanted or to fulfill their desires - but he recognized them as autonomous human beings with their own interests, agendas, and inner lives separate from men's.</seg>
<seg id="49">Not the most enlightened attitude, but one that nonetheless set a high standard for other male filmmakers to follow, notably, Pedro Almodovar and Woody Allen, who both get a lot of credit (among actresses, critics, and audiences) for finding women as fascinating as Fellini did.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Film Set</seg>
<seg id="51">For Fellini, a movie shoot was itself a summation of all his great themes - it was a party, a circus, a dream, even a woman.</seg>
<seg id="52">("I even see the cinema itself as a woman, with its alternation of light and darkness, of appearing and disappearing images," he said in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="53">Going to the cinema is like returning to the womb; you sit there still and meditative in the darkness, waiting for life to appear on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="54">"One should go to the cinema with the innocence of a fetus.")</seg>
<seg id="55">The film set was the workshop where one could confront thorny issues, from one's own writer's block to society's malaise, from the mysteries of sex to man's place in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="56">Fellini did this most explicitly in the self-reflexive 8 ½, which became the model for all autobiographical movies about creatively blocked auteurs (from Francois Truffaut's Day for Night to Bob Fosse's All That Jazz to Allen's Stardust Memories to Tom DiCillo's Living in Oblivion to Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou).</seg>
<seg id="57">But the set wasn't just a place to work out a male midlife crisis.</seg>
<seg id="58">For Fellini - and for all those who've emulated him - the movie set has been the place where one could resolve through art problems that are intractable in real life.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sometimes, the answer is simply to give yourself over to pure joy, pure fantasy, like Anita Ekberg wading into the Trevi Fountain (and Mastroianni following her, trying to keep up) in the most iconic scene from La Dolce Vita.</seg>
<seg id="60">For our ability to recognize such moments of blissful resolution - and for the language of moving pictures that can capture them - we have Fellini to thank.</seg>

<seg id="1">British police serve Assange with extradition notice</seg>
<seg id="2">Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scotland Yard said they had served a "surrender notice" on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fearing Stockholm would pass him on to the US, he sought refuge at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.</seg>
<seg id="6">Scotland Yard has "served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He remains in breach of his bail conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The embassy declined to comment on the serving of the police notice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges, after releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stephen Larkham named Brumbies head coach, Laurie Fisher director of rugby</seg>
<seg id="2">The Brumbies will announce today that Stephen Larkham and Laurie Fisher will work together as head coach and director of coaching next season, following the shock departure of Jake White last month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brumbies head coach Stephen Larkham and director of rugby Laurie Fisher after the announcement of their new coaching structure in Canberra.</seg>
<seg id="4">THE Brumbies have confirmed Wallabies great Stephen Larkham and former head coach Laurie Fisher will share coaching duties for the club's next two Super Rugby seasons.</seg>
<seg id="5">Larkham will be the club's head coach, while Fisher has been appointed the Brumbies' director of rugby.</seg>
<seg id="6">As head coach, Larkham will have greater input and involvement with the overall organisation of the team and play a bigger part in recruitment and weekly selections.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fisher will control day-to-day rugby operations with elements like staffing, elite and academy program development, talent pathways and training structures.</seg>
<seg id="8">The appointments come following the shock resignation of South African-born World Cup-winning coach Jake White in September, who left just over a month after taking the side to the Super Rugby final.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the media conference to announce their appointments on Friday, Larkham was confident he and Fisher could keep the club's momentum going.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Nothing is going to change in terms of how we run the team," Larkham said."</seg>
<seg id="11">""Off the field, it's going to be the same.</seg>
<seg id="12">Laurie spoke to the forwards, I spoke to the backs, and Jake oversaw that process.</seg>
<seg id="13">Larkham, Australia's greatest modern day five-eighth, will also have greater authority over the team's overall attacking philosophies.</seg>
<seg id="14">But he indicated there would be plenty of room for Fisher's input across the park.</seg>
<seg id="15">There's robust discussions, and you put in your arguments to one another.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It's whoever argues the best point really, comes away with it at the end," he said."</seg>
<seg id="17">""We're fairly logical sort of men, so we come down and understand where the other person is coming from."</seg>
<seg id="18">Fisher, who was Brumbies head coach from 2005-'08, said the key to making the partnership work would be communication.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Whether it's a marriage, or whether it's a rugby program, if you're not talking about it, you're going to struggle," he said."</seg>
<seg id="20">""It's like any system.</seg>
<seg id="21">No one person in any environment determines exactly how it's done.</seg>
<seg id="22">Fisher said on top of his new duties, he'd continue to focus on the forwards, the breakdown and the tackle contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">We need to develop more locally bred Brumbies players.</seg>
<seg id="24">"So I'm really keen to get my teeth into that area," he said."</seg>
<seg id="25">Brumbies chief executive Andrew Fagan said an assistant coach would be appointed to assist Larkham and Fisher.</seg>
<seg id="26">""Their primary responsibilities will be defence, but will support the program as required," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash</seg>
<seg id="2">The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.</seg>
<seg id="3">"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The issue will be resolved this evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.</seg>
<seg id="8">No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.</seg>
<seg id="12">The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.</seg>

<seg id="2">British street artist Banksy has completed his takeover of New York City's streets after unveiling new work, announcements and updates on his website every day during October.</seg>
<seg id="3">The artist's final piece was an inflatable "throw-up," meaning a quickly-executed graffiti mark, on a building near the Long Island Expressway in the city's eastern borough of Queens.</seg>
<seg id="4">As with his first piece, The Street Is In Play, on October 1, an irreverent online audio guide accompanied the piece, which said it was "another Banksy piece that was full of hot air" and joked that it was a "shame [the residency] didn't get any press."</seg>
<seg id="5">The audio expressed Banksy's message of the residency, that "art's right place is on the cave wall of our communities, to provoke debate and voice concern," asking the question, "don't we want to live in a world made of art, not just decorated by it?"</seg>
<seg id="6">Banksy confirmed the end of his project by writing on his website, "And that's it."</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks for your patiences.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cheaters get high on their dishonesty</seg>
<seg id="2">These people tended to experience a larger boost in positive emotions compared to those who behaved honestly.</seg>
<seg id="3">The findings may help to explain why people will cheat without a good reason and why wealthy celebrities might steal when they have plenty of money to pay for items.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dr Ruedy said: "Many theories of moral behaviour assume that unethical behaviour triggers negative affect."</seg>
<seg id="5">"We challenge this assumption and demonstrate that unethical behaviour can trigger positive affect, which we term a "cheater's high."""</seg>
<seg id="6">The researchers, whose findings are published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, conducted six studies on how people felt after cheating.</seg>
<seg id="7">In one 179 students were offered the chance to earn cash rewards for solving anagrams.</seg>
<seg id="8">Forty one per cent of them cheated by adding in solutions after they had seen the answers.</seg>
<seg id="9">The researchers found these cheaters experienced a boost in positive emotions.</seg>
<seg id="10">In another study 161 students were set another challenge where there was no financial reward and on this occasion 68 per cent of these students cheated by clicking on a link to see early answers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Again these cheaters experienced a similar boost in their emotions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In another study to find out why people get this kick, the researchers again recruited 205 people online to solve anagrams and report how they did in return for cash.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the participants were sent a message telling them that it would not be possible to check their answers and asking them to report them honestly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Those who lied about their scores and received the message reported greater self-satisfaction than those who cheated but did not receive the message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dr Ruedy claims this shows that the buzz of cheating comes from the thrill of getting away with it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"She said: "Cheating is associated with feelings of self-satisfaction, and the boost in positive affect from cheating persists even when prospects for self-deception about unethical behaviour are reduced."</seg>

<seg id="1">Book Details Obama Aides" Talks About Replacing Biden on 2012 Ticket</seg>
<seg id="2">President Obama's top aides secretly considered replacing Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with Hillary Rodham Clinton on the 2012 ticket, undertaking extensive focus-group sessions and polling in late 2011 when Mr. Obama's re-election outlook appeared uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The aides concluded that despite Mrs. Clinton's popularity, the move would not offer a significant enough political boost to Mr. Obama to justify such a radical move, according to a newly published account of the 2012 race.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea of replacing Mr. Biden with Mrs. Clinton had long been rumored, but the journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, in their new book, "Double Down," provide a detailed description of the effort inside the senior circle of Obama advisers.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was pushed by the chief of staff at the time, William M. Daley, despite the close personal rapport Mr. Daley had developed with Mr. Biden, a fellow Irish Catholic and veteran of Washington politics.</seg>
<seg id="6">"When the research came back near the end of the year, it suggested that adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't materially improve Obama's odds," the authors write in their sequel to "Game Change," which chronicled the 2008 campaign.</seg>
<seg id="7">Biden had dodged a bullet he never saw coming - and never would know anything about, if the Obamans could keep a secret.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a phone interview on Thursday, Mr. Daley acknowledged that he had wanted to research what the move would have meant for Mr. Obama, whose popularity, in the fall of 2011, was at its lowest in his presidency to date.</seg>
<seg id="9">He called it simply "due diligence."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?" "</seg>
<seg id="12">While last year's grind of an election lacked the drama of the 2008 race, there was no lack of backstage maneuvering and fighting, providing grist for the authors" reconstruction of Mr. Obama's race against Mitt Romney and the at-times-unpredictable Republican primary.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Obama is seen as being detached from much of the tedious but necessary grunt work of politics and as wanting to be a more unapologetically liberal president.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Biden, who may run for president in 2016, is viewed warily by Mr. Obama's circle not only for being a gaffe-prone "Uncle Joe," but also for, in their minds, being overly consumed with his own political future.</seg>
<seg id="15">And Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, another potential presidential candidate, is described as having been eliminated from vice-presidential contention by Mr. Romney because of unanswered questions about his background and health.</seg>
<seg id="16">But at the heart of the book, which The New York Times obtained from people in the publishing industry, are the same two families that loomed over the 2008 race: the Obamas and the Clintons.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even after Mr. Obama named Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state, seemingly binding the wounds from their hard-fought 2008 primary campaign, the book says, he still could barely endure spending much time with the often-exhausting Bill Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Obama rarely contacted his Democratic predecessor in the first years after taking office, but after the midterm losses for his party, the incumbent and his inner circle realized that they needed the still-popular Mr. Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="19">When the two of them golfed together in September 2011, an effort aides hoped would bring them closer, they did not even finish 18 holes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Obama succinctly expressed his view of Mr. Clinton to an aide after coming off the course at Andrews Air Force Base.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Obama grimaced and replied, "I like him ... in doses," " the authors write.</seg>
<seg id="22">Earlier in the year, "Clinton held Obama captive in the presidential limo" outside a fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, the authors write, grabbing Mr. Obama's hand as he reached for the door.</seg>
<seg id="23">Instead of having a one-on-one meal together that night, as was planned, Mr. Obama, unable to "handle any more undiluted Clinton," invited aides from both of their staffs to join the dinner and talked to them about their children, rather than talking about politics with his predecessor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Showtime for Bond songs</seg>
<seg id="2">Art: Georgie Pinn.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since Shirley Bassey released Goldfinger almost 50 years ago, it has been tradition for a major artist to record the signature song for each new James Bond film.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, fans can recognise "Bond songs" from the opening bars alone - even the obscure ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They're quite distinct," says Simon Myers, producer of the live stage show The Songs of James Bond.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of them are epic, mysterious, with an element of sex.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have an orchestral background with a rising and falling bass and that guitar line at the start.</seg>
<seg id="8">And singers love them because the vocals are big and challenging and dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bassey, of course, is the quintessential Bond songstress, having recorded the themes for Goldfinger, Diamonds are Forever and Moonraker.</seg>
<seg id="10">Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die and Carly Simon's Nobody Does It Better were also major hits.</seg>
<seg id="11">Standing alone - stylistically at least - is Madonna's stuttering electro-dance number Die Another Day.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The less said about that, the better," Myers says.</seg>
<seg id="13">These songs can be quite divisive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some people say Adele's Skyfall is the greatest Bond song of all time; others don't like it at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">And there are those artists you might be surprised to learn have actually recorded Bond songs, like Sheena Easton and Lulu.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maria Mercedes: The glamour endures with Bond songs from the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="17">On November 8 and 9, Myers will present 23 of his favourites at Melbourne's Athenaeum Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has chosen four performers: veteran actor-singer Maria Mercedes; respected vocal coach and singer Susie Ahern; actor and former opera student Ben Mingay; and The Voice finalist Kiyomi Vella.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I've been wanting to do this for 20 years," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It started when I bought a CD of James Bond songs and I thought, wouldn't it be awesome to make a concert out of these?</seg>
<seg id="21">Some numbers will performed solo, others as duets, while Live and Let Die will feature all four singers.</seg>
<seg id="22">A 15-piece band will play on stage and visual artist Georgie Pinn will project images onto a giant screen.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's all original footage that I've shot; there are no scenes from the films," Pinn says.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fire, diamonds, silhouettes: the imagery she has chosen evokes the slick, glamorous feel of the Bond movies.</seg>
<seg id="25">"A lot of it is like the title sequences of the films," she says, "but instead of having the female characters just dancing around, we've given them a more active role."</seg>
<seg id="26">The look and sound of each Bond movie is just as important as the storyline.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I started watching some of the old ones again, to get into the mood," Mercedes says, "and my God, they were so over the top, they were ridiculous!</seg>
<seg id="28">But even if you forget the movies themselves, the songs and the glamour endure.</seg>
<seg id="29">When Mercedes began singing at 14, appearing on various television talent shows, Bassey was her role model.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I listened to her endlessly, singing Goldfinger and Diamonds are Forever," she says.</seg>
<seg id="31">The sophistication, the sexiness - I wanted to be Shirley Bassey.</seg>
<seg id="32">Myers won't reveal who will sing each song but it's a fair bet Mercedes will perform most of Bassey's big numbers.</seg>
<seg id="33">For her, the show's appeal extends beyond the songs.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's a chance for the audience to immerse themselves in mid-century glamour: a world of men in sharp suits and women in sequined dresses, stylish visual projections with a modern twist, and an orchestra taking pride of place on stage.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In this day and age, music often gets sacrificed," Mercedes says.</seg>
<seg id="36">A 15-piece-band is quite a luxury.</seg>
<seg id="37">I've got a black sequined outfit with a split up the side for the first act and a fabulous gold outfit for the second.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's not just a series of songs; it's a show.</seg>
<seg id="39">There's a real sexiness to the whole thing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Due to new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of trucks sit in queue on the Russian border almost a week already.</seg>
<seg id="2">Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and to set up portable toilets</seg>
<seg id="3">Hundreds of trucks have accumulated at border points upon entry into Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">This situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs processing of freight.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ukrainian border patrol guards and customs officers confirm: the line is caused by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since October 28 customs agencies of Russia have begun to employ additional measures to guarantee delivery of freight, - reported deputy manager of Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.</seg>
<seg id="7">The new document standard is being applied in countries that have joined the convention on international transport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Entry points work in an accelerated regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">A correspondent of "FACTS" visited the border and talked to truck drivers who ended up hostages of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Prices at the roadside store-cafe at the "Novoazovsk" entry point rise each day just like the line of trucks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trucks stand in several rows that spread approximately two kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="12">The customs terminal Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka secures one of the most important transport vectors from southern Ukraine to international motorways.</seg>
<seg id="13">From here freights are sent to Stavropol Krai of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Sunday until midnight they still let through, but later they introduced the new rules, - complains long-distance truck driver Aleksei Golovanev (on the photo), who hauls freight in transit through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and sleeps in his vehicle almost a week already.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the new rules, I need an additional packet of documents and payment of freight insurance to cross the border .</seg>
<seg id="16">The amount depends on the value of the freight and the distance it will be hauled.</seg>
<seg id="17">Minimum coverage 4.5−5 thousand rubles (approximately 1,100−1,300 hryvnia).</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who will drive a short distance (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a freight valued at up to 50 thousand dollars will pay somewhere around 15 thousand rubles (3,800 hryvnia) and drive on.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the rest are stuck - after all no one has such big money with them!</seg>
<seg id="20">Imagine, if a driver hauls freight for a sum of only four thousand dollars, but even to Moscow he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!</seg>
<seg id="21">There are no facilities for survival at the border, - complains long-distance truck drivers arranging themselves to eat near their vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="22">At roadside stores and cafes it is always expensive anyway, but we have never encountered such prices like here!</seg>
<seg id="23">Salespeople got their bearings and quickly jacked them up: a long loaf costs 15 hryvnia, seven hryvnia - cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - bowl of soup.</seg>
<seg id="24">But there is only one cafe.</seg>
<seg id="25">And no toilet.</seg>
<seg id="26">We sleep in the steppe, we also go there to the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="27">No wash, no shave...</seg>
<seg id="28">I can even go a week without leaving the vehicle, my wife prepared me everything for the road.</seg>
<seg id="29">I can last a week, - another long-distance truck driver Victor Skotarenko comforts himself.</seg>
<seg id="30">But will the queue get to my vehicle within a week?</seg>
<seg id="31">What is your price for one and a half liters of water? - we inquire in the only border store.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have for 11 and for 15 hryvnia.</seg>
<seg id="33">What, is the bottle crystal or the water infused in silver?</seg>
<seg id="34">We have a cafe, not a store.</seg>
<seg id="35">Take it while there is still something, - retorts the saleswoman.</seg>
<seg id="36">After they began to expose the situation in the media, authorities of the region turned their attention to the dire situation of the Ukrainian drivers.</seg>
<seg id="37">The leaders of the Amvrosievska and Novoazovsk district government administrations received an order to provide drinking water to everyone who is standing idle in queue on the Ukrainian-Russian border, - announced the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional government administration Sergei Dergunov.</seg>
<seg id="38">Now ambulance teams are on duty at entry points.</seg>
<seg id="39">Also portable toilets will be set up for convenience of the people.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to an official, the problem associated with the queues will be resolved already in the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="41">As reports the press office of the Donetsk regional government administration, as of October 31, at international entry points "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk", 32 and 68 vehicles, respectively, stood idle.</seg>
<seg id="42">"FACTS" will monitor the development of the situation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Premier Barry O'Farrell has said parents should not be "spooked" by an incident of indecent assault of three boys by a contract cleaner at a Sutherland Shire school.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Damian Shaw Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="4">A SUTHERLAND Shire cleaner will spend tonight behind bars after allegedly indecently assaulting three children at a primary school over a six-month period.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 60-year-old man of Kogarah, was refused bail at Sutherland Local Court after being arrested by Child Abuse Squad detectives on six charges of indecently assaulting a persons under 16 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was accused of assaulting a 10-year-old boy and two 11-year-old boys on the school grounds south of Sydney between April and October.</seg>
<seg id="7">The man allegedly slapped the boys on the bottom numerous times, slapped one boy on the thigh and swiped his hand over another boy's penis, according to the court documents.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last, and "most serious," alleged attack occurred on Monday when an 11-year-old was touched on the penis, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="9">A complaint was made to police and the accused was stood down by the school.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he allegedly returned to the school on Tuesday and Wednesday after being told not return and watched one of his alleged victims walk to school, the court documents say.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also was allegedly seen outside the homes of one of the alleged victims, the police said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The man has denied the charges.</seg>
<seg id="13">Premier Barry O'Farrell said parents shouldn't be "spooked" by the alleged assault of the young students.</seg>
<seg id="14">But concerned parents at the public primary school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, told The Daily Telegraph they were shocked.</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm absolutely horrified.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'll see if there is any information from the school to the parents because we should have been notified," one parent said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Another parent said she was good the cleaner had been charged.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's frightening, I've got to speak to my son about it tonight.</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't know what to do.</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm a bit shocked," the mother said.</seg>
<seg id="21">The court heard the Australian citizen, who migrated from Macedonia in 2001, had strong ties to his community and had worked as a cleaner with his wife for more than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="22">Magistrate Peter Budgen denied the father-of-two bail, saying his alleged victims were of "tender years."</seg>
<seg id="23">His legal aid lawyer Greg Melrose said his client did not know the alleged victims' names or where they lived, and if he was spotted near one of their homes it was a coincidence because he could not park near the school.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Melrose also said the man told police he had not entered school grounds after he was stood down, just the office, and only did so to try to talk to the principal about why he had been sacked.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said his client denied the allegations and had a clean criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Department of Education was liaising with parents and would provide counselling, a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="27">The spokesman refused to say whether he was contracted to clean at other schools.</seg>
<seg id="28">The matter was adjourned to November 14.</seg>

<seg id="1">No escape from electronic eyes</seg>
<seg id="2">The use of closed circuit television images is now commonplace in criminal cases such as that of Jill Meagher.</seg>
<seg id="3">AMID the controversy about alleged American eavesdropping on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile telephone discussions and the collation of data about global mobile phone traffic, a much quieter conversation is going on here in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's not new: Australians have long grappled with the tension between privacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="5">If we know where the criminals are, we can better protect ourselves from their evil.</seg>
<seg id="6">But they aren't criminals before they commit a crime, so in order to protect ourselves we need to know where everyone is.</seg>
<seg id="7">That includes you.</seg>
<seg id="8">Confronted with this choice, the more recent practice of Australians, and people the world over, has been to make no choice.</seg>
<seg id="9">So it's being made for them.</seg>
<seg id="10">With every new closed circuit television camera installed, every retina reader in public and private places, every deployment of face-recognition technology, a decision is being made in favour of safety over privacy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bob Hawke's first political advertisement in the 1987 election campaign was for the government's then-popular Australia Card proposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">Every Australian would be issued a unique identifier number with the purpose of cracking down on welfare and tax fraud.</seg>
<seg id="13">But by 1988, the re-elected Hawke government had abandoned the Australia Card, so overwhelmingly had public opinion turned against it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Agitated by a conservative federal opposition and the ranting of talkback radio hosts, Australians chose privacy over the higher taxes they would have to pay to support ever-increasing welfare and tax cheating.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was the last time they made a conscious choice.</seg>
<seg id="16">With the advent of the internet and digital video cameras in the 1990s, far more sophisticated and more continuous ways of monitoring and recording a person's activities began emerging.</seg>
<seg id="17">Back then the police might get lucky if a local convenience store or railway station had recorded images of suspect behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="18">But now, with most retail outlets, public buildings and community spaces equipped with closed circuit television cameras, images of an individual's movement over extended periods of time can be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">Closed circuit television images provided evidence to bring the killer of Melbourne woman Jill Meagher to justice.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their use in criminal cases is now commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="21">Surely that's a welcome technological advance.</seg>
<seg id="22">But what are the constraints on third-party usage of closed circuit television images when no crime has been committed?</seg>
<seg id="23">In practice, not many, it seems.</seg>
<seg id="24">Back in 2001 a parliamentary committee chair, Christopher Pyne, claimed I had intimidated him at a public bar in Canberra.</seg>
<seg id="25">At no time did Pyne allege I had committed a crime; just that I had used vulgar language (which I did not deny).</seg>
<seg id="26">The Speaker of the house sought video footage of the entire evening from the bar.</seg>
<seg id="27">The bar owner obliged, possibly worried about the consequences of non-compliance on his patronage.</seg>
<seg id="28">Consider the precedent.</seg>
<seg id="29">If a parliamentarian decides a political rival or member of the public has been intimidating, the Speaker can seek video images of the alleged incident.</seg>
<seg id="30">Politicians, as we know, are fair game.</seg>
<seg id="31">But surely we should at least be discussing the adequacy of privacy protections for private individuals against the misuse of video footage, retina imaging, mobile roaming and other technologies by law enforcement authorities, national security agencies and the general public.</seg>
<seg id="32">US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has warned of the intrusion on personal liberties by US national security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="33">Yet that intelligence gathering has averted a number of planned terror attacks in the US and elsewhere, saving countless lives.</seg>
<seg id="34">Video footage helped authorities identify the Boston Marathon bombers who killed several bystanders.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, innocent people caught up as suspects in the crowd-sourcing exercise had to work for days to clear their names.</seg>
<seg id="36">Advances in computing technology will make it easier to identify patterns of mobile telephone calls, enabling security agencies more effectively to identify and thwart planned terrorist plots.</seg>
<seg id="37">Facial imaging, by which computers can define the essential features of people's faces and identify them despite subsequent changes that would baffle the human eye, can be an early step in tracking every person's movements over their lifetimes.</seg>
<seg id="38">Foot traffic through Brisbane's main shopping mall is to be monitored based on mobile phones carried by pedestrians.</seg>
<seg id="39">These are some of the existing surveillance technologies, mostly developed in just the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="40">More will follow very quickly, as Emmeline Taylor, convener of criminology at the Australian National University, points out.</seg>
<seg id="41">Raising the privacy issue is not unpatriotic.</seg>
<seg id="42">If the public is better informed about the technologies being deployed and the adequacy of laws governing their usage, more informed choices can be made.</seg>
<seg id="43">Do you remember who sang the lyrics, "Every step you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you"?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was the Police.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the police are here to protect us, aren't they?</seg>

<seg id="2">By Matthew Miller</seg>
<seg id="3">BEIJING (Reuters) - The online payment affiliate of China's biggest e-commerce company Alibaba Group Ltd will be restructured to attract new strategic investors, in a move that will reduce the shareholding of Alibaba's founder Jack Ma in the affiliate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce Co Ltd will be restructured as a new company in which 60 percent of its shares will be offered to new strategic investors, Lucy Peng, head of the restructured entity, said in a letter published on its official Weibo microblog account on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ma will see his shareholding reduced from 80 percent to about 7 percent in the new company, or no greater than his shareholding in Alibaba Group, according to the letter.</seg>
<seg id="6">The restructured company, to be known as Alibaba Small and Micro Financial Services Group, will hold Zhejiang Alibaba's 100 percent stake in unit Alipay, as well as its shareholding in Alibaba's micro-finance unit, Zhongan Insurance, and Tianhong Asset Management Co.</seg>
<seg id="7">Alipay is China's biggest third-party payment platform, providing payment solutions to 460,000 merchants, and with 800 million registered accounts.</seg>
<seg id="8">The remaining 40 percent in the new company will be offered to nearly 24,000 employees at Alibaba Group and Zhejiang Alibaba, said Peng, former chief executive of Alipay.</seg>
<seg id="9">That includes the share held by Ma.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement on Friday will have no impact on existing agreements with Alibaba and the group's shareholders SoftBank Corp and Yahoo!</seg>
<seg id="11">Inc, Alibaba spokesman John Spelich said.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2011, Ma sparked a public dispute with Alibaba Group's biggest outside investors when he separated Alipay from Alibaba.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ma said at the time that new Chinese government regulations on third-party payment services required the changes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The companies later settled, in a deal that guaranteed Alibaba 49.9 percent of Alipay's earnings prior to an initial public offering, and as much as $6 billion if Alipay sells shares to the public.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Today's announcement underscores that employees of both Alibaba Group Holdings and Alibaba Small and Micro Financial Services Group are being incentivized to work hard to achieve success for the company," Spelich said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Alibaba Group, through Alipay, is introducing a variety of financial services to complement its e-commerce businesses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Besides Alipay, which provides users with an online payment system, the Hangzhou-based company has also started fund and insurance sales, as well as small loan finance.</seg>
<seg id="18">In June, Alipay launched Yu E Bao, a fund management platform, allowing Alibaba customers to directly invest cash from their Alipay account into a money market fund managed by Tianhong Asset Management Co.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="3">No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="6">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gender" on their official documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.</seg>
<seg id="25">German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="33">And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">He was given female hormones at age 12.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found out was horrifying.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.</seg>
<seg id="58">Surgery rendered him infertile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigma."</seg>
<seg id="61">"A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'" she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid it will encourage intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law is about assigning it at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'</seg>
<seg id="78">This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.</seg>
<seg id="80">We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.</seg>
<seg id="83">It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears</seg>
<seg id="2">Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had "never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation," the Commission was told.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.</seg>
<seg id="6">He conceded the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management "from myself down" failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.</seg>
<seg id="12">Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.</seg>
<seg id="19">YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">The hearing adjourned until December 20.</seg>

<seg id="4">A record price was on Thursday night set for Australian artist Brett Whiteley for his stunning 1976 canvas My Armchair, detailing his beloved Lavender Bay studio, which fetched $3,927,272 including buyer's premium.</seg>
<seg id="5">Purchased by a private collector, the previous record was $3.48 million for his The Olgas for Ernest Giles (1985) purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="6">The auction at Menzies Art Brands' South Yarra rooms mirrored opening night at the opera with the frocked up crowd - standing room only - prior to its 6.30pm start.</seg>
<seg id="7">At 7.15pm the auctioneer Martin Farra opened bids at $2.7 million and four minutes later the deal was done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Executive chairman of Menzies Art Brands, Rod Menzies described the result candidly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mission accomplished.</seg>
<seg id="10">The result has buoyed the secondary art market admirably after a tough time which has recently seen stock exchange and real estate prices rising.</seg>
<seg id="11">My Armchair was first exhibited at Australian Galleries, Collingwood in 1976 and according to the gallery's Stuart Purves, was the piece de resistance of the show.</seg>
<seg id="12">Purchase for $10,000 by the original vendors, a Melbourne couple, Purves recalls they had to remove the double doors at the entrance to their house to fit the 2 metre by 2.8 metre painting in.</seg>
<seg id="13">Recently they repeated the process to get the work to auction.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whiteley had held two previous shows from 1966 at Australian Galleries before the 1976 sale and Purves says he shut the gallery for three days while the artist organised the layout of the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whiteley was there every second of the way.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It was the zenith of his life, he was 37, married to his beautiful wife, Wendy and had a beautiful daughter, Arkie, and had purchased the Lavender Bay property," Purves said.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 17:01</seg>
<seg id="3">A man has admitted scrawling graffiti about Fusilier Lee Rigby's death on a war memorial in London.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daniel Smith, of Grecian Street North, Salford, caused the damage to the RAF Bomber Command War Memorial, on 5 June.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unemployed 21-year-old admitted causing criminal damage at Westminster Magistrates' Court.</seg>
<seg id="6">The memorial was vandalised twice after Fusilier Rigby was killed in the street in Woolwich, south-east London, on 22 May.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was created to remember RAF crew who were killed in World War 2.</seg>
<seg id="8">The graffiti caused damage worth £870.</seg>
<seg id="9">District Judge Quentin Purdy said the content and location of the graffiti was "highly emotive."</seg>
<seg id="10">Disgusted with himself</seg>
<seg id="11">Smith's actions challenged the "tolerance we all seek to see in society," he added.</seg>
<seg id="12">Colleen Gildernew, defending Smith, said: "He had no idea that the war memorial was a war memorial.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is very disgusted with himself, even more so because of that.</seg>
<seg id="14">He also pleaded guilty to causing £510 of criminal damage to a wall of a commercial property in Knightsbridge.</seg>
<seg id="15">Smith, who has 44 previous convictions, mainly for shoplifting, had applied for a job in the Army but was not selected "because of his convictions as a young boy."</seg>
<seg id="16">The 21-year-old had planned on going to Fusilier Rigby's funeral but was unable to attend as he was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Purdy said he would explore all "reasonable options" for Smith moving on rather than being sent back into custody.</seg>
<seg id="18">But he said a custodial sentence was a possibility, adding "there may be no alternative."</seg>
<seg id="19">The court heard that Smith had spent the past 11 weeks in Feltham Young Offenders' Institution and was released on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judge said it was "slightly worrying" that Smith was released with few arrangements in place.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sentencing has been adjourned until Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
<seg id="9">She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.</seg>
<seg id="11">An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA to Allow Gadgets During Takeoff and Landing</seg>
<seg id="2">The days of hearing "Please turn off all your electronic devices" on the loudspeaker before airlines' take offs and landings are coming to an end.</seg>
<seg id="3">After hearing and assessing a report from the Aviation Rulemaking Committee, today the Federal Aviation Administration announced that it will be loosening the restrictions on gadget usage on planes, announcing that airlines can safely expand passenger use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Most planes can handle radio interference," Michael Huerta, the administrator of the FAA, said at a press conference this morning.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is safe to read e-books and play games.</seg>
<seg id="6">One percent of flights might not be able to tolerate the interference.</seg>
<seg id="7">In those cases passengers will be asked to turn off their devices.</seg>
<seg id="8">That means that e-readers, phones, tablets and MP3 players won't have to be powered off during the takeoff and landing periods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are still some restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">All the devices must be put in airplane mode during those periods and some larger devices, like laptops, may still have to be stowed in a seat pocket during takeoff and landing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Additionally, you cannot talk on your phone at any point during the flight, Huerta stressed.</seg>
<seg id="12">I want to be clear you still cannot talk on the phone during the flight.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The committee did not consider that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Once in the air, passengers can connect to the plane's in-flight WiFi network and they can also use Bluetooth devices.</seg>
<seg id="15">There will still be one point, however, where all passengers have to put down their devices: during the safety video or when flight attendants provide the pre-flight safety information.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Passengers must take a break and listen to the safety briefing before each flight," Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="17">So when will you be able to listen to your music or read an e-book while the flight takes off?</seg>
<seg id="18">Fairly soon, it seems.</seg>
<seg id="19">Airlines will now have to revise policies and work with the FAA, but it shouldn't be too long of a wait.</seg>
<seg id="20">Delta has already submitted its plan and says it might be ready to allow use as early as tomorrow, Nov.</seg>
<seg id="21">The airline says its aircrafts have already completed the carrier-defined PED tolerance testing.</seg>
<seg id="22">"These changes won't take effect immediately, but we will be working with the airlines to get it done as quickly as we can," Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="23">I expect expanded use to happen very soon.</seg>

<seg id="19">Mr Jeffries said: "JK Rowling's letter said how utterly extraordinary it was that I had such a tusk.</seg>
<seg id="20">She said she thought she made the name up - but she couldn't be absolutely certain.</seg>
<seg id="21">In a way it's quite nice that we're still in the dark about its ultimate origins.</seg>
<seg id="22">This way the tusk retains its mystery.</seg>
<seg id="23">Narwhals used to be seen as mythical creatures associated with unicorns, which ties in well with the Harry Potter magical theme.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Jeffries said he donated three per cent of his profits to a multiple sclerosis charity because the cause is so important to JK Rowling, whose late mother Anne died from the illness at 45.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her added: "I'm giving £900 of the money made from the tusk to her chosen charity.</seg>
<seg id="26">I feel that the books were part of the reason the tusk sold for so much, and that it was only fair some of the proceeds went to her charity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Michael Owen goes from Red Devil to Brown Panther in silverware search</seg>
<seg id="2">Ex-Manchester United striker Michael Owen celebrates after scoring.</seg>
<seg id="3">He'll go even more mental if he wins the Melbourne Cup.</seg>
<seg id="4">HE won the UEFA Cup, FA Cup, and played for England at a World Cup - now former football star Michael Owen is chasing his very first Melbourne Cup.</seg>
<seg id="5">Owen will touch down in Melbourne today ahead of Tuesday's big race where the horse he part-owns, Brown Panther, will try to upstage some of the biggest names in racing.</seg>
<seg id="6">And according to English trainer Tom Dascombe, Owen has never been so pumped.</seg>
<seg id="7">"He sent me a text yesterday saying, `I've never been so excited'," Dascombe said.</seg>
<seg id="8">He's pretty keen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Amazingly, Dascombe revealed he didn't have a clue who Owen actually was when they first spoke.</seg>
<seg id="10">Owen, 33, is basically a football icon worshipped at powerhouse club Liverpool, then later at clubs like Real Madrid and Manchester United.</seg>
<seg id="11">The baby-faced striker was even crowned with football's highest honour, the Ballon d'Or.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Dascombe happily admitted he didn't like football.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chris Ely winces as Brown Panther shakes sand over him after a roll at Werribee.</seg>
<seg id="14">Picture: Colleen Petch Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="15">"I was training at Lambourn and Michael basically rang me up one day and said, `fancy coming here?'," said Dascombe, a no-nonsense bloke who comes across as more Noel Gallagher than Prince Harry.</seg>
<seg id="16">We went from there.</seg>
<seg id="17">I had no idea who he was.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'm not really a football fan.</seg>
<seg id="19">I've been to Manchester United a few times when he was playing and I enjoyed it, but I've got more interest in the horses than I do in football.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jockey Richard Kingscote is another Englishman who says he doesn't really follow football, which probably helped with any expectations or nerves when riding for a high-profile owner like Owen.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I like my motorbikes," Kingscote said.</seg>
<seg id="22">I've had a couple of people ask for tickets, or get a T-shirt signed, little things like that.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's never a problem for Michael.</seg>
<seg id="24">Brown Panther is a $21 chance for the Cup, and lumped 60.5kg to victory in the Group 2 Goodwood Cup (3219m) two starts back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Dascombe said the Cup had been pencilled in two years ago after Brown Panther, a six-year-old stallion, won a race by six lengths at Royal Ascot.</seg>
<seg id="26">"You don't come here on a whim," Dascombe said.</seg>
<seg id="27">After he won at Royal Ascot, that's when we started making plans about this race.</seg>
<seg id="28">I don't think he's necessarily well handicapped for this race.</seg>
<seg id="29">He's giving weight to a lot of horses, and if we met them at home, he'd be getting weight off them.</seg>
<seg id="30">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="31">But I'd rather win the Goodwood Cup and carry a couple of more pounds here than not win that race.</seg>
<seg id="32">Brown Panther stretches out with Andrew Jackson aboard during trackwork at Werribee.</seg>

<seg id="34">We haven't done a lot with him.</seg>
<seg id="35">He's one of those horses who gives his best every day.</seg>
<seg id="36">You're worried all the time because we he walks, he walks fast, when he trots, he goes fast, when he gallops, he wants to put it all in.</seg>
<seg id="37">You need to hold him back a bit, otherwise he seems fresh ... we don't want to do too much with him.</seg>
<seg id="38">On another murky morning as the internationals worked at Werribee:</seg>
<seg id="39">#THE Red Cadeaux camp said they would be "disappointed if he doesn't finish in the top four";</seg>
<seg id="40">#AUSSIE jockeys Tommy Berry and Kerrin McEvoy punched around Tres Blue and Royal Empire respectively; and</seg>
<seg id="41">#SUAVE Italian Luca Cumani chose his words carefully when referring to Englishman Ryan Moore's effort on Mount Athos' in last year's Cup, and said: "Things didn't pan out, the plan was not implemented."</seg>
<seg id="42">Cumani has since booked Craig Williams.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama's Health Care Walk Back</seg>
<seg id="2">Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."</seg>
<seg id="3">With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">Addressing what he called the "flurry in the news" about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You're going to get a better deal," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone "miserably" since October.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am eager to earn your confidence back.</seg>
<seg id="14">An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prince William wearing a bikini and other royal targets of News International phone hackers</seg>
<seg id="2">Rebekah Brooks, former News International chief executive, allegedly authorised payment for a stolen royal phone directory used for phone hacking.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: AFP Photo</seg>
<seg id="4">London: Former News of the World editor and News International chief executive officer Rebekah Brooks authorised a payment to an army wife for a photo of Prince William wearing a bikini at a party, a court has heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">The court also saw a transcript of a hacked voicemail left by Prince Harry, in which he pleaded for an aide to help him research an essay for the Sandhurst military academy.</seg>
<seg id="6">If they're discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal charges, as could we</seg>
<seg id="7">And Brooks" one-time deputy Andy Coulson allegedly authorised payment for a stolen royal phone directory used to target Prince Charles" top aide, who the News of the World thought (wrongly) was having an affair.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly had an affair with fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the phone hacking trial at the Old Bailey in London on Friday the jury continued to hear prosecutor Andrew Edis QC outline the allegations against the eight defendants in his opening statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Four of the defendants are charged with conspiring to hack phones, three are charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in public office through paying public servants for information, and four are charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice by hiding evidence from police.</seg>
<seg id="11">All deny the charges.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the morning, the jury heard of more hacking by the News of the World newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="13">At one point editors decided to target Calum Best, son of footballer George, because they had paid a woman who claimed to have had his child.</seg>
<seg id="14">Editor Andy Coulson emailed news editor Ian Edmondson saying "Do his phone," Mr Edis told the jury - saying they would need to weigh up what that meant.</seg>
<seg id="15">The jury also heard of an attempt in 2004 by the News of the World to use phone hacking to establish whether home secretary Charles Clarke was having an affair with an adviser.</seg>
<seg id="16">Coulson was closely involved in the investigation, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He had a standard, three-pronged method of getting such stories.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it's someone really important, the editor contacts the minister and puts it to him.</seg>
<seg id="19">Phone hacking, surveillance, confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not every story in the newspaper was discovered by phone hacking, but it was used to confirm tips from sources.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's a perfectly rational but illegal system," Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Celebrity victims included Sven Goran Ericksson, Delia Smith, Sadie Frost, Jude Law, Paul McCartney, Kerry Katona, Geoffrey Archer and Nigel Farage.</seg>
<seg id="23">Paul McCartney was hacked for many years, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="24">At one point the newspaper hacked hairdresser Laura Rooney because they thought, mistakenly, she was related to Wayne Rooney.</seg>
<seg id="25">The prosecution then moved on to the charges of inappropriate payments to public officials.</seg>
<seg id="26">News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman was convicted on phone hacking charges in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since then, new emails were provided by News International's lawyers to police, showing that in 2003 and 2005 Goodman wanted to acquire royal telephone directories from palace police.</seg>
<seg id="28">They were purchased with the intention to hack phones, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="29">One hacking target was Sir Michael Peat, principal private secretary to Prince Charles.</seg>
<seg id="30">But the phone books and the hacking also helped the paper get stories relating to Princes William, Kate Middleton, Prince Harry and Sarah Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2002, Coulson authorised a payment of £750 ($1265) for one directory.</seg>
<seg id="32">Goodman later sought £1000 ($1686) to purchase another one, which contained the Queen's direct lines to her family.</seg>
<seg id="33">"These people will not be paid in anything other than cash," Goodman wrote in an email to Coulson asking for money.</seg>
<seg id="34">If they're discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal charges, as could we.</seg>
<seg id="35">Goodman said it was a "very risky document for [the policeman] to nick."</seg>
<seg id="36">Coulson approved the payment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Edis said this was "the clearest indication possible of a conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office."</seg>
<seg id="38">The jury heard that Goodman kept documents as part of his unfair dismissal case against News International after his conviction, which Mr Edis said were kept to prove he was officially sanctioned to pursue phone hacking.</seg>
<seg id="39">One email revealed that the News of the World had hacked the voicemail of an aide to Prince Harry.</seg>
<seg id="40">The email included a transcript of a message Harry left on his private secretary's mobile, asking him to "please, please help" with an essay about the siege of the Iranian embassy that was part of his Sandhurst homework.</seg>
<seg id="41">His private secretary was Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, an ex-SAS officer.</seg>
<seg id="42">The information was used for a News of the World story that suggested Prince Harry was cheating.</seg>
<seg id="43">Another phone hack revealed that Prince William had been 'pretend-shot" in army night exercises.</seg>
<seg id="44">The court also heard that Brooks approved a payment of £4000 ($6744) to the spouse of a member of the armed forces at Sandhurst to obtain a picture of Prince William wearing a bikini at a James Bond fancy dress party.</seg>
<seg id="45">The photo was never used, but The Sun ran the story using a mock-up.</seg>
<seg id="46">After Goodman went to prison and Coulson resigned, Brooks was still in a position to help Goodman, and tried to get him a job at The Sun when he was released, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="47">She made the offer at a lunch only three weeks after telling the press regulator that anyone caught breaking the law would be sacked.</seg>
<seg id="48">Brooks also personally approved £40,000 ($67,483) in payments to a reporter's Ministry of Defence source.</seg>
<seg id="49">Some payments were for information so the Sun Newspaper could be first to print news about dead and wounded soldiers, the jury was told.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Brooks was conspiring to commit misconduct in public office, and she knew it," Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="51">The prosecution will continue to open its case on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">From billionaire to MP: Palmer to disclose riches</seg>
<seg id="2">Clive Palmer: Circumspect about source of wealth.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wealthy businessman Clive Palmer will be forced to disclose a minefield of potential conflicts of interests in his new role as a federal MP, with directorships of no fewer than 74 private companies involved in aviation, sport, mining, shipping, real estate and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="4">Concerns about the influence of Mr Palmer's financial interests on his political decisions were raised on Friday by a fellow Queensland MP, Wyatt Roy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Clive is an individual who's clearly pretty self-interested.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I think there are pretty serious questions about that," Mr Roy said.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Fairfax Media investigation of Mr Palmer's wealth finds his investments stretch from cane farms in the Sunshine Coast hinterland to the coalfields in central Queensland, a Tahitian resort, prospecting operations in offshore gas fields, Chinese ship builders and Zeppelin airships.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past the self-proclaimed billionaire has been circumspect about the source and nature of his total wealth, batting back questions because his companies are privately held.</seg>
<seg id="9">But under the rules of Parliament, he will be required to submit a detailed list of his assets within 28 days of being asked to swear an oath or make an affirmation as federal MP.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Roy, 23, said Mr Palmer's term should be about the results he can deliver for his electorate.</seg>
<seg id="11">"And [Mr Palmer] has to make a decision about whether that's what he wants to do or he wants to pursue his almost clown-like approach to politics," he said"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mr Palmer responded: "Well, poor old Wyatt's still developing his personality."</seg>
<seg id="13">He's only a young boy that's never had a job in his life.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the ABC's 7.30 this week Mr Palmer denied he or his party would have a conflict of interest from his business interests.</seg>
<seg id="15">Members of Parliament are free to vote as they want on anything," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Palmer's Waratah Coal company claims the right to develop 105,000 hectares in Queensland's Galilee Basin, with plans to export 1.4 million tonnes of coal each year.</seg>
<seg id="17">The mine has been approved by the Queensland government but still needs to have its environmental impact statement approved by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="18">On another front, Mr Palmer's North Queensland nickel refinery was hit with a $6.2 million carbon tax bill in July by the federal government's Clean Energy Regulator for refusing to pay the carbon tax owed by the refinery.</seg>
<seg id="19">In September Mr Palmer said he and his Palmer United party would have no conflict of interest if he voted to abolish the carbon tax.</seg>

<seg id="1">Roy Choi serves up an appetizer with memoir 'L.A. Son'</seg>
<seg id="2">Several years ago, a cookbook editor friend called asking my advice on whether she should publish Jacques Pépin's autobiography.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pepin is one of my heroes in food, I told her, but I'd pass on the book - all chef biographies tend to follow the same story arc, there's not a lot new to be said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wisely she ignored me, and though "The Apprentice" turned out just as I predicted plot-wise, it was one of the bestselling cookbooks of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">I learned two lessons from that incident: I'm a lot better off as a second-guessing journalist, and when it comes to these autobiographies, plot is secondary to character.</seg>
<seg id="6">What brings this to mind is Roy Choi's new book, "L.A. Son: My Life."</seg>
<seg id="7">My City.</seg>
<seg id="8">My Food.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the surface, there is not much to connect Pépin and Choi.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pépin is the consummate old-school professional.</seg>
<seg id="11">Choi is the tattooed bad boy popularizer of the Korean taco and the food-truck craze, thanks to his Kogi truck.</seg>
<seg id="12">But while Pepin's autobiography was the epitome of the traditional chef's life, it may be that Choi's will be the same for the new generation - for those who choose a life in the kitchen (as an alternative to, say, joining a band) rather than being forced into it.</seg>
<seg id="13">"L.A. Son," co-written with Tien Nguyen and Natasha Phan, pops with Choi's hip-hop verbal rhythms - and the boy does like his F-bombs, even in the recipes (there are 60, nicely chosen but they're mainly footnotes to the main story).</seg>
<seg id="14">There are the familiar chef autobiography milestones here - starting with a primal scene rooted in Mom's cooking, which served as the family's emotional anchor after they emigrated from Korea.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the Chois ran a restaurant in Orange County for a time, and it is the afternoon break for family meal and the collective chore of stuffing dumplings that remains a touchstone for Choi throughout the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Writing about the difference between his mom's kitchen and those of his friends in the gated Orange County community of Villa Park (where his family bought Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan's house), Choi says: "Our house smelled like kimchi and sour soybean paste, not potpourri and potatoes."</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was okay by me: sometimes no matter how exciting a new trip can be, all you want to do is get back home, curl up with your own pillow, and sink into its comforting, familiar reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even if that reality consists of salted aged fish eggs and grilled pig intestines.</seg>
<seg id="19">But rather than apprenticing himself to a restaurant kitchen as the traditional model would have him do, Choi undertook an education of a different sort.</seg>
<seg id="20">As his parents scrambled from business to business, their hard work too often left him unsupervised, and the vacuum was filled by the predictable teenage temptations - drinking and drugging and gambling, the usual suburban bad-boy stuff told with the usual adolescent braggadocio.</seg>
<seg id="21">Of course, when things got really bad, Choi could escape back to his family's home in the mean cul-de-sacs of Coto de Caza.</seg>
<seg id="22">Because all of that scrambling did pay off, translating into a very comfortable parachute whenever he wound up in free fall.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was during one of those periods that Choi experienced his culinary epiphany - via the Food Network.</seg>
<seg id="24">He woke up on the couch, foggy as usual and convinced that Emeril Lagasse was speaking directly to him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Emeril Lagasse wasn't talking to the camera anymore.</seg>
<seg id="26">His eyes were looking straight at me like ----Mona Lisa.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was talking to me. ... And bam, just like that, I knew.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was my destiny.</seg>
<seg id="29">Whatever, it worked.</seg>
<seg id="30">Choi started attending a local cooking school, impressing his parents enough that they sent him to the Culinary Institute of America - as he puts it "The Harvard of cooking schools."</seg>
<seg id="31">From there, his ascent was rapid.</seg>
<seg id="32">A formative externship at seafood temple Le Bernardin and then progressively better jobs working for hotel chains, until he wound up as chef de cuisine at the Beverly Hilton.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps his rise was too rapid, though - when he wound up running RockSugar, the pan-Asian fusion restaurant put together by the Cheesecake Factory gang, he just didn't have the chops.</seg>
<seg id="34">He was fired and, desperate for work, agreed to help a friend with a harebrained experiment selling Korean tacos out of a food truck in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="35">And there the story ends, which is frustrating but kind of typical.</seg>
<seg id="36">Throughout the book, Choi tends to cut out just when things begin to turn interesting - or maybe when they cease to fit with his image of thug-life.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's too bad because Kogi was more than just a new way of cooking - sloppy and exuberant and about as far from professionally polished as possible.</seg>
<seg id="38">It was also a fairly revolutionary, much cheaper way for chefs to get into the food business.</seg>
<seg id="39">And it used all of the new social media bells and whistles better than anyone else has, even today, to create a sense of a movable communal happening.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would be fascinating to understand the mix of calculation and happenstance that led to that.</seg>
<seg id="41">Choi also leaves out his experience converting the Kogi popularity into traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants at Chego, A-Frame and Sunny Spot.</seg>
<seg id="42">What was the transition like from a one-truck operation to a multi-restaurant corporation?</seg>
<seg id="43">And of course it would be good to know how Choi adapted.</seg>
<seg id="44">Sure, he still affects the K-Town homeboy persona, with tats, baggies and a slightly glazed presence, but the reality is that he's a successful businessman, responsible for many employees.</seg>
<seg id="45">How does he reconcile the two?</seg>
<seg id="46">But maybe those are subjects for the next book.</seg>
<seg id="47">After all, Choi is young, and a chef's life is long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Parsons is The Times' food editor.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's an OCTOPUS UPRISING we need to worry about: Intelligent eight-tentacled animals could evolve to become even smarter</seg>
<seg id="3">Octopuses are highly intelligent, more so than any other invertebrates</seg>
<seg id="4">They can be trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns</seg>
<seg id="5">In some studies, they have been shown to practice observational learning</seg>
<seg id="6">Scientists says they may one day build structures other than simple shelters</seg>
<seg id="7">Last year, a thieving octopus foiled the efforts of marine researchers to investigate the feeding habits of sea life.</seg>
<seg id="8">The researchers dropped a bait cage into the waters of False Bay, Cape Town, as part of a survey of creatures living off the coast of South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="9">What they didn't count on was the invertebrate sneaking along and not only stealing the food, but also taking the entire cage itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">Octopuses are believed to be highly intelligent, more so than any other kind of invertebrates, claim scientists</seg>
<seg id="11">This is just one example of the incredible intelligence of these invertebrates, which scientists are discovering is far more advanced than we first thought.</seg>
<seg id="12">One scientist, speaking to Max Knoblauch from Pacific Standard, suggests that the creatures" intelligence could evolve much further with time.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Cephalopods clearly manipulate objects, they clearly use tools," Dr Russell Burke from Hofstra University in New York told the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="14">They don't build things, aside from shelters, but it's certainly imaginable that given the time, given some other factors, those kinds of things could happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Humans have long been fascinated with animal intelligence, as shown in the 2011 film 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'.</seg>
<seg id="16">And now, scientists are claiming some creatures could have much greater intelligence than first thought</seg>
<seg id="17">Octopuses are believed to be highly intelligent, more so than any other kind of invertebrates; but their learning capability is still much debated among biologists.</seg>
<seg id="18">The creatures have been known to break out of aquariums and into others in search of food, and they have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs stored inside.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are the only invertebrate which has been shown to use tools, with some species, as pictured above right, retrieving discarded coconut shells and reassembling them to use as shelter.</seg>
<seg id="20">In laboratory experiments they can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns.</seg>
<seg id="21">In several widely contested studies, they have even been shown to practise observational learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">In some countries, octopuses are on the list of experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anaesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="23">British animal testing laws regard them as 'honorary vertebrates', extending them protections not afforded to other invertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="24">As well as building shelters, maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence that the animals have a system that can store both short and long-term memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">Several widely contested studies also claim that they have even been shown to practice observational learning.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the UK, for instance, British animal testing laws regard them as 'honorary vertebrates', extending them protections not afforded to other invertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="27">Writing in The Conversation, Dr Clint Perry from Macquarie University in Australia argues that we need to stop thinking of humans as the apex of intellect.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Humans may not be as smart as we once thought," claims Dr Perry.</seg>
<seg id="29">More and more research is showing that the seemingly complicated logic and intellect we routinely use to solve problems relies heavily on short cuts known as heuristics.</seg>
<seg id="30">Put simply, this comes very close to what we consider instincts.</seg>
<seg id="31">So could this mean that creatures like the octopus will one day have more intelligence that humans?</seg>
<seg id="32">"The reality is intelligence is a complex concept, difficult to define and hard not to base around our own abilities," said Dr Perry.</seg>
<seg id="33">We should remind ourselves that we are animals living in a world with other animals.</seg>
<seg id="34">All species are of course different from each other.</seg>
<seg id="35">But we're really not so dissimilar.</seg>
<seg id="36">In some countries, octopuses are on the list of experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anaesthesia</seg>

<seg id="2">Fri Nov 1, 2013 1:33am EDT</seg>
<seg id="3">(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday reinstated a Texas abortion restriction that was blocked by a lower court this week, allowing nearly all of the state's sweeping anti-abortion law to go into effect.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals means doctors who perform abortions in Texas must have admitting privileges with local hospitals within 30 miles of their clinic, according to court documents.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Texas law passed in July was the most fiercely debated proposal to restrict abortions in the United States this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This new ruling represents a huge pro-life victory," said the Texas Alliance For Life in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Appeals Court overturned U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel's ruling on Monday, a day before the law was due to go into effect, that a section of the measure pertaining to admitting privileges was unconstitutional after supporters said it would force clinics to close.</seg>
<seg id="8">This fight is far from over.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion statewide," said Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the family planning and reproductive health group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Supporters of the right to abortion have warned that the reinstated measure could force up to one third of the state's clinics to close immediately, cutting off access for some 22,000 women, because those clinics have not been able to gain admitting privileges for their physicians since the law passed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whole Woman's Health will close three of its five facilities in Texas on Friday because of the ruling, according to Amy Hagstrom Miller, the organization's founder and CEO, who spoke on the Rachel Maddow Show on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Just this evening, we had to call all our patients and cancel their appointments for tomorrow," Miller said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Doctors do not have the required admitting privileges at the three clinics located in Fort Worth, San Antonio and McAllen.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas said in a statement on Thursday that its "doors are still open."</seg>
<seg id="15">Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is running for Texas governor, had asked the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Yeakel's ruling and requested a full court hearing on the issue in January.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="17">The appeals court granted Abbott a hearing on the issue in January.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the court let stand Yeakel's ruling that blocks the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's abortion pill protocol for women who are 50 to 63 days pregnant if a doctor determines a surgical abortion is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2012, another federal judge in Austin struck down the state's law requiring women to get a transvaginal ultrasound before abortions.</seg>
<seg id="20">An appeals court reversed that decision and the ultrasound requirement has gone into effect.</seg>
<seg id="21">Earlier this week, Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports the right to abortion, said nine states, including Texas, passed laws requiring doctors to have admitting privileges, but they are in effect only in Kansas, Tennessee and Utah.</seg>
<seg id="22">Laws were blocked by courts in four other states and have not yet taken effect in Arizona, Nash said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some 18 states, including Texas, have enacted laws restricting drug-induced abortions or holding them to the stricter federal guideline, Nash said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such laws have gone into effect in 14 states, but have been blocked by legal action in North Dakota, Wisconsin and Oklahoma, and are being challenged in Iowa, she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Hidden Meaning of Films, Take 2</seg>
<seg id="2">"The Pervert's Guide to Ideology," Sophie Fiennes's second collaboration with the public intellectual Slavoj Zizek, sets out a daunting task.</seg>
<seg id="3">Titling a film that way, even tongue in cheek, recalls the Monty Python sketch about summarizing Proust, only with an even broader remit.</seg>
<seg id="4">Less dynamically than in this film's predecessor, "The Pervert's Guide to Cinema," Mr. Zizek again harvests insights and subtexts in movies, with a bit of current events thrown in.</seg>
<seg id="5">He performs - with harangues, halting delivery and a deadeyed stare - in sumptuously designed and shot sets that evoke "The Sound of Music," "Taxi Driver," "Jaws" and other golden oldies of critical interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="6">He even dons costumes and adopts poses from the films, commenting from within his chosen text.</seg>
<seg id="7">The false freedoms and insidious ubiquity of ideological systems drive much of the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Zizek's daisy-chained improvisations amount to an argument on behalf of complexity and unseen depths, and, like much academic writing, it risks monotony and becoming as reductive as it can be seductive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Zizek also has a frustrating tendency to dead-end into jargon or sidestep at pivotal moments.</seg>
<seg id="10">He speaks the truth much of the time, yet all the whipping back of the curtain ends up covering up other realities about movies and life.</seg>
<seg id="11">But maybe I'm just being a casualty of ideology.</seg>

<seg id="3">BON Jovi are rewarding loyal Australian fans with a discounted $35 ticket for their summer stadium tour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Promoter Paul Dainty said Jon Bon Jovi insisted that "thousands" of the cheaper tickets be made available for the outdoor concerts in December so fans struggling to make ends meet could still enjoy the state-of-the-art rock show."</seg>
<seg id="5">""The band did the same thing when they announced their European dates and got a huge reaction," Mr Dainty said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Everyone is suffering a bit from the economic doom and gloom perceptions and the band want to help out, give people a great start to their Christmas celebrations.""</seg>
<seg id="7">The other pricing packages are still being finalised but the $35 tickets are expected to be snapped up quickly when they go on sale on May 20.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Jon Bon Jovi has insisted that "thousands" of the cheaper tickets be made available for so fans struggling to make ends meet can enjoy the band's show.</seg>
<seg id="9">Picture: David Bergman</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Dainty said they won't just be nosebleed seats, with some equivalent to the $160 seats at the Eminem concerts held at similar venues in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is important to point out that there will be regular ticket prices as well but there will be thousands of these tickets dotted around the stadium and available to the general public," he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Dainty believes other artists and promoters in Australia will follow Bon Jovi's lead on their Because We Can tour this year both to sell out concerts quickly and give music fans greater choice.</seg>
<seg id="13">Australians have historically paid more than American and European music fans due to the high costs of freighting big productions here and the fluctuating fortunes of the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bon Jovi's $35 tickets are expected to be snapped up quickly when they go on sale on May 20.</seg>
<seg id="15">Concertgoers were also forced to adopt tiered ticket pricing - more expensive for the front rows and meet-and-greet packages, slightly less for the back rows - when promoters sought to offset their costs in the past two decades.</seg>
<seg id="16">But artists are leading the charge towards a lower-priced ticket so all fans have a chance to see them live.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lady Gaga offered her Little Monsters an $80 ticket, One Direction's cheapest seat was $72 and The Janoskians are charging $40 plus booking fees for their upcoming national tour.</seg>
<seg id="18">""I think we will see more of it because ticket pricing has become an important issue," Mr Dainty said.</seg>
<seg id="19">When you have a band like Bon Jovi, who had the highest grossing tour in the world in 2010, doing this, others will naturally try to emulate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">""We are announcing this from day 1, not late in the day because we still have tickets up the back."</seg>
<seg id="21">General public tickets go on sale from noon on May 20.</seg>
<seg id="22">Richie Sambora has taken a sabbatical from the band's world tour and it is not known if he will rejoin them for the Australian leg.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bon Jovi perform at Etihad Stadium, Melbourne on December 7, AAMI Stadium, Adelaide, December 11, ANZ Stadium, Sydney on December 14 and Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane on December 17.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.</seg>
<seg id="11">A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy," Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.</seg>
<seg id="13">"No," Mr Tripodi replied.</seg>
<seg id="14">I can't remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn't that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pentagon training manual: white males have unfair advantages</seg>
<seg id="2">A controversial 600-plus page manual used by the military to train its Equal Opportunity officers teaches that "healthy, white, heterosexual, Christian" men hold an unfair advantage over other races, and warns in great detail about a so-called "White Male Club."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Simply put, a healthy, white, heterosexual, Christian male receives many unearned advantages of social privilege, whereas a black, homosexual, atheist female in poor health receives many unearned disadvantages of social privilege," reads a statement in the manual created by the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI).</seg>
<seg id="4">The manual, which was obtained by Fox News, also instructs troops to "support the leadership of people of color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Do this consistently, but not uncritically," the manual states.</seg>
<seg id="6">The military manual goes into great detail about a so-called "White Male Club."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Equal Opportunity Advisor Student Guide is the textbook used during a three month DEOMI course taught at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="8">Individuals who attend the training lead Equal Opportunity briefings on military installations around the nation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 637-page manual covers a wide range of issues from racism and religious diversity to cultural awareness, extremism and white privilege.</seg>
<seg id="10">I obtained a copy of the manual from an Equal Opportunity officer who was disturbed by the course content and furious over the DEOMI's reliance on the Southern Poverty Law Center for information on "extremist" groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I'm participating in teaching things that are not true," the instructor told me.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked not to be identified because he feared reprisals.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I should not be in a position to do that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">It violates Constitutional principles, but it also violates my conscience.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I'm not going to do it - not going to do it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Read an excerpt from the manual here.</seg>
<seg id="17">DEOMI instructors were also responsible for briefings at bases around the country that falsely labeled evangelical Christians, Catholics and a number of high-profile Christian ministries as domestic hate groups.</seg>
<seg id="18">I contacted the Pentagon as well as the DEOMI multiple times for comment on this story, but so far they have not responded to my requests.</seg>
<seg id="19">DEOMI opened in 1971 in response to the civil rights movement.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's responsible for Equal Opportunity/Equal Employment Opportunity education and training for military active duty and reservists, according to its website.</seg>
<seg id="21">The subject of white privilege emerged in a 20-page section titled, "Power and Privilege."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Whites are the empowered group," the manual declares.</seg>
<seg id="23">White males represent the haves as compared to the have-nots.</seg>
<seg id="24">The military document advises personnel to "assume racism is everywhere, every day" and "notice code words for race."</seg>
<seg id="25">They are also instructed to "understand and learn from the history of whiteness and racism."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Assume racism is everywhere, everyday," read a statement in a section titled, "How to be a strong 'white ally.'""</seg>
<seg id="27">""One of the privileges of being white is not having to see or deal with racism all the time," the manual states."</seg>
<seg id="28">""We have to learn to see the effect that racism has.""</seg>
<seg id="29">"On page 181 of the manual, the military points out that status and wealth are typically passed from generation to generation and "represent classic examples of the unearned advantages of social privilege.""</seg>
<seg id="30">""As such, the unfair economic advantages and disadvantages created long ago by institutions for whites, males, Christians, etc. still affect socioeconomic privilege today," the manual states."</seg>
<seg id="31">The guide also points out that whites are over-represented and blacks are underrepresented in positive news stories, that middle class blacks live in poorer neighborhoods than middle class whites and that even though there are more white criminals than any other race, the news coverage of black criminals is about equal to the news coverage of white criminals.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The military manual goes into great detail about a so-called "White Male Club.""</seg>
<seg id="33">""In spite of slave insurrections, civil war, the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, the women's suffrage movement leading to the 19th amendment, the civil rights movement, urban rebellions and the contemporary feminist movement, the club persists," the document states.</seg>
<seg id="34">DEOMI states that "full access to the resources of the club still escape the vision of equitable distribution."</seg>
<seg id="35">The military also implies that white Americans may be in denial about racism.</seg>
<seg id="36">In a section titled, "Rationalizations for Retaining Privilege and Avoiding Responsibilities," the military lays out excuses white people use.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Today some white people may use the tactic of denial when they say, "It's a level playing field; this is a land of equal opportunity,"" the manual reads.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some white people may be counterattacking today by saying political correctness rules the universities or they want special status.</seg>
<seg id="39">DEOMI points out that if "white people are unable to maintain that the atrocities are all in the past, they may switch to tactics to make a current situation seem isolated."</seg>
<seg id="40">They said some of the ways whites may claim to be victims include saying things like, "I have it just as bad as anyone else," "They're taking away our jobs," or "White people are under attack."</seg>
<seg id="41">The military concludes the section by urging students to "understand and learn from the history of whiteness and racism" and "support the leadership of people of color."</seg>
<seg id="42">I called former Congressman and Lt. Col. Allen West (ret.) to get his take on the manual.</seg>
<seg id="43">In a nutshell - he wants a congressional investigation.</seg>
<seg id="44">"This is the Obama administration's outreach of social justice into the United States military," he told me.</seg>
<seg id="45">Equal Opportunity in the Army that I grew up in did not have anything to do with white privilege.</seg>
<seg id="46">West said he is very concerned about the training guide.</seg>
<seg id="47">"When the president talked about fundamentally transforming the United States of America, I believe he also had a dedicated agenda of going after the United States military," he said.</seg>
<seg id="48">The priorities of this administration are totally whacked.</seg>
<seg id="49">West said the DEOMI manual reminded him of a similar program inflicted on the military by President Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="50">"They came down with a new training requirement called, "Consideration of Others Training,"" he said.</seg>
<seg id="51">The soldiers were supposed to sit around and go through vignettes and talk about their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="52">I truly wish the Pentagon and the DEOMI would return my telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="53">I'd like to know how teaching soldiers, airmen and sailors about white privilege and fomenting racial division helps them protect our nation from the enemy.</seg>

<seg id="1">French King Henry IV's head stars in forensic dispute</seg>
<seg id="2">Doubt - and a reportedly royal severed head - haunts a murky corner of forensic science these days, as researchers squabble over an unearthed packet of mummified remains thought to have belonged to King Henry IV of France.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mystery has produced a frightful case of regret among two researchers who were part of the first team to investigate the purportedly royal noggin.</seg>
<seg id="4">This week, French pathologist Geoffroy Lorin de la Grandmaison and Leslie Eisenberg, an American forensic anthropologist, wrote to the British Medical Journal and urged the retraction of the 2010 study that first identified the disembodied head as belonging to Henry.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the heart of the macabre drama is an embalmed head with several vertebrae still attached.</seg>
<seg id="6">The remains were found in 1919 in the Royal Basilica of St. Denis outside Paris and reportedly secreted away by a civil servant.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reappearing almost a century later, the specimen still had its soft tissue and organs intact, right down to the open mouth and partially closed eyes.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the basis of CT imaging and digital facial reconstruction, French medical examiner and forensic osteo-archaeologist Philippe Charlier and a multidisciplinary team - including Eisenberg and Lorin de la Grandmaison - in 2010 identified the head as that of the charming and rakish monarch known variously as "the Green Gallant" and "Good King Henry."</seg>
<seg id="9">Even a mushroom-like growth on his nose and evidence of a pierced right ear seemed to point to King Henry IV.</seg>
<seg id="10">Though beloved by most of his people, the Bourbon monarch was assassinated in 1610 after 21 years on the throne.</seg>
<seg id="11">That was just the beginning of his misfortune.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 1793, marauding revolutionaries sacked Paris' churches and desecrated the graves of many a purported royal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Legend had it that Henry's remains got the same treatment that befell his descendant Louis XVI: Dead or not, it was off with his head.</seg>
<seg id="14">But researchers from the University of Leuven in Belgium were not so sure the head belonged to Good King Henry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Obtaining a sample of the mummified tissue, they conducted a genetic analysis and compared it with DNA samples given by three male descendants of the House of Bourbon.</seg>
<seg id="16">Analyzing the Y chromosome of the three descendants, as well as genes that reveal matrilineal descent, they found clear similarities among the three descendants.</seg>
<seg id="17">But none of those matched the DNA of the disembodied head.</seg>
<seg id="18">The team further compared the Y chromosome taken from the mysterious head with that taken from a blood-soaked handkerchief said to contain the genetic material of Louis XVI.</seg>
<seg id="19">(That "sample" was collected on Jan.</seg>
<seg id="20">21, 1793, when a spectator at La Place de la Revolution in Paris thrust out the cloth to capture blood gushing from Louis' headless body.)</seg>
<seg id="21">The two samples did not match.</seg>
<seg id="22">Though widely used in genealogical research, paternity testing and forensics, the Y chromosome's pattern of repeated DNA letters is not as definitive a test of genetic relatedness as are the patterns found on other chromosomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">So perhaps this still was Henry's head?</seg>
<seg id="24">"Impossible!" declared Jean-Jacques Cassiman, an emeritus professor at the University of Leuven and coauthor of the Belgian team's study, whose results were published in the European Journal of Human Genetics this month.</seg>
<seg id="25">The findings came on top of an earlier dismissal by French historian Philippe Delorme.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among other things, Delorme noted that the head bore no sign of craniotomy, as would be typical for a member of the royal family at that time.</seg>
<seg id="27">In such an esteemed person, craniotomy incisions would have been made in life (as a treatment for infection, head trauma and other ills) and in death (as a means to harvest "rondels," diskettes of bony tissue that were subsequently worn around the neck as an amulet).</seg>
<seg id="28">Charlier, the lead investigator of the 2010 study, has been stout in defense of his findings.</seg>
<seg id="29">Illegitimacy - not of his methods but among many princelings of the French court - may explain the genetic mismatch, Charlier has argued.</seg>
<seg id="30">Extramarital liaisons among members of the court make it "hopeless," he said, to ascertain lineage using DNA tests over so many generations.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such protests have failed to discourage defections from Charlier's team of researchers.</seg>
<seg id="32">Hence this week's letter by two of Charlier's coauthors and two others who have challenged the 2010 findings, saying that "robust scientific arguments ... negate the conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"The retraction of the article is now justified, as a rigorous scientific anthropological study should have excluded the hypothesis (and the findings) that the head belonged to" Henry, the four wrote.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nailing down the identity of long-lost bones is tricky, and disputes among forensic scientists are common, said Alison Galloway, a forensic anthropologist at UC Santa Cruz who has followed, but not been involved in, the royal kerfuffle.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The original analysis looked good," Galloway said.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Charlier's team should have known that its conclusions would be challenged, she said.</seg>
<seg id="37">"If you had a group of 100 skulls - all men of European ancestry, let's say - and you had a photograph of a person, about 10 of those skulls could superimpose pretty well on that photograph," she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Although facial reconstruction makes for great visuals in a TV drama, "it's a technique much better used to exclude somebody" than to identify him definitively.</seg>
<seg id="39">With grieving relatives, criminal defendants and judges looking on, forensic scientists typically stick with conclusions that will hold up in a court of law.</seg>
<seg id="40">Only rarely do their disputes become the object of royal speculation and historical ghost stories.</seg>
<seg id="41">Charlier's investigation, and the ensuing fracas, may be more of a divertissement than a serious professional debate, Galloway said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Why are we so worried about whether it's Henry's head?</seg>

<seg id="1">Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the association with the European Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The prime minister of Ukraine Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will significantly decrease after the country signs the association agreement with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="3">He stated this while chatting with readers of his page on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="4">I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which are, among others, customs payments.</seg>
<seg id="5">So, after the signing of the agreement and the enactment of the provision on the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will significantly decrease.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this will mean that prices should also decrease.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is in respect to goods that come from countries of the EU," wrote Azarov.</seg>
<seg id="8">In respect to other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="9">But, nevertheless, there should not be an increase in prices there either.</seg>
<seg id="10">Therefore, the messages on billboards that have recently appeared in our country quite a lot, saying the association with the EU is a rise in prices, this is not entirely true, or if we speak more accurately - entirely not true," summarized Azarov.</seg>

<seg id="1">Review: Audi A8 sets the pace</seg>
<seg id="2">THE A8 is one of the three main pillars of the large luxury car market, and you don't get to that monumental elevation without deserving it.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the updated version of a car that's been in service since 2010, with efficiency improvements to the engines, eye-opening new technology and a little bit more of what makes the A8 a customer favourite.</seg>
<seg id="4">The range takes roughly the same shape, with standard and long-wheelbase chassis options linked to diesel, petrol and petrol-electric hybrid drive-trains.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only the hybrid lacks quattro four-wheel drive, and every model gets the magnificent ZF eight-speed automatic gearbox as standard.</seg>
<seg id="6">But which engine to choose?</seg>
<seg id="7">Now that's a pickle.</seg>
<seg id="8">The flagship is technically the 500-horsepower W12, but since that's expected to make up just 0.4 per cent of sales in the UK, you can probably look right past that one.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 4.0-litre V8 petrol features twice, in the spookily quiet 4.0 TFSI, and then again in combination with a thunderous exhaust in the rumbling, 513bhp S8.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both are superb in their own ways, but the former is the more understated.</seg>
<seg id="11">You could also try the monstrous 4.2-litre V8 TDI diesel, a unique format of engine among Audi's group of rivals.</seg>
<seg id="12">One touch on the accelerator is all it takes to feel its epic accelerative appeal, and it's also as quiet as a sleeping church mouse.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the most popular engine is likely to be the 3.0 TDI, so let's hop behind the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's neither the quietest nor the most muscular engine in the range, and in fairness the only ace it holds over the other choices is fuel economy and CO2 ratings, but it still does everything well enough to seem like a flawlessly logical choice.</seg>
<seg id="15">Don't drive any of the others and you'll never need to wish you'd spent the extra...</seg>
<seg id="16">In typical press-car style, the A8 I'm sitting in is decked out with a handsome spread of options that enhance the car in all the key areas, but very few A8s have been sold completely as standard in recent years so it's fair play.</seg>
<seg id="17">The interior materials are straight from the top drawer's top drawer, and there's also a quirky new selection of manufacturing methods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Strawberry leaves, for example, are one of the natural ingredients Audi has used to tan certain leathers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The leather itself is also a new development.</seg>
<seg id="20">Technology is vital to a car in this segment and, crucially, it has to be both effective and easy to use, which is no mean feat for a car with more processing capability than most home computers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Several features stand out, though, like the MatrixBeam LED headlights that automatically detect other cars and dim the LEDs that cast light towards them.</seg>
<seg id="22">The system can create eight separate gaps in its impressive spread of light, which is more than enough for everyday situations, and it allows the A8 to stay on main beam without dazzling anyone.</seg>
<seg id="23">But one of the car's best features is one of its most traditional.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's an incredibly quiet environment at almost all times, with road noise never rising above a low hum.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sounds of wind and tyre roar are perceptible, but barely so.</seg>
<seg id="26">Maybe it's down to the A8"s size, but the Dynamic Ride Control on this model seems to have a greater effect than on many of the firm's other cars.</seg>
<seg id="27">The incredibly firm Dynamic mode is probably best avoided on UK roads, but Comfort is perfect for the A8, while Efficiency changes gear much earlier than normal to help conserve fuel.</seg>
<seg id="28">The evidently revised calibration works a treat.</seg>
<seg id="29">All the luxury options previously present in the car remain, including an extravagant reclining rear seat that combines with a forward-folding front passenger seat which gives extra leg room and onto which a footrest is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's nice to have a stretch while your chauffeur does his thing...</seg>
<seg id="31">Many things can go unsaid here, because the A8 is at least as brisk, stable and comfortable as it has ever been.And, now that it's cheaper to run, along with its cutting-edge materials and technology, it's an option that's hard to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="32">CAR Audi A8 SE Executive V6 3.0 TDI quattro</seg>
<seg id="33">PERFORMANCE Top speed 155mph, 0-62mph in 5.9 seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Foreign workers on 457 visas could undergo "genuineness" test</seg>
<seg id="2">A "genuineness" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown.</seg>
<seg id="3">The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the "genuineness" criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about "whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."</seg>
<seg id="10">Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">The man's distraught nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comforted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the vessel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Toronto Mayor Rob Ford refuses to resign over 'drug video'</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 01:18</seg>
<seg id="3">Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has refused to quit after police said they recovered a video appearing to show him smoking from a crack pipe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Ford, who has denied smoking crack, said he had "no reason" to resign.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police have not gone into detail about the content of the mobile-phone footage but say it is consistent with previous media descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="6">The saga has captivated the city since reports surfaced in May of the video's existence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The video, first brought to light by journalists who reported seeing it, has never been released publicly.</seg>
<seg id="8">Earlier, Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair told media of the video they had recovered from a computer hard drive, the contents of which he said "contained video images which appear to be those video images previously reported in the press."</seg>
<seg id="9">Police have not filed criminal charges against Mayor Ford in connection with the video.</seg>
<seg id="10">Disappointed</seg>
<seg id="11">"There is nothing on that video that would support the laying of criminal charges," Mr Blair said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he added it was an "issue of significant public concern and... a problem for the city."</seg>
<seg id="13">He said he was "disappointed" by the video's contents.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Ford told a gaggle of reporters outside his office on Thursday following the police statement that he wished "I could come out and defend myself."</seg>
<seg id="15">Unfortunately I can't because it's before the courts, and that's all I can say right now...</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have no reason to resign," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">In May the Toronto Star newspaper said it had been approached by drug dealers trying to sell the video; two of its reporters viewed the video, but the organisation declined to pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="18">A Gawker journalist also reported seeing the video and the organisation raised more than $200,000 in an online campaign to buy it, before being told by a source the video was "gone."</seg>
<seg id="19">A photo depicting Mr Ford with two young men, which Gawker said they were given by the drug dealer selling the video, became notorious when it emerged that one of the men, Anthony Smith, had been shot dead on a Toronto street.</seg>
<seg id="20">Two men are facing murder charges in that case.</seg>
<seg id="21">Driver charged</seg>
<seg id="22">Reports of the mystery video's existence triggered a massive police investigation into the mayor and his associates, specifically a friend and occasional driver named Alexander "Sandro" Lisi.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Lisi has since been charged with marijuana trafficking and possession.</seg>
<seg id="24">Police said on Thursday that he now faced a charge of extortion in relation to the video.</seg>
<seg id="25">Documents released on Thursday also revealed a lengthy police surveillance operation against Mr Ford, with officers going through his rubbish and monitoring late-night meetings between Mr Ford and Mr Lisi.</seg>
<seg id="26">The documents were released by court order on Thursday after petitioning by leading Canadian media outlets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several of Mr Ford's aides have resigned and his chief of staff was sacked in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some were interviewed by police in the case.</seg>
<seg id="29">Divisive figure</seg>
<seg id="30">The case has riveted the city and its suburbs of just under six million people, Canada's largest.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Ford and his brother Doug, also a city councillor, have become divisive figures.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Ford was elected in 2010 on a tough economic platform in which he promised to rein in spending and end the influence of special-interest groups.</seg>
<seg id="33">His term in office has been plagued with allegations of substance abuse and regular confrontations with media, whom he accuses of organising a witch-hunt.</seg>
<seg id="34">He also narrowly escaped being removed from office in a conflict of interest case.</seg>
<seg id="35">But he has drawn public sympathy with his folksy image and a very public battle with his weight.</seg>
<seg id="36">Before Thursday's revelations, Mr Ford had pledged to run for re-election next year.</seg>
<seg id="37">He refused to comment to reporters at his home early on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">NHS couple received £1 million payoff before being given new management jobs</seg>
<seg id="2">Her husband Chris Reed, 57, who was chief executive of the NHS North of Tyne PCT, also received a redundancy payout of £345,000 when his organisation was abolished in the same month, it is believed.</seg>
<seg id="3">In June both were taken on by the troubled Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, where he took the role of interim chief executive and she was employed as the recovery director.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their salary arrangements are not known, and both have left the trust in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the couple, or by any of those who have received redundancy payouts.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the figures were revealed Labour blamed the Coalition for wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds replacing statutory bodies with 211 new clinical commissioning groups, but ministers claim they were forced into the decision by "lax contracts" drawn up by the previous government.</seg>
<seg id="7">Andy Burnham, the shadow Health Secretary, described it as a "scandalous abuse of precious NHS resources."</seg>
<seg id="8">Adding: " (Cameron) has given gold-plated, six figure payoffs to thousands of managers while handing P45s to 6,000 nurses."</seg>
<seg id="9">Dan Poulter, the Conservative Health Minister, blamed the costs on "dismantling Labour's bloated bureaucracy."</seg>
<seg id="10">The NHS restructuring reforms came into effect in April.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bodies which had been responsible for buying services for the NHS ceased to exist, meaning all staff were made redundant.</seg>
<seg id="12">The statutory bodies were replaced by GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups.</seg>
<seg id="13">The National Audit Office estimated that 10,000 people had lost their jobs at a total cost of £430 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their report in July found that more one in five of NHS staff made redundant as part of the Government's reforms had been re-employed by the health service.</seg>
<seg id="15">The NAO estimated that 44 very senior managers were made redundant at an average cost of £277,273.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, new figures released by the Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities yesterday, suggests that more than 50 staff received in excess of £100,000.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers" Alliance, said that the public would be "appalled" that the "golden goodbyes ran to six figures," especially for those walking into another public sector job.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yasmin Chaudhry, who was given a redundancy payout of £330,000 when she left her job as joint chief executive of Durham PCT, is now employed on contract at the NHS Trust Development Authority, which improves hospital leadership in troubled trusts.</seg>
<seg id="19">A spokesman for the trust said that she was had agreed to work for them for a year, including five months unpaid.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sir Neil McKay, paid £415,000 when he was made redundant as chief executive of NHS East of England, is now chairman of the Greater Manchester Cancer Services Provider Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, he has chosen to forgo a salary.</seg>
<seg id="22">Staff are entitled to seek re-employment in the NHS four weeks after they are made redundant.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a letter circulated as the statutory bodies were abolished, Sir David Nicholson, the then Chief Executive of the NHS, wrote to senior staff urging them not to take large payoffs then quickly seek new jobs in the health service.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Department of Health did not respond to a request to comment last night.</seg>

<seg id="2">Blues forward Chris Yarran outruns Eagles defender Adam Selwood.</seg>
<seg id="3">WEST Coast defender Jacob Brennan rates Carlton's Chris Yarran and Jeff Garlett as the fastest forward duo running around in the AFL.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yarran and Garlett exposed the Eagles for pace in Saturday night's 24-point win in Perth, with veteran Eagle Adam Selwood copping the brunt of the onslaught.</seg>
<seg id="5">On two occasions Selwood tried to chase down Yarran, only for the 22-year-old Blue to burn off his rival with three running bounces before kicking a goal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yarran, who finished with four goals, has played predominantly in defence over the past few years, but is currently being used in attack to cover for the absence of fellow speedster Eddie Betts (broken jaw).</seg>
<seg id="7">Brennan said there was no stopping Yarran and Garlett once they found space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They're the quickest by far that I've played against, for sure," Brennan said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early body-work is the key to try to prevent them from getting those easy runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Once they're up and going, they're pretty hard to run down.</seg>
<seg id="11">I felt for Adam, but I was on the receiving end a couple of times myself just trying to chase them down.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a tough gig.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, Eagles forward Ashton Hams has again denied he's a ducker, saying his knack of earning frees for high contact is more to do with his short stature rather than any tactical aspect.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hams, who stands at just 174cm, was booed by Melbourne supporters in round three after getting a controversial free kick for high contact.</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm spewing.</seg>
<seg id="16">I used to support Melbourne and now they're booing me, so I wasn't real happy about that," he said with a smile.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that's football.</seg>
<seg id="18">I find it quite funny.</seg>
<seg id="19">I love getting a bit of crap and giving a bit back.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's good fun.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons</seg>
<seg id="2">Syria destroyed all declared capacities for production of chemical weapons, acknowledged the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</seg>
<seg id="3">This first phase of disarmament Damascus completed the day before the established deadline.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before November 1 Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for preparing chemical warfare agents for use, reports the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="5">Destruction of the stocks of poisonous substances themselves or their chemical components must be completed by the middle of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to a representative of OPCW, currently the poisonous agents are located in sealed depots.</seg>
<seg id="7">International inspectors headed to Syria after, according to the U.S., more than 1,400 people died during a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main objective of the inspectors was to not lose time - in order to not allow Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and loading ammunition.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now they will attentively observe these production capacities in order to not allow their repair.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next milestone - mid-November: by that time the OPCW and Syrians must agree to a detailed plan for destroying the already existing stocks of poisonous substances.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are many questions here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Where will they be destroyed?</seg>
<seg id="13">Who will provide equipment for this?</seg>
<seg id="14">All Syrian declarations will be thoroughly checked by western intelligence agencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will readily recommend to the inspectors new facilities for inspection if there will be reasons to suspect that Damascus is not fully forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="16">The U.S. believes that this bombardment was conducted by regular troops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Syria and Russia insist that it is the work of Syrian rebels.</seg>
<seg id="18">The world community required from Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement achieved through the mediation of Russia, - to destroy or disable all capacities for the production of rounds, poisonous gases and liquids and for loading rounds with those substances.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when this phase is over, the next step must be to destroy the chemical weapons already existing in the Syrian army.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is assumed that in this arsenal may be more than 1,000 tons of neuroparalytic poisonous substances, skin blistering mustard gas and other banned chemical substances stored in several dozen different places.</seg>
<seg id="21">For its destruction it is essential that the OPCW and Syrian authorities for a start agree on a schedule of actions - two weeks are allocated for this.</seg>
<seg id="22">The supervisor of field operations of the OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally observed the destruction of equipment".</seg>
<seg id="23">"They now have no capability to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The statement of the OPCW says that inspectors visited 21 of 23 facilities in Syria and made sure that factories producing rounds and poisonous substances either were destroyed or disabled.</seg>
<seg id="25">The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct an inspection there, it says in the document, but the equipment from there was transported and inspected by OPCW specialists.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "especially difficult" since it was necessary to work under conditions of an ongoing conflict.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the beginning of October the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, so far inspectors found no time to celebrate this - they were too busy with work.</seg>

<seg id="1">The concept of an 'untethered' office takes root</seg>
<seg id="2">When he heard about a shake-up at company headquarters, Mark Sprague got a knot in the pit of his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="3">It wasn't his executive job that was at stake at the international real estate brokerage CBRE Group Inc.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was his spacious office of 11 years, his cherished file cabinets and his trophies.</seg>
<seg id="5">They all had to go.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sprague and everyone else in the company's 200-person office were given no choice by management.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone was to be part of an experiment to create the company's first completely "untethered" office in the United States where employees roam freely.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the airy complex on the top two floors of a Bunker Hill tower, there are no assigned desks or offices.</seg>
<seg id="9">Workers doing similar tasks can join their peers in a "neighborhood" or plop down on a modernist couch.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even Chief Executive Robert Sulentic books an office by the day and shed many of his possessions as part of the big move last month.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No family pictures, no tokens, no nothing that is mine," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Improvements in technology have made framed photos outmoded.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I have lots of family pictures on my iPhone," Sulentic said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Five years ago we didn't have that.</seg>
<seg id="15">When the boss leaves the office at night, he takes everything to an assigned locker or home in a briefcase.</seg>
<seg id="16">The firm's goal was to reduce rent costs by using its office space more efficiently and to create a template for other CBRE offices around the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it worked, company officials figured, the downtown L.A. office would also be an example for other conservative white-collar firms pondering how to reorganize their workplaces to make them more efficient and appealing to young employees weaned on wireless technology.</seg>
<seg id="18">Corporations have experimented for years with office-sharing concepts such as "hoteling," where workers such as accountants who travel frequently "check in" to a desk when they are in the office.</seg>
<seg id="19">But examples of conventional white-collar offices where no one has an assigned desk are rare enough in the U.S. that CBRE had to look to its outposts in Europe for ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">After touring CBRE offices in Amsterdam, the company's head of operations in Los Angeles and Orange counties, Lew Horne, decided to make what workplace consultants call a "free address" office in downtown L.A.</seg>
<seg id="21">That meant everyone, including senior workers and newly hired assistants, would have to give up their private turf.</seg>
<seg id="22">As Horne was pushing the plan forward over the objections of Sprague and others, the company's top management decided to take part in the experiment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Headquarters of the Fortune 500 firm were moved from the Westside to the downtown Los Angeles office.</seg>
<seg id="24">Individual mobility and the office's large common areas almost force employees to interact with one another and work together more effectively, Sulentic said.</seg>
<seg id="25">People get used to communicating aggressively and openly with each other.</seg>
<seg id="26">The office makeover was overseen by Laura O'Brien, head of the company's Workplace Strategies Group.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of her challenges was getting people ready to move by making them scan paper records into a computer or toss them straight into a recycling bin.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We threw out 900,000 pieces of paper," she estimated.</seg>
<seg id="29">Each employee is now supposed to have no more than one file drawer for storing paper documents.</seg>
<seg id="30">Desktop computers were replaced with laptops that can be stored in lockers in the new office.</seg>
<seg id="31">Upon arriving, employees collect their telephone headsets, laptops and key files.</seg>
<seg id="32">They then head to one of 10 "neighborhoods" where employees doing similar tasks such as legal work or property management cluster.</seg>
<seg id="33">Or they can set up in the heart of the office near the front door that looks like a cross between an upscale hotel lobby and a coffee bar.</seg>
<seg id="34">Workstations have telephones, keyboards and monitors that employees plug into, and they can sit, stand or even walk on a treadmill while they work.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are media-equipped conference rooms for meetings and small booths for making private phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="36">"More choice makes the office more energetic," O'Brien said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Researchers model familial amyloidosis in vitro using iPSC technology</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 - Researchers from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and Boston Medical Center (BMC) have generated the first known disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from a patient with familial transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR).</seg>
<seg id="3">The findings, which are reported in Stem Cell Reports, may lead to new treatments for genetic diseases such as familial amyloidosis.</seg>
<seg id="4">iPSCs are a form of stem cells that come from skin or blood cells reprogrammed into cells that have the ability to become any type of tissue in the body.</seg>
<seg id="5">ATTR is a lethal, autosomal dominant protein-folding disorder caused by one of more than 100 distinct mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene.</seg>
<seg id="6">In ATTR, protein secreted from the liver aggregates and forms fibrils in target organs, chiefly the heart and peripheral nervous system, highlighting the need for a model capable of duplicating the multisystem complexity of this clinically variable disease.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to researchers using iPSC technology, cell lines can be established that are genetically identical to the individual from whom they are derived, allowing for disease modeling and development of novel therapeutics in the personalized genetic context of the patient from which they are made.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this study, the researchers used the iPSC to generate liver cells that secrete the disease-specific mutant protein as well as cardiac and neuronal cells, the downstream target tissues of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Upon exposure to the mutant protein, the heart and neuronal cells displayed signs of stress and an increased level of cell death as compared to those exposed to normal protein, thereby recreating essential aspects of the disease in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="10">Furthermore, small molecule stabilizers of the mutant protein that are being tested in clinical trials show efficacy in this model, validating this iPSC-based, patient-specific in vitro system as a platform for testing therapeutic strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Our work demonstrates that it is possible to model a complex, multisystem genetic disease in a relatively short space of time, using lineage-specified cells derived from patient stem cells," explained George J. Murphy, PhD, assistant professor of medicine in the section of Hematology and Oncology and co-director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine (CReM) at BUSM and BMC.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is a major breakthrough that will facilitate testing novel targeted therapies that are being developed for ATTR amyloidosis," said coauthor John Berk, MD, clinical director of the Amyloidosis Center at BUSM and BMC, where these rare diseases have been studied for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patients and families from all over the world who come to us for treatment may soon benefit from this research.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hallmark says it shouldn't have changed Christmas carol lyrics</seg>
<seg id="2">(AP) - Greeting card giant Hallmark said Thursday that it shouldn't have changed the lyrics to "Deck the Halls" on a new holiday ornament that stirred a backlash from customers online.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kansas City, Mo.-based company has been defending itself after it began selling a miniaturized version of a tacky holiday sweater that changes the lyrics to the holiday carol.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ornament removes the word "gay" and emblazons the sweater with the phrase: "Don we now our FUN apparel!"</seg>
<seg id="5">Critics took to Twitter and Hallmark's Facebook page, accusing the company of making a political statement by using the word "fun" to replace "gay."</seg>
<seg id="6">Some Facebook commenters said they would never again buy Hallmark merchandise and that the change amounted to the company rewriting Christmas classics in the name of political correctness.</seg>
<seg id="7">Others suggested removing the word "gay" demonstrated a homophobic bias.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company initially responded by saying the multiple meanings attached to the word "gay" meant the sweater's lyrics would be "open to misinterpretation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The trend of wearing festively decorated Christmas sweaters to parties is all about fun, and this ornament is intended to play into that, so the planning team decided to say what we meant: 'fun.'</seg>
<seg id="10">That's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company updated its statement Thursday, saying it was surprised by the public's response and that it now realized it shouldn't have changed the lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We've been surprised at the wide range of reactions expressed about the change of lyrics on this ornament, and we're sorry to have caused so much concern," the statement read.</seg>
<seg id="13">We never intend to offend or make political statements with our products and in hindsight, we realize we shouldn't have changed the lyrics on the ornament.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Hallmark spokeswoman Linda Odell said the company has no plans to stop selling the ornament.</seg>

<seg id="1">The scheduled meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region took place at the Yalutorovsk automobile factory.</seg>
<seg id="2">As part of the event, there was a presentation of a new line of production of electric-welded steel tubes.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov related, in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner, marketing research was conducted to study the market for selling steel structures in the Tyumen region.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was found that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric-welded tubes per month.</seg>
<seg id="5">Then a decision was made to change the profile of the factory and install within it equipment for their production.</seg>
<seg id="6">Already this year more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products have been shipped.</seg>
<seg id="7">Investments in the factory made up more than 120 million rubles, - recounted Denis Gribanov.</seg>
<seg id="8">In October a new mill was launched, which helps augment the product mix.</seg>
<seg id="9">The factory produces small tube sections that are used for greenhouse facilities, small-scale construction and the furniture industry, as well as large ones for the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="10">We plan to reach a production level of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will make up around 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the transition to a different type of activity, the number of employees at the plant has not been reduced - now it amounts to 157 people, when new equipment is purchased there are plans to increase personnel by more than 50 employees.</seg>
<seg id="12">Retraining of staff is underway at the plant, and necessary specialists are being selected from those already available.</seg>
<seg id="13">Next year it is planned to commission a new unit for slitting steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will help reduce the cost of products, as well as another mill with a tube production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the end of 2014 at the plant they intend to master the production of tubes that are used in housing and utilities infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="15">Plant management is aiming to cover up to 70 percent of Tyumen region's demand for these products.</seg>
<seg id="16">Deputy director of the department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing production managers, recommended putting greater emphasis on modernizing machine-building plants.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also directed at this are forms of government support of industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans to purchase new equipment and expenses on its leasing.</seg>
<seg id="18">This year 150 million rubles have been allocated for these objectives, two thirds of this amount have already been spent.</seg>
<seg id="19">The last committee that will examine subsidy agreements are accepting documents from plants until November 15.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, expenses on the participation of local producers in international fairs are reimbursed by the budget.</seg>
<seg id="21">For next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles that may be used to compensate leasing payments and loans to acquire new equipment.</seg>
<seg id="22">5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy saving programs.</seg>
<seg id="23">Funds for reimbursing ordered and paid equipment that is produced in the south of Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex will be reduced to 72 million rubles.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Leonid Ostroumov, ultimately this form of support will end since the motive of its introduction was compensation of the extraction tax that oil companies paid into the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="25">Presently they are not doing this and subsidies are becoming direct expenditure obligations of the region.</seg>
<seg id="26">Accordingly, the regional government considers direct support of industrial plants to be priority, and not financing of the oil industry through them.</seg>
<seg id="27">Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many plant managers expressed concern in connection with the developing situation in relations with oil companies.</seg>
<seg id="29">A subsidy for equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of industry in the south of Tyumen region, and if it is canceled it will be difficult to compete in price with the temperate zone of Russia where the work force is cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, the issue is unclear regarding the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - the company "Rosneft", which so far is not placing its orders at Tyumen plants.</seg>
<seg id="31">The agreement on implementing the Uvatskiy project expires in 2013, and requests for its extension have not been received.</seg>
<seg id="32">At present, plants in the south of the region that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for next year.</seg>
<seg id="33">The open-ended question remains, will taxes from oil produced in the Uvatskiy region proceed to the budget of the region or will they be paid based on the place of registration of the new owner of the fields?</seg>

<seg id="1">Will Calderon scandal delay film tax credit bill?</seg>
<seg id="2">Will the federal probe into the activities of state Sen. Ronald S. Calderon delay or derail efforts to expand California's film tax credit program?</seg>
<seg id="3">That's the question many in the film industry were privately asking after reports emerged that federal investigators were examining Calderon's role in seeking tax credits on behalf of the film industry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gov. Jerry Brown signed a Calderon bill last year that extended for two years California's $100 million in annual tax breaks for films and TV shows made in the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">Calderon allegedly accepted $60,000 in bribes from an undercover FBI agent posing as the owner of an independent film studio, according to a report by the Al Jazeera television network, which cited a sealed federal affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Calderon's attorney has denied the accuracy of the report.</seg>
<seg id="7">ON LOCATION: Where the cameras roll</seg>
<seg id="8">The studio, called United Pacific Studios, has a few obscure credits listed on the industry website IMDB, but has not pulled any permits, according to Film L.A., which handles film permits for the city and the county.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Times reported Wednesday that federal investigators, who raided Calderon's Capitol office in June, also were examining Calderon's efforts to give tax breaks to productions of less than $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="10">He and family members received a total of $10,800 in campaign contributions from an independent producer who stood to benefit from the change Calderon advocated, The Times reported.</seg>
<seg id="11">The probe couldn't come at a worse time for Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="12">A coalition of entertainment industry unions and studios has been lobbying to expand the state program, funding for which is due to expire in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's disappointing to me that the FBI picked the film tax credit as the place to create the sting because I'm greatly concerned that people and legislators won't separate the fiction created by the FBI from the truth that the studios and others have not been a party in bribing a public official to get these tax incentives passed," said Paul Audley, president of FilmL.A. Inc.</seg>
<seg id="14">They put at risk the future needs of this industry going forward, because this story is going to be hanging out there as we go before the legislature next year.</seg>
<seg id="15">PHOTOS: Billion-dollar movie club</seg>
<seg id="16">Other film industry and union officials were disheartened by the reports on the FBI probe but noted the investigation was not focused on the film program itself.</seg>
<seg id="17">United Pacific Studios did not receive a tax credit from the state, according to the California Film Commission.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ed Duffy, business agent for Teamsters Local 399, which represents casting directors, location managers and drivers, said he did not think the scandal would weaken efforts to expand California's film tax credit program next year.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It's not going to affect our mission," Duffy said.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is all about jobs for California and for this to have come up ... is just very sad.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, hopefully we can get by this.</seg>
<seg id="22">Complicating matters is that Calderon's nephew, newly elected state Assemblyman Ian Calderon, has been a strong advocate for beefing up California's film incentives.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ian Calderon, who has not been a target of the federal probe, recently co-hosted a meeting at the headquarters of SAG-AFTRA in L.A. to discuss expanding the state's film tax credit.</seg>
<seg id="24">A spokesman for Ian Calderon could not be reached for comment.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Anytime you have an FBI scandal that involves a piece of legislation, people are going to step back and take a second look," said Ben Golombek, chief of staff for Assemblyman Raul Bocanegra (D-Pacoima), who co-chaired the state Assembly committee meeting."</seg>
<seg id="26">"But, Golombek added, "The credibility of the program is strong and nowhere in the report was that questioned.""</seg>
<seg id="27">L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti also has strongly supported the effort to help curb so-called runaway production.</seg>
<seg id="28">He recently named industry veteran Tom Sherak as his film czar to help lobby lawmakers do more to keep the industry in California.</seg>
<seg id="29">In an interview Thursday, Sherak said he was optimistic the scandal would not hurt the industry's efforts in Sacramento.</seg>
<seg id="30">""If you have a good idea and it's an honest idea and it does good for people, I don't see it being affected," Sherak said.</seg>
<seg id="31">People can tell the difference between a dishonest venture and an honest venture.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's a righteous cause.</seg>

<seg id="1">Disappointed Huawei breaks its NBN silence</seg>
<seg id="2">Huawei Australia chairman John Lord: 'We have nothing to hide.'</seg>
<seg id="3">Huawei has broken its silence after the Coalition government decided to uphold a ban on the Chinese telco participating in the national broadband network, saying the company is "extremely disappointed."</seg>
<seg id="4">John Lord, the chairman of Huawei Australia and a former Royal Australian Navy admiral, told the company's staff to hold their heads up high and be "proud to be Huawei."</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Lord's letter to staff came after Prime Minister Tony Abbott effectively shut down speculation Canberra was going to relax the Labor government's ban on Huawei.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Abbott ruled out any softening of the Coalition's stance on the telco in a letter to Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While much of this week's commentary has focused on cyber security," Mr Lord wrote, "I want to make it crystal clear that Huawei has never been presented with any evidence that our company or technology poses any kind of security risk."</seg>
<seg id="8">The former fleet commander played down the importance of the NBN to Huawei's business operation: "Despite the NBN decision, last year was our most successful year to date and today Huawei's Australian business is bigger than ever."</seg>
<seg id="9">Huawei Australia more than doubled its local revenue last year and earned $368 million, a 61 per cent increase from the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has secured major contracts, including construction of part of Optus' fast 4G network.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Lord reiterated an offer to reveal its technology and source codes to be verified by Australian security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="12">The offer has so far been ignored by both the Coalition and Labor governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">"That position still stands - we have nothing to hide, and we have complete confidence in the veracity of our equipment," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">We have always understood that the bar is set higher for Huawei and because of that we are willing to go further than any other vendor to prove our security credentials.</seg>
<seg id="15">He described Canberra's decision to ban Huawei as "the exception, not the rule."</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted Huawei was building eight out of nine national broadband projects around the world, including Britain's.</seg>
<seg id="17">These countries have not embraced Huawei cautiously, they have embraced us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="18">Huawei established a cyber-security centre in Britain after it was awarded a large contract to supply equipment to the British equivalent of the national broadband network.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is staffed with security-cleared personnel, some of whom used to work for Britain's signals intelligence agency, GCHQ.</seg>
<seg id="20">The decision to block Huawei in Australia has been met with concern from Chinese officials and business leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">One senior Chinese diplomat told Fairfax Media Australia placed a higher premium on the US alliance than the trading relationship with China and that US intelligence services might be behind the Coalition's new policy.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decision to uphold Labor's ban on Huawei received extensive media coverage in China and stoked a nationalist backlash from citizens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many have urged Beijing to retaliate with a ban on imports of Australian agricultural products.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we've not been in that situation before -- it's all completely new.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was "full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name."</seg>

<seg id="1">Colorado Voters Deciding How to Tax Pot</seg>
<seg id="2">A pro-pot jingle in Colorado last year went like this: "Jobs for our people/Money for schools/Who could ask for more?"</seg>
<seg id="3">Nearly a year after Colorado legalized recreational weed, voters get the chance to decide exactly how much more - in taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, voters decide whether to approve a 15 percent pot excise tax to pay for school construction, plus an extra sales tax of 10 percent to fund marijuana enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some pot activists are campaigning against the taxes, arguing that marijuana should be taxed like beer, which has a tax rate of 8 cents a gallon.</seg>
<seg id="6">They've handed out free joints at tax protests.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Our alcohol system is regulated just fine with the taxes they have, so we don't see any need for this huge grab for cash from marijuana," said Miguel Lopez, volunteer coordinator for the small opposition campaign to Colorado's pot tax measure.</seg>
<seg id="8">While polls suggest the tax is going to pass - even in this state where voters frequently reject new taxes - it is very much an open question how much the state is going to reap.</seg>
<seg id="9">A projection prepared for voters by state fiscal analysts predicted the taxes would bring in $70 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="10">But an early draft of Colorado's first budget after retail sales begin, the 2014-15 fiscal year, doesn't include an amount they expect in pot revenue.</seg>
<seg id="11">Washington state isn't counting on pot revenue, either.</seg>
<seg id="12">Voters in that state set tax rates when they approved legalization last year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Taxes will be 25 percent, levied at least twice and up to three times between when the pot is grown and when it reaches the customer, plus sales tax.</seg>
<seg id="14">Marijuana's tax potential is an important question for the prospects for pot legalization in other states.</seg>
<seg id="15">If pot proves a tax windfall for Colorado and Washington, other states may be inclined to look favorably on legal weed.</seg>
<seg id="16">But if recreational pot smokers in the two states stay in the black market to avoid taxes, while the price tag for regulating a new industry balloons, marijuana legalization could suddenly look like a bad deal.</seg>
<seg id="17">That's why many in Colorado's marijuana industry are pushing the tax measure.</seg>
<seg id="18">They say that because most people don't use marijuana, the public needs to see a public benefit from making the drug legal.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Taxes are an opportunity for marijuana to show it can play a valuable role in the community," said Joe Megyesy, spokesman for the campaign promoting the tax measure.</seg>
<seg id="20">Support for the marijuana taxes extends even to politicians who opposed legalization in the first place, including Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and Republican Attorney General John Suthers.</seg>
<seg id="21">I think everyone sort of realizes that the die has been cast.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We're really doing this, and if we're going to move marijuana out of the shadows, we need to regulate it and tax it," said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor who studies drug policy and served on the Colorado panel that helped write state marijuana regulations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Still unclear is how the new marijuana market responds.</seg>
<seg id="24">Colorado's medical marijuana framework will remain in place, with a much lower taxation rate.</seg>
<seg id="25">Heavy pot users could save a lot of money by paying nominal annual fees to be on the state medical marijuana registry and paying only regular sales taxes on their pot.</seg>
<seg id="26">Colorado also allows growing pot at home without a license, allowing users to avoid taxes entirely.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kiwi slips against greenback over week</seg>
<seg id="2">THE New Zealand dollar has edged lower against the greenback this week after the Federal Reserve kept its money printing programme intact.</seg>
<seg id="3">The kiwi traded at 82.64 US cents at 5pm in Wellington from 82.78 cents at the start of the week, and was little changed from 82.62 cents at 8am and 82.49 cents on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The trade-weighted index rose to 76.63 from 76.33 on Thursday, a little stronger from last week's close at 76.40.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Fed this week kept its $US85 billion monthly asset purchase programme unchanged, while giving a more upbeat assessment for the world's biggest economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We thought the US dollar was over-sold a bit and that seems to be the dominant theme," said Chris Tennent-Brown, FX economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the US economy is on the up, then the US dollar should be in a multi-year upstream.</seg>
<seg id="8">New Zealand's Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler left the kiwi marking time on Thursday when he kept the official cash rate at 2.5 per cent, saying sustained strength in the kiwi would give him "greater flexibility" over the timing and pace of next year's rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id="9">Still, traders haven't bought into the warning, and are still pricing in 80 basis points of increases over the coming year, according to the Overnight Index Swap curve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The New Zealand dollar increased to 87.14 Australian cents from 86.87 cents on Thursday and to 60.96 euro cents from 60.18 cents.</seg>

<seg id="1">Travel guide to the island of Luzon in the Philippines</seg>
<seg id="2">So, why do we come?</seg>
<seg id="3">Tenerife is the largest of the Canary Islands archipelago - around 130km across at its widest point - and built its reputation as a package-holiday destination in the 1970s, when the rapid development of a string of hotels and apartment blocks along the south-west coast began.</seg>
<seg id="4">This high-rise strip - Playa de Las Américas, Los Cristianos and the Costa Adeje - now hosts the majority of visitors, drawn by year-round sun, imported white sand and prices to suit every budget.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, flying from Manchester on 23 November, Monarch (0871 423 8568; monarch.co.uk) has a week's self-catering at the Laguna Park II apartments in the Costa Adeje from £246 per person, which rises to £1,332pp if you prefer half-board luxury at the nearby Grand Hotel Iberostar El Mirador.</seg>
<seg id="6">Alternatively, flying from Gatwick on the same date, Thomson (0871 231 4691; thomson.co.uk) will deliver a week's stay at "adult-focused" Spring Hotel Vulcano, half board, for £556pp.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the north coast, the town of Puerto de la Cruz combines a bustling appeal with the resort tourism found to the south.</seg>
<seg id="8">Again on 23 November, Thomas Cook (thomascook.com) has a week-long stay at the Hotel Botanico and Oriental Spa Gardens for £742pp, including breakfast, with flights from Gatwick.</seg>
<seg id="9">All prices above include transfers and are based on two people sharing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Don't be dismayed if the prospect of crowds of sunbathers doesn't sound immediately appealing.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is an island that rewards exploration beyond the tourist resorts.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tenerife's central asset is a dormant volcano, the vast Mount Teide, which rises to 3,718m and is often described as the highest mountain in Spain (despite it being more than 1,700km from Madrid).</seg>
<seg id="13">The Parque Nacional del Teide is centred on the vast crater at its summit.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are plenty of hiking routes on offer, with information available from the visitors' centre (00 34 922 92 23 71).</seg>
<seg id="15">Wrap up warm, though; the chilly upper slopes of Teide are a marked contrast to the heat of the coast.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only accommodation in the national park is Parador de las Cañadas (00 34 922 374 841; www.parador.es) which has doubles from €100, room only.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, many visitors come here simply to take the eight-minute journey on the Teleférico cable car (telefericoteide.com) to the viewpoint 200 metres from the top of Teide (€25pp).</seg>
<seg id="18">A new combined ticket includes a return bus transfer from Costa Adeje (Route 342) or Puerto de la Cruz (Route 348) to the Teide National Park, plus a ticket to take the cable car via a special fast-lane entrance.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tickets are purchased on the buses and cost €37 for adults.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you wish to take the steep hike to the summit itself, you will need a permit (obtained in advance from www.reservasparquesnacionales.es).</seg>
<seg id="21">The island's quiet yet steep inland roads, which cut through forests of long-needled Canarian pine trees, have long made it an attractive destination for cyclists, with Tour de France champion Chris Froome and Team Sky using it as a winter training base.</seg>
<seg id="22">Tenerife Bike Training (00 34 653 395 775; tenerifebiketraining.com) offers an eight-day trip for €1,000 including B&B, transfers and support vehicle, but not flights.</seg>
<seg id="23">Uncover some civic charisma</seg>
<seg id="24">The archipelago once had an important role as the mid-Atlantic staging posts for Spain's colonisation of the New World.</seg>
<seg id="25">Santa Cruz, the pretty capital of Tenerife which lies in the north-east of the island, is where the conquistador Alfonso Fernández de Lugo planted his "holy cross" in 1494.</seg>
<seg id="26">These days, the most impressive structure in the city is Santiago Calatrava's Auditorio, pictured (00 34 922 568 600; auditoriodetenerife.com), a striking white wave of a building set close to the shore.</seg>
<seg id="27">For a real slice of a colonial city, board the Linea 1 tram from Intercambiador, Santa Cruz's main station, and take the half-hour trip to nearby La Laguna.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now a Unesco World Heritage Site, this charming city was the blueprint for Latin American outposts such as Havana and also served as Tenerife's capital for 200 years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Park life</seg>
<seg id="30">Tenerife caters for families brilliantly, with some diverting funparks.</seg>
<seg id="31">One of the biggest and, well, wateriest of them is Siam Park, pictured, near Los Cristianos: Thai-themed and stuffed with slides, it will easily deliver a day's distraction (siampark.net; admission €33 adults/ €22 children).</seg>
<seg id="32">Alternatively, Loro Parque in Puerto de la Cruz is run by the same operator and is part zoo, part aquarium, part theme park.</seg>
<seg id="33">It even offers visitors a "Penguinarium" with real snow (loroparque.com; admission €33/€22; combined tickets for the two parks are also available).</seg>
<seg id="34">Go coastal</seg>
<seg id="35">The Canary Islands are well-known as places to spot cetaceans, with sightings of bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales often guaranteed by the many boat operators in the resorts in the south-west.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you prefer to paddle your way around the island, Teno Activo (00 34 922 12 80 60; tenoactivo.com) runs kayaking and walking adventures, including trips to the pretty beach which lies at the end of the Masca Gorge, hidden alongside mighty cliffs known as Los Gigantes (from around €20).</seg>
<seg id="37">There are, of course, plenty of beaches to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="38">You can usually escape from the crowds at Santa Cruz's local option, Playa de las Teresitas, pictured.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is reached via bus 910.</seg>
<seg id="40">This stretch of artificial sand hides below the Anaga mountains - themselves well worth a day-trip - and offers gentle waves that are perfect for families.</seg>
<seg id="41">Look north</seg>
<seg id="42">Much of the northern coast of Tenerife remains relatively undeveloped, with the undoubted jewel being Garachico, pictured, a tiny town with cobbled streets, a pretty main square and a small harbourside fort called Castillo de San Miguel.</seg>
<seg id="43">The most striking thing about Garachico, though, is the series of lava rock pools that spills into the Atlantic along the shore.</seg>
<seg id="44">The remnants of a volcanic eruption in the 18th century that tore through the town, the lava has - with the aid of some strategic concrete - been moulded into swimming pools.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stay at the Hotel San Roque (00 34 922 13 34 35; hotelsanroque.com) a lovely boutique property with doubles from €195, including breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="46">La Gomera</seg>
<seg id="47">Tenerife's green little sister lies off its west coast and offers you a landscape riven by deep valleys, graced with ancient laurel forests, and populated by a culture still renowned for a strange whistling speech called Silbo Gomero.</seg>
<seg id="48">The island makes for a great day-trip via the regular ferries which run from Los Cristianos to San Sebastián, the capital.</seg>
<seg id="49">The quickest option is offered by Fred Olsen (00 922 62 82 00; fredolsen.es), which operates three daily services for €30 each way.</seg>
<seg id="50">For longer stays, Prestige Holidays (01425 480400; prestigeholidays.co.uk) offers seven nights' B&B at Jardin Tecina on La Gomera from £783pp including breakfast, return flights from Gatwick to Tenerife South with easyJet, private taxi transfers on both Tenerife and La Gomera, return catamaran crossings to La Gomera.</seg>
<seg id="51">The price quoted is for departures during this month.</seg>
<seg id="52">Getting there</seg>
<seg id="53">International flights arrive at Tenerife South, which offers swift transfer opportunities to the beach resorts.</seg>
<seg id="54">Between them, Ryanair (0871 246 0000; ryanair.com), easyJet (0843 104 5000; easyJet.com) and Jet2 (0871 226 1737; jet2.com) have connections from the majority of UK airports, with Thomson, Thomas Cook and Monarch providing a similarly wide array of departures with their package holidays.</seg>
<seg id="55">Prefer business class?</seg>
<seg id="56">In March this year, British Airways (0844 493 0787; ba.com) restored a link from Gatwick to Tenerife that had lain dormant since its franchise operator GB Airways was sold to easyJet in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="57">Flying at the front of the plane currently costs from around £395 return in December.</seg>
<seg id="58">Getting around</seg>

<seg id="1">Front-rower Josh Cordoba becomes second player to launch legal action against Cronulla Sharks over 2011 supplement program</seg>
<seg id="2">Cronulla had a season shrouded in controversy after being linked to the infamous ASADA doping investigation, with the team torn apart mid-way through the year.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, with Paul Gallen leading the way the Sharks managed to make the 2013 finals series.</seg>
<seg id="4">FORMER Sharks forward Josh Cordoba has become the club's second ex-player to commence legal action over the controversial 2011 supplement program.</seg>
<seg id="5">News Limited can reveal Cordoba has hired the same law firm to advance his damages claim as former teammate Isaac Gordon, who commenced proceedings in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Both players are now living in central Queensland, working in mines surrounding Gladstone, after being released from Cronulla last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gordon has been the poster boy for health concerns surrounding the supplement program after emerging from a game in May 2011 with severe bruising down the length of one of his legs.</seg>
<seg id="8">An independent investigation found players were given peptides CJC-1295 and GHRP-6 in the form of injections, then creams and tablets, while Gordon was also advised to take BB Formula - traditionally used on racehorses - to help him put on weight.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cordoba was a member of the Sharks team for most of the 11 matches that the program covered.</seg>
<seg id="10">The program is now the centrepiece of ASADA's NRL investigation, with players who might have been exposed to banned substances in danger of two-year bans.</seg>
<seg id="11">As ASADA and the NRL move closer to finalising their investigation into Cronulla and announcing any punishments against players, staff or club, Sharks officials have become increasingly concerned about the prospect of widespread legal action.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sharks CEO Steve Noyce on Wednesday night confirmed the club received a legal letter from Cordoba's solicitor, James Chrara, in the past month.</seg>
<seg id="13">Cordoba declined to comment on Wednesday night.</seg>
<seg id="14">Josh Cordoba in action for the Sharks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Chrara, however, confirmed the 28-year-old had approached his firm, Shine Lawyers, several months ago to seek damages from the Sharks.</seg>
<seg id="16">At present there is no evidence Cordoba suffered the same type of bruising as Gordon in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Chrara believed clinical records could show Cordoba has a case against the club, because he was administered with substances that were allegedly different to those to which he originally consented, none of which were banned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's an almost identical complaint (as Gordon)," Chrara said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Josh was part of the same program.</seg>
<seg id="20">At present there is no evidence of physical (outward) damage, but there may be something inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's what we are continuing to investigate and we have asked Cronulla for records.</seg>
<seg id="22">But certain elements of the claim stand regardless of what they show, because it's our belief there has been a trespass against Josh.</seg>

<seg id="1">Senators question U.S. Syria strategy</seg>
<seg id="2">WASHINGTON Obama administration officials defended U.S. work in Syria Thursday against blistering criticism from Republicans who claim Washington has goals, but no strategy to find a political resolution that would end the bloody conflict affecting nations throughout the Mideast.</seg>
<seg id="3">Robert Ford, U.S. ambassador to Syria, testifying to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States is proud of the humanitarian and other assistance it has provided to the Syrian opposition trying to topple President Bashar Assad's government.</seg>
<seg id="4">He acknowledged that the Syrian people were "deeply disappointed" when the U.S. did not take military action against the Syrian regime, but said U.S. officials are working furiously to arrange a conference in Geneva next month to set up a transitional government and end the bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You continue to call this a civil war, Ambassador Ford," said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="6">This isn't a civil war anymore; this is a regional conflict.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's spread to Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="8">We now have al-Qaida resurgence in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's destabilizing Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Iran is all in.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hezbollah has 5,000 troops there.</seg>
<seg id="12">For you to describe this as a quote, 'civil war,' of course, is a gross distortion of the facts, which again makes many of us question your fundamental strategy because you are - you don't describe the realities on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ford said he does not think that Assad can win militarily and only has the advantage in a few places like around Aleppo in northern Syria.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said Assad has a disadvantage on the battleground in other places, including some in the east and south.</seg>
<seg id="15">McCain was not satisfied, saying Assad's killing of civilians remained unchecked.</seg>
<seg id="16">Come on. ...</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact is that he was about to be toppled a year ago, or over a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then Hezbollah came in.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the Russians stepped up their effort.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the Iranian Revolutionary Guard intervened in what you call a, quote, 'civil war,' and he turned the tide.</seg>
<seg id="21">And he continues to maintain his position of power and slaughtering innocent Syrian civilians.</seg>
<seg id="22">And you are relying on a Geneva conference, right?</seg>
<seg id="23">Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the committee, said he thinks the U.S. assistance to the Syrian opposition has been an "embarrassment."</seg>
<seg id="24">"I find it appalling that you would sit here and act as if we're doing the things we said we would do three months ago, six months ago, nine months ago," said Corker.</seg>
<seg id="25">The London 11 (group of countries that support the opposition) has to look at us as one of the most feckless nations they've ever dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the Foreign Relations panel's chairman, said in prepared remarks that progress toward destroying Syria's chemical weapons was "the only positive note" in the worsening crisis.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Menendez lamented the worsening humanitarian crisis caused by the war, now in its third year, and said that a lack of progress on a negotiated political settlement portends continued bloodshed and suffering.</seg>
<seg id="28">He and other lawmakers told Ford that they don't believe the Obama administration has a strategy for dealing with the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deductions for capital repairs of the building will appear in utility payment documents of Voronezh residents as a new line of expenses.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the most approximate calculations, from 100 to 400 rubles per month must be additionally paid for a standard two-room apartment starting after the New Year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The regional government will determine the precise rate.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the other hand, the residents themselves will decide on painting the entrance, cleaning up the stair wells, or even replacing the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="5">Deputies of the regional Duma approved this law.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, noted: "Order must be imposed in this matter as well - prioritize capital repairs of buildings, not accumulate funds in management companies, which here are frequently registered either in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or somewhere else, this will be the establishment of government control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for repairs of multi-apartment buildings."</seg>
<seg id="7">Participatory construction is now also under control of the government.</seg>
<seg id="8">The law protecting against swindlers was approved by the regional Duma in its final reading.</seg>
<seg id="9">The document did not arise out of thin air.</seg>
<seg id="10">4.5 thousand people suffered from dishonest developers in our region.</seg>
<seg id="11">The problems of the majority were able to be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the new law prescribes the rights and responsibilities for all participants of equity construction.</seg>
<seg id="13">Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, stated: "It is no secret that in this area abuses have also begun related to the fact that in '98 the same shareholders got hit, and the same shareholders in the 2000's."</seg>
<seg id="14">People have begun to make money on it, these two laws were adopted in order to close the loophole, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was decided to build a temporary residence center near Voronezh for foreign citizens who are subject to deportation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regional parliament adopted such a law not only due to pressure from the federation.</seg>
<seg id="17">The region has more than enough problems related to illegal migrants.</seg>
<seg id="18">Specifically, last year slightly more than 100 thousand foreigners completed migration registration.</seg>
<seg id="19">But only one in five registered official permission to work.</seg>
<seg id="20">Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is highly questionable.</seg>
<seg id="21">Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, recounted: "They violated legislation, but are not criminals.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is no trial, but deportation is necessary - they need to be held somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="23">The federation adopted such a solution to arrange such places using regional funds.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the Voronezh region, such a place has been determined - it is the Old Olshanka of Semiluksky district.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well, but finally the regional parliament allotted new benefits to parents with multiple children.</seg>
<seg id="26">Firstly, families raising 5 or more children are fully exempt from the transport tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million - but the parents with multiple children save just as much.</seg>
<seg id="28">Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more children will be provided housing subsidies beginning in the new year.</seg>
<seg id="29">For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters at a price of 30 thousand per meter.</seg>
<seg id="30">For example, a family of 6 persons - papa, mama, biological child and 3 adopted.</seg>
<seg id="31">For them, according to regulations, the government will acquire housing with an area of 108 square meters for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is a perfectly acceptable option for the left bank or the Southwest microdistrict.</seg>
<seg id="33">Well, and in the regional center one can buy an entire cottage for that amount.</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tea party is aghast.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.</seg>
<seg id="11">This really is a must for our nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is not a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars get many more miles to the gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
<seg id="25">California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People are paying more directly into what they are getting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is looking into one.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="49">The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.</seg>
<seg id="63">An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chocolate linked to less risk of heart attack, but not heart failure</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- High levels of chocolate consumption might be associated with a decreased risk of developing heart disease, researchers in Britain say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dr. Oscar Franco and colleagues at the University of Cambridge carried out a large scale review of the existing evidence to evaluate the effects of eating chocolate on cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="4">They analyzed the results of seven studies, involving more than 100,000 participants with and without existing heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="5">For each study, they compared the group with the highest chocolate consumption against the group with the lowest consumption.</seg>
<seg id="6">Differences in study design and quality were also taken into account to minimize bias.</seg>
<seg id="7">Five studies reported a beneficial link between higher levels of chocolate consumption and the risk of cardiovascular events and they found that the "highest levels of chocolate consumption were associated with a 37 percent reduction in cardiovascular disease and a 29 percent reduction in stroke compared with lowest levels."</seg>
<seg id="8">However, there was no significant reduction was found in relation to heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="9">The studies did not differentiate between dark or milk chocolate and included consumption of chocolate bars, drinks, biscuits and desserts.</seg>
<seg id="10">The researchers said the findings need to be interpreted with caution, in particular because commercially available chocolate is very calorific -- around 500 calories for every 100 grams, or 33.5 ounces -- and eating too much of it could in itself lead to weight gain, risk of diabetes and heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the researchers concluded, given the health benefits of eating chocolate, initiatives to reduce the current fat and sugar content in most chocolate products should be explored.</seg>
<seg id="12">The findings were presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Paris.</seg>

<seg id="1">Columbia Helicopters Assists Australians With Helicopter Returns From Afghanistan -- PORTLAND, Ore., Nov.</seg>
<seg id="2">1, 2013 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Columbia Helicopters has been working with the Australian Army on preparations for the return of two CH 47D Chinook helicopters from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two helicopters flew some 5,600 missions since deployed there in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Portland-based company, which has a global reputation for expertise in maintenance of the CH 47 and other Boeing Vertol-built twin-rotor helicopter types, has been engaged in the project since August of this year, under a contract with the Australian Defence Force (ADF).</seg>
<seg id="5">The work is being carried out in Kandahar with a staff of 15, including mechanics and electricians, as well as quality control and supervisory personnel.</seg>
<seg id="6">The crews have averaged 10-hour days, and six-day weeks, according to Todd Petersen, Columbia Helicopters' Vice-President, Marketing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Petersen explained that under the contract, Columbia Helicopters' technicians also performed heavy phase maintenance on the helicopters, prior to preparation for shipping.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We have had a three-year presence in Kandahar working with the Australians, and this is the third year in a row that we have carried out a major inspection for them on the CH 47D," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="9">Preparing the helicopters for shipment, reported Petersen, involved the removal of the rotor blades and heads, forward transmission, aft pylons and aft vertical shafts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Those components, along with the helicopter airframes, will be loaded aboard a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Boeing C17 cargo plane for transportation to the 5th Aviation Regiment at the RAAF base in Townsville, Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Columbia Helicopters maintenance crews will accompany the helicopters to Townsville, where they will reassemble the aircraft," said Petersen, adding that the project is scheduled to wrap up by late November.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he also pointed out that while the project coincides with the pull-out of the Australian Army from Afghanistan, Columbia Helicopters will continue to have a full-time, on-site presence in Townsville, assisting the Australian Army with maintenance support on the CH 47D for at least the next several years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It has been a privilege for Columbia Helicopters to have worked with the ADF over the past three years, and we look forward to continuing that relationship," Petersen remarked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Among the recommendations, Sir Andrew said RBS must ensure that it is clear who is in charge of small business lending, pointing out that under its current structure the operation is split between several divisions.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is no silver bullet, but they really do need to take a fresh look at it all.</seg>
<seg id="4">"There are an awful lot of things they are doing, but when you look at what they are achieving it hasn't quite worked out," said Sir Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report comes on the same day RBS and Treasury are set to announce the outcome of a review into the break-up of the taxpayer-backed lender into a "good bank" and a "bad bank," but Sir Andrew cautioned that such a move could make things even worse for SMEs trying to borrow money from the bank.</seg>
<seg id="6">To be quite honest, the time when it really would have made a difference would have been in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In retrospect it might have enabled the SME [lending] business to have done better, but today it is less of any issue," said Sir Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report has also called for RBS to launch an independent investigation into claims of wrongdoing by its global restructuring group (GRG), which deals with businesses in financial distress.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sir Andrew said small businesses had made serious allegations about the conduct of the unit and the bank had to thoroughly investigate the matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They absolutely need to look into it [wrongdoing by GRG]...it needs clearing up," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snowden writes to Germans to seek support in spy row</seg>
<seg id="2">By Stephen Brown and Alexandra Hudson</seg>
<seg id="3">BERLIN (Reuters) - Fugitive U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden has told Germany he is counting on international support to stop Washington's 'persecution' of him for revealing the scale of its worldwide phone and Internet surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an open letter to a country at the center of the row over U.S. spying on allies, Snowden said his revelations had helped to "address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust."</seg>
<seg id="5">Complaining that Washington continued to "treat dissent as defection" and speaking of a "sustained campaign of persecution" that he said had forced him into exile in Russia, Snowden wrote that "speaking the truth is not a crime."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behavior," read his letter to Chancellor Angela Merkel, the German parliament and German federal prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snowden gave the letter to German lawmaker Hans-Christian Stroebele, who presented it to the media in Berlin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Stroebele, a maverick 74-year-old member of parliament for the opposition Greens, gave the letter to reporters shortly after getting off a plane from Moscow, where he met Snowden on Thursday at a secret location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The letter did not carry any specific address, beginning simply: "To whom it may concern."</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden's leaks about the targets and methods of the National Security Agency (NSA), from alleged mass scanning of emails to the tapping of world leaders' phones - including Merkel's - have infuriated U.S. allies and placed Washington on the defensive.</seg>
<seg id="11">U.S. authorities want him handed over to face espionage charges for illegally disclosing government secrets.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of Britain's MI5 Security Service has said the material he divulged to journalists was a gift to terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 30-year-old ex-CIA employee and NSA contractor, who fled to Moscow via Hong Kong earlier this year and was given political asylum by President Vladimir Putin, said he had been forced into exile for acting according to his "moral duty."</seg>
<seg id="14">Snowden said he was ready to travel to Germany to help its parliamentary inquiry into NSA bugging of Merkel's mobile phone - but added: "I would rather go before the U.S. Congress, or a committee of the U.S. Congress and lay the facts on the table."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neither option is likely in the immediate future.</seg>
<seg id="16">Germany's parliament wants to talk to him about the NSA's secret monitoring of Merkel's phone and the communications of a host of politicians and business people, according to reports.</seg>
<seg id="17">But visiting Germany would pose grave diplomatic problems for Merkel and endanger Snowden's asylum status back in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The asylum he has in Russia gives him security in Russia but not in Germany," Stroebele, who sits on parliament's control committee which oversees the work of the German intelligence agencies, told a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="19">If he left he would not be able to return to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="20">"He would come to Germany if he could be safe here or in another country," said the white-haired MP, who is the first foreign politician known to have met with Snowden in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some politicians want Snowden put on a witness protection scheme, others suggest sending a parliamentary committee to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="22">German officials say there is no discussion of granting him asylum, which he would have to request on German soil, and there is a pending U.S. request to arrest him if he comes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Edward Snowden is in Russia under a temporary refugee status and, if he leaves Russian territory, he may lose it," the Russian lawyer representing Snowden, Anatoly Kucherena, was quoted as saying by Russian Interfax news agency.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If some countries have questions to Snowden, they can send them to him and he will decide," said the lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Putin says Russia will only shelter Snowden if he refrains from activities that could harm the United States or Russian-U.S. relations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Asked if meeting German investigators would violate these terms, a Putin spokesman declined to comment.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We'll find a way of making it possible, if Mr Snowden is prepared to speak to German representatives," German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Merkel has dispatched senior aides to Washington demanding assurances there will be no wholesale secret surveillance, after Snowden revealed that the NSA typically monitored half a billion phone calls, emails and text messages in a month.</seg>
<seg id="29">The NSA said this week that it was European governments like France and Spain who collected telecommunications data in bulk and then handed it to the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany over US surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."</seg>
<seg id="9">Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.</seg>
<seg id="14">If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.</seg>
<seg id="16">However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."</seg>
<seg id="17">Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
<seg id="18">The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."</seg>

<seg id="1">Long odds for Tom Waterhouse revival</seg>
<seg id="2">Illustration: Rocco Fazzari</seg>
<seg id="3">Read the full story in tomorrow's BusinessDay</seg>
<seg id="4">The telegenic Tom Waterhouse vowed in May we would be seeing less of him following the controversy of his spruiking of live odds across our most popular sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">It now appears he has fresh incentive to do so.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Waterhouse may be forced to curb his marketing arsenal due to a more recent vow - to make a profit.</seg>
<seg id="7">This follows the sale of his business in August to UK bookie, William Hill, for a modest $30 million up front with a further $70 million dependent on the company turning a significant profit by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">As many suspected, the massive marketing spend by Tom Waterhouse to date means the business is expected to lose more than $3 million this year on a customer base of 75,000, according to William Hill.</seg>
<seg id="9">It could have been worse.</seg>
<seg id="10">British rival, Bet365, might be rethinking its spend after losing more than $36 million in its first year of operations here, which included a marketing campaign featuring Hollywood star, Samuel L Jackson, a significant factor.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bet365 gained 40,000 customers and revenue of just $7.7 million.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Waterhouse to receive some, or all, of the $70 million rump payment the business needs to generate an operating profit on a sliding scale between $10m and $30m for the year ending December 31, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Waterhouse said it is still important for the company to market aggressively and get a ""share of voice"" as it looks to entice punters away from TAB outlets to its online betting shop.</seg>
<seg id="14">""While TV works well as a way to advertise we will continue to use it,"" Mr Waterhouse said.</seg>
<seg id="15">But he added: ""I don't know if we will necessarily go as much on TV.""</seg>
<seg id="16">The early signs of retreat are already there to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Waterhouse brand will no longer be plastered all over Nine's NRL coverage from next year with Sportsbet - owned by Irish betting shop, Paddy Power - paying a reported $40 million to replace him as Nine's official partner.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sportsbet would not confirm the deal but said sanity is returning to pricing for sport broadcast sponsorships.</seg>
<seg id="19">""The prices that were being paid were crazy,"" said Sportsbet executive, Barni Evans.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of the price inflation was driven by hyper competition for a small number of premium assets in the marketplace and Tom Waterhouse was at the centre of that.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is no worse barrier for a horse to draw wide in this country than the 2500-metre start at Flemington, so it's no surprise that bookmakers are now keen to lay the pre-draw equal favourites Savvy Nature and Complacent in Saturday's $1.5 million Victoria Derby after they both drew off the track.</seg>
<seg id="3">Savvy Nature is in gate 13 while Complacent drew even worse with 16.</seg>
<seg id="4">Another top Sydney hope, Criterion, who separated the other two in the Spring Champion Stakes, drew 14.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Victoria Derby barrier was even worse pre 1972 when the VRC finally accepted that the traditional distance of 2400 metres was unfair and it was extended to 2500 metres.</seg>
<seg id="6">The extra 100 metres was added so the three-year-olds had the extra distance before they reached the extremely tight turn out of the straight.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hucklebuck ridden by Dom Tourneur.</seg>
<seg id="8">One might wonder why such a traditional race was run from such a shocking barrier on such a spacious track.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, the reason is that when the derby was first run in 1885 the Flemington track was quite different with the 2400-metre start being behind the Elms stand, giving the runners an extra 400-metre straight run before they reached the 2000-metre start.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the bad draw I still remain confident that the staying-bred Complacent can win the race.</seg>
<seg id="11">Source: Betfair.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Peter Snowden-trained colt is from the first Australian crop of 2007 Epsom Derby winner Authorized, while his dam Insouciance is a daughter of another Epsom Derby winner in Quest For Fame.</seg>
<seg id="13">On that breeding we can all but eliminate any worries about him running the distance and the way he has come on in his Sydney races, finishing with a brilliant win in the Spring Champion Stakes, suggests to me that only bad luck from the bad barrier will prevent him from winning.</seg>
<seg id="14">His main danger might be the Victorian Polanski, who has done everything right in the lead-up and he has drawn perfectly in barrier one.</seg>
<seg id="15">Savvy Nature was OK winning at Moonee Valley last Saturday when he didn't seem happy racing the left-handed way for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="16">But in last week's race he beat a horse who had been beaten at Avoca at his previous start, so I have a query about that form.</seg>
<seg id="17">5 Best Bets</seg>
<seg id="18">Flemington Race 1, No 2 HUCKLEBUCK</seg>
<seg id="19">It's appropriate that on Victoria Derby day a son of 2003 Derby winner Elvstroem looks one of the better bets on the program.</seg>
<seg id="20">This gelding has stamped himself as a serious galloper and getting better as he matures and gets over longer trips.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had a moderate start to his career with an effortless win in a maiden at Gawler then he went to the Morphettville Park track and among those he beat was the recent Geelong Classic winner, Gamblin" Guru.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trainer Phillip Stokes obviously realised he had a horse good enough for the Melbourne spring carnival and, after an unlucky third at Moonee Valley in a strong field, the gelding started favourite at Caulfield and didn't give punters a moment's worry as he strolled home by two lengths.</seg>
<seg id="23">The step up to 1600 metres on Saturday looks ideal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adelaide gallopers are enjoying a good run here this spring.</seg>
<seg id="25">SUGGESTED BET Back Hucklebuck and start the day on a winning note.</seg>
<seg id="26">Flemington Race 2, No.</seg>
<seg id="27">Darren Weir's home-bred filly May's Dream is a solid favourite to win the VRC Oaks next Thursday and she will firm even more if, as expected, she wins today's Wakeful Stakes and I think that she will.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lightly raced, May's Dream has done everything right in her short career, with an excellent first-up third at Moonee Valley when she looked in need of the run, followed by an easy win at Caulfield, before a gallant second to champion filly Guelph in the Thousand Guineas when she chased that filly hard all the way up the home straight and raced like a true stayer.</seg>
<seg id="29">Being a daughter of South Australian Oaks winner and Melbourne Cup runner-up She's Archie, May's Dream should be ideally suited by today's step up in distance and with Guelph now in the paddock, May's Dream can establish herself as our best staying filly by winning both this and the Oaks.</seg>
<seg id="30">SUGGESTED BET Back May's Dream to win the Wakeful-Oaks double.</seg>
<seg id="31">Flemington Race 4, No.</seg>
<seg id="32">Chris Waller, as well as being Australia's champion trainer, is also a conservative judge of his horses, so when he declared during the week that his star three-year-old Zoustar "might be the next big thing in racing"" he made headlines.</seg>
<seg id="33">Zoustar has since been sold to a leading stud for a $20 million package and may be heading overseas to race at Ascot next year.</seg>
<seg id="34">I've seen Zoustar race in Brisbane and Sydney and I think he'll probably win the Coolmore Stud Stakes today, but while I'm including him in our best bets today, I'm not so sure he is going to be reasonable odds.</seg>
<seg id="35">The hype about him being a $20 million colt has assured that he will be very short, under the odds, and I'm only suggesting him as a betting prospect if we can get black figures.</seg>
<seg id="36">SUGGESTED BET If he wins easily, maybe he's worth $20 million.</seg>
<seg id="37">But look for $2 or better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Flemington Race 3, No.</seg>
<seg id="39">Flemington trainer Nigel Blackiston is a former stable foreman for Bart Cummings so it is no surprise that he is a naturally patient man and this is highlighted by the career of his promising staying mare Let's Make A Deal, a four-year-old who has raced only 11 times.</seg>
<seg id="40">Bred to stay, by Red Ransom from Let's Get Famous, a daughter of the great Let's Elope.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let's Make A Deal started this preparation with an impressive mid-week win over 1600 metres at Sandown and was then tossed in the deep end and ran a pleasing fourth in the group 1 Makybe Diva Stakes at Flemington.</seg>
<seg id="42">She was not disgraced when second to the very smart Star Rolling in Adelaide before a close-up fourth in the Herbert Power Handicap.</seg>
<seg id="43">She will be at her peak today and on her home track she looks a great chance at odds .</seg>
<seg id="44">SUGGESTED BET Although the barrier is awkward, Let's Make A Deal is a nice each-way bet.</seg>
<seg id="45">Flemington Race 5, No.</seg>
<seg id="46">The time-honoured Mackinnon Stakes used to be known as the "practice stakes"" by punters who got used to seeing Melbourne cup candidates have their lead-up run in the Mackinnon - and it was suggested that several were not out to bust their boilers.</seg>
<seg id="47">Not any more, not since the VRC increased the prizemoney to $1 million and re-classified it as a group 1 event.</seg>
<seg id="48">Now it is a great race.</seg>
<seg id="49">This year it's an open affair and my top fancy is Solzhenitsyn, who won his second Toorak Handicap last start and steps up to 2000 metres for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="50">He was very strong in the Toorak and it's interesting that top Queensland trainer Robert Heathcote has removed his blinkers hoping this will help the horse relax.</seg>
<seg id="51">There is no pace here and if he settles okay from his perfect draw, Solzhenitsyn might well outsprint his rivals in the run home.</seg>
<seg id="52">SUGGESTED BET Back Solzhenitsyn to win.</seg>
<seg id="53">The Quaddie</seg>
<seg id="54">Very keen on Complacent, and if the Sydney colt had drawn a better barrier I would be inclined to take him one-out.</seg>
<seg id="55">He was considered fortunate to beat Savvy Nature in the Gloaming Stakes at Rosehill, but over the much tougher 2000 metres in the Spring Champion Stakes at Randwick, he thrashed the same horse.</seg>
<seg id="56">Considering it was only his fifth start, and his third back from a spell, I believe this colt is still on the up and trainer Peter Snowden is happy to run him without a Victorian start.</seg>
<seg id="57">If he has no luck, then I think Polanski and Savvy Nature are the dangers.</seg>
<seg id="58">My numbers: 2, 3, 4.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sharnee Rose has regained her zest for racing since joining the stables of Kris Lees and the astute Newcastle mentor loves nothing more than success at the VRC spring carnival.</seg>
<seg id="60">Sharnee Rose showed ability in her early career and under Lees' care has posted impressive wins at Rosehill, beating Red Tracer, and at Randwick, when she finished too strongly for Queenstown (who has since won easily at Moonee Valley).</seg>
<seg id="61">As always this is a terrific race with several other chances, including the classy Red Tracer, Catkins and New Zealand visitor, Zonza.</seg>
<seg id="62">My numbers: 1, 3, 4, 14.</seg>
<seg id="63">Of the quaddie legs, this is the toughest.</seg>
<seg id="64">Straight racing at Flemington is always a test, with so many starters and guessing which part of the track will be best.</seg>
<seg id="65">The wind can often play a part too, so we'll go wide here, including a few at attractive odds.</seg>
<seg id="66">Albrecht ran a mighty race over this track when first-up then drew the inside gate which didn't suit him last start when a respectable fifth.</seg>
<seg id="67">With James McDonald in the saddle he has a big chance at double-figure odds.</seg>
<seg id="68">Others to include are Albrecht's stablemate, Chiaramonte, Spirit Of Boom, Fontelina, Amaethon and Shamal Wind.</seg>
<seg id="69">My numbers: 1, 4, 8, 9, 11, 15.</seg>
<seg id="70">Peter Snowden is set for another good day, including this final leg where he has two main chances, Galah and Launay.</seg>
<seg id="71">Interesting to see stable jockey Kerrin McEvoy is riding Galah, while Steven Arnold will ride Launay.</seg>
<seg id="72">Galah is ready to win after an excellent second-up third at Caulfield behind Epsom winner Boban, while Launay, although disappointing last start, has won five races at Flemington and is well treated with 56.5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="73">Other chances appear to be British General, a 1400 metres specialist, as well as smart Sydney gallopers Riva De Lago and Strike The Stars.</seg>
<seg id="74">My numbers: 1, 3, 4, 8, 10.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parramatta's Chris Sandow eyes repeat of Broncos demolition</seg>
<seg id="2">Eels' Chris Sandow out to demolish Broncos again.</seg>
<seg id="3">CHRIS Sandow has warned his best is yet to come as the Eels halfback tonight attempts to replicate the demolition job that sparked the Broncos' dramatic freefall last season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Broncos will start favourites in tonight's clash at Parramatta Stadium, but they are wary of the Sandow threat after the pint-sized playmaker tore them apart in their last meeting at Suncorp Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sandow scored two tries in the Eels' 42-22 boilover in round 21 last year, including a superb 50-metre solo effort as Brisbane suffered their second defeat in an eventual six-match losing streak.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sandow has battled at times behind a rookie Parramatta pack this season, but he looked more threatening in the Eels' gutsy 14-10 loss at home to North Queensland last week.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 24-year-old admits he is still searching for self-belief after a difficult maiden season at the Eels in 2012 during which he was briefly dumped by former coach Steve Kearney, now an assistant at Brisbane.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I still have more to give," the Kingaroy-born No.7 said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I have to take on the line a bit more and direct the boys around at the same time as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I needed to get my confidence back (after last season) but I'm happy with the squad we've got, it's a young team and it will take time for us to get better.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was a close game (last week).</seg>
<seg id="12">We made a few errors, I dropped two balls myself and I was filthy with that.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was proud of our effort against the Cowboys, they have an Australian front-row with (James) Tamou and (Matt) Scott, so hopefully we can lift again for the Broncos.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sandow will be ably supported by Eels fullback Jarryd Hayne, who was outstanding against the Cowboys, pulling off three trysaving tackles on Tariq Sims, Gavin Cooper and Tamou.</seg>
<seg id="15">Broncos coach Anthony Griffin warned his side not to be complacent against a Sandow-led Eels side that embarrassed them at Suncorp last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We have to get a job done in the middle first before we worry about Sandow and Hayne," Griffin said.</seg>
<seg id="17">You just have to want to tackle him (Sandow).</seg>
<seg id="18">The moment you watch him pass the football he will come at you, he has made a lot of line-breaks this year.</seg>
<seg id="19">He is playing a lot different this year, he is a lot more direct.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is just a real X-factor for them, he is one of those players that does things that other guys can't do with his short kicking game and his running game.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sandow just seems to be very confident and very positive in his decision-making and everything he is doing.</seg>
<seg id="22">This year he is playing a lot more direct and he is backing himself a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="23">To beat Parramatta you've got to do a good job on him.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Broncos received a boost yesterday with veteran forward David Stagg and front-row firebrand Josh McGuire cleared to play.</seg>
<seg id="25">The duo will replace Jarrod Wallace and Scott Anderson, who drop off a six-man bench.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Parramatta have the calibre of players there and it hasn't clicked a few times for them," Broncos centre Jack Reed said.</seg>
<seg id="27">But last year they put 40 points on us, so we have to go down there with the right attitude and treat them with respect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bulls PG Rose to Start Despite Sore Neck</seg>
<seg id="2">Derrick Rose is in the starting lineup for the Chicago Bulls' home opener against the New York Knicks after missing Thursday's shootaround due to a sore neck.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rose warmed up with black tape on either side of his neck, but opted not to talk to reporters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was in his usual spot at point guard when the starting lineups were released.</seg>
<seg id="5">It will be Rose's first meaningful home game since he injured his left knee in the 2012 playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="6">Coach Tom Thibodeau said earlier that Rose has a sore neck and is a game-time decision.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also said the 2011 NBA MVP isn't sure how he got hurt.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rose tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in the 2012 playoff opener and missed all of last season.</seg>
<seg id="9">He had 12 points in Chicago's season-opening 107-95 loss at Miami on Tuesday night.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rose missed an exhibition game in Brazil due to soreness in his left knee.</seg>
<seg id="11">But that was his only significant setback while preparing for this season.</seg>

<seg id="1">Spices Top List of Possibly Tainted Foods</seg>
<seg id="2">Find Out Which Foods Are Most Likely to Make You Sick</seg>
<seg id="3">Spices are the latest kitchen standby to land on a list of possibly tainted foods.</seg>
<seg id="4">Roughly 7 percent of imported spices tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were contaminated with salmonella, a potentially deadly bacterium.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twelve percent contained insect parts or rodent hairs, according to the FDA report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The bug parts aren't going to harm you, but no one wants to eat those," said ABC News' chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser.</seg>
<seg id="7">The salmonella can cause disease, but probably less than you might think, because we tend to cook the spices.</seg>
<seg id="8">We tend to not use very many of them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, there have been at least 14 spice-related disease outbreaks worldwide in the past 30 years, sickening more than 1,900 people and killing at least two, according to the FDA report.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You usually think it's the chicken, not the paprika," Besser said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Read more about the report.</seg>
<seg id="12">At least 9 million Americans suffer from a foodborne illness caused by a major pathogen each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</seg>
<seg id="13">But there are ways to prevent getting sick from the foods you eat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Read on to learn what you can do to protect you and your family from food poisoning's worst offenders.</seg>
<seg id="15">7 Foods Most Likely to Make You Sick</seg>
<seg id="16">Eggs</seg>
<seg id="17">The Problem: The FDA reports that more than 140,000 Americans are infected each year with the salmonella bacteria from eating eggs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Approximately 30 die.</seg>
<seg id="19">Often the shell is contaminated by animal waste or some other environmental source.</seg>
<seg id="20">Becker said that if the eggs aren't treated properly at the site where they are produced, the contamination is transferred to your kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="21">Safety Tips: Becker advised consumers to avoid eating raw eggs and to cook all eggs thoroughly before eating.</seg>
<seg id="22">It's also important to wash your hands with soap and warm water after handling either the shells or liquid parts of an egg, as well as all surfaces the egg has touched.</seg>
<seg id="23">Diet Pill Review</seg>
<seg id="24">Veggies</seg>
<seg id="25">The Problem: Leafy green vegetables are the number one source of food related illness, according to CDC statistics, and sprouts are another major culprit.</seg>
<seg id="26">Vanessa Coffman, education manager for STOP Foodborne Illness, said vegetables are a major source of salmonella, E. coli and other bacterial infections because they are grown in fields, often directly in the soil, where they can be exposed to pollution, animal feces and countless other forms of contamination.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also, since many vegetables are eaten raw, pathogens may survive even after a thorough washing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Safety Tips: Coffman said the best way to protect yourself from dirty veggies is to wash them thoroughly and cook them whenever possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Keep meat and vegetables separate from one another and use a separate cutting board for each," she advised.</seg>
<seg id="30">Fruit</seg>
<seg id="31">The Problem: Last year, more than half a million cantaloupes were recalled by the Food and Drug Administration.</seg>
<seg id="32">The agency said it was acting in "an abundance of caution" after it was discovered that some consumers had eaten fruit that had tested positive for salmonella.</seg>
<seg id="33">Fruit of all kinds are generally high up on the agency's recall list.</seg>
<seg id="34">Becker said that part of the problem is that one farm may send out contaminated produce all across the country, so outbreaks become widespread very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consumers don't always wash fruit before eating and, although cooking would render it safer to eat, most people eat it raw.</seg>
<seg id="36">Safety Tips: Coffman said that even a fruit with an outer rind, such as a cantaloupe or an orange, should be washed before slicing to avoid dragging pathogens across the entire length of the fruit.</seg>
<seg id="37">Even produce that comes with a "prewashed" sticker should be washed carefully anyway.</seg>
<seg id="38">Fish</seg>
<seg id="39">The Problem: As healthy a food as fish is, it's frequently pulled off grocery shelves due to safety concerns.</seg>
<seg id="40">One common reason, said Coffman, is vibrio contamination, a pathogen related to the bacteria that cause cholera.</seg>
<seg id="41">Vibrio is found in higher concentrations when water gets warmer, so outbreaks are more common in the summer months.</seg>
<seg id="42">Fish can also be recalled due to high mercury concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="43">Just last month, the Texas Department of State Health Services, warned against eating fish caught off the coast of the Lone Star State due to unusually high levels of mercury.</seg>
<seg id="44">If consumed on a regular basis, mercury can cause harm to the central nervous system.</seg>
<seg id="45">Safety Tips: Pregnant women, children and people with compromised immune systems should limit their consumption of fish suspected of high mercury levels and all raw fish, including what's found in sushi.</seg>
<seg id="46">Coffman said that all fish and seafood should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit.</seg>
<seg id="47">Meat</seg>
<seg id="48">The Problem: In April of this year alone, nearly 500,000 pounds of adulterated meat was recalled by the United States Department of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="49">The meat in question was thought to be contaminated with the listeria bacteria, a pathogen that kills one in five people it infects.</seg>
<seg id="50">E. coli, salmonella and parasites are also routine meat and poultry contaminants, according to the USDA's own Inspector General reports, as are antibiotic resistant drugs and pesticides.</seg>
<seg id="51">Safety Tips: Becker stressed how important it is to refrigerate meat to 40 degrees or below until right before cooking it.</seg>
<seg id="52">"That includes outdoor picnics and barbeques," he said.</seg>
<seg id="53">Bring a cooler and keep it chilled until ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="54">Coffman advised using separate cutting boards for meat and washing hands and surfaces with warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds after handling.</seg>
<seg id="55">Proper cooking is also essential to kill as many bacteria as possible.</seg>
<seg id="56">According to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, whole cuts of meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees followed by theee minutes rest.</seg>
<seg id="57">Burgers should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees; poultry and all leftovers to 165 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="58">Nuts and Seeds</seg>
<seg id="59">The problem: This week, a Michigan company recalled its packaged sunflower seeds and all products containing the seeds that were distributed in nine states over a suspected listeria contamination.</seg>
<seg id="60">More commonly, the culprit in nuts and seeds is salmonella.</seg>
<seg id="61">If something goes amiss during the roasting process, the pathogen survives and infected nuts can find their way into grocery baskets.</seg>
<seg id="62">Peanut Execs Could Face Prison Over Salmonella DeathsSafety Tips: Whenever possible eat roasted versus raw nuts.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to protect yourself from accidentally consuming contaminated nuts, Becker advised, is to check for recall updates on the government's Food Safety website.</seg>
<seg id="64">You can also sign up for recall email alerts on the Stop Foodborne Illness website or Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="65">7 Foods Most Likely To Make You Sick</seg>
<seg id="66">Pet Food</seg>
<seg id="67">The Problem: Oh no!</seg>
<seg id="68">Not even Fido is safe.</seg>
<seg id="69">Dog food recalls for salmonella outbreaks are fairly common.</seg>
<seg id="70">Ditto for cat food.</seg>
<seg id="71">An animal that has eaten some bad food will usually experience diarrhea and dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="72">Most will live through it, though youngsters, seniors and pets that are already ill may not.</seg>
<seg id="73">Contamination also poses a high a risk to owners who may be sickened after handling tainted food.</seg>
<seg id="74">Safety Tips: Since your furry friend can't speak up to describe his symptoms, be sure to stay up to date on all recalls.</seg>
<seg id="75">These are listed on the FDA website.</seg>
<seg id="76">If you find your pet's food on the recall list, stop using it immediately.</seg>
<seg id="77">Check with the company's website to learn about disposal methods and compensation.</seg>
<seg id="78">7 Foods Most Likely to Make You Sick This Summer</seg>
<seg id="79">Summary of Best Food Safety Tips From the Experts</seg>
<seg id="80">Wash your hands and all surfaces thoroughly with warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds after handling produce or meat.</seg>
<seg id="81">All meat, poultry and fish should be refrigerated to 40 degrees Fahrenheit or cooler until just before it is cooked.</seg>
<seg id="82">For outdoor picnics and barbeques, bring a cooler.</seg>
<seg id="83">Store produce and meat separately.</seg>
<seg id="84">Store meat on the lowest possible shelf to avoid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="85">Buy a meat thermometer and cook food to its appropriate internal temperature.</seg>
<seg id="86">USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service recommends cooking whole cuts of meat to 145 degrees followed by a three-minute rest time, 160 degrees for ground meat, and 165 degrees for all poultry, whether ground or whole.</seg>

<seg id="1">US air strikes likely as John Kerry says Syria's use of chemical weapons in attack 'undeniable'</seg>
<seg id="2">US Secretary of State John Kerry says those responsible for the attacks will be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Courtesy RT News</seg>
<seg id="4">THE US State Department says it's cancelling a meeting with Russian diplomats on Syria this week.</seg>
<seg id="5">The meeting at The Hague was about setting up an international conference to find a political resolution to the Syrian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="6">A senior State Department official says the meeting between Undersecretary Wendy Sherman and US Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford with their Russian counterparts was cancelled because of the ongoing US review about alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="7">The US says it has evidence that chemical weapons very likely were used by the government of Bashar Assad.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UN convoy carrying inspectors that came under fire from snipers leaves its hotel on the way to investigate evidence of last week's gas attack in Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier, the US warned Syria would face action over the "moral obscenity" of a chemical weapons attack, as UN inspectors braved sniper fire to gather evidence about the incident."</seg>
<seg id="10">Warplanes and military transporters have begun arriving at Britain's Akrotiri airbase on Cyprus, about 100km from the Syrian coast, in a sign of increasing preparations for a military strike, The Guardian reports.</seg>
<seg id="11">The US Navy has four warships armed with cruise missiles on standby in the eastern Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are reports two nuclear submarines are also in the area.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this image taken from amateur video posted online, purports to show a UN official in the suburb of Moadamiyeh in Damascus, Syria, on Monday where the Syrian regime allegedly used deadly chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="14">Picture: AP/Media Office of Moadamiyeh/TV OUT</seg>
<seg id="15">Officials cautioned that no final decisions on force nor a timeline for action had been made.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there is a growing sense in Washington that the clock was relentlessly ticking down towards US strikes against President Bashar al-Assad's regime: the only questions were when and how.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Officials said President Barack Obama has not decided how to respond to the use of deadly gases, a move the White House said last year would cross a "red line."</seg>
<seg id="18">Two administration officials said the US was expected to make public a more formal determination of chemical weapons use on Tuesday night (AEST), with an announcement of Obama's response likely to follow quickly.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this image taken from amateur video posted online, purports to show a UN official measuring and photographing a canister in the suburb of Moadamiyeh in Damascus, Syria.</seg>
<seg id="20">The officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorised to publicly discuss the internal deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The international community appeared to be considering action that would punish Assad for deploying deadly gases, not sweeping measures aimed at ousting the Syrian leader or strengthening rebel forces.</seg>
<seg id="22">The focus of the internal debate underscores the scant international appetite for a large-scale deployment of forces in Syria and the limited number of other options that could significantly change the trajectory of the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="41">"In Australia, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the crisis in Syria was of "historical proportions" and that the global community would be judged on how it responded to current events just like Rwanda in 1994."</seg>
<seg id="42">""Just this morning I had a conversation with President Obama - we discussed how to chart a way forward on this crisis," Mr Rudd said."</seg>

<seg id="70">With China and Moscow expected to boycott any resolution backing a military strike, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the West could act even without full UN Security Council backing.</seg>
<seg id="71">The alleged poison gas attack is only the latest atrocity in a conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="72">Assad, in an interview with a Russian newspaper published Monday, denied accusations his government was behind the attack, calling the charges an ``insult to common sense.</seg>
<seg id="73">"The United States faces failure just like in all the previous wars they waged," he added."</seg>
<seg id="74">"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meanwhile warned of the "extremely dangerous consequences of a possible new military intervention" and said intervening without a UN Security Council resolution would be illegal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge allows Irwindale factory to continue producing Sriracha</seg>
<seg id="2">Though some near Irwindale's Sriracha factory still complain of inflamed asthma and burning throats from the factory's spicy emissions, fans of the popular hot sauce can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Los Angeles Superior court judge ruled Thursday that production at Huy Fung Foods' plant can continue, denying Irwindale's request for a restraining order to stop operations until the company fixes the odor issues.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Huy Fong Foods is grateful with today's ruling denying the preliminary restraining order sought by the City of Irwindale," the company said in an email to The Times.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company has worked with the city and other governmental agencies in this matter and will continue to do so.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thursday's ruling could mean that next year's supply of Sriracha hot sauce is secure.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to a declaration from Huy Fung Foods founder and chief executive David Tran filed in court Thursday, the process of harvesting, grinding, and storing the chiles needed for next year's sauce could be completed in just over a week - well before the next court date.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the pace of the harvest and production process depends on the weather and on the chiles themselves, Huy Fong officials said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Irwindale officials said they will continue to use all legal tools to ensure that the emissions from the factory no longer bother residents.</seg>
<seg id="10">The city has also asked for a preliminary and permanent injunction on operations at the factory, and the next hearing is scheduled for Nov.</seg>
<seg id="11">City Atty.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fred Galante said residents near the factory are experiencing ongoing harm from the plant's spicy, garlicky emissions.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We're still pursuing this," Galante said.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a declaration filed Thursday, Tran said the company first learned of problems when a city councilman's son complained of an odor in late 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company installed carbon filters and thought the issue resolved, but the councilman's son complained again this past September, according to the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company added a second layer of filters and invited inspectors into the plant.</seg>
<seg id="18">City officials, according to Tran, suggested using an air-filtration system that would cost $600,000 to install, but Tran said he wanted to explore other options.</seg>
<seg id="19">Galante said Irwindale filed suit on Monday because Huy Fung Foods decided not to cooperate with the city.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some residents have been complaining, Galante said, including parents of children with asthma who can't play outside thanks to the smell.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If we continue to receive ongoing complaints, we will continue to pursue legal action," Galante said.</seg>

<seg id="5">Coach Nathan Buckley said the Magpies had tried to plug it since the loss to Hawthorn exposed the issue in Round 3.</seg>
<seg id="6">Any solution will be tested on Friday night against St Kilda, particularly its in-form skipper Nick Riewoldt and lively small forwards.</seg>
<seg id="7">"He's back to All-Australian form of three or four years ago," Buckley said after training yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Leading contested marker in the competition, and he runs so hard and blows his opponents up.</seg>
<seg id="9">""So, he's going to be a challenge for one or both of our tall backs and a challenge to hold defensively.</seg>
<seg id="10">We've been taken to the cleaners by Hawthorn and Essendon, two very good sides who have been able to maintain their composure and complete at an exceptional rate.</seg>
<seg id="11">""Now whether that's our pressure or their skill or a bit of both, we need to look after our end of the bargain.</seg>
<seg id="12">We're not defending as well as we'd like to as a team.</seg>

<seg id="14">The stats this morning (in the Herald Sun) were there for all to see.</seg>
<seg id="15">""Our structures are sound.</seg>
<seg id="16">It ends up how committed you are to defending at the contests, first and foremost, and then being able to win your one-on-ones behind the ball ... we rely on our forwards to be able to put pressure on, our mids to be two-way runners and our defenders to be able to win those one-on-ones.</seg>
<seg id="17">And we haven't been able to do it for long enough to this point of the season.</seg>
<seg id="18">Buckley said he had no problem with midfield ace Scott Pendlebury accusing teammates of being "cheats" regarding the defensive aspects of the Anzac Day loss to the Bombers.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We're prepared to speak openly about the challenges we have in front of us," the coach said.</seg>
<seg id="20">There's stronger words spoken behind closed doors on where we're at and where we want to be - how much we're talking about what we want and how much we're actually doing it.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buckley emphasised "the need to spread the responsibility across the back six" to compensate for reliable defender Alan Toovey's season-ending knee injury.</seg>
<seg id="22">He said Brent Macaffer would have the opportunity "to re-establish himself as a defender," with Heath Shaw, Paul Seedsman, Marty Clarke and Harry O'Brien as options.</seg>
<seg id="23">We weren't anticipating that we would be playing our best football in Round 5.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We've still got plenty of players to come back in with experience," Buckley said.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've got full confidence in the players that are incumbent at the moment, but we know we'll be a better side in 10 weeks than we are now.</seg>

<seg id="5">Michigan company Backyard Brains has developed what is calls "the world's first commercially available cyborg" and it involves playing with live cockroaches.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that's not enough to turn you squeamish, this might.</seg>
<seg id="7">To get your cyborg into action, you first cut a live cockroach and then implant electrodes to control the insects' movements using your smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's enough to give you the creepy crawlies, right?</seg>
<seg id="9">Maybe not because the company has already attracted $12,339 which it has raised from 83 backers so some people must dig it.</seg>
<seg id="10">On its website, Backyard Brains says RoboRoach is not a gimmick but "part cockroach and part machine: and 'just good ol' fashion neuroscience, evolution and engineering."</seg>

<seg id="3">Mr Zahra, who has been chief executive of the department store chain for three years, unexpectedly quit last week, citing personal reasons.</seg>
<seg id="4">He will step down once a replacement is found.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Zahra said he plans to take a break for at least six months, but is not ending his management career.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I'm only 47 and I do think there's a bit more in me and I'm certainly healthy and energetic enough to take on another management role," he said on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="10">"There's certainly nothing sinister," Mr Zahra said.</seg>
<seg id="11">He is also prepared to wait some time before a replacement is found.</seg>
<seg id="12">It will be protracted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Equally we know that our competitor will also be looking for a new CEO - that's the way these things work.</seg>

<seg id="15">Despite David Jones picking up an extra 2.1 per cent in sales during the September quarter and growing online sales, Mr Zahra said he would not reconsider his position.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Never say never, but really the board need to find a successor," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">I want to make sure that the handover is seamless for the company, for the team and for me personally so I'm committed to stay until that process happens and that will take time.</seg>

<seg id="4">Several hundred Islamists protested in a few cities on Friday, responding to a call from a pro-Mursi alliance for daily protests until the ousted president stands trial on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Alexandria, seven people were wounded after residents clashed with Mursi supporters before security forces intervened, a security official said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Forty-five Mursi supporters were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fighting also erupted in the Gisr al-Suez district of Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ties between Washington and strategic ally Cairo have deteriorated since the overthrow of Mursi, Egypt's first democratically elected president.</seg>
<seg id="9">The state news agency said Kerry's visit to Egypt, the first since Mursi's fall, would only last several hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">A mass uprising which toppled authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak, a longtime U.S. ally, in February 2011 had raised hopes that military men would no longer dominate Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the man who removed Mursi, army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, has become a wildly popular figure and many Egyptians have turned against the Brotherhood and anyone perceived as its supporter, including the United States.</seg>
<seg id="12">State-run newspapers often carry conspiracy theories which suggest Washington backed the Brotherhood to ensure U.S. domination of Egypt and the rest of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="13">One even reported that President Barack Obama is a Brotherhood member.</seg>
<seg id="14">Those dynamics could make it difficult for Washington to lobby successfully for democracy in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="15">In a sign of the tension, the United States said on October 9 it would withhold deliveries of tanks, fighter aircraft, helicopters and missiles, as well as $260 million in cash aid to Egypt, pending progress on democracy and human rights.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mursi's removal has posed a dilemma for Obama in dealing with a longstanding strategic ally.</seg>
<seg id="17">He wants to maintain ties with the most populous Arab country, which has a peace treaty with Israel and controls the Suez Canal waterway linking Europe and Asia.</seg>
<seg id="18">But he does not want to be seen as acquiescing in the ouster of an elected leader, even an Islamist Washington came to view as ineffective during his turbulent year in office.</seg>
<seg id="19">Washington has repeatedly urged the army-backed interim authorities to govern in a more inclusive manner - code for accommodating the Brotherhood and restoring democratic rule.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has instead taken harsher measures against Egypt's oldest Islamist movement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hundreds of Islamists have been killed and the Brotherhood's leaders are behind bars, leading to fears that some members of the group will take up arms against the state.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Brotherhood and its allies have urged crowds to gather on Monday outside a police institute near Cairo's notorious Tora prison, where Mursi's trial is expected to take place.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mursi has been held in a secret location since July.</seg>
<seg id="24">In that time Islamist militants have staged almost daily attacks against security forces in the Sinai Peninsula and some fear an Islamist insurgency could spread to other parts of Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Supporters and opponents of the Brotherhood, which denies any links to militants, have often clashed in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Egypt has declared a state of emergency and imposed a night-time curfew.</seg>
<seg id="27">A court has outlawed the Brotherhood and ordered its assets seized.</seg>
<seg id="28">On Thursday the authorities took the unusual step of detaining 21 women Brotherhood members in Alexandria.</seg>
<seg id="29">Nasser al-Abd, a senior security official in Egypt's second city, said the charges against the women include using force to disrupt traffic during protests, membership of an outlawed group and distributing illegal leaflets.</seg>
<seg id="30">A lawyer representing the women suspects said they were aged between 15 and 25.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are living in oppression and darkness, said Um Yumna, whose daughter was among the detainees.</seg>
<seg id="32">I can't believe that they made the girls kneel and held up pistols to them.</seg>
<seg id="33">May God avenge this and hurt their hearts like they hurt ours.</seg>
<seg id="34">Abd, the security official, denied any mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Islamists and rights groups accuse the army of staging a coup and returning Egypt to the iron-fisted Mubarak era.</seg>
<seg id="36">The army says it acted in response to mass protests against Mursi and has set out plans for a new constitution and elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will be the result of construction of transport hubs in Moscow</seg>
<seg id="2">Each year, the capital's authorities promise to develop more and more transport hubs (TH).</seg>
<seg id="3">There are plans to commission 255 transport hubs before 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our correspondent found out what the project really entails.</seg>
<seg id="5">A couple of months ago a construction fence arose near the Smolenskaya metro station on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.</seg>
<seg id="6">A sign announced ongoing development of a transport hub.</seg>
<seg id="7">All of this was very strange since no above-ground transport stops near "Smolenskaya" and, consequently, it is impossible to transfer to it.</seg>
<seg id="8">In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sadovoe ring road, it is necessary to cover around 130 meters, including an above-ground crossing over Karmanitskiy lane.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now almost everything is finished at Smolenskaya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The flower kiosk disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced with stone block.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is the entire transport hub.</seg>
<seg id="12">Transport hubs can be planar and extensive, they explain in the press office of the capital's department of transport.</seg>
<seg id="13">So far there are no extensive transport hubs.</seg>
<seg id="14">But planar ones involve the construction of parking areas, removal of shopping facilities that inhibit the movement of passengers, creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, transport specialists do not engage in planar transport hubs, but site improvement professionals from the capital repairs department of the city of Moscow do.</seg>
<seg id="16">A transport hub is not necessarily an elaborate construction, explains the director of the Institute of Economics for Transportation and Transportation Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sometimes a roof overhead and a panel notifying about transport arrival time are enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">Well, for example, they recently opened an entirely full-fledged planar transport hub at the "Yasenevo" metro.</seg>
<seg id="19">Granted, without awnings, but with intercepting parking areas and panels indicating when a bus will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="20">But in pursuit of quantity, officials register as transport hubs everything at hand.</seg>
<seg id="21">As early as 2011 the mayor's office planned to construct only 151 hubs, of which 59 with capital construction.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now as many as 255 transport hubs are listed in plans up to 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">They promise to commission a hundred and fifty of them this year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though there is a transport hub development program in the city, no qualitative criteria are designated, states Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".</seg>
<seg id="25">They report on the number of facilities, but the quality of the transfer on each of them frequently gets worse.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to experts, there should be two criteria: firstly - reduction in transfer time, secondly - convenience.</seg>
<seg id="27">Above all, the capability to change transport mode without going out into the rain.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Moscow, however, with transport hub development sometimes it turns out exactly opposite.</seg>
<seg id="29">A striking example is the "VDNKh" metro.</seg>
<seg id="30">Previously, suburban buses from Yaroslavl highway entered the square in front of the main entrance to the All-Russia Exhibition Center.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now their stops have been re-located to the opposite side of Yaroslavl highway to Cosmonaut street.</seg>
<seg id="32">Further from the metro, significantly further from the monorail, though closer to residential buildings.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even though residents downright did not want a bus terminal under their windows and complained on all possible levels.</seg>
<seg id="34">Extensive transport hubs in Moscow somehow immediately did not succeed.</seg>
<seg id="35">They began to build the first of them about five years ago at the "Planernaya" metro.</seg>
<seg id="36">The project was designed to be exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="37">And in fact it succeeded as an example of how a transport hub sold out to investors is turned into a banal shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="38">No, here there are platforms for buses, an awning so as not to walk from the metro station in the rain, and three floors of bus stops.</seg>
<seg id="39">Granted, they on principle did not provide space to Khimki trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow transport hub.</seg>
<seg id="40">They were pushed away further from the metro as strangers.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, more space was left for trading.</seg>
<seg id="42">32 stores of only clothes, but generally there is almost everything - from pet goods to a car dealership.</seg>
<seg id="43">Well, indeed, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the way?</seg>
<seg id="44">Around here, when they build an extensive transport hub, for some reason a shopping center always results.</seg>
<seg id="45">Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when they decided to put part of a parking area on the market.</seg>
<seg id="46">Now, lively trade is occurring on the third floor of the "Planernaya" transport hub among the parking places marked out on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="47">Vegetables, seasoning, Chinese jeans, non-Russian conversation and security guards maliciously looking at our photographer.</seg>
<seg id="48">The transport hub has completely turned into a bazaar.</seg>
<seg id="49">The thing is, previously there was a market at "Planernaya" metro, but they tore it down.</seg>
<seg id="50">But in the prefect's office they took pity on vendors and let them onto the intercepting parking area of the transport hub.</seg>
<seg id="51">Nevertheless, due to high prices it is always empty there.</seg>
<seg id="52">The most humorous part is that the market was torn down in order to build in its place... the new planar transport hub.</seg>
<seg id="53">That's the shuffle.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the Kaluzhskaya metro, the approach distance from the metro vestibule to the bus made up 50 meters, recounts Alexander Morozov.</seg>
<seg id="55">After construction of the shopping center, allegedly a transport hub, the distance increased to 170 meters.</seg>
<seg id="56">In order to board the bus, it is necessary to walk through the entire shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="57">After 22:00, when it is closed, it is necessary to walk around it under the open sky.</seg>
<seg id="58">By the way, the constructions on Planernaya and Kaluzhskaya will soon seem like roses.</seg>
<seg id="59">In mid September, the urban planning and land commission of the mayor's office confirmed the planning solutions for the first eight extensive transport hubs.</seg>
<seg id="60">Four of them will be 25-storied, not counting the two-three underground levels.</seg>
<seg id="61">The main monster will develop at the Tushino metro, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of area.</seg>
<seg id="62">Representatives of the directorate of railway terminals of Russian Railways who are responsible for construction of the transport hub at the metro have already told journalists: stores, hotels and apartments will be available in future multi-story buildings.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, officials assure that multi-level parking areas will occupy from a third to half of the area.</seg>
<seg id="64">Let's take as an example "public" garages.</seg>
<seg id="65">Let's say that a garage with 258 car spaces, which they recently built on International street, has an area of 8,105 square meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">That means that parking for 2.6 thousand cars at "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will require approximately 80 thousand "squares".</seg>
<seg id="67">This is less than a third of the giant that they intend to build there.</seg>
<seg id="68">Allow one-two floors to go toward all kinds of platforms for buses.</seg>
<seg id="69">There remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.</seg>
<seg id="70">And that, just a minute, is almost two state department stores.</seg>
<seg id="71">If the railway folks will build extensive transport hubs at stations and terminals, then the metro folks will absorb the remaining areas.</seg>
<seg id="72">They also promised that there will be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices, and even gyms.</seg>
<seg id="73">By the way, recently in the property department of the city of Moscow they told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to directly contact officials to acquire a site for a transport hub.</seg>
<seg id="74">Without any tenders.</seg>
<seg id="75">Because, they say, transportation issues for the city are priority.</seg>
<seg id="76">An ideal transport hub is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston and Spadina station in Toronto, assures Alexander Morozov.</seg>
<seg id="77">There, trolleybuses and trams are sent underground to the metro level and the approach distance from the metro car to the tram equals only 50 meters without an exit to the street.</seg>
<seg id="78">There is no unnecessary vending around.</seg>
<seg id="79">But Moscow officials are given to extremes.</seg>
<seg id="80">Either we will not build anything, or we will go as far as build 25 floors with offices and apartments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gazprom's Alexei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria starts new gas era</seg>
<seg id="2">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.</seg>
<seg id="5">South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia's export routes through Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="7">Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."</seg>
<seg id="8">Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year's end.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia is not involved in the struggle with urban vechicle-pollution</seg>
<seg id="2">Attempts to solve transportation problems inherent to large cities have been observed in most of the world's megalopolises since the second half of the 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a rule this has involved either reconstruction and expansion of main roads, or attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and their usage time.</seg>
<seg id="4">One widely known example is that of Singapore, where a rigid quota system curbs the growing number of private vehicles, and the right to acquire vehicles is bought via auctions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its price could be two to three times higher than the actual price of the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="6">European cities, including London, have introduced a fee to drive into the city center.</seg>
<seg id="7">Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, has established so-called green zones that allow only vehicles rated with a certain ecological class that also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).</seg>
<seg id="8">The Beijing environmental protection agency, for example, in 2012 confirmed a "five-year clean air plan" with a total cost of approximately 250 billion yuan (around $40 billion).</seg>
<seg id="9">As told to Kommersant by Lee Kunsheng, the director of the vehicular pollution supervision department of the municipal agency of Beijing environmental protection, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, as well as to prevent the number of privately-owned vehicles from exceeding 6 million (it is currently at 5.2 million) and to prevent fuel usage per vehicle from increasing by more than 5%.</seg>
<seg id="10">Based on data from the agency, in Beijing automotive transport is currently responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.</seg>
<seg id="11">The key measures of the program include restricted use of automotive transport as well as additional taxes imposed on vehicle owners.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the citywide measures envisaged by the "green five-year plan" include an accelerated transition to Euro fuel standards ahead of the rest of the country, introduction of a local system of environmental standards and markings for vehicles and fuels, restricted vehicle access to the central part of the city, prohibited use of outdated vehicles (in addition, the creation of financial incentive programs to replace old cars with hybrids or electric cars), development of electric transportation (including for public and official use), and development of public transport (including high-speed).</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the vehicle-based innovations introduced by Beijing include a measure that prohibits operation of all private vehicles within the fifth transport ring (in total the Chinese capital has six of them) one day per week (appropriate information is displayed on the vehicle license plate), as well as the issuance of vehicle license plates based on a lottery (for example, in 2011, which was the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits to register private vehicles in Beijing made up only a third of the total number from 2010).</seg>
<seg id="14">In accordance with the active government program titled "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities rated with high or very high air pollution shall be reduced to 128 (there were 138 in 2012).</seg>
<seg id="15">According to data from the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011 "mobile sources" accounted for 41% of all air pollutant emissions in cities.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Moscow, for example, emissions from vehicles are ten times higher than industrial emissions, while in St. Petersburg they are nine times higher.</seg>
<seg id="17">At present, the Russian Federation is merely just beginning to think about the possibilities for regulating vehicles on city streets.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Economics for Transportation and Transportation Policy of the Higher School of Economics, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel are notoriously unpopular, and could be accepted by the public only if they are universally applied.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moscow has a unique problem related to the structure of its vehicle population, in which there are two clusters that are only slightly sensitive to any regulatory measures - official and private vehicles, as well as vehicles of "privileged" people who number at least 200 thousand (nearly 5% of the total vehicle population of Moscow).</seg>
<seg id="20">Recently, urban researchers from the EKOM center in St. Petersburg conducted studies that analyze the balance between city territory and residential areas, road surface area and number of motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="21">Main conclusions of the researchers: the city center contains less than half the roads it needs, and the majority of drivers who live in the center do not use their vehicles every day but leave them in parking areas or simply on the streets for long periods.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, they propose construction of vehicle storage areas instead of parking areas, and narrowing of roadways (so that streets become more pedestrian-friendly) instead of their expansion, and also propose placing restrictions on driving and parking personal vehicles within the protected zone of the historical city center (which occupies a territory of approximately 3,212 hectares and covers a number of central districts of the city).</seg>

<seg id="1">China's Footprint Grows in Zambia</seg>
<seg id="2">On Lusaka's Great East Road, the image of a young Chinese woman beamed from a recent billboard encouraging participation in Zambia's census, a symbol of how much China has weaved its way into the nation as a donor, investor and partner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zambia's relationship with China is growing quickly, spurring development but also friction.</seg>
<seg id="4">While there is nationwide gratitude for the scarce jobs and new infrastructure that China has brought, labor relations are sometimes tense and some Zambians complain they are being exploited.</seg>
<seg id="5">This complex relationship between China, a global economic giant, and a financially struggling country is one being played out across Africa.</seg>
<seg id="6">The issues are particularly acute in Zambia, where census data shows that about 100,000 Chinese live and more than 500 Chinese companies are engaged in farming, retail trade, pharmacies, hospitals, information and communication technologies as well as road-building, mining and manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="7">This week Chinese investors made a bid to expand even more into a continent that is rich in natural resources and seen as an area with strong potential for growth at the "Africa Infrastructure and Power Forum" held in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Top executives from Zambia's power company as well as officials from key ministries such as commerce and mining are attending the event, slated to end Friday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other African countries seeking more business with China included South Africa, the continent's biggest economy.</seg>
<seg id="10">South African Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe this week ended a trip to China, the African country's top trading partner.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trade volume between the two countries has grown to $20 billion.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Zimbabwe, Chinese investment has increased so much that Chinese-language signs greet visitors arriving at the international airport in Harare, the capital.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Zambia, a country of 14 million people with a GDP of $20 billion, the impact of China has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The Chinese have changed Zambia," said Nelson Mwendabai, a retired civil servant who ticked off Chinese-backed projects: a railway between Tanzania and Zambia, new roads, schools, clinics and stadiums.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mwendabai said: "We should just accept that they are our friends."</seg>
<seg id="16">Zambian President Michael Sata criticized the Chinese presence as an opposition leader, seeking to harness nationalist unhappiness with Chinese accused of taking jobs from Zambians by engaging in low-pay jobs such as pushing wheelbarrows at construction sites.</seg>
<seg id="17">He changed his tune after his Patriotic Front party won elections in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="18">In April, Sata went to China on an 11-day state visit, soon after new Chinese ruler Xi Jinping took office.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I have come to say 'thank you' for the work the Chinese are doing in Zambia," Sata told Xi.</seg>
<seg id="20">Relations between Zambia and China date back to Zambia's independence from British colonial rule in 1964.</seg>
<seg id="21">The real Chinese push begun in the past couple of decades, as China expanded rapidly and sought natural resources to feed its economy.</seg>
<seg id="22">China's accumulated investment in Zambia stands at over $2.5 billion, mostly in mining and metal refining.</seg>
<seg id="23">Chinese mining of Zambia's copper reserves is an important ingredient in China's industrial production, said Zhou Yuxiao, China's ambassador to Lusaka.</seg>
<seg id="24">Chinese mines are expanding into Zambia's northwest Copperbelt region, where fresh deposits of copper, gemstones, uranium and traces of oil have been located.</seg>

<seg id="1">Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher finalizing long divorce, reports say</seg>
<seg id="2">The high-paid celebs, who called it quits on their six-year marriage in November 2011, are said to have signed the paperwork needed to officially end their union.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it's about time.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since Kutcher officially filed for divorce on Dec.</seg>
<seg id="5">21, 2012, the "Two and a Half Men" star has been openly dating his "That '70s Show" costar Mila Kunis and the former @mrskutcher has recently been linked to Australian pearl diver Will Hanigan, 30.</seg>
<seg id="6">The divorce agreement has been drawn up, according to People, and was simply pending signatures from Moore and Kutcher, People reported.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ex-couple will reportedly file the documents next week, according to Page Six.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kutcher, 35, and Moore, 51, "have finally signed their divorce agreement," a source told Page Six.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are about to file paperwork with the court that will formally end their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="10">The couple's marriage came to a halt just after Kutcher allegedly had a sexual tryst with a young blond at a San Diego hotel.</seg>
<seg id="11">Soon after, Moore hit a downward spiral and suffered a breakdown before briefly entering rehab.</seg>
<seg id="12">The pair have been battling it out with the help of various attorneys since their filing.</seg>
<seg id="13">PHOTOS: 50 most beautiful female celebrities</seg>
<seg id="14">"There had been lengthy negotiations between lawyers for both sides about the financial settlement - in particular, how much he owed her from their marriage," another source told Page Six.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tech entrepreneur has been named one of TV's highest-paid male celebrities by Forbes, earning an estimated $24 million just in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="16">People estimated their joint fortune at more than $300 million and said that Moore was seeking a lump-sum payment of at least $25 million because she believed she had a hand in his numerous tech startups.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Demi introduced him to powerful friends that took Ashton under their wings," a source told the mag.</seg>
<seg id="18">He would not have been able to make so much money if he had not met them.</seg>
<seg id="19">PHOTOS: Our favorite ripped Hollywood hotties</seg>
<seg id="20">And because the "Jobs" star was allegedly cheating on his wife, Moore, who is reportedly worth $150 million, sought spousal support.</seg>
<seg id="21">But TMZ reports that she now thought it no longer mattered.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the filing is in California, Kutcher is not accountable because it is a no-fault state.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kutcher is said to have been "a little more generous than he had to be" in regard to the division of property, and the couple split what they acquired during their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="24">When they filed for divorce, he had just started his stint on "Two and a Half Men" and wasn't taking home as big a paycheck as he is now, TMZ said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both sides are reportedly satisfied with the settlement.</seg>

<seg id="6">A NORWEGIAN shop has been forced to apologise after stocking fake severed body parts in their freezer in a Halloween prank gone wrong.</seg>
<seg id="7">The "chop shop" range of fake severed hands and feet, covered in blood, shrink-wrapped and even sporting nutritional information, were sold next to cuts of meat, NRK reports.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shoppers were horrified to find the bloody hands and limbs in the meat freezers at Europris, which has stores across Norway.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parents were especially concerned that the items would frighten children who were shopping for costumes.</seg>
<seg id="10">After a flood of complaints on social media the store removed the items and issued an apology, with spokesperson Knut Spaeren saying: "We also didn't want to cause any upset, especially not to children and we are withdrawing the range with immediate effect."</seg>

<seg id="1">hacking trial: Prince Harry message 'was hacked'</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 17:04</seg>
<seg id="3">A voicemail message left by Prince Harry, in which he asked an aide for help with an essay, was hacked by the News of the World, a court has heard.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Old Bailey jury saw a transcript of the message left while the prince was at Sandhurst military academy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 2005 document was one kept by former NoW royal editor Clive Goodman, who denies misconduct in public office.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is one of eight people who deny a series of charges.</seg>
<seg id="7">Five are former News of the World journalists.</seg>
<seg id="8">Goodman was jailed for phone hacking in 2007 and subsequently dismissed from his job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Embassy siege</seg>
<seg id="10">During Friday's prosecution opening statements, the court was also told:</seg>
<seg id="11">The then editor of the (NoW), Andy Coulson, told a senior journalist investigating an exclusive story on television celebrity Calum Best to "do his phone"</seg>
<seg id="12">Goodman emailed Mr Coulson in 2003 to ask if he could pay a police officer £1,000 for a royal telephone directory</seg>
<seg id="13">In that email, Goodman said: "These people will not be paid in anything other than cash because if they're discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal charges, as could we."</seg>
<seg id="14">Journalists at the News of the World used hacking as a "perfectly rational but entirely illegal" way of standing up stories</seg>
<seg id="15">Targets included former Home Secretary Charles Clarke, actors Jude Law and Sienna Miller, and former aide to Prince William and Prince Harry, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton</seg>
<seg id="16">While editor at the Sun, Rebekah Brooks personally authorised payments to an MoD official to get stories first, some involving the deaths of members of the armed forces</seg>
<seg id="17">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court that documents from Goodman's employment case against News International, which owned the now-closed NoW, had recently become available after he waived his legal privilege.</seg>
<seg id="18">Goodman kept the documents as evidence to show that what he had done had been sanctioned at a high level of the NoW, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="19">The first document shown to the jury was a transcript of the voicemail message Prince Harry left on the mobile phone of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton, an ex-SAS man serving as his private secretary, in which the prince asked for information about the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege in London.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transcript included the words: "Just wondering if you have any info at all on siege on the Iranian embassy because I need to write an essay quite quickly on that."</seg>
<seg id="21">I need some inf.</seg>
<seg id="22">Have most of the stuff but if you have extra.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Edis told the jury that the voicemail came to the attention of Goodman, who was interested in it as a potential allegation of misconduct to do with essay writing against Prince Harry.</seg>
<seg id="24">The prince was doing his officer training when the events took place around December 2005.</seg>
<seg id="25">The message was accessed by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who was jailed for phone hacking along with Goodman in 2007 and has admitted further phone-hacking charges.</seg>
<seg id="26">The court heard there were discussions between Goodman and his boss, Mr Coulson, about how to run the Harry story without exposing its source.</seg>
<seg id="27">They decided not to refer to the siege in their coverage as it would be "too precise to get through unnoticed."</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Edis said: "Everyone would know that they hacked his voicemail because obviously Harry and Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton both knew that this voicemail was sent and received."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr Edis suggested to the jury that the reason Goodman had kept the emails was because of his arrest.</seg>
<seg id="30">Goodman's prosecution caused Mr Coulson, 45, who denies charges including conspiracy to phone hack, and others at News International to be "extremely worried about what Clive Goodman would do, or say, in the course of defending himself."</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Edis continued: "We can see that they had every reason to be worried."</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun job offer</seg>
<seg id="33">The court heard that concern about keeping Goodman "on-board" was also felt by Mrs Brooks when she was editor of the Sun.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr Edis told the jury about an email exchange between Mrs Brooks and Goodman in which she offered him a job shortly after he had been released from prison in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="35">The court also heard that a source in the military had provided the Sun with a photograph of Prince William at a party while he was at Sandhurst.</seg>
<seg id="36">An email from a Sun reporter to Mrs Brooks stated: "My best contact at Sandhurst, who has provided a string of great stuff over a period of months, is offering us a picture of William at a James Bond party dressed as a Bond girl."</seg>
<seg id="37">He is wearing a bikini and an open Hawaiian shirt.</seg>
<seg id="38">""The chap who has the picture wants £4,000 up front.</seg>
<seg id="39">It will open the door for future exclusives and info.""</seg>
<seg id="40">The newspaper did not run the photo.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mr Edis told the court that Mrs Brooks personally authorised payments to an MoD official via a Sun journalist.</seg>
<seg id="42">He said the only reason for the payments was to make sure the Sun got the story first and some involved the reporting of the deaths of members of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="43">""Sometimes these payments were about things coming into public domain anyway," he added."</seg>
<seg id="44">""In which case there was no good reason at all for the MoD source to accept money to leak them early.</seg>
<seg id="45">The only advantage of that was that the Sun would get the exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="46">It may concern the death of an active serviceman... it really matters when it is released and how it is released to other people affected by it.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mr Edis said: "Mrs Brooks was involved in a conspiracy to commit the criminal offence of misconduct in a public office - and she knew it."</seg>
<seg id="48">Mrs Brooks denies conspiracy to phone hack, misconduct in public office, and perverting the course of justice.</seg>
<seg id="49">The court has heard that three former News of the World journalists, who are not on trial, as well as Mulcaire, had pleaded guilty to phone-hacking charges.</seg>
<seg id="50">The trial was adjourned until Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">There is no "Brotherly Circle" group In Ministry of Internal Affairs databases to which the U.S. linked Leps</seg>
<seg id="2">The "Brotherly Circle" group, to which Washington has linked the singer Grigory Leps, does not appear in the databases of Russian security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="3">As pointed out to Interfax in law enforcement agencies of the RF, after reports of Grigory Leps being entered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury into blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brotherly Circle" emerged in the media, all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.</seg>
<seg id="4">Security Agencies believe that distribution of such information helps maintain the myth about the so-called "Russian mafia", which supposedly operates abroad.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Even in the name itself - 'Brotherly Circle', there is a certain element of mystery, containing a hint of a secret lodge.</seg>
<seg id="6">"All this is very similar to a PR stunt," said an agency source.</seg>
<seg id="7">On October 31, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the entry of Artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Ribalskiy and Igor Shlikov into its blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brotherly Circle".</seg>
<seg id="8">The persons entered into this list are suspected of links to a certain Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and are on U.S. sanctions lists since February of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for delivering money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".</seg>
<seg id="10">At Grigory Leps' production center, they declined to comment on the U.S. accusations leveled at the singer, calling it "nonsense".</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2011, president of the United States Barack Obama added the syndicate "Brotherly Circle" to the list of "significant transnational organized criminal groups" and ordered the Department of the Treasury to "disrupt and inhibit their global criminal operations".</seg>
<seg id="12">A person's entry into blacklists of the American Department of the Treasury entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with him by persons living in the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">There is no point being a vegan in Siberia: a hothouse tomato will not replace soup</seg>
<seg id="2">A correspondent from RIA Novosti explained why vegetarianism does not suit life in Siberia.</seg>
<seg id="3">People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here they could not endure the winter without damage to health, and no hothouse tomatoes will compensate them, believe Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors surveyed on the eve of Vegetarian Day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Drink liters of oil</seg>
<seg id="6">Strict vegetarianism, when they abstain not only from meat and fish, but also from milk, honey, eggs, is becoming a popular way of life.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, doctors-nutritionists are confident that to follow such strict norms in nutrition in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia is at the least unhealthy.</seg>
<seg id="8">A total rejection of animal products is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="9">In animal proteins there are essential amino acids that are very difficult to compensate with vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is absolutely necessary to include at least milk or eggs into a diet," assures nutritionist Marina Bogai.</seg>
<seg id="11">She cites as an example fish containing the essential fatty acid Omega-3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The vegetable oil most rich in it is made of flax.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In order to consume it in the amounts required for a human, it is necessary to drink liters of it!" says the nutritionist.</seg>
<seg id="14">Medical professionals are confident that residents of Siberia need to give special attention to diet in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="15">During this season, vegetarianism is especially dubious.</seg>
<seg id="16">In our actual living conditions, high demands are placed on food.</seg>
<seg id="17">Increased caloric content is needed not to freeze.</seg>
<seg id="18">"If a person restricts his animal products, he will fall short of that caloric content accordingly," says the specialist.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctor-nutritionist Olga Poznyak agrees with this.</seg>
<seg id="20">She adds that imported vegetables and fruits is not a solution.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is better for a person to eat predominately products that were raised in the region of residence or there where he was born.</seg>
<seg id="22">The genetic code is configured for better assimilation and digestion of these products.</seg>
<seg id="23">And in winter people do not want to gnaw on a cucumber, but hot soup or something else more nourishing," the doctor explains her view.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to her, out of what vegans can eat, really healthy are various cereals, croups, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this is unequivocally insufficient for good nourishment.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, in the bodies of Siberians the level of vitamins is sufficient only from the middle of August through the middle of September.</seg>
<seg id="27">A full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and snow lies in May, is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="28">The body needs energy for life, and that is, above all, fat," states the medical professional.</seg>
<seg id="29">Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="30">Children are growing, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.</seg>
<seg id="31">But by adhering to vegetarianism, we provide them inadequately.</seg>
<seg id="32">Pregnant women also need high-protein food, vitamins and minerals on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Vegans do not receive enough of them," assures Bogai.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arifulina says that an adult person is free to choose whatever he likes, "to play with the toys that he wants".</seg>
<seg id="35">He has an already formed body, skeleton, organs.</seg>
<seg id="36">But children nonetheless must be nourished adequately.</seg>
<seg id="37">If parents deprive him of some kinds of minerals or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, this is simply a violation of the child's rights.</seg>
<seg id="38">"You will not be able to restore tomorrow deficiencies of some or other substances for development of the brain, vision, bones," she says.</seg>
<seg id="39">All surveyed expert medical professionals agree on the low quality of winter-grown hothouse and imported vegetables and fruits.</seg>
<seg id="40">What they import to us and what is grown in hothouses contains less minerals essential to us than (grown) on open ground.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The quality of products is not right," says Bogai.</seg>
<seg id="42">Arifulina also notes that imported and hothouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sometimes the desire of producers to gather a large harvest harms quality.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Apples do not become brown when cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and grow moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and non-aromatic," the medical professional cites examples, adding that they are most likely crammed with an excessive amount of fertilizers.</seg>
<seg id="45">And they become providers not of vitamins, but of cellulose.</seg>
<seg id="46">The head of the laboratory of the Siberian physics and technological institute of agricultural issues, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with this.</seg>
<seg id="47">She says that with the correct approach and adherence to all norms and requirements, it is possible to grow wholesome vegetables in hothouses.</seg>
<seg id="48">If they try to force out more from a square meter, then, of course, they also begin to water more frequently, and overfeed plants with mineral fertilizers.</seg>
<seg id="49">For example, when there are too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and not sweet," she explains, adding that the issue of quality primarily depends on the conscience of the producer.</seg>

<seg id="2">I love you.</seg>
<seg id="3">I can't cope without you': What Rebekah Brooks wrote to fellow hacking suspect Coulson as he tried to end six-year affair</seg>
<seg id="4">Coulson's command revealed to court in email to suspect Ian Edmondson</seg>
<seg id="5">Tabloid had feared that model Best would go to rival about new baby story</seg>
<seg id="6">Prosecutor Andrew Edis: 'Coulson fully in the know about phone hacking'</seg>
<seg id="7">News of the World targeted MP Charles Clarke over false affair accusations</seg>
<seg id="8">His secretary's phone was hacked by Glenn Mulcaire in hope of finding proof</seg>
<seg id="9">Yesterday six-year affair between Coulson and Rebekah Brooks revealed</seg>
<seg id="10">Letter found on Brooks's declared her 'love' for her NotW number two</seg>
<seg id="11">By Martin Robinson</seg>
<seg id="12">Andy Coulson ordered a senior News of the World journalist investigating the love life of George Best's son Calum to 'do his phone', the Old Bailey heard today.</seg>
<seg id="13">In an email David Cameron's former spin doctor demanded his news editor Ian Edmondson hack the model's voicemails fearing the celebrity went to a rival newspaper about becoming a father, the prosecution said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The command was written on the day before the News of the World published an exclusive story that Best was having a baby with former model Lorna Hogan, the jury was told.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the dock: Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson arrive at London's Old Bailey for the trial's third day today, which heard that Coulson 'knew phones were hacked' and even demanded it in the case of Calum Best</seg>
<seg id="16">Prosecuting QC Andrew Edis said: 'What does he mean?', adding: 'They wanted it to be exclusive because they were paying Hogan a lot of money for the story.</seg>
<seg id="17">They were concerned about leaking because Calum may leak their story to the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">Target: Model Calum Best was targeted by Coulson and his team in case he went to a rival about his story, the court heard</seg>
<seg id="19">'The evidence that we have doesn't actually reveal that there was any phone hacking of Best but it doesn't mean there wasn't'.</seg>
<seg id="20">Callum had bragged he has close friends on the NotW so he might know what they are planning.</seg>
<seg id="21">How are they going to investigate this?</seg>
<seg id="22">In the e-mail of May 20, 2006, he says three words "do his phone."</seg>
<seg id="23">So the prosecution say frankly the evidence against Ian Edmondson is absolutely overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is quite clearly guilty we say on count one - (phone hacking).</seg>
<seg id="25">You will decided in the end whether that is right or not.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Edis said phone hacking was part of cycle whereby the papers would uncover private information and then pay a third party for a kiss and tell story,</seg>
<seg id="27">'There will have been sources there which gets them towards the phone hacking which gets them towards a source,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mark Oaten was a promising MP with the Liberal Democrats and had hoped to lead the party.</seg>
<seg id="29">'They found out that he had been having an affair with a young man who they pursued to sell the story - kind of a kiss and tell story,' said Mr Edis.</seg>
<seg id="30">That was discovered, or investigated, by using phone hacking but eventually it went into the paper because they paid the young chap a lot of money</seg>
<seg id="31">The story was 'an example of hacking working with sources to put the story in the paper.'</seg>
<seg id="32">Andy Coulson 'knew phones were hacked in bid to prove former Home Secretary Charles Clarke was having an affair'</seg>
<seg id="33">News of the World editor Andy Coulson was 'fully in the know' as phones were being hacked to try to prove Home Secretary Charles Clarke was having an affair, the Old Bailey heard.</seg>
<seg id="34">The 45-year-old 'must have known' voicemails were being listened to illegally when reporters believed the politician was sleeping his blonde diary secretary Hannah Pawlby, the jury was told.</seg>
<seg id="35">Coulson, who went on to be David Cameron's spin doctor, even tried to personally confront Mr Clarke over the alleged affair on the day the tabloid went to press.</seg>
<seg id="36">Couple: Mrs Brooks and her husband, who is on trial for perverting the course of justice, walk towards the Old Bailey on the day after her affair with Andy Coulson was revealed</seg>
<seg id="37">'Mr Coulson was, at the time we are looking at, fully in the know about phone hacking', said prosecutor Andrew Edis QC.</seg>
<seg id="38">This was a pretty big story the News of the World was looking to run if they can.</seg>
<seg id="39">Attack: Blagger Glenn Mulcaire was asked to hack MP Charles Clarke's secretary's phone to prove false allegations they were having an affair, the court heard</seg>
<seg id="40">'They got a tip, but there are a lot of those, some rubbish, some turn out to be true, but they don't put in the paper on the basis of a tip.'</seg>
<seg id="41">He said private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was asked by the News of the World to hack phones associated with Mr Clarke, including Ms Pawlby's and her sister's, proved by his notes made at the time.</seg>
<seg id="42">Emails show they also put reporters outside Ms Pawlby's house to try to catch her and her boss in the act.</seg>
<seg id="43">'In the third step, the editor gets involved and puts the story to them, hoping to get some sort of reaction that enables them to get it in the paper', said Mr Edis.</seg>
<seg id="44">The editor was personally involved in the third one, he obviously knows about the surveillance, but what about the first one, does he know about the phone hacking.</seg>
<seg id="45">He says no, we say "Oh yes he does.".</seg>
<seg id="46">Yesterday the trial heard Rebekah Brooks had a secret six-year affair with Andy Coulson before he became David Cameron's spin doctor, the phone hacking trial heard yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="47">The pair, both of whom were married, are said to have had a romance at the height of a phone hacking conspiracy in which the News of the World is alleged to have targeted celebrities, politicians and royals.</seg>
<seg id="48">Part of an astonishing love letter from Brooks to Coulson, written after he tried to end their affair in February 2004, was read to the jury yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="49">Revelation: Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson (left, in September 2004) were having a secret affair for at least six years, the Old Bailey heard.</seg>
<seg id="50">Coulson is pictured leaving the court earlier this week with wife Eloise (right)</seg>
<seg id="51">Famous: Eastenders star Ross Kemp and Rebekah Wade married in 2002 but later divorced in 2009</seg>
<seg id="52">In the letter Brooks, who was married at the time to actor Ross Kemp, told Coulson, who was also married: "The fact is you are my very best friend."</seg>
<seg id="53">I tell you everything.</seg>
<seg id="54">I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you.</seg>
<seg id="55">We laugh and cry together.</seg>
<seg id="56">In fact without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope.</seg>
<seg id="57">I'm frightened to be without you.</seg>
<seg id="58">In it, she also expresses her fears about how they will maintain a professional relationship.</seg>
<seg id="59">She asks him: "How do we really work this new relationship?"</seg>
<seg id="60">There are a hundred things that have happened since Saturday night that I would normally share with you.</seg>
<seg id="61">Yesterday Brooks and Coulson did not look at each other as they sat side by side in the dock while the letter was read out.</seg>
<seg id="62">Brooks glanced down at her lap, pursing her lips, while Coulson stared straight ahead.</seg>

<seg id="65">Brooks's current husband and co-defendant, Charlie Brooks, sat a few yards away in the dock.</seg>
<seg id="66">Moments earlier Brooks had glanced at the public gallery where Coulson's wife of 13 years, Eloise, was notably absent.</seg>

<seg id="73">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said the letter went to the heart of the case, proving that the two editors trusted each other implicitly and kept no secrets from one another at a time when phone hacking was rife on their watch.</seg>
<seg id="74">The document was found on a computer hidden in a cupboard when Scotland Yard raided Brooks's London flat in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="75">It was unclear when, if ever, it was sent.</seg>
<seg id="76">Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire; Coulson, also 45, from Charing in Kent; former NotW head of news Edmondson, 44, from Raynes Park, south west London; and the tabloid's ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, from Woodford Green, Essex, all deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
<seg id="77">Case: Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, left, has admitted intercepting voicemails, and NotW chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck has also admitted charges</seg>
<seg id="78">Guilty: Former News of the World journalist James Weatherup (left) and his news editor Greg Miskiw (right) have also been accused of breaking the law by intercepting voicemails, the Old Bailey heard</seg>
<seg id="79">Brooks is also accused of two counts of conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office - one between January 1 2004 and January 31 2012 and the other between February 9 2006 and October 16 2008 - linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public officials.</seg>
<seg id="80">Coulson is also facing two allegations that he conspired with former royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, from Addlestone in Surrey, and other unknown people to commit misconduct in public office - between August 31 2002 and January 31 2003, and between January 31 and June 3 2005.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is claimed that Goodman paid palace policemen for copies of royal phone directories - allegedly authorised by Coulson - to get information on members of the Royal Family.</seg>
<seg id="82">Brooks also faces two allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice - one with her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, from Chelmsford in Essex, between July 6 and 9 2011; and a second with her husband, Charles Brooks, and former head of security at News International, Mark Hanna, and others between July 15 and July 19 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1">The £420,000 ticket to the past: 19th century train station left untouched since its closure during Dr Beeching's cuts in 1965 goes up for sale</seg>
<seg id="2">Norham Station in Northumberland comes complete with its original signal box, waiting room and platform</seg>
<seg id="3">Was purchased by the final station master Peter Short after its demise 48 years ago and could sell for £420,000</seg>
<seg id="4">By Victoria Williams</seg>
<seg id="5">When a 19th century village railway closed in 1965, time stood still.</seg>
<seg id="6">Station master Peter Short couldn't bear to leave, so he and his wife preserved all the original features and turned it into a museum.</seg>
<seg id="7">They raised their four children in the station master's house and lived there until they died.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scroll down for video</seg>
<seg id="9">Time capsule: Norham Station was closed during the Beeching Cuts in 1965 and is now up for sale</seg>
<seg id="10">At a stand still: The old 'sleeper' station near the Scottish Border does not look much different to how it was in the 19th century where milk churns would arrive every morning to supply the town's shops</seg>
<seg id="11">Now their children are selling Grade II-listed Norham Station in Northumberland and its three acres of land for £420,000.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Shorts" daughter, Amanda Yule, 47, said her father was loath to leave so he rented it for five years after it closed, before buying it for £800 in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="13">The family kept their free-to-enter museum open till 2010.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mrs Yule said: "My dad loved the romance of the railway and my mum's dad was a steam train driver, so the railway was in our blood.</seg>
<seg id="15">We'd love a railway enthusiast to buy the station and keep it just as it is.</seg>
<seg id="16">Built in 1851, the station still has its original signal box, ticket office, waiting room and platform and its buildings are full of railway memorabilia - right down to the enamelled advertising hoardings for Gold Flake cigarettes and the platform's Victorian gas lamps.</seg>
<seg id="17">It served its community for decades, taking deliveries of milk churns and food on the platform and allowing villagers to travel the length of the small branch line, but was abandoned by British Rail when Dr Beeching's axe fell in 1965, leaving it to the care of its station master who purchased it for just £800.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Short, who also acted as signalman, bought the station and all its buildings - including the engine shed and goods warehouse - and chose not to change a thing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Richard Landale, of Sale & Partners, who is handling the sale of the station and its three acres of land, said: 'In parts Norham appears to still be a working station, so much has been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a testimony to the quality of the original building, as well as the love and care of Mr and Mrs Short, who bought the station when it closed, and restored it.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tracks: The platforms on either side of the station still remain with the benches and lights in tact</seg>
<seg id="22">Tracks: The station stood on a 23-mile stretch of track which served the border town of Coldstream and the a number of communities in rural Northumberland</seg>
<seg id="23">The original signal box still remains on the site, but has not been used for around 60 years</seg>
<seg id="24">Controls: The signal box still contains the old levers which would transfer locomotives across the tracks and guide them into the small station</seg>
<seg id="25">Waiting: This photo from the station's early years shows men, women and children ready to board an approaching train</seg>
<seg id="26">Single or return?</seg>
<seg id="27">Owners could use the Station Masters office where nothing has moved since its closure, every detail from tickets, lost property forms and the Station Master's glass still remain</seg>
<seg id="28">Untouched: A ticket which has been left on the desk since 1965 shows a journey from Marylebone Station in London and a pair of glasses and a pipe used by the ticket inspector</seg>
<seg id="29">Office: Papers lay strewn around the old station master's desk while a jacket remains hanging in the window</seg>
<seg id="30">Attachment: The last station master, Peter Short, did not want to his old workplace go to waste, so bought the site in 1970 for just £800, he has since passed away</seg>
<seg id="31">Authority: The station master would have gone through his daily routine wearing this hat, which has become slightly frayed since the station's closure</seg>
<seg id="32">Ewan Harris, a partner at the firm, added: 'This is a unique and rare opportunity to purchase a perfectly preserved railway station.</seg>
<seg id="33">Stations do come up for sale from time to time, but never with as much property or land attached, nor as well preserved.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not only is this a home, it is also a piece of history, and it is unlikely there is another station similar in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="35">Norham Station was built in 1851 and stands on the North East Railway Line that ran from Tweedmouth in England, across the border to Sprouston Junction, Kelso, in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="36">Brought about by the Newcastle & Berwick Railway Act of 1845, the 23-mile track served the border town of Coldstream and the rural communities all along the route.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its one claim to fame arrived in 1948 when the East Coast Main Line was flooded and for three months, through the autumn, express trains were diverted along the branch, including The Flying Scotsman.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Shorts, who showed visitors around the free-to-enter museum they ran until its closure in 2010, described it as 'a lovely, happy little station' where milk churns arrived each morning, goods were delivered for local shops and parcels for the villagers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Hut: A shovel lies against the wall of the porter's cabin, which has not been used in almost 50 years</seg>
<seg id="40">Delivery: Old receipts detailing where parcels and post would be send remain stamped and in their pigeon holes</seg>
<seg id="41">Controversial: Richard Beeching holding one of the reports which would lead to the closure of thousands of railway stations across the country in the 1960s</seg>
<seg id="42">When British railways reached their peak at the end of the First World War, they faced increasing competition from the road networks and car manufacturers who were selling more affordable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="43">Therefore Dr Richard Beeching was brought in to restructure the rail network in order to save money.</seg>
<seg id="44">The two reports, published in 1963 and 1965, identified 2,363 stations - one-third of those in the network - and around 6,000 miles of track to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">The publications set out in stark terms how nearly half of the nation's 7,000 railway stations generated only 2 per cent of the total rail traffic, while one-third of the entire track carried just one per cent of the traffic.</seg>
<seg id="46">Two-thirds of the rolling stock was not used all the year round.</seg>
<seg id="47">One extreme example of this under-use highlighted by Beeching was in Norfolk, where the line between Thetford and Swaffham carried an average of only nine passengers on five trains a day.</seg>
<seg id="48">Not surprisingly, his proposal sparked outrage from commuters, local councils and the trade unions, who were appalled at the talk of 70,000 job losses.</seg>
<seg id="49">Route: The discarded tickets was from a passenger who took a journey from South Shilbottle Colliery to Norham Station</seg>
<seg id="50">Toys: A large model railway was built inside the booking office to make the property perfect for any train enthusiast</seg>
<seg id="51">Decor: Milk churns, a trailer and a collection of posters from the 1960's adorn the outside of the station building which leads out onto the platform</seg>
<seg id="52">Danger: A sign next to the station warns passengers against going on the track, but the fine is relatively cheap by today's standards</seg>
<seg id="53">Family: Sandra (left) and Amanda Short, daughter's of the station's final station master Peter, said they had fond memories of the station growing up</seg>
<seg id="54">Exterior: The Shorts, standing outside the front of the house, said they would prefer a rail enthusiast to buy the site to keep it as it is</seg>
<seg id="55">History: This family photo of the Shorts show how it has been a part of their family for decades</seg>
<seg id="56">Profit: Following the death of their father in 2008, they are looking to sell the station for £420,000, which was bought for £800 in 1970</seg>

<seg id="1">Gary Sinise builds homes and hope for wounded veterans</seg>
<seg id="2">"How many 28-year-olds do you know who actually own their own house?" asks Sgt. John Peck while at his home in Spotsylvania, Va.</seg>
<seg id="3">Peck, a new home owner, doesn't live in just any ordinary house.</seg>
<seg id="4">He resides in a smart home designed to make his life easier.</seg>
<seg id="5">He uses an iPad to help open doors, access cabinets and turn the lights on and off.</seg>
<seg id="6">A quadruple amputee, Peck was severely wounded on May 24, 2010, in Afghanistan during his second tour of duty with the Marines.</seg>
<seg id="7">While searching for improvised explosive devices with a metal detector, Peck and his fellow soldiers were going through rooms of a compound when Peck came across a 3-foot tall storage unit.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was a tall guy.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was six foot," said Peck.</seg>
<seg id="10">"And it was kind of hard for me to get into that little spot...I had to get on my hands and knees, and everything was clear and then I turn to my patrol leader and I'm like, "Hey, Sgt. Mandez, I'm going to go hold security outside.</seg>
<seg id="11">I turn around -- and boom, I stepped on the IED.</seg>
<seg id="12">He blacked out, and although he doesn't remember what happened next, Peck does recall saying to himself, "Don't let me die here.</seg>
<seg id="13">I don't want to die here.</seg>
<seg id="14">They put me on the helicopter and I saw the helicopter medic...and he's like, 'Alright, we're going to put you to sleep.'</seg>
<seg id="15">And I thought to myself, 'I'll see these guys in a few more days.'</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, I didn't wake up for three months," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Once conscious, Peck learned the harsh reality of his situation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Apparently, as soon as I got blown up, my right arm was gone, my right leg was gone just above the knee.</seg>
<seg id="19">My left leg was gone just above the knee.</seg>
<seg id="20">Peck's left arm was later amputated, and ever since, the Illinois native has been learning how to adjust to his new life.</seg>
<seg id="21">One thing that's made the transition easier is his smart-technology home.</seg>
<seg id="22">Built and funded in 2012 by the Building for America's Bravest, a joint program between Tunnel to Towers and the Gary Sinise Foundation, the house has helped provide Peck with a sense of independence.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I was expecting this little itty bitty cardboard box, and it turned out to be this monstrosity and I was quite surprised that they got that much and did all this and didn't really ask for anything in exchange -- just come help us out at the run/walk in New York and stuff like that," said Peck.</seg>
<seg id="24">Actor Gary Sinise is able to help fund houses like Peck's by hosting fundraising concerts with the Lt. Dan Band, a music group he named after the character he portrayed in the 1994 film, "Forrest Gump."</seg>
<seg id="25">Sinise plays bass in the group, which tours throughout the year to help raise both awareness and money for military and first-responder communities.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since its start, the initiative has built or broke ground on some 27 houses for wounded veterans.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition to the money raised at concerts, the groups have partnerships with General Electric (which donates appliances to the home) and American Airlines (which transports Sinise's band members to fundraising concerts).</seg>
<seg id="28">When I played Lt. Dan in 'Forrest Gump' I never thought that 20 years later I'd still be associated with the character.</seg>
<seg id="29">I knew it was an important movie and I very much wanted to play the part.</seg>
<seg id="30">I have Vietnam veterans in my family and have been associated with Vietnam veterans groups for many years prior to that.</seg>
<seg id="31">So, I really wanted to play the ['Forrest Gump'] part.</seg>
<seg id="32">But could have I predicted that 20 years later people would still call me that?</seg>
<seg id="33">And I'd walk into the hospital room of a double amputee and he would recognize me for that?</seg>
<seg id="34">And that would open the doors for a conversation?</seg>
<seg id="35">I couldn't have predicted that.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Sinise, 58, has decided to embrace it: "They [veterans] related to the fact that I played a catastrophically injured solider and that stuck with me."</seg>
<seg id="37">For Peck, things are a lot brighter today than when he first came home from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="38">His mother lives with him, and without her help, Peck says he "would be dead."</seg>
<seg id="39">Even twisting a soda cap off a bottle is a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="40">If it hasn't been open before, I can't do it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="41">Peck also has a service dog who not only provides comfort (he cuddles with Peck), but also helps him with everyday activities like getting undressed.</seg>
<seg id="42">"If I drop something on the ground, he can pick it up for me," he said.</seg>
<seg id="43">Peck, who split with his wife shortly after returning home from Afghanistan, also gets support from his new girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="44">"My girlfriend always encourages me, which always helps out," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Improvements in instruments increase supernova hunt chances</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Astronomers at Ohio State University predict sometime during the next 50 years a supernova occurring in our home Milky Way galaxy will be detectable from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="3">Advances in cameras and new strategies for observation make it almost 100 percent certain such a cosmic event will be detectable from Earth -- at least in the form of infrared radiation, they said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unfortunately, they noted, the odds of a shining stellar spectacle being visible in the nighttime sky to the naked eye drop considerably -- to about 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">But astronomers will have the advantage of having high-powered infrared cameras to point at the sky at a moment's notice, providing a solid chance of doing something for the first time: detecting a supernova fast enough to witness what happens at the very beginning of a star's demise.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We see all these stars go supernova in other galaxies, and we don't fully understand how it happens," astronomy Professor Christopher Kochanek said.</seg>
<seg id="7">We think we know, we say we know, but that's not actually 100 percent true.</seg>
<seg id="8">A massive star becomes a supernova when it's used up all its nuclear fuel and its core collapses, just before it explodes violently and throws off most of its matter into space.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's the event astronomers hope to catch at the moment it begins, close enough to us to reveal clues to the process.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Today, technologies have advanced to the point that we can learn enormously more about supernovae if we can catch the next one in our galaxy and study it with all our available tools," Kochanek said.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- The U.S. average price for a gallon of gasoline in October was cheaper than last year but an Illinois refinery fire caused regional woes, the AAA said.</seg>
<seg id="3">A monthly survey published Thursday showed gasoline prices in all 50 states were down from a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alaska, Utah, Arizona and California had the largest declines with prices, on average, 41 cents lower than last year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan had the smallest decreases, with an average 7.7 cent decline from last year.</seg>
<seg id="6">AAA spokesman Michael Green told UPI motorists in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio were experiencing higher gasoline prices, though, because of a fire last week at a Citgo refinery in Lemont, Ill.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is possible that consumers in the Great Lakes region will pay higher prices in the days ahead as suppliers compensate for reduced refinery production," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Football - a cause for discord?</seg>
<seg id="2">In the State Duma as part of "Open Tribune", politicians and experts spoke about how to maintain national peace in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among the proposals, the following was heard: ban football in the Northern Caucasus because from this game comes nothing but scandals and discord.</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulevo and said that in order to reduce the "degree of tension in society" politicians and mass media must be proper in statements.</seg>
<seg id="5">Probably he had in mind the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one telecast threatened to enclose the Caucasus with barbed wire if they did not want to limit the birth rate there...</seg>
<seg id="6">All speakers also talked about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples inhabiting Russia, which added confusion to the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maksim Grigoryev stated that the events in Biryulevo are a "model conflict, which could have been predicted", but "here too many people and authorities are responsible for these issues", and with seven nannies the child loses an eye.</seg>
<seg id="8">The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe practiced a long time in relation to migrants, according to the social activist, has broken down, and one need to find own way.</seg>
<seg id="9">The historian Yuriy Petrov entrusted great hopes on a new unitary history book.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is also necessary to create a handbook on the cultural history of peoples of the country, so that high schoolers in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gennady Zyuganov suggested introducing criminal liability for "appeals to dismember Russia": "If in the U.S. you say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska back to Russia, then they will arrest you and give you 20 years in prison!"</seg>
<seg id="12">Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard to "not incite".</seg>
<seg id="13">As usual, he blamed everything on journalists, who bring out painful and incisive national problems into public discussion: "In the heat of polemics one could say anything!"</seg>
<seg id="14">The leader of the fraction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev instantly recommended journalists to conclude a "charter" and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then politicians can also undertake the same responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the procedure overall has been established, stated Mr. Vasilyev.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an example he cited the law that makes regional and municipal authorities responsible for interethnic peace on their territory.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm regarding this law: it does not contain "clear representations about what adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.</seg>
<seg id="18">This means that subjects will interpret the scope of those authorities in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, municipalities do not have the staff necessary to resolve so many complex issues, no resources, and the center will not give them the methodological recommendations that they could utilize...</seg>
<seg id="20">The head of the Duma Committee on Ethnic Matters Gadjimet Safaraliev proposed creating a special department with the formidable name "Ministry of National Security", which would engage in issues of national politics.</seg>
<seg id="21">But Valeriy Tishkov, who in the 90's headed a similar department that was subsequently abolished, opposed.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is sufficient to have a special person on the federal level, "a minister without a briefcase" who you can call upon if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We walk on the edge, shells are exploding nearby, it is very important for representatives of various ethnicities and religions to oppose provocations together, and this work must receive proper informational support," said the representative of Russian Orthodox Church for public relations Vsevolod Chaplin.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to him, there should be no neutrality of the government in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here Oleg Nilov diverted the discussion to an unexpected course: "It is hard to find more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, but they are pushed the wrong way, down the wrong road," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The wrong road" is the development of football: "Here an entire crowd beats up a footballer, there they burn flags, there comrades throw rocks at each other...</seg>
<seg id="27">Maybe we don't need such football?</seg>
<seg id="28">There is another kind of sport - it's called rugby...</seg>
<seg id="29">"They will have no equal in this type of sport!" the Just Russia party member said heatedly.</seg>
<seg id="30">No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - instantly intervened Mr. Zhirinovsky.</seg>
<seg id="31">You offer them curling too!</seg>
<seg id="32">Need to know national specifics, that's the same as offering a "Zaporozhets" to a Georgian"...</seg>
<seg id="33">In Yaroslavl representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves with wild behavior in the stands - during a game with a local club.</seg>
<seg id="34">We will have to ban football throughout the country...</seg>

<seg id="2">The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, earning 125 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the deceased Michael Jackson, whose postmortem income from October of 2012 through October of 2013 amounted to 160 million, "outdid" her.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noticeably behind him are other deceased celebrities who last year "earned" several times less.</seg>
<seg id="5">Second in the list of the most "prosperous" departed celebrities compiled by Forbes magazine at year's end was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and a line lower the author of Peanuts comics Charles Schultz with 37 million.</seg>
<seg id="6">Besides them, into the first five went Elizabeth Taylor, who was leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).</seg>

<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., put a hold on Jo Ann Rooney, President Obama's navy undersecretary pick, due to her remarks about military sexual assaults.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gillibrand's office said the senator, a member of the Armed Services Committee, took the unusual move against Obama, a fellow Democrat, because she was "extremely troubled" by Rooney's justification of why she didn't like Gillibrand's proposal to remove the chain of command from decisions to prosecute allegations of sexual assault and other major crimes in the military.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rooney, tapped by Obama to be the Navy's No.</seg>
<seg id="5">2 civilian, told the Armed Services Committee ahead of her confirmation hearing her justification had to do with the limits of evidence in the military.</seg>
<seg id="6">"A judge advocate outside the chain of command will be looking at a case through a different lens than a military commander," Rooney said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">I believe the impact would be decisions based on evidence rather than the interest in preserving good order and discipline.</seg>
<seg id="8">Basing decisions solely on evidence would be bad because "I believe this will result in fewer prosecutions and therefore defeat the very problem that I understand it seeks to address," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gillibrand said it was "shocking statements like those of Jo Ann Rooney that further erode" the trust sexual-assault victims place in the system.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The United States legal system is based on evidence, justice and due process," Gillibrand said in a statement first reported by Capital New York.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why isn't this good enough for our service members who risk everything to protect those freedoms?</seg>
<seg id="12">Gillibrand said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The brave men and women we send to war to keep us safe deserve nothing less than a justice system equal to their sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="14">If you were a service member raped on duty, why would you have confidence to come forward and report after hearing that basing decisions to prosecute solely on evidence would be a bad outcome?</seg>
<seg id="15">"Jo Ann Rooney's testimony should send chills down the spine of any member of the armed services seeking justice," she said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rooney, currently principal deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said after her original comment she never meant to suggest military commanders shouldn't weigh the evidence when deciding whether to prosecute sexual-assault allegations.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My original answer expresses the view that commanders must evaluate more than the evidence," Rooney said in a letter to Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich.</seg>
<seg id="18">Other considerations for commanders include morale and discipline within the ranks and the possibility of "non-judicial punishment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The White House had no immediate comment on Gillibrand's hold on the nomination, which will require Rooney to receive 60 votes for confirmation.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- Derrick Rose saved an otherwise forgettable effort Thursday by hitting the winning shot with 5.7 seconds left to give Chicago an 82-81 victory over New York.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bulls scored only 11 points in the fourth period and missed nine consecutive attempts from the field down the stretch, but pulled out the win when Rose launched a shot over two defenders from the baseline that rattled home.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chicago bounced back from a season-opening loss to Miami while the Knicks missed a chance to open the campaign with two straight victories.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Knicks still trailed by 10 heading into the final period, but the Bulls went cold from the field and New York came back to tie it at 80-80 when Iman Shumpert made two free throws with 1:15 remaining.</seg>
<seg id="7">New York's Tyson Chandler was fouled with 10 seconds to go while fighting for a rebound and he made 1-of-2 from the line to put the Knicks in front.</seg>
<seg id="8">That set up the shot by Rose, which he put up over both Chandler and Raymond Felton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rose, playing in his second game after missing the entire 2012-13 season, led Chicago with 18 points but made only 7-of-23 from the field and suffered four of the Bulls' 18 turnovers.</seg>

<seg id="1">2 killed, dozens rescued as flooding sweeps Texas</seg>
<seg id="2">AUSTIN, Texas - Two men were killed as heavy rains across Central Texas swelled rivers and creeks and triggered flash flooding Thursday, prompting dozens of rescues across a region that's been dealing with a long, punishing drought.</seg>
<seg id="3">About 10 miles south of Austin, one frightening rescue involved a couple whose SUV was swept away by floodwaters.</seg>
<seg id="4">They were forced to cling to trees for hours until a helicopter rescued them on Halloween morning.</seg>
<seg id="5">In all, the National Weather Service said, more than a foot of rain fell across Texas' midsection, including up to 14 inches in Wimberley, southwest of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">The storm system stretched across much of the nation, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast, and carried heavy rain and strong winds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In South Texas, Houston motorists were slowed during morning rush hour because of downpours and sporadic flooding.</seg>
<seg id="8">Austin police reported that the body of a man 50 to 60 years old was found Thursday in the city's flooded Onion Creek.</seg>
<seg id="9">The body was found in a pile of flood-strewn debris Thursday afternoon, according to a police report.</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier, the Austin American-Statesman and KVUE-TV reported that the Caldwell County sheriff's office said a man died Thursday after driving on a low-lying portion of road overtaken by flooding.</seg>
<seg id="11">The victim was swept out of his vehicle in Dale, south of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="12">No identities have been released for either man.</seg>
<seg id="13">Emergency crews in and around Austin responded to more than 100 rescue calls, often with boats and life rafts, but few were more harrowing than one in the town of Buda.</seg>
<seg id="14">Around 4 a.m., rescuers near Little Bear Creek spotted a man and his girlfriend in trees about 200 yards from the roadway.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fire Capt. Craig Odell said rescuers encouraged the pair to "hang on" until the helicopter arrived.</seg>
<seg id="16">The man and woman, whose names were not released, estimated they were in the water about four hours before they were hoisted to safety, Odell said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They're definitely very lucky," Odell said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Both victims suffered lacerations and were treated for hypothermia; the man broke his nose.</seg>
<seg id="19">By Thursday afternoon, the skies had cleared in much of the state and a warm sun was shining, meaning most youngsters didn't have to rethink trick-or-treating.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their parents might, however.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Texas Department of Public Safety warned those out for Halloween fun "to be prepared for continued rising water and flooding."</seg>
<seg id="22">First Independent Baptist Church in south Austin had hoped to attract 2,500 students Thursday night to a fall festival featuring booths and music on the church grounds.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think people will be here tonight, working," pastor Daniel Trinidad said of his church, where head-high floodwaters washed away an outdoor baptismal deck and reduced the vestibule to a soggy mess of water-logged pews and mud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Community members were sweeping water out of the building and trying to dry framed artwork and church documents.</seg>
<seg id="25">"They want to help out, not do Halloween," Trinidad said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Elsewhere, Austin's Onion Creek overflowed, trapping Sabrina Loyless' neighbors atop their car.</seg>
<seg id="27">Loyless was awakened around 5 a.m. by their screams for help, and the 30-year-old tried to wade across the street - but ended up clinging to tree branches.</seg>
<seg id="28">"When I got about halfway across the road, I realized how bad an idea it was," said Loyless, who hours after her rescue was wrapped in a firefighters' blanket and waiting for the water to recede so she could get back into her home.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mike Brown, 54, was still barefoot as he waited for permission to return to his trailer, which he thinks will be a total loss.</seg>
<seg id="30">The auto-salvage yard employee said he awoke to water all around him - even seeping into his bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"My possessions were floating around," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">I opened my door and swam out.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Red Cross deployed two relief trucks from Fort Worth to Austin to aid flood victims with cleanup.</seg>
<seg id="34">On a front lawn near Brown, landscaper Lee Dufrene was keeping watch over three small horses from a local ranch.</seg>
<seg id="35">He and others led another 15 larger horses to high ground, but when floodwaters crested, the animals were gone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"I woke up at 3:30 to the sound of horses plunging through the water," said Dufrene, who choked back tears when he talked of his missing 1-year-old horse, Sunny.</seg>
<seg id="37">The horses might have run away and then been rescued by emergency crews, but he didn't know.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've still got hope," Dufrene said.</seg>

<seg id="1">David Tennant 'thrilled' to receive Ian Richardson ring</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 09:25 By Rebecca Jones Arts correspondent, BBC News</seg>
<seg id="3">David Tennant said he was "touched and thrilled" to receive a ring belonging to the late Scots actor Ian Richardson to wear on stage as Richard II.</seg>
<seg id="4">Richardson, best known for playing the scheming politician Francis Urquhart in House of Cards, played the role at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="5">Former Doctor Who actor Tennant has been wearing the amber stone ring since receiving it from Richardson's widow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It's lovely to have this as a kind of talisman," he told the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tickets to see Tennant's performance are sold out in Stratford-upon-Avon and London.</seg>
<seg id="8">But disappointed fans have a chance to see the actor in the RSC's production when it is broadcast live into cinemas around the world on 13 November.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shared history</seg>
<seg id="10">The actor, who has received much attention for the long hair extensions he wears for the part of Richard II, received the large brass ring on the press night for the play, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="11">Richardson's widow, Maroussia, found it while she was tidying up at home.</seg>
<seg id="12">She said she thought it was "a good idea" to give it to Tennant, because he went to the same drama school as her husband.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both actors were born in Scotland and she said she was keen to celebrate the "Scottish connection."</seg>
<seg id="14">Tennant said he was "touched and thrilled" when it arrived.</seg>
<seg id="15">I immediately wanted to wear it in the performance.</seg>
<seg id="16">I wanted to have a bit of Ian Richardson on stage with me, giving me a hand," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The actor, who is currently on the small screen in the legal thriller The Escape Artist, added he has been wearing it ever since.</seg>
<seg id="18">It means an enormous amount to me.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was terribly moved.</seg>
<seg id="20">It felt like a blessing and encouragement from history.</seg>
<seg id="21">The piece joins a sonic screwdriver Tennant was given after playing Dr Who.</seg>
<seg id="22">But he said he was committed to passing it on one day, "to make sure that the legacy moves on."</seg>
<seg id="23">"This ring needs to find its way down the generations," he added.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richardson won the Bafta for best TV actor award for his portrayal of Tory chief whip Urquhart in House of Cards, which ran for four episodes in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="25">The character was said to have been based on Richard III and Macbeth, with cunning asides to the camera used as an essential way to pull viewers into the story.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although he gained his highest profile in film and television work, Richardson - who died in 2007 - was also a leading Shakespearean stage actor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Legislative bans have forced Russians to drink less beer</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian brewers are in a bad mood.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to their estimates, consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the previous level, and that is the best case scenario.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although businessmen initially expected growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">After all, the current year is developing unsuccessfully for them: sales dropped by 7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of this was told by the head of one of the largest beer brewing companies in the country, chairman of the Council of the Russian Beer Brewing Union Isaac Sheps at the Adam Smith Institute's 3rd annual conference "Day-to-day Goods in Russia", which just completed in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="7">At it they discussed government regulation of the market.</seg>
<seg id="8">From 2008 through 2012 the Russian beer market already contracted by 18 percent since in recent years in the country we are observing significant strengthening of regulation of the beer brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - a beverage with small alcohol content, Sheps told listeners.</seg>
<seg id="9">There's no other country in the world with such rigid restriction of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of more and more new irrational bans that are supposedly founded on a battle against alcohol abuse.</seg>
<seg id="10">The beer brewer complained that many legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not exert any real influence, nonetheless more and more new initiatives are constantly emerging.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ban on selling alcohol in kiosks that was introduced this year hit beer producers the hardest of all.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers," said Isaac Sheps.</seg>
<seg id="13">Beer brewers have two forecasts for the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Optimistic - the one Sheps talked about: sales of the frothy beverage will remain at the previous level.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pessimistic - they will drop by another 2-3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move from varieties that are tailored to the mass consumer to the "premium" class: there will be less beer, but it will cost more.</seg>
<seg id="17">Meanwhile, radical consequences from the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are so far not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Based on my observations, the level of alcoholism disorders remains at approximately the same level," said doctor-narcologist Aleksei Sotnikov.</seg>
<seg id="19">Granted, there is an increased percentage of patients who consumed surrogates of hard liquors, as well as those who "got hooked" on alcohol-containing tonics such as "Jaguar", while ten years ago specifically "beer-based" alcoholism was dominant.</seg>

<seg id="1">Presently Roman Senchin is in Paris at a presentation of his novel "Yeltishevi", translated into French.</seg>
<seg id="2">Let us recall that precisely this novel of his became a finalist for four awards: "Clear glade", "Russian Booker", "National bestseller" and "Big book".</seg>
<seg id="3">And last year for this book the author was conferred awards from the government of the Russian Federation relating to culture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of present-day thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Virtually every publication of his harsh stories and tales based on modern life material incites heated debates among critics from the most diverse areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is fair to say that, combined together, the articles on prose and political essays of Senchin, reviews of his books and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990's to the beginning of the 2010's.</seg>
<seg id="7">In discussions on the works "of one of the most controversial modern writers", according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, the dialog for the most part is guided by how participants understand the word "literature", how they view the present and future not only of our literature, but also of our life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The guts of the 12-foot-long B61 nuclear bomb</seg>
<seg id="3">Weighing the utility of nuclear weapons has always been more theology than science.</seg>
<seg id="4">That was made clear again Tuesday when the House Armed Services Committee's strategic forces subcommittee poked into the need to spend $10 billion or more improving the Pentagon's existing arsenal of B61 nuclear bombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The advocates of a reliable, potent and fresh nuclear deterrent argue that investing in a retooled B61 is a good use of scarce taxpayer dollars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those less inclined to spend money on nuclear weapons no one ever wants to see used suggest newer B83s can do the job for at least the next decade.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are the only two bomber-dropped gravity bombs left in the U.S. atomic arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not surprisingly, the representatives from the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, which builds the nation's nukes, support the modernization plan.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This B61 weapon arms the B-2," Air Force General Robert Kehler, chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, said.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will arm the future long-range strike platform.</seg>
<seg id="11">It arms the current dual-capable aircraft that are forward stationed in Europe as well as those of our NATO allies that maintain dual-capable aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it's the candidate weapon to arm the F-35 in that dual-capable aircraft role.</seg>
<seg id="13">The B83 won't do, Kehler said.</seg>
<seg id="14">It doesn't work with as many kinds of aircraft, and frankly, it's just too destructive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It has a very high yield," he said, referring to the size of the explosion it would create.</seg>
<seg id="16">And we are trying to pursue weapons that actually are reducing in yield because we're concerned about maintaining weapons that would have less collateral effect if the President ever had to use them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kehler acknowledged fretting about collateral damage in a nuclear war sounds strange.</seg>
<seg id="18">"However, there is a direct relationship between yield and collateral damage," he added.</seg>
<seg id="19">Without getting too Strangelovian here...the [B83] weapon is not as flexible as the B61...in terms of our ability to use various yields that would be matched to the targets.</seg>
<seg id="20">The B83, truth be told, is a city-destroyer.</seg>
<seg id="21">First detonated in 1984, its yield (adjustable, but about a megaton) is 75 times that of the "Little Boy" that destroyed Hiroshima.</seg>
<seg id="22">The B61 also sports an adjustable yield, but it ranges from a much more modest 0.3 to 340 kilotons, no more that a third of the B83′s punch.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the nuclear realm, that makes it more of a threat - because of its smaller yield, it is more likely to be used - and consequently generates more deterrence.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kehler said the nation needs an improved B61 to bolster the chances that it will never be detonated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The ultimate objective of the nuclear deterrent is to make sure that the weapons are never used.</seg>
<seg id="26">"And yet, we use them every day to do that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's almost counterintuitive from people who aren't informed, but we use those weapons every single day.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police of the Canadian city has announced that it possesses the corresponding video recording and is prepared to begin an investigation on the city's mayor.</seg>
<seg id="4">CNN reports that the latter declared that he will not resign from his post .</seg>
<seg id="5">Information that authorities have proof of consumption of narcotics by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto police website.</seg>
<seg id="6">The head of local law enforcement agencies Bill Blair held a press conference on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sheriff said that he is not authorized to share the particular video clips with the public, however he guarantees their existence.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to Blair, the compromising video of Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-narcotics raid conducted by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of this video, however until recently there had been no confirmations.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mayor himself does not provide any comments on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="11">He only says that he is not guilty of anything and does not intend to resign.</seg>
<seg id="12">The video recording discovered by the police is one piece of evidence in the case of the 35-year-old friend of Ford, Alexander Lisi, who is accused of soft narcotics dealing, extortion, illegall income acquisition, as well as criminal conspiracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">At times Lisi served as the driver of Rob Ford.</seg>
<seg id="14">City residents have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.</seg>
<seg id="15">The latter repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public while drunk, took the liberty of making racist and sexist statements.</seg>

<seg id="1">China plea paper 'to be overhauled'</seg>
<seg id="2">A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the New Express is to undergo "full rectification," the regulator said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "rectification" order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.</seg>
<seg id="7">A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="8">"New Express's editorial management was disordered," the regulator said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license."</seg>
<seg id="10">It had also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.</seg>
<seg id="12">After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.</seg>
<seg id="15">I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've realised my wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.</seg>

<seg id="4">The show has been plagued by scandal in its eight year history, mainly due to a number of tasteless stunts and insensitive comments from Kyle Sandilands.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here are the five most infamous moments that landed the show in the headlines for all the wrong reasons:</seg>
<seg id="6">March 2007: Sandilands offended the boys in blue after calling a police officer an "a**ehole" on air after he was pulled over on his drive into work.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They're (Highway Patrol) scum," Sandilands said.</seg>
<seg id="8">This clown, right, didn't even have the guts to stand in front of my own window so I can see his face and I thought 'What a wanker!'</seg>
<seg id="9">Kyle Sandilands leaves 2DAY FM in his Ferrari after resigning on air this morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">September 2007: The show was inundated with complaints after they allowed a young man to confront his father live on air after he caught his dad performing a sex act on another man.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sandilands admitted to Andrew Denton on Enough Rope that he didn't consider the ramifications of airing the call.</seg>
<seg id="12">What the producers will come and say this guy's contacted the show.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the situation with his dad.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's been two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Um his dad hasn't told his mother; he doesn't know what to do.</seg>
<seg id="16">Boom, he's on.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is real life.</seg>
<seg id="18">"This happens out there, so you know we don't we don't go out looking for it; they come," Sandilands said.</seg>
<seg id="19">July 2009: The show was forced to take a two week 'recess' after a stunt with a 14-year-old girl strapped to a lie detector went horribly wrong.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the segment, the distressed teenager was asked to discuss her sexual history live on air in front of her mother.</seg>
<seg id="21">The stunt was cut short when she claimed to have been raped when she was just 12-years-old.</seg>
<seg id="22">Several of the show's advertisers, including QANTAS and Optus, withdrew their sponsorships from the program.</seg>
<seg id="23">As a result of the stunt, Sandilands was sacked as a judge on Channel 10's Australian Idol, with a network statement saying, "Idol has remained a family-focused show ... His radio persona has taken on a more controversial position ... which is not in the interest of the show."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kyle Sandilands" Australian Idol contract was reportedly worth $1 million.</seg>

<seg id="26">September 2009: Sandilands was suspended for almost a month after vilifying Magda Szubanski on air.</seg>
<seg id="27">The shock jock suggested that the comedian, who had battled with weight issues in the past, should be put in a concentration camp to shed some kilos.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Watch the weight fall off," he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Szubanksi, whose father was a polish fighter in World War II, said the comments were "abhorrent."</seg>
<seg id="30">April 2010: Newsreader Geoff Field quits the show after Sandilands accused him on air of being intoxicated at a work function.</seg>
<seg id="31">Field had been with the show since 2005 and was often on the receiving end of taunts from Sandilands.</seg>
<seg id="32">Just after Field left, Sandilands spoke to Media Week about the openly gay newsreader, saying he's "closer to dumb than most people think."</seg>

<seg id="1">Hugh Bowman aiming for a rare trifecta: Derby, Cup and baby</seg>
<seg id="2">Hugh Bowman in Melbourne with wife Christine, who is expecting a baby in five weeks.</seg>
<seg id="3">BEFORE the end of the year, champion jockey Hugh Bowman could have won his third Victoria Derby, his first Melbourne Cup - and become a new father.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bowman will be trying to claim the first two legs of the "trifecta" at Flemington during Cup Week, starting with Polanski in the AAMI Victoria Derby (2500m) today.</seg>
<seg id="5">He will then team up with the Lloyd Williams-owned Seville in the Group 1 Melbourne Cup (3200m) on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then his wife, Christine, the popular TVN producer, is due to give birth to the couple's first child in five weeks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Christine saw her doctor earlier this week to ensure she could travel to Melbourne and watch her husband ride in the Derby and Melbourne Cup.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hugh Bowman returns to scale after winning The Metropolitan aboard Seville.</seg>
<seg id="9">"My doctor said I could go down to Melbourne for Cup Week as there is no fear I will go into labour," Christine said.</seg>
<seg id="10">I'm not sure if I will go out to the track because I will be on my feet all day but I'll be cheering for Hugh.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hugh believes he can give his wife plenty to cheer for today, particularly with Polanski in the Derby.</seg>
<seg id="12">His other Group 1 rides are Pakal (Mackinnon Stakes), Villa Verde (Coolmore Stud Stakes) and You're So Good (Myer Classic).</seg>
<seg id="13">Hugh, already a two-time Derby winner on Lion Tamer (2010) and Sangster (2011), said Polanksi showed enough in his Norman Robinson Stakes win last start to suggest he will be very hard to beat today.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Polanski is going the right way about things," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He gave me a really good feel when he won at Caulfield last start.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's still a bit 'new' but he's big and strong and I know he will stay.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the winning post he was only just getting warm the other day so he gives me the impression he will run the 2500m.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hugh Bowman's Victoria Derby hope, Polanski, enjoys the media attention.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hugh conceded Derby co-favourites Complacent and Savvy Nature are obviously Polanksi's main dangers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I thought probably Complacent was the pick of them, he as been there and done it." he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">In his last two Sydney starts, he did get a beautiful run but he was strong to the line.</seg>
<seg id="22">If he has any luck, he will be in the finish.</seg>
<seg id="23">Savvy Nature came off his Spring Champion Stakes third behind Complacent to score a very easy win in the Vase at Moonee Valley last week.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Savvy Nature was impressive the other day but in a sense it was put on for him," Bowman said.</seg>
<seg id="25">I don't think he went a whole lot better than he has been going.</seg>
<seg id="26">He did nothing out the back, they went hard, and he didn't beat much, to be honest, although he did win very easily,</seg>

<seg id="1">Open joint-stock company Rostovaeroinvest declared the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner in the tender to select the general designer of a facility.</seg>
<seg id="2">At Rostovaeroinvest they are not disclosing the contract amount.</seg>
<seg id="3">Based on information from the press service of the open joint-stock company, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the tender, and according to the terms of the tender the design must be prepared and submitted for state expert review in the spring of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal for the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and landscaping for the airport complex.</seg>
<seg id="5">During the first phase of construction, the interior area of the terminal will amount to 50 thousand square meters, with its possible future expansion.</seg>
<seg id="6">Based on data from Rostovaeroinvest, prospects for development of the airport complex will be taken into account in the design project: by 2025 the terminal will be capable of providing service to around 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.</seg>
<seg id="7">By the time the tender results were tallied, the architectural concept of the "Yuzhniy" air terminal complex, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been determined.</seg>
<seg id="8">The design for the main terminal building embodies the concept of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience implementing large-scale projects, the company designed terminals C and E of Sheremetyevo International Airport and the new air terminal complex at "Knevichi" international airport in Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Yuzhniy international airport complex will be built in the Aksaysky district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and ultimately integrated into urban development.</seg>
<seg id="11">The start of construction of the air terminal complex is planned for 2014, the commissioning of all facilities - for 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2">The food allowance for a family of four persons is being reduced by 36 dollars per month</seg>
<seg id="3">Starting Friday in the U.S. funding of grocery vouchers known as "food stamps" is being reduced because the corresponding government program is expiring.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now 36 dollars per month less than before will be allocated for the food assistance benefits of a family of four persons, say officials.</seg>
<seg id="5">This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Based on data from the agency Reuters, in the 2012 fiscal year benefits per person amounted to 133 dollars per month on average.</seg>
<seg id="7">Expenses on food assistance in the U.S. grew to 80 billion dollars per year due to the growth of unemployment and of prices on food products.</seg>
<seg id="8">Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food assistance issued via "food stamps", bearing such a name from earlier times when they had the shape of paper coupons.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded in order to stimulate growth of the economy and help the poorest Americans.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, Republicans in Congress demand to carry out further cuts in funds allocated for the program, declaring that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.</seg>
<seg id="11">Owners of grocery stores throughout America are worried that cuts will lead to reduced expenditures of consumers.</seg>
<seg id="12">U.S. congressmen continue to debate on how to possibly cut even more financing of the government.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shanahan on Haynesworth: 'Lazy, Lack of Passion'</seg>
<seg id="2">Mike Shanahan leveled a scathing critique at Albert Haynesworth on Thursday, saying the former Redskins defensive lineman was "lazy" and had a "lack of passion" and "lack of character."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Washington Redskins coach was responding to comments made this week by Haynesworth, who told Tennessee Sports Radio that Shanahan is "conniving," self-centered and will run quarterback Robert Griffin III "into the ground."</seg>
<seg id="4">Asked for his reaction, Shanahan began his answer and then stopped himself and started over - because he wanted to "say it the right way."</seg>
<seg id="5">Then he hammered home a zinger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"When you don't get along with somebody as a head coach or an assistant coach, it usually falls into one of those areas - lazy, lack of passion, and a lot of times lack of character," Shanahan said.</seg>
<seg id="7">And he fits all three.</seg>
<seg id="8">Haynesworth signed a $100 million free agent contract with the Redskins in 2009, but he and Shanahan clashed frequently after the coach arrived in Washington a year later.</seg>
<seg id="9">Haynesworth became an NFL punch line when he needed 10 days to pass a conditioning test at the start of training camp and lost his starting job.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was eventually traded for a fifth-round draft pick and is perhaps the biggest free agent bust in league history.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latest back-and-forth began when recently retired Redskins tight end Chris Cooley, who now has his own radio show, called Haynesworth "an awful human being."</seg>
<seg id="12">Haynesworth then went on the radio to say that Cooley "sounds as stupid as he looks" and then went after Shanahan, pointing out the coach's lack of success in the playoffs with the Denver Broncos after John Elway retired.</seg>
<seg id="13">He's conniving and everything like that. ...</seg>
<seg id="14">I mean, the guy is all 'me, me, me.' ...</seg>
<seg id="15">"They're always going to try to blame RG3 for something," Haynesworth said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's never going to be the head coach's fault.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ever.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's unusual for Shanahan to respond to such vitriol from a former player, but this time he did so with a smile.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You usually take the high road as much as you can, I usually do," Shanahan said.</seg>
<seg id="20">But he's been talking quite a bit, over the last couple of years, so I thought at least I'd be honest with you guys and tell you how I feel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police recover video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford allegedly smoking crack</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Toronto police said Thursday they have video of Mayor Robert Ford allegedly smoking crack and have arrested a friend of Ford's on extortion charges.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police Chief Bill Blair announced the finding and released documents showing Ford and Alexander Sandro Lisi frequently met in out-of-the-way places where they sometimes exchanged packages.</seg>
<seg id="4">Afterward, Ford told reporters at City Hall there is no reason for him to resign, the Toronto Star reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I wish I could come out and defend myself," Ford said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unfortunately I can't, because it's before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ford has consistently denied smoking crack ever since questions arose after the newspaper reported on the existence of video evidence seen by its reporters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Blair announced Thursday forensic investigators were able to recover video files that had been deleted from a computer hard drive Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's safe to say the mayor does appear in the video," Blair told reporters Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We have recovered a digital video file which is consistent with that which has previously been described in various media reports," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Blair said, the evidence does not support bringing criminal charges against Ford.</seg>
<seg id="12">I'm disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="13">I know that this is a traumatic issue for the citizens of this city and for the reputation of this city and that concerns me.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Star said a document released with the video describes frequent meetings between Ford and Lisi near Dumpsters or on vacant parking lots at night -- as well as about 400 telephone calls between the two, and a flurry of calls May 16, 2013, as the Star and the Gawker website were first reporting on the video showing Ford smoking crack.</seg>
<seg id="15">The content of the calls was not reported.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lisi, 35, was arrested Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cronulla centre Ben Pomeroy is leaving the club to play in France.</seg>
<seg id="3">Source: TheAustralian</seg>
<seg id="4">ENIGMATIC Cronulla centre Ben Pomeroy has played his last game for the NRL club and will take up a two-year deal with French Super League outfit Catalans Dragons.</seg>
<seg id="5">The French club announced the acquisition of the 29-year-old on their website.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous said Pomeroy was an important addition to his side.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ben has played over 160 NRL games and will bring all his experience to our squad," Frayssinous said."</seg>
<seg id="8">""He is very powerful, runs and tackles hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will be an asset to our attack and defensive line.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pomeroy, who could delight and frustrate Sharks fans in equal measure, scored four tries in 20 games this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">His robust running style came under scrutiny after he appeared to strike Newcastle utility Kurt Gidley with his forearm while carrying the ball in their round 20 clash at Shark Park in August.</seg>
<seg id="12">The incident sparked a melee and Pomeroy was put on report but he was not charged by the NRL match review committee.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pomeroy played 158 games for Cronulla from 2006 to 2013 after joining the Sharks following two seasons at Penrith where he played 10 NRL games.</seg>
<seg id="14">His place in the centre at the Sharks in 2014 will be taken by former Wests Tiger Blake Ayshford who has joined Cronulla on a two-year deal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pomeroy has been signed by the Dragons as a replacement for winger Damien Blanch who has been linked to premiers the Sydney Roosters, where he could reunite with his former mentor Trent Robinson.</seg>
<seg id="16">He coached the French side before linking up with the tricolours for the 2013 NRL season.</seg>
<seg id="17">Pomeroy's last game for Cronulla was in their 24-18 loss to grand finalists Manly in the second week of the finals.</seg>

<seg id="1">As Long as You're Watching People Have Sex, You Could Be Learning Something</seg>
<seg id="2">Illustration by Tom Gauld</seg>
<seg id="3">Once, 15 years ago, I spent three strange days hanging around the Sheraton hotel in Universal City - which is not so much a city as a mostly unincorporated area in Los Angeles County that houses Universal Studios and its attendant theme park - reporting on an event that billed itself as an academic conference on the First Amendment and pornography.</seg>
<seg id="4">I was there on assignment for a magazine that was introducing a section on education, and the hook was that the conference was being sponsored by the Center for Sex Research at California State, Northridge, and something called the Free Speech Coalition, which I later learned was the lobbying arm of the adult-entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having never attended an academic conference, I didn't know what to expect, but the mix yielded some highly amusing juxtapositions, some bordering on parody.</seg>
<seg id="6">Panels on Victorian pornography and erotic vases from Ancient Greece were presented alongside topics too out there to even try to euphemize.</seg>
<seg id="7">My job, as I remember, was to soak in the ambience, filter it through my disbelief and report back in arch tones.</seg>
<seg id="8">In other words, the article would write itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">No doubt my experience of the conference was also filtered through an unholy trifecta of inexperience, selective focus and confirmation bias, but I was pretty quickly struck by how hostile to inquiry (for an event co-sponsored by a research center) the conference seemed to be.</seg>
<seg id="10">To be honest, I don't recall attending any panels on Victorian pornography or Ancient Greek vases, and maybe if I had, then my one-sided experience would have been mitigated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Instead, over the next few days I found myself absorbing one unrelenting, expertly media-trained "celebratory" paean to commodified sex-positivity after another, and feeling more and more depressed by the hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">The conference's best-known attendants seemed to respond to all but the most ingratiating questions by swiftly shaming the interlocutor.</seg>
<seg id="13">The porn stars stuck to their talking points and stayed on message.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Liking sex" was the preferred euphemism for making or consuming porn.</seg>
<seg id="15">Conversely, harboring even the slightest ambivalence about porn meant that you categorically "hated sex" and were out to ruin it for everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="16">A dominant narrative soon emerged at the conference, in which pornography - and not the Victorian kind with the bloomers and the spankings or whatever - was presented as a bastion of orgiastic disinhibition; a filthy fun-times Arcadia from which sprang nothing but joy and empowerment and marriage and children and unicorns.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like all good stories, this one had a villain: "the girlfriend."</seg>
<seg id="18">A sex-hating, man-foiling human barricade whose cruel, withholding ways sent armies of disconsolate men into the tender embrace of their "favorite" porn stars daily.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was taken aback.</seg>
<seg id="20">I was a girlfriend!</seg>
<seg id="21">I mean, I wasn't that girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the more this version of reality was reified throughout the event, the sadder, the more isolated, the more diminished I became.</seg>
<seg id="23">The worst thing about it was how overwhelming the experience was, and how deviant it made me feel.</seg>
<seg id="24">I was reminded of this recently while watching the new Showtime series "Masters of Sex," which also dwells on a sexual milieu so oppressively canonical and intolerant as to seem almost religious: the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="25">Set in the famously inhibited middle of America in the famously clamped-down American midcentury, "Masters of Sex" follows the researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, whose landmark 1966 book, "Human Sexual Response," tore down barriers and helped pave the way for the sexual revolution - all of which will presumably come later in the series.</seg>
<seg id="26">For now, the characters are still stuck in the mid-"50s, when Masters (Michael Sheen), a hormone-replacement-therapy specialist, hired Johnson (Lizzy Caplan), a thrice-divorced former nightclub singer and mother of two, as his secretary.</seg>
<seg id="27">Together they led the charge to bring sex out of the Middle Ages.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Masters of Sex" is a contemporary show about retro attitudes that we can look back on now from the safety of more enlightened times.</seg>
<seg id="29">It also has the problem/advantage of depicting a prudish time on-screen while existing in the context of the most relentlessly unprudish media landscape ever.</seg>
<seg id="30">This predicament presents an interesting artistic challenge to its creators: How do you make a fresh, interesting and surprising show about sex in an era when it's hard to find anything anywhere that isn't, on some level, about sex?</seg>
<seg id="31">And how do you convey what it was like to be alive at a time when sex was still taboo without ascribing attitudes we find distasteful today (excessive inhibition, sexism, homophobia) to characters we're meant to care about and identify with?</seg>

<seg id="6">But stats show that I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
<seg id="8">One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends.</seg>
<seg id="9">Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
<seg id="12">As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
<seg id="14">I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.</seg>
<seg id="15">We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="17">That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="23">The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's a mystery I have yet to solve.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.</seg>
<seg id="27">They have the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like "nice face."</seg>
<seg id="29">Finally, let's talk pumpkins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lucky for us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="33">The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Women: What guilt and men have to do with work-life balance</seg>
<seg id="2">(MoneyWatch) A new leadership book, "Getting to 50/50," highlights the perpetual debate about the proper work-life balance for parents, particularly for women.</seg>
<seg id="3">Along with her co-author Joanna Strober (and with a foreword by Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg), Sharon Meers maps out a detailed plan.</seg>
<seg id="4">First, women need to "fire guilt."</seg>
<seg id="5">Second, they need to give men leading roles at home.</seg>
<seg id="6">And third, we need to realize that "good: is the goal, not perfection.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authors also share practical advice drawn from experience as well as from social science research.</seg>
<seg id="8">And Meers has plenty of real-life experience -- she is a mother and leads Enterprise strategy at Magento, the global ecommerce platform of eBay.</seg>
<seg id="9">She's also a former managing director at Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here's what she had to say in a brief conversation about her new book.</seg>
<seg id="11">CBS MoneyWatch: What does "50/50" refer to in this book, and what does it mean to you?</seg>
<seg id="12">Sharon Meers: 50/50 means men and women sharing power and playing equally important roles at work and at home.</seg>
<seg id="13">50/50 is about all of us -- men, women, children, employers -- having much, much more of what we want by changing the way we perceive our choices in career, marriage and childrearing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Why is getting to 50/50 so crucial?</seg>
<seg id="15">As we talked to hundreds of working men and women, a pattern emerged: Couples win from standing in each others' shoes, day after day, and committing themselves equally to raising their children and breadwinning for a family.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mothers work without guilt; fathers bond with their kids; children blossom with the attention of two equally involved parents.</seg>
<seg id="17">Why haven't flexible work schedules become the norm?</seg>
<seg id="18">Working parents certainly need the ability to address the needs of their kids, whether that's getting a sick child to the doctor or picking up at day care on time.</seg>
<seg id="19">That said, employers need great results from everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">Two things really help -- measuring what matters and planning ahead.</seg>
<seg id="21">Agree with your boss what things really matter and how you can measure them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then do a lot of that and report back.</seg>
<seg id="23">And try to anticipate which meetings or travel is essential, and make sure you have back up at home: your spouse, friends or other family.</seg>
<seg id="24">Build relationships at work so others can step in for you if you have an emergency at home</seg>
<seg id="25">Why do smart bosses tell their parents, and all employees, to "go home," as you write in the book?</seg>
<seg id="26">No matter where you sit in the food chain, there are only so many productive hours your brain can put in.</seg>
<seg id="27">After that, you'll make mistakes and you'll make a mess.</seg>
<seg id="28">Studies show that working parents who make it home in time for dinner are actually happier, healthier and more successful at work.</seg>
<seg id="29">When your kids are in a good place, when you have enough time to connect with your family, that makes you a more positive, productive person at work.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC News - UK to protest to Spain over Gibraltar armed stand-off</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 11:42 By Brian Wheeler Political reporter, BBC News</seg>
<seg id="3">The UK is to protest to the Spanish government "at a high level" after an armed stand-off in Gibraltarian territorial waters.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Ministry of Defence has accused a Guardia Civil patrol boat of "manoeuvring in a provocative and dangerous manner in the vicinity of Royal Navy vessels."</seg>
<seg id="5">No shots were fired in the incident.</seg>
<seg id="6">But there was a minor collision between the Spanish vessel and a Gibraltar Defence Police boat.</seg>
<seg id="7">The incident happened on Wednesday while the Gibraltar Squadron was providing force protection to a Royal Navy Fleet Auxiliary tanker in Gibraltarian territorial waters.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the Gibraltar Chronicle, the Spanish patrol boat Rio Tormes sailed too close to a Royal Navy vessel after breaching a security cordon off the British territory.</seg>
<seg id="9">Armed crew members on HMS Scimitar ordered the Spanish vessel to leave the area but the Guardia Civil vessel reportedly ignored the warning, resulting in a stand-off.</seg>
<seg id="10">Speaking in the House of Lords on Thursday, Conservative peer Baroness Hooper said "guns were pointed at each other" during Wednesday's incident.</seg>
<seg id="11">Asked to confirm this, a Foreign Office spokesman said the Royal Navy crew had followed "appropriate operational procedures."</seg>
<seg id="12">The spokesman confirmed that "there was an incident" and that it would be "raised at a high level with the Spanish government."</seg>
<seg id="13">Business minister Lord Ahmad told Lady Hooper he would write to her with the "full facts" about the incident.</seg>

<seg id="4">SUSPENDED Manly forward Richie Fa'aoso has opened up about his controversial eight-game suspension by declaring: "No one goes out there to put someone on their head."</seg>
<seg id="5">News Limited yesterday secured an exclusive interview with Fa'aoso, who expressed regret at the two spear tackles on Souths superstar Greg Inglis but was adamant he wouldn't alter his tackling style.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He (Inglis) is a key player and you do have to be aggressive," Fa'aoso conceded.</seg>
<seg id="7">But no one goes out there to put him him on his head.</seg>
<seg id="8">No way.</seg>
<seg id="9">Someone said I targeted him, no way.</seg>
<seg id="10">""He is a great player and you have to get numbers in but not target him or smash and hurt him.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's a man game.</seg>
<seg id="12">I'll cop it on the chin and move on.</seg>
<seg id="13">He strenuously denied being a dirty player, revealing that he had only been suspended for one game in the past nine years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Richie Fa'aoso faces eight weeks for spear tackling Greg Inglis twice.</seg>
<seg id="15">FA'AOSO said he had tried to perform a legitimate tackle that night but Inglis was "unfortunately" tipped on his head, twice.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I regret the tackles because I am missing (suspended) for so long," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don't regret going low and going hard at him.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's what you have to do.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to go hard at someone who has such a good bump and palm.</seg>
<seg id="20">""You can't go high on the bloke or you will get beat.</seg>
<seg id="21">I went low and it was unfortunate he got tipped on his head.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is a contact sport, it's a man's game.</seg>
<seg id="23">If you go half-hearted you get hurt and look like a fool.</seg>
<seg id="24">""I just go in hard and try to play the game as tough as I can.</seg>
<seg id="25">It just didn't go the way it should have gone and I am now paying the price.</seg>
<seg id="26">I am regretting it.</seg>
<seg id="27">I was dirty on myself.</seg>
<seg id="28">THE prop maintains he is not a dirty player.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I don't think I am a dirty player," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some people might think I am.</seg>
<seg id="31">I just play the game as hard as I can.</seg>
<seg id="32">Aggression is a big part of our game and I think we need to keep it in the game.</seg>
<seg id="33">""That's why people come to watch because they love that stuff ... but not the spear tackles or dirty stuff.</seg>
<seg id="34">I was 19 years old and playing for Penrith against the Storm when I (last) missed a game.</seg>
<seg id="35">It was back in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="36">""To say I am a dirty player is a bit below the belt.""</seg>
<seg id="37">Richie Fa'aoso copped eight weeks for two spear tackles on Greg Inglis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Picture: Channel Nine Source:</seg>
<seg id="39">"COLLEAGUE Phil Rothfield attacked Fa'aoso, saying: "Fa'aoso has become a serial offender.</seg>
<seg id="40">He is one of the worst exponents of foul play I've seen for years.""</seg>
<seg id="41">Fa'aoso yesterday hit back.</seg>
<seg id="42">""You don't want to hear people say that about you and put it in the paper," he said."</seg>
<seg id="43">""I don't know where he (Rothfield) has come from, mixed Oztag.</seg>
<seg id="44">I don't know if he is watching the game but that is how the game goes sometime.</seg>
<seg id="45">These things can happen.</seg>
<seg id="46">""To be honest I am not going to change my tackling technique or the way I go in low for a tackle.</seg>
<seg id="47">FA'AOSO hasn't contacted Inglis but the pair spoke briefly after the match.</seg>
<seg id="48">Asked what message he would send GI, the Rabbitohs fullback, Fa'aoso said: "Glad you're OK, mate."</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger over Bali bomb plotter's sentence</seg>
<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">"He should be put in front of the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and "died" three times while on life support.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.</seg>
<seg id="18">To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it's not much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He didn't give himself up," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek may yet appeal his sentence.</seg>

<seg id="2">Actress Pamela Anderson chops off her hair.</seg>
<seg id="3">By Nardine Saad</seg>

<seg id="5">Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity adopter of the pixie haircut.</seg>
<seg id="6">And can you say va-va-cute?!</seg>

<seg id="8">Miley Cyrus has the cut too, but we refuse to lump her into the heavyweight-pixie category, haircut or not.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anderson shed her long blond locks recently and was photographed in Los Angeles sporting the shorn 'do on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The look suited her well!</seg>
<seg id="11">The 46-year-old ex-Playboy model looked pretty demure when she debuted the look, wearing an knee-length striped dress, white cardigan and large sunglasses.</seg>
<seg id="12">She was accompanied by her ex, film producer Rick Salomon, Us Weekly reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Boston Red Sox win: A redemptive baseball season</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 03:12 By PJ Crowley Former US Assistant Secretary of State</seg>
<seg id="3">The city of Boston is planning a party on Saturday to celebrate its eighth world baseball championship.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six months ago, just two weeks into what was expected to be a rebuilding year, the focus was not on championship banners, but bombs that exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, less than a mile from Fenway Park and a mere 45 minutes after the Red Sox had finished an early season game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Three people died in the blasts and more than 260 people were injured, many in life-altering ways.</seg>
<seg id="6">For a day, the city was locked down as law enforcement pursued a suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (his brother Tamerlan was killed), who was apprehended and charged with murder.</seg>
<seg id="7">The day after the arrest, the Red Sox saluted government figures, law enforcement officers, first responders, runners, spectators and other citizens who reacted courageously and resolutely in the minutes, hours and days following the incident.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city and the team (along with Boston's hockey team, the Bruins, which made its own run to the Stanley Cup finals) embraced the slogan "Boston Strong," with the emblem "B Strong" painted on Fenway's legendary Green Monster scoreboard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Long-suffering fans</seg>
<seg id="10">The bombings and sports became intertwined in ways that undoubtedly helped the city heal and gave the resurgent Red Sox a larger sense of purpose.</seg>
<seg id="11">Are there broader lessons beyond baseball?</seg>
<seg id="12">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="13">The huge wall housing the scoreboard is known as the "Green Monster"</seg>
<seg id="14">The World Series victory was Boston's third in 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Red Sox are now a baseball superpower.</seg>
<seg id="16">But before 2004, the Red Sox went 85 years between world championships.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the same stretch, Boston's arch-rival, the New York Yankees, won 26.</seg>
<seg id="18">During that drought, rooting for the Red Sox became theological (full disclosure, my father worked for the Red Sox for a quarter century and my nephew works for them now).</seg>
<seg id="19">Being a Red Sox fan was about the afterlife: they will win eventually but only after most long-suffering fans are dead.</seg>
<seg id="20">Talk to a Red Sox fan for five minutes and heaven and hell are sure to be mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="21">There were celebrated near misses over the years.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most Red Sox fans, regardless of age, can recite the names and circumstances of those who played starring roles in various tragi-comedies: Pesky holding the ball in 1946; Lonborg pitching on two days' rest in 1967; a fluke Yankee home run made Dent a four-letter word in 1978; Mookie's dribbler rolling through Buckner's legs in 1986; and Pedro being left in too long in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="23">Full names are not required.</seg>
<seg id="24">Intriguingly, prior to Wednesday's clinching win, the Red Sox didn't try to hide from its history or rewrite it.</seg>
<seg id="25">Community spirit</seg>
<seg id="26">The team put every one of its ghosts on the Jumbotron, the stadium's large-screen television.</seg>
<seg id="27">This night was about overcoming history, not being paralysed by it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Those who root for the Red Sox are audacious enough to call themselves a Nation.</seg>
<seg id="29">Unlike countries, which are defined by common geography, a nation is defined by a common identity, and shared interests and values.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Red Sox are one of a handful of sports franchises in America that surmount geography and have a national and, with the introduction of players with ties to Latin America, Europe and Asia, international identity.</seg>
<seg id="31">Dear Japan, thank you for Koji Uehara and Junichi Tazawa, but we digress.</seg>
<seg id="32">This season, the team and community exceeded expectations, the whole truly greater than the sum of its parts.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why?</seg>
<seg id="34">It was about chemistry - and beards that even the Taliban might admire.</seg>
<seg id="35">Acts of terrorism target chemistry, attempting to tear the fabric that binds a community together.</seg>
<seg id="36">No replay</seg>
<seg id="37">The mutual embrace of Boston and its sports teams demonstrates how communities can respond to acts of terrorism - by refusing to be terrorised, choosing to be inspired and embracing what unites rather than divides.</seg>

<seg id="3">We watched video of the match against Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", the official site of "Avantgarde" quotes Chebaturkin.</seg>
<seg id="4">- We missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant time.</seg>
<seg id="5">We missed due to our mistakes, due to non-execution of the game plan.</seg>
<seg id="6">We knew that the competitor has performers.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to statistics they had five attacks straight-off - they drove in three pucks on us.</seg>
<seg id="8">Very good implementation.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry says US spying has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedented admission</seg>
<seg id="2">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has "reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."</seg>
<seg id="6">He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="8">And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: "We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."</seg>
<seg id="12">There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said the itinerary is still being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some "tough love" will also be dispensed.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying," Murphy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tech Families Cite 'Legacy' of Campus Safety</seg>
<seg id="3">The families of victims and survivors of the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech call campus safety measures instituted at colleges and universities nationwide a "living legacy" that won't be diminished by a court decision involving two who were killed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The VTV Family Outreach Foundation said the changes sparked by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history remain strong despite a Virginia Supreme Court ruling Thursday that tossed a jury's wrongful death finding against the state stemming from two students' deaths during the rampage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Justices concluded that Tech administrators did not have a duty to warn students that a gunman remained at large after he had killed two people in a dormitory and that they had no way to anticipate he would go on to kill 30 more and himself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The court ruled in the case of two students whose families argued that they might have survived the rampage if the administrators alerted the campus earlier to the gunman's initial shootings at a dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead, Erin Nicole Peterson, Julia Kathleen Pryde and 28 other people were killed nearly three hours later in Norris Hall, a classroom building.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the justices agreed with the state - that there was no way to anticipate the deadly intentions of student Seung-Hui Cho.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Thus, as a matter of law, the commonwealth did not have a duty to protect students against third party criminal acts," the court wrote.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since the shootings, U.S. campuses have instituted warning systems across different platforms - cellphone alerts, warning sirens - and have been proactive in working to prevent a repeat of what happened in Blacksburg, Va.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advocates and family members of victims said the ruling won't change that.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Improvements to how colleges and universities across the country, post April 16, 2007, handle threat assessment and emergency response spurred by the tragedy have fundamentally improved campus safety," the VTV Family Outreach Foundation said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is their living legacy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The foundation and its 32 National Campus Safety Initiative - named for the number of victims at Tech - works to promote efforts to make college campuses safer.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The April 16, 2007, tragedy forever changed campus safety," said S. Daniel Carter, director of the initiative.</seg>
<seg id="16">This court ruling does nothing to diminish that.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Thursday's ruling, the justices reversed the jury's findings and issued a final ruling, meaning there is no avenue for appeal.</seg>
<seg id="18">The state attorney general's office said the court "found what we have said all along to be true."</seg>
<seg id="19">Spokesman Brian Gottstein wrote in an email: "The commonwealth and its officials at Virginia Tech were not negligent on April 16, 2007."</seg>
<seg id="20">Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="21">The case was the lone pending legal action stemming from the massacre, Gottstein said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The appeal attorney representing the parents of Peterson, 18, and Pryde, 23, said justices applied a stricter standard than the trial judge.</seg>
<seg id="23">The public perception of the university's actions could be a different matter, attorney L. Steven Emmert said.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Now in the court of public opinion, the university may suffer - that's quite possible, but that's not the court's to deal with," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Courts will decide legal rights.</seg>

<seg id="2">By Bernie Woodall and Ben Klayman</seg>
<seg id="3">DETROIT (Reuters) - The 16-day U.S. government shutdown in early October appeared to dampen consumers' appetite for new cars, as five of six automakers reporting monthly sales early on Friday missed analysts' expectations.</seg>
<seg id="4">U.S. October auto sales for the three Detroit-based automakers rose by double digits from a year earlier, but only General Motors Co (GM.N) beat expectations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Analysts had forecast stronger performances from Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Chrysler Group LLC (FIA.MI), as well as from Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE).</seg>
<seg id="6">GM said October sales climbed nearly 16 percent to 226,402 vehicles from 195,764 a year ago, with all four GM brands reporting year-to-year increases, led by Buick, up 31 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, expected GM sales of 211,563.</seg>
<seg id="8">October sales dipped to an annual rate of 15.3 million units, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, compared with expectations of 15.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The continued weakness ... was primarily driven by the government shutdown impacting consumer sentiment through the first half of the month," he said in a briefing note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="10">Results at Ford and Chrysler narrowly missed analysts' expectations, as did those at Toyota and Nissan.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ford said October U.S. sales increased 14 percent to 191,985 vehicles, from 168,456 a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ford and Lincoln brand sales both rose during the month.</seg>
<seg id="13">Analysts expected 194,301.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chrysler reported October sales of 140,083, up 11 percent from 126,185 a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">Analysts expected 143,536.</seg>
<seg id="16">Toyota sales rose 8.8 percent to 168,976 vehicles, while Nissan was up 14.2 percent to 91,018.</seg>
<seg id="17">Analysts expected 176,815 at Toyota and 93,632 at Nissan.</seg>
<seg id="18">GM shares were up 1.5 percent at $37.50 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Ford shares were down 1.1 percent at $16.93.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sales of full-size pickups, buoyed by a steady housing market and lower gasoline prices, continued to show strength in October, although their torrid year-long pace slowed a bit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ford's F-series was up 13 percent for the month and up 20 percent for the year to date, while Chrysler's Ram was up 18 percent for the month and 23 percent for the year to date.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Chevrolet Silverado was up 10 percent for the month and 20 percent for the year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Average transaction prices for all full-size trucks in October jumped more than 5 percentage points from a year ago, to $39,189, according to Kelley Blue Book.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The truck segment will remain hotly contested through the rest of this year," said analyst Alec Gutierrez of Kelley Blue Book, with GM spending less than Ford and Chrysler to promote its Silverado and Sierra.</seg>
<seg id="24">Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) U.S. subsidiary said VW brand sales fell 18 percent to 28,129 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="25">The German automaker's upscale Audi brand reported record sales of 13,001, up 11 percent, with Porsche boosting sales 11 percent to 3,562.</seg>
<seg id="26">Group sales of 44,692 were down 9 percent from a year ago, missing analysts' expectations of 48,654.</seg>
<seg id="27">VW's U.S. chief, Jonathan Browning, said, "The first half of the month (was) very slow in terms of overall traffic and consumer activity."</seg>
<seg id="28">He said the government shutdown had a broader impact on "consumer confidence in general."</seg>
<seg id="29">Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) said its U.S. sales climbed 7 percent to 53,555 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="30">Fuji Heavy Industries' (7270.T) Subaru said sales jumped 32 percent to 34,483.</seg>
<seg id="31">Consumer demand for electrified vehicles remain mixed.</seg>
<seg id="32">October sales of GM's Chevrolet Volt dropped 32 percent to 2,022, while Nissan Leaf climbed 27 percent to 2,002.</seg>

<seg id="1">TV review: BBC strays way off target in World's Busiest Maternity Ward</seg>
<seg id="2">There is a maternity hospital in Manila where women in labour routinely sit four to a bed, where an experienced midwife might deliver upwards of 200,000 babies in her career.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's known as "the world's busiest maternity ward" and there's none of your "birthing plan" nonsense here.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital sounds like it would make a great subject for a documentary, doesn't it?</seg>
<seg id="5">Sadly, the makers of the This World series on population thought they had a better idea.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the waiting room, presenter Anita Rani got talking to Rosalyn, soon to give birth to her seventh child, who will live, along with the rest of the family, in a single room in the densely populated slum area of Tondo.</seg>
<seg id="7">Junalyn also lives in the slums, but she was putting off pregnancy in hope of securing a life-changing job at an international banking firm.</seg>
<seg id="8">It wasn't long before Rani ascended the social ladder to mingle with Manila's more elevated elements, including middle-class mother-of-one Rose, who will give birth to her second, and probably last, child at a hospital with state-of-the-art facilities, where a private room sets you back £2,000, and Vicki Belo, a TV presenter and beauty specialist, who had made a fortune selling armpit-bleaching treatments (don't ask) to young Filipinos.</seg>
<seg id="9">The programme's title, World's Busiest Maternity Ward, led us to expect a turbo-charged version of Channel 4's long-running maternity ward series, One Born Every Minute, and that would have been better.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead, This World was so keen to link the programme's case studies to a bigger picture of global population growth that it strayed way off topic into a celebration of the Philippines' expanding economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rani had several interviews with esteemed economists, yet there was no discussion of the macroeconomic context of poverty, and only a passing mention of the role that access to contraception might have in a Catholic country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ironically, if this documentary had restricted itself to the maternity ward, it might have involved more insights into the real causes of population growth and fewer thinly veiled pitches for international investment.</seg>

<seg id="1">An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31 near the city of Kokimbo in the central part of Chile, reports the agency Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="2">The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, as specified on the website of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).</seg>
<seg id="3">Tremors were registered at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 Moscow time).</seg>
<seg id="4">So far nothing is being reported regarding victims or destruction caused by the underground tremors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Let us recall that Chile is located on one of the most seismically active regions of Earth, therefore earthquakes of various intensity there are not uncommon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Power engineers of Dnepropetrovschina have begun a unique program to save... stork nests</seg>
<seg id="2">In old times, in order to attract storks to the yard, villagers installed a cart wheel on a high post and a heavy nest held up well on it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such special supports have long since not been set up, therefore storks have taken fancy to the poles of electric power transmission lines - interwoven branches are supported by wires, thanks to which a stork home sits securely.</seg>
<seg id="4">Grandma Anya, near the home of which a stork family has been living for already about twenty years in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district, began to notice that the nest sags despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The birds place new branches on top, but the lower layer has already sunk between the wires, will collapse any minute.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, it's a pity for the family of storks that each year have nested near the inn, they hatched and nursed three-four chicks over the summer, but I'd also rather not be without light.</seg>
<seg id="7">As soon as the birds flew away to warm territories, Grandma Anya called the Tsarichansky regional power network to which the pole belongs.</seg>
<seg id="8">And did not even expect that there they would respond so fast.</seg>
<seg id="9">When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest still hangs on at all, - recounted the technical director of DFPC "Dneprooblenergo" Sergei Berezovsky.</seg>
<seg id="10">Corrosion had begun on the wires that ended up essentially inside the nest weighing 150-200 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="11">At any moment the birds could have died from electric discharge.</seg>
<seg id="12">And indeed the local residents risked being left without light due to the damage of the wires.</seg>
<seg id="13">For that reason the linemen began an operation to save the nest, and this is already not the first time in our practical experience.</seg>
<seg id="14">We were helped by scientist-ornithologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University who developed a scheme for moving the nest.</seg>
<seg id="15">They even conducted training for employees of regional networks.</seg>
<seg id="16">The well-known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised the power specialists at all stages of nest reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="17">For a start, they figured that in the region more than 50 stork "apartments" are in an unsafe condition.</seg>
<seg id="18">For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.</seg>
<seg id="19">They braided the frame with willow branches, and then moved the old nest to it.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a base so that the birds recognize the nest and return to it.</seg>
<seg id="21">Later the storks will finish constructing their home themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">A month ago in the village of Peschanka in the Novomoskovsky district the first nest was reconstructed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Next to the power support they placed a new reinforced concrete post and arranged on it a platform with the old, already lived-in nest.</seg>
<seg id="24">The entire operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnia.</seg>
<seg id="25">And the other day the same kind of housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district at the inn of Grandma Anya.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here they secured the platform in its previous place, only they slightly raised it above the wires.</seg>
<seg id="27">Ornithologists are confident that the cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" underwent capital repairs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Before the end of the year the same reconstruction awaits another four nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnepropetrovschina.</seg>
<seg id="29">By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others are mercilessly killing them.</seg>
<seg id="30">The other day sad news spread over the region - in the village of Ust-Kamenka in the Apostolovsky district, on the opening day of pheasant hunting, poachers just for the fun of it gunned down a family of swans dwelling at a local pond.</seg>
<seg id="31">The noble birds did not fear people at all - local residents fed them and did not offend.</seg>
<seg id="32">When the villagers, hearing gunshots, ran up to the pond, four beautiful swans already laid dead on the water.</seg>
<seg id="33">Presently employees of the Apostolovsky district police department are ascertaining who shot the birds listed in the Red Data Book.</seg>

<seg id="1">FDA attempts to crack down on Salmonella, filth in spices</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- In response to recent outbreaks from Salmonella-contaminated spices, U.S. health officials completed a draft risk profile on pathogens and filth in spices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The study's findings suggest the presence of pathogens, such as Salmonella, and filth in spices is a systemic challenge.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Failures identified in the farm-to-table food safety system potentially leading to adulteration of consumed spice generally arose from poor/inconsistent application of appropriate preventive controls," the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">The study identified 14 spice/seasoning-associated outbreaks worldwide that occurred from 1973 to 2010, resulting in less than 2,000 reported human illnesses and 128 hospitalizations worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="6">The relatively small number of outbreaks identified may be attributable in part to the application of preventive controls by the spice and food manufacturing industries, including pathogen reduction treatments, and cooking during food preparation, the FDA said.</seg>
<seg id="7">People's tendency to eat small amounts of spices with meals generally lowers the probability of illness from contaminated spices relative to similarly contaminated foods consumed in larger amounts.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is also possible that illnesses caused by contaminated spices are underreported, particularly because of challenges related to attribution for minor ingredients in multi-ingredient foods.</seg>
<seg id="9">The risk profile identifies the most commonly occurring microbial hazards and filth in spices and quantifies, where possible, the prevalence and levels of these adulterants at different points along the supply chain.</seg>
<seg id="10">It also identifies potential sources of contamination throughout the farm-to-table food safety continuum and evaluates the efficacy of current mitigation and control options designed to reduce the public health risk posed by consumption of contaminated spices in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="11">The FDA has a number of regulatory standards and programs in place that help prevent contaminated spice from reaching consumers and these are described in the risk profile, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the agency is taking steps to further strengthen spice safety.</seg>
<seg id="13">The FDA has increased inspections of spice manufacturing facilities in recent years and has begun to implement some of the options presented in the risk profile.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is working with several partners to develop a training center focused on supply chain management for spices and botanical ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="15">As part of this program, FDA experts have provided food safety training in India, a leading country of origin for U.S. spice importation, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report concluded with a list of knowledge gaps and the research needed to fill them.</seg>
<seg id="17">The FDA seeks comments on this draft document, which can be submitted via the Federal Register.</seg>
<seg id="18">More information on the proposed rules can be obtained at: www.fda.gov/fsma.</seg>

<seg id="1">In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford automobile factory in Vsevolozhsk.</seg>
<seg id="2">As they say in trade unions, all of the dismissed received compensation.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the issue of the reduction of industrial production in the region is becoming much more poignant than the problems of workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Deputy of the regional legislative assembly Aleksei Etmanov at a meeting said that they cut around 600 people at the factory of the company Ford in Vsevolozhsk.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, this occurred as early as September: at that time in line with a program of voluntarily dismissal, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization, around 600 people resigned from the factory.</seg>
<seg id="6">Workers who decided to resign voluntarily were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.</seg>
<seg id="7">Due to that, the overwhelming majority left their jobs voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, according to Etmanov, such an amount of people is an entire night shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">I think that the matter will not be limited to this.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, in the coming two years authorities do not plan on undertaking any programs to support regional enterprises that are in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting a budget the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large job cuts.</seg>
<seg id="11">At Ford, they are not denying nor confirming this information.</seg>
<seg id="12">We are awaiting a response from the company, and, as soon as it emerges, we will definitely publicize it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Talk of cutting workers at the Ford factory in Vsevolozhsk has gone on for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, company plans to dismiss 600 people became known as early as September.</seg>
<seg id="15">Previously the factory announced a suspension of automobile production.</seg>
<seg id="16">The reason they gave at the factory was a drop in demand for Ford automobiles in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Petrostat, results of nine months of 2013 show that the industrial output in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.</seg>
<seg id="18">Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.</seg>

<seg id="1">What as we paying Tasmanians the dole when there are scallops to shuck?</seg>
<seg id="2">From Tasmania, the state with the highest unemployment rate in the country:</seg>
<seg id="3">Evidently, it is a boom year [for scallops], with plenty of stock.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the operators are unable to find enough shuckers, even though they are paid well above the minimum wage (around $24 an hour).</seg>
<seg id="5">And this is in Tasmania, where unemployment is 50 per cent higher than the mainland.</seg>
<seg id="6">One large operator has opted to freeze the catch at sea, ship it to Thailand to be shucked after the catch is partly thawed and export the product from there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some of it is even re-imported to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Labour is cheap and reliable in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even taking into account the extra costs of freezing and transport, this strategy makes more sense than processing the scallops in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fisherman say the same:</seg>
<seg id="11">ALAN BARNETT, SCALLOP FISHERMAN: We have our boats export-registered to be able to freeze on board and when the boats come in we unload directly either into cold stores or into containers, and from there they get straight on the ship over and into Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="12">BOB LISTER: They're coming back to Australia to be sold locally as half-shell scallops.</seg>
<seg id="13">I think it's probably cheaper to process scallops overseas than it is in Australia, unfortunately...</seg>
<seg id="14">FIONA BREEN: Local processors can't find enough workers to shuck scallops.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sound of scallop shucking</seg>
<seg id="16">MICK SMITH, PROCESSOR: It is hard to get the workers.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's hard to get people that will stick at it.</seg>
<seg id="18">If people stick at it, they can make really good money out of it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I just think, with the future generation, I don't think they're interested.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if it's not lazy workers, it's officious bureaucracy:</seg>
<seg id="21">JOHN HAMMOND: This mind set we've now is that fishermen are rape, pillagers and plunders; there'll be nothing left if we don't stop them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Well they've pretty much stopped us.</seg>
<seg id="23">There's only one endangered species out here, and that's me, and Junior.</seg>
<seg id="24">Yeah, we're managed to death.</seg>
<seg id="25">FIONA BREEN: Authorities from Victoria, the Commonwealth and Tasmania have been talking about streamlining the three different sets of regulations, but nothing's happening fast...</seg>
<seg id="26">JOHN HAMMOND: I think this area here that's open here now works out - for our total available area of fishing in Tasmanian waters, is less than half of one per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27">That's all we've got to fish in.</seg>

<seg id="2">SHOCK jock Kyle Sandilands and broadcast partner Jackie O walked away from their lucrative radio contracts with Southern Cross Austereo after weary bosses refused to cave in to Sandilands' demands for a 100 per cent, $2 million pay rise.</seg>
<seg id="3">Executives confirmed the FM bad boy set unrealistic terms during negotiations to remain at 2DayFM, asking that they double his salary to $4 million.</seg>
<seg id="4">Jackie O leaving her Vauclause house / Picture: Stephen Cooper Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="5">"It would have taken a ridiculous sum of money to get him to stay - and we are not in the business of paying ridiculous sums of money," said an executive yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="6">After more than a decade with 2DayFM Sandilands and Jackie O sounded emotional when they announced the end of their long-running, breakfast show on air yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Jackie and I have decided that we will not be returning to 2DayFM in 2014 and that's not an easy decision," Sandilands said, signalling the end of an airwaves era that has seen them top the FM ratings for the last 50 surveys.</seg>
<seg id="8">Following years of scandals and advertising boycotts, Sandilands' decision to quit has created a breakfast line-up crisis at Southern Cross.</seg>
<seg id="9">Farewell ...</seg>
<seg id="10">Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O / Picture: Splash News Source: Splash News Australia</seg>
<seg id="11">Melbourne Fox FM hosts Matt Tilley and Jo Stanley also finish their breakfast show contracts on November 29 - the same day as Sandilands and Jackie O in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="12">Southern Cross CEO Rhys Holleran said negotiations with Sandilands and Jackie O had been friendly.</seg>
<seg id="13">"At the end of the day we couldn't agree, so no hard feelings," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Kyle is looking at taking a different path and that's really a matter for him.</seg>
<seg id="15">This really gives us the chance to make some generational change and we are very confident of our strategy for both Sydney and Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="16">Friends say Sandilands, 42, is feeling burnt out and plans to explore other interests including his investment in a coconut water company and opportunities in television.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is contracted for 2014 to Channel 9's Australia's Got Talent.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The physical demands of breakfast radio take a huge toll and Kyle has had enough," the friend said.</seg>
<seg id="19">He has plenty of other interests but is exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="20">Associates of Sandilands have been spruiking his desire to launch a digital radio station locally with himself as headline act, possibly making him Australia's answer to US shock jock Howard Stern.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kyle Sandilands" girlfriend Imogen Anthony arriving at his home.</seg>
<seg id="22">Last night it was unclear what future, if any, Jackie O, who reportedly earns half as much as her sidekick, has at the network.</seg>
<seg id="23">A media buyer said yesterday that without Kyle and Jackie O , the network stood to lose big ratings and bigger dollars at a time when the industry generally was tightening up.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It may cause SCA to lose a few ratings points a year - which could lead to significant loses nationally of between $10 and $20 million," the buyer said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Executives spent the past month trying to persuade the duo to stay on - despite the huge cost in lost revenue associated with Sandilands', dubbed "Scandilands" for his inability to tone down his outrageous and sometimes offensive on-air behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="26">HOW much money does one shock jock need ‎to pay the bills?</seg>
<seg id="27">If you happen to be the nation's most controversial radio star, Kyle Sandilands, it seems you can go through $50,000 a month without having enough change for a coffee‎on the day before pay day.</seg>
<seg id="28">What with the rental on properties in Hollywood and Sydney - at one point good money handed out to pal and landlord John Ibrahim, not generally regarded as a cheap guy, for a house in Dover Heights - and the lease on expensive cars, including a Rolls Royce Phantom Coupe worth $600,000, there are always bills needing to be paid.</seg>
<seg id="29">And that doesn't include the money that goes into supporting up to a dozen friends and associates who like to hang out in his mansions living off his generosity.</seg>
<seg id="30">After weeks of negotiations, Sandilands has refused to agree to Southern Cross Austereo's more modest offer of a new contract, arguing that he wants double or nothing.</seg>
<seg id="31">How he will survive without the $2 million 2DAY FM has been paying him remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="32">Television should more than sustain him financially, but the reality is it was Sandilands' radio profile that made him hot property on television.</seg>
<seg id="33">The shock jock is under pressure to change his lifestyle entirely, something friends say may prove impossible for the notorious money waster who recently admitted ambitions of owning a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="34">He has disclosed that his health has gone from bad to worse during the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="35">If Australia had an Elvis Presley, the tragically ballooning Sandilands, who is generally well-liked, would be it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Though radio fans will mourn his loss from breakfast radio, his decision to walk away may well save his life.</seg>
<seg id="37">Here is the full transcript of their big announcement:</seg>

<seg id="1">WA Senate result to be revealed</seg>
<seg id="2">The result of the West Australian Senate vote recount is set to be revealed this weekend amid concerns that more than 1300 missing ballots may mean the state has to go to a new election.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) directed a recount of some WA Senate ballot papers, prompted by the close result of just 14 votes for the sixth Senate seat and appeals by the Australian Greens and Australian Sports Party.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the recount, that looked at informal votes and 1.2 million above-the-line ballot papers, 1375 votes which had been verified in the initial count could not be "located, rechecked or verified in the recount process."</seg>
<seg id="5">The AEC apologised and has hired former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty to independently, and urgently, inquire into the matter.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, the AEC WA manager Peter Kramer says the results of the recount and distribution of preferences will be known on Saturday afternoon and the candidates have been asked if they want to appoint scrutineers to observe the distribution of preferences.</seg>
<seg id="7">But some politicians including Australian Greens Senator Scott Ludlam, and Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer have decried the process.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Palmer believes the original election result should stand.</seg>
<seg id="9">The initial result gave seats to the Palmer United Party's Zhenya Wang, Labor's Louise Pratt and Joe Bullock and the Liberals' David Johnston, Michaelia Cash and Linda Reynolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">AEC spokesman Phil Diak said there was nothing to suggest an "untoward removal" of the ballot papers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Special Minister of State Michael Ronaldson did not think it was an "issue of skulduggery," but said it was a disturbing development which required an inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="12">Independent senator Nick Xenophon thinks there should be a fresh election in WA if the ballot papers cannot be found.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Better to cost money now than have a result where there is a question mark over those that have been elected," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said WA deserved an explanation and while there was a way to go with due processes, another election could not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is a very serious matter," he said in Canberra.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">But mice who had not been given the vaccine "chilled out," say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Half-a-game' Sonny Bill Williams won't be missed, says league legend John Sattler</seg>
<seg id="2">Ex coach Graham Lowe says Stephen Kearney should have chased Sonny-Bill Williams properly before naming World Cup squad</seg>
<seg id="3">SOUTHS legend John Sattler has launched a stinging attack on "half-a-game" Sonny Bill Williams, saying his likely departure from the NRL will not be the crushing blow many envisage.</seg>
<seg id="4">Williams' murky future took another bizarre twist on Tuesday night when he made himself available for New Zealand's World Cup campaign - just hours after ruling himself out of the event.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shock backflip prompted Test selector Richie Barnett to accuse the Roosters superstar of "disrespecting" the Kiwis as he weighs up a likely return to New Zealand rugby after the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">While Williams' signing with the NZRU appears a fait accompli, Roosters chairman Nick Politis is refusing to give up hope of keeping the dual international at Bondi.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Sattler is not convinced Williams' weekly contributions match the hype.</seg>
<seg id="8">Souths' last premiership-winning captain in 1971, Sattler attended last Sunday night's grand final and walked away lukewarm about the Kiwi Test star's game of two halves.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Roosters have formally approached the NRL seeking salary cap assistance to retain Williams, but Sattler says the code owes the 108kg forward no favours.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sonny Bill Williams has won the Jack Gibson Medal as best and fairest of new NRL premier the Sydney Roosters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Picture: Toby Zerna</seg>
<seg id="12">"I don't think we'd miss him, the game goes on," said Sattler, a former Test captain.</seg>
<seg id="13">Once they start this, 'will I or won't I go' ... well just leave Sonny Bill.</seg>
<seg id="14">""If your heart isn't in rugby league, go and play another code.</seg>
<seg id="15">The game shouldn't do any more than it has already to keep him.</seg>
<seg id="16">While he made uncharacteristic mistakes in the opening half of the grand final, Williams produced a superb second stanza, finishing with 23 tackles and 141 metres from 14 runs.</seg>
<seg id="17">Tohu Harris has been punted from NZ's rugby league World Cup squad to make way for Sonny Bill Williams.</seg>
<seg id="18">This season, the 28-year-old has averaged 12 hit-ups, 24 tackles and 108 metres per game, figures Sattler believes do not denote greatness.</seg>
<seg id="19">"He can't be considered a great of the game, imagine putting him in the same league as Bob McCarthy, Ron Coote or Reg Gasnier," Sattler said.</seg>
<seg id="20">He doesn't get involved enough, he hangs around and every so often he will make a great run, but he has no work-rate.</seg>
<seg id="21">""His first half the other night was woeful, in grand finals your first half is crucial so he really played half-a-game.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sonny Bill wouldn't hold a candle to Coote or McCarthy.</seg>
<seg id="23">There's no doubt he has plenty of ability but in my opinion he just doesn't do enough work.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sonny Bill Williams in action for the Sydney Roosters in the NRL Grand Final.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite Barnett's blast, the NZRL eventually added Williams to their Cup squad, just prior to the forward explaining his backflip on social media.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Without thinking the whole situation through, I eagerly jumped at the chance to chill out and rest," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">After having some time to really think about how much representing my country means to me, I decided to put my name forward for selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Maroons coach Mal Meninga believes NRL hierarchy can do no more to prevent Williams returning to play for the Chiefs and All Blacks in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think the NRL have done enough," Meninga said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sonny Bill Williams has issued an apology for his World Cup selection backflip, insisting his decision to take a holiday was not thoroughly considered.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sonny Bill understands how much the game wants him to stay.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's a personal decision.</seg>
<seg id="33">The game has told Sonny Bill how much they want him to stay and they will do everything they possibly can, but at the end of the day it will be his decision.</seg>
<seg id="34">Broncos rival Justin Hodges urged Williams not to walk away from rugby league.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I think he has been fantastic for the game," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">When you lose players like Karmichael (Hunt) and 'Izzy' (Folau) to other codes, it makes their codes bigger.</seg>
<seg id="37">""We need our big names to stay, a guy like Sonny Bill draws fans and entertains.</seg>
<seg id="38">Having him this year made the game a bit more hyped and I think he's a fantastic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Roosters have the money to keep him, it's just a matter of whether he wants to stay on.</seg>
<seg id="40">I hope he does.</seg>

<seg id="3">With plenty of improved features, but still too few apps, is there enough to tempt buyers to put its new Surface 2 on a shopping list that includes Apple and Android tablets?</seg>
<seg id="4">Microsoft Surface 2 (rating: 3/5)</seg>
<seg id="5">Microsoft's first foray into the tablet market with the Surface RT last year was largely shunned by consumers, who found it all too easy to make unfavourable comparisons with its iOS and Android-based rivals, based on size, weight, performance, price and the increasingly important app availability.</seg>
<seg id="6">Personal Technology</seg>
<seg id="7">Microsoft has valiantly set out to address at least some of those concerns in the Surface 2, which costs from $449 (£359 in the UK), making it $50 less than the initial Surface RT and other premium, full-size tablets.</seg>
<seg id="8">Like the first, the model is built around the RT ("run time") version of Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system - the updated 8.1 version in this instance.</seg>
<seg id="9">Windows RT was specifically designed for mobile devices powered by the Arm family of processors, but it is more limited than the full version of Windows 8.1.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Surface 2 looks and feels like its predecessor although it is slightly thinner and lighter, but the difference is so fractional as to be insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is similar in size to most of its rivals, but at 1.5lb it is about 50 per cent heavier than Apple's new iPad Air.</seg>
<seg id="12">But in some ways the Surface 2 hardware is more flexible than the iPad Air's since you can plug in more add-ons, such as a card reader for extra storage.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new version has kept the distinctive kickstand.</seg>
<seg id="14">The difference is that it can lean back at a 40-degree angle as well as at 24 degrees, which I found more comfortable for typing when I connected one of the amazingly slim backlit keyboard accessories that snap on using a magnet.</seg>
<seg id="15">More importantly, the Surface 2 has a more powerful and faster processor, a significantly higher-resolution 10.5in high-definition touchscreen, battery life that delivers up to 10 hours of continuous video playback between charges, and much better front and rear-facing digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="16">Both cameras can capture 1080p video and feature improved low-light performance, so I found face-to-face Skype conversations between home in New York and my son in England more enjoyable than before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Overall, the improvements all add up to make the Surface 2 much more appealing than its predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unfortunately, however, the Surface 2 still suffers from what might be termed a mighty app deficit: it can run only apps designed specifically for Windows RT and although Microsoft has been expanding the number in Windows Store, some of the most popular iOS and Android apps are absent.</seg>
<seg id="19">I missed RunKeeper, Tumblr and Instagram, and while most of my favourite music apps are available, Rdio and Spotify noticeably are not.</seg>
<seg id="20">That makes it hard to recommend wholeheartedly the Surface 2 - fast, light and well built though it is - as an alternative to any of Apple's iPads or of the often much more affordable Android tablets, such as Lenovo's new 8in and 10in IdeaPad Yoga tablets .</seg>
<seg id="21">That said, the Surface 2 does have one big advantage over riwvals: it comes with a version of Microsoft Office that includes the popular PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and Outlook apps.</seg>
<seg id="22">Once you run the Office apps and add one of the two versions of snap-on keyboard - costing $120 or $130 (£100, £110) - you effectively have an affordable, ultra-lightweight notebook PC, albeit with somewhat limited apps.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then there is the Surface Pro 2 tablet, which is designed for business users, with its much more powerful Intel processor and a digital pen to take notes and draw on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="24">This could be a better buy because it runs the regular, not the RT, version of Windows 8.1 and the full range of Windows applications.</seg>
<seg id="25">I much prefer it because I can run all my favourite Windows desktop apps, which include Windows-based home automation and personal finance software, on a lightweight tablet.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is on sale from $899 (£759).</seg>
<seg id="27">But at that price, you might start to be tempted by one of the lighter notebook PCs available with a traditional fixed keyboard, while saving up for an iPad Mini or Android 7in or 8in tablet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Planet of the Apps</seg>
<seg id="29">Paul Taylor picks his favourite from the latest crop of apps</seg>
<seg id="30">What it is: Inrix XD Traffic, free for iPhone and Android.</seg>
<seg id="31">Why you should try it: The traffic intelligence company has just launched a more detailed and extensive version of its app, which helps drivers arrive quicker and travel more safely by updating them on information that will affect their journey, such as traffic jams, accidents and speed of travel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Charlene Downes murder police appeal 10 years after disappearance</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 06:01</seg>
<seg id="3">Police investigating the murder of a Blackpool teenager say they hope people who have never come forward might now have the confidence to do so.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officers are renewing their appeal for information on the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of Charlene Downes.</seg>
<seg id="5">They believe 14-year-old Charlene was one of a number of girls who were groomed for sex by men in the town.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lancashire Police said others affected by abuse would now be adults and might be more willing to share information.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police also hope the publicity surrounding recent "high profile" grooming cases will encourage new witnesses to speak to them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Charlene's body has never been found and no-one has been convicted of killing her.</seg>
<seg id="9">At a retrial in 2008 a man was cleared of her murder, and another man was found not guilty of helping to dispose of the teenager's body.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brushed under carpet</seg>
<seg id="11">Four years after Charlene's disappearance another Blackpool girl, 15-year-old Paige Chivers, went missing.</seg>
<seg id="12">She is also presumed to have been murdered.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officers said the two cases were not directly connected, but said there were similarities.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlene's mother, Karen Downes, said: "I'm still as devastated as I was 10 years ago, and I still live in hope that one day she will be found.</seg>
<seg id="15">I will never give up until justice is done for her, and I'm very disappointed that nothing has been done by now.</seg>
<seg id="16">She added: "I want the police to do more, they have done nothing in the past five years since the case collapsed, they have just brushed it under the carpet or put it in a dusty cupboard somewhere."</seg>
<seg id="17">Assistant Chief Constable Andy Rhodes said: "Charlene was involved in a situation in Blackpool around child sexual exploitation, and her disappearance is linked to that problem in Blackpool at the time.</seg>
<seg id="18">We think there are people out there that know things and have never come forward.</seg>
<seg id="19">We also think there are people out there, who were children involved in that scene at the time, who may now have the confidence to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="20">He added: "We are not connecting the murders [of Charlene and Paige] directly, but they were obviously in the same area and the same scene in terms of child sexual exploitation, so we think there's significant amounts of consistencies in terms of how these tragic murders occurred."</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt swears in first freely elected president</seg>
<seg id="2">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre," his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.</seg>
<seg id="14">Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was greeted with chants of, "The army and the people are one hand," from the hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture room.</seg>
<seg id="16">Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="1">RBS traders suspended in forex probe</seg>
<seg id="2">31 October 2013 Last updated at 23:02</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has suspended two traders in connection to a growing investigation into the possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates.</seg>
<seg id="4">The news follows reports that London-based executives at three other major banks have been placed on leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regulators in the UK, US and Switzerland are looking into whether banks colluded to set exchange rates.</seg>
<seg id="6">The global foreign exchange market is worth more than £3tn a day.</seg>
<seg id="7">London is the most important centre for the market, accounting for about 40% of all foreign exchange trading.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reports are that executives at Citigroup, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered have agreed to be placed on leave, but none has been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are Rohan Ramchandani of Citigroup, Matt Gardiner of Standard Chartered and Richard Usher at JP Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="10">RBS declined to comment.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is among several banks believed to have been contacted by regulators in recent weeks about foreign exchange dealing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Others include Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Barclays.</seg>
<seg id="13">No surprise</seg>
<seg id="14">On Wednesday Barclays became the latest bank to confirm it had launched its own internal probe into its foreign exchange trading.</seg>
<seg id="15">Regulators, including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, are looking at allegations traders used instant messaging services to fix rates - similar to the Libor-fixing scandal which resulted in big fines for major banks in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bankers were found to have colluded in fixing the Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate) rate - an interest rate used by many banks, mortgage lenders, and others to set the price of borrowing on trillions of pounds of financial contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Currently, foreign exchange prices are set at 16:00 in London each day during a one minute window.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are suspicions traders used this window to manipulate prices.</seg>
<seg id="19">Speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com, said it was not a surprise that the foreign exchange market has come in for regulatory scrutiny, given its size.</seg>
<seg id="20">She said the outcome of the investigations might affect London's standing as the centre of the forex market.</seg>
<seg id="21">"[London] has a very good reputation, but continual regulatory probes are chipping away at that," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Apple's iPad Air goes on sale, plenty available</seg>
<seg id="2">Apple's new tablet, the iPad Air, went on sale Friday, and it doesn't look like it will be selling out.</seg>
<seg id="3">Apple</seg>
<seg id="4">November 1, 2013, 8:11 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="5">The launch of the iPad Air seems to be the complete opposite of the September release of Apple's iPhone 5s.</seg>
<seg id="6">During that launch, Apple was tight on supplies of its new, high-end iPhone, and not long after the release, the gold version of the device was sold out online and at several store locations.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, the iPad Air went on sale Friday morning and there appears to be an ample supply of the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new Apple tablet features the most drastic redesign of the device in two years.</seg>
<seg id="9">The iPad Air features the same look introduced with the iPad mini and weighs in a just one pound, nearly half a pound lighter than its predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="10">The device has also slimmed down from 0.37 inches thick to 0.29 inches.</seg>
<seg id="11">The iPad Air starts at $499 for a 16 GB model and can be purchased online or in stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">The most expensive model -- a 128 GB model that can connect to LTE cellular networks -- is available for $929.</seg>
<seg id="13">All models are listed online as available to ship to customers by Nov.</seg>
<seg id="14">Users can also check the company's website and store app to see the device's availability in Apple Stores, where customers can pick up the device immediately.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Just Russia proposes to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments with extremism</seg>
<seg id="2">For legislative protection of patriotic sentiments of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "A Just Russia" proposes to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments to extremist activity and punish it with five years of prison.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the newspaper "Izvestia" reports, such amendments to legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma committee on energy Oleg Mikheev have already been submitted to the Supreme Court and the administration for decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">The author of the amendments proposes that patriotic sentiments be understood as the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, a responsible attitude toward its fate, respect to its history and culture.</seg>
<seg id="5">As Mikheev indicates, in domestic legislation there are sanctions against desecration of the formal symbols of government authority - the flag and emblem.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the member of parliament, protection of Russians whose sentiments also may be offended by defamation of government symbols and other displays of disrespect to our country, has been insufficiently elaborated in Russian legislation.</seg>
<seg id="7">As an example, he cites the discussions expanding every year on the eve of Victory Day, when certain persons in the media venture to cast doubt on the heroic feat of the people of USSR in the fight against the fascists.</seg>
<seg id="8">The day before the nationwide holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Exercising their wit and "alternative viewpoint" of history, certain publicists come to reasonings about, they say, what a pity that the cultured Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!</seg>
<seg id="10">I consider such to be absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual staple" of the nation," resents Oleg Mikheev.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, according to Mikheev, there are a lot more patriotic-spirited than religious people in Russia, moreover the law punishes insults of the sentiments of religious believers, yet it is possible to insult patriotic sentiments virtually without punishment.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the people's representative, it is necessary to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments to extremist activity and prescribe an appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.</seg>
<seg id="13">Draft legislation stipulates punishment for insulting patriotic sentiments: from a fine of 100 thousand to 5 years imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rugby league Immortal Andrew Johns nervous ahead of More Joyous inquiry</seg>
<seg id="2">Rugby league great Andrew Johns after a surf at Sydney's Whale Beach yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Attila Szilvasi Source: The Daily Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="4">ANDREW Johns is nervous and so he should be.</seg>
<seg id="5">Don't worry about his State of Origin career.</seg>
<seg id="6">Today is one of the most pressurised days of his life.</seg>
<seg id="7">Johns' moment of reckoning arrives today when he will attend the second day of the More Joyous hearing, and his performance may be remembered ahead of any game of football he ever played.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former rugby league great has moved in so many different directions since the story broke he could hide behind a corkscrew.</seg>
<seg id="9">Johns has reportedly become acutely stressed at what lies ahead, and you can understand it because he has already told two different versions of his conversation with bookie Tom Waterhouse about the prospects of More Joyous in the All Aged Stakes.</seg>
<seg id="10">That spells trouble today, because no matter what line he chooses, he will poke a hole in one of his earlier defences.</seg>
<seg id="11">But saving face cannot be his priority.</seg>
<seg id="12">Today racing deserves the truth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take it as read that whoever he supports owner John Singleton or bookmaker Tom Waterhouse his friendship with the other will be ruined beyond repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">Like many high-profile team sportsmen, Johns has spent much of his life in a bubble where his mess has been cleaned up by others.</seg>
<seg id="15">Few Sydneysiders are better connected.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite the rule that claims off-field deeds don't matter, no other player would survive a drug addiction and a racism scandal to be judged an Immortal.</seg>
<seg id="17">For once he cannot say "sort it out with my manager" or "go and see the chief executive" the eternal cop-out lines of football stars backed into tight corners.</seg>
<seg id="18">He started the bushfire about More Joyous being "off" and now he is out there on his own, the world is closing in fast, and he has some serious questions to answer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Singleton yesterday turned the heat up on Johns by claiming he told him More Joyous would "finish nearer last than first" which she did.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast to the world of rugby league stardom, where players can hide behind iron curtains erected by their clubs, racing folk are used to being isolated, exposed and vulnerable, and it's why several other big players in this soap opera have handled the pressure better than Johns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Every racing person is an island buffeted by the gale-force winds of a volatile industry, and it breeds tough people.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most horses never win a dollar.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most tips fail.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most trainers end up near broke.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Bible, the meek inherit the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="26">In racing, they get swallowed whole.</seg>
<seg id="27">You wouldn't call racing legends classical role models, but it's easy to admire their cement coating.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mega-rich owner Singleton could have afforded 10 lawyers if he wanted to, but he represented himself at the inquiry because he wanted his message alone to get through.</seg>
<seg id="29">His performance was not flawless, and most felt he was the loser on the day, but in some ways that made his decision to roll the dice and go it alone even braver.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the other corner, Gai Waterhouse hired a posse of lawyers and she has had some impressive moments too under great duress since the scandal broke.</seg>
<seg id="31">The racing world has learnt more about Gai in the past few weeks than we have in the last few decades.</seg>
<seg id="32">We always wondered who exactly was the real person beneath the plum accent who routinely tipped everything bar her clothes horse as "an exceptional winning charrrrrnce."</seg>
<seg id="33">Now we know.</seg>
<seg id="34">She is tough, combative and deceptively cunning, a true perfumed steamroller who will fight to the death for herself and her family.</seg>
<seg id="35">Her masterstroke at the first day of the inquiry was to wait until the final hour late in the day to unveil her killer lines "You're a sham, John," and "We're here because of Chinese whispers (between) a trumped-up little jockey, a brothel owner and a football player."</seg>
<seg id="36">It ensured she provided the freshest meat for the television news and the next morning's paper.</seg>
<seg id="37">Had she been a footballer, she may have been withdrawn from a commitment speaking to a lunch for 500 at the Warrnambool jumps carnival a few days after the scandal broke.</seg>
<seg id="38">While Johns told a television crew stationed near his home where to go with a four-letter word, Waterhouse told reporters at Warrnambool, "I'll have to love you and leave you, " proving there are times when middle-aged women can have slicker sidesteps than league Immortals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian security agencies know nothing about the group "Brotherly Circle" - New Izvestia</seg>
<seg id="2">INTERFAX.RU writes about it citing an information source in RF law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="3">"After reports of Leps being entered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury into blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brotherly Circle' emerged in the media, we looked through all databases, but we did not detect such a group," said the agency source.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to him, the distribution of such information helps maintain the myth about the so-called Russian mafia, which supposedly operates abroad.</seg>
<seg id="5">As "NI" previously had written, yesterday the U.S. Department of the Treasury published on its website a list of supposed members of the criminal group "Brotherly Circle".</seg>
<seg id="6">Among them the Russian singer Grigory Leps was also named.</seg>
<seg id="7">He appears in the list as "Grisha", they put out the day before.</seg>
<seg id="8">They coincide with the data of the popular Russian performer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, stage name, place and data of birth are specified.</seg>
<seg id="10">Besides Leps, another five persons are mentioned there.</seg>
<seg id="11">Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and one more native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the U.S. they are confident that Grigory Leps, who resides on the island of Phuket, transported money for gangsters on their orders.</seg>
<seg id="13">To this message was attached a photograph of the singer and was specified all of his data, which correspond to the facts.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, Leps actually recently bought a home on Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the agency they noted that they intend to impose sanctions in relation to Leps.</seg>
<seg id="16">A person's entry into blacklists of the American Department of the Treasury entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with him by persons living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="17">The assistant of Leps Maya Serikova stated that no notifications have come to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question, is Grigory the one about whom everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the U.S."</seg>
<seg id="18">All that Leps knows is media information.</seg>

<seg id="1">US airlines lifts ban to use portable electronics during take-off and landing</seg>
<seg id="2">The FAA decision to allow "gate to gate" use came after a lengthy investigation by a committee which heard from pilots, passengers, flight attendants, plane manufacturers and technology experts.</seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, Amazon filled a plane with its product, the Kindle electronic reader, and switched the devices on to show they were not interfering with the aircraft's systems.</seg>
<seg id="4">Announcing the change at Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC, Michael Huerta, the FAA Administrator, said: "The world has changed a lot in the past 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am pleased to announce that airlines can safely expand passenger use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most commercial airlines can tolerate radio interference from portable electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's safe to read downloaded materials, like e-books, calendars and to play games.</seg>
<seg id="8">The FAA said that in some cases when there was extremely low visibility some landing systems might not be able to tolerate the radio interference, and flight crews would ask passengers to shut down devices.</seg>
<seg id="9">That would happen in about one in 100 flights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Before adopting the new guidelines, airlines will have to undergo testing to make sure their aircraft can cope with the extra radio interference.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most US airlines were expected to adopt the new measures by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Delta, one of the major airlines, said its fleet had already been tested and passengers would be allowed to use their devices this week.</seg>
<seg id="13">JetBlue also said the new measures would take effect immediately.</seg>
<seg id="14">A spokesman for the US Travel Association said: "We're pleased the FAA recognises that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security."</seg>
<seg id="15">Brett Snyder, a frequent traveller who writes an internet column called The Cranky Flyer, said: "The current set of rules are archaic and based simply on precedent as opposed to reality."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Association of Professional Flight Attendants also welcomed the change, saying its members would no longer have to act as "hall monitors" telling passengers to turn devices off.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers will still be required to listen to a preflight safety briefing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Huerta said: "Passengers must take a break from their devices, their reading material, their music, whatever they are doing, and listen to the safety briefing before each flight.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is information that can save your life.</seg>
<seg id="20">A decision on whether to extend the revised rules to Europe rests with the European Aviation Safety Agency.</seg>
<seg id="21">EASA was involved in the study carried out by the Federal Aviation Authority, which would suggest that Europe could fall into line.</seg>
<seg id="22">The aviation industry will be keen to see the rules harmonised across the world to avoid passengers being confused.</seg>
<seg id="23">However even if the rules were relaxed, it will be up to airlines to apply individually before they are allowed to lift the ban on electronic devices.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court Reinstates Most of Texas' New Abortion Rules</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled that most of Texas' tough new abortion restrictions can take effect immediately - a decision that means at least 12 clinics won't be able to perform the procedure starting as soon as Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">A panel of judges at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said the law requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital can take effect while a lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="4">The panel issued the ruling three days after District Judge Lee Yeakel said the provision serves no medical purpose.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its 20-page ruling, the appeals court panel acknowledged that the provision "may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions."</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the panel said that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that having "the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate" a law that serves a valid purpose, "one not designed to strike at the right itself."</seg>
<seg id="7">The panel left in place a portion of Yeakel's order that prevents the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol for abortion-inducing drugs in cases where the woman is between 50 and 63 days into her pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doctors testifying before the court had said such women would be harmed if the protocol were enforced.</seg>
<seg id="9">After Yeakel halted the restrictions, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott had made an emergency appeal to the conservative 5th Circuit, arguing that the law requiring doctors to have admitting privileges is a constitutional use of the Legislature's authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women," Abbott, a Republican who is running for governor, said in a written statement.</seg>
<seg id="11">Lawyers for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers had argued that the regulations do not protect women and would shut down a third of the 32 abortion clinics in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a statement Thursday, Planned Parenthood said the appeals court decision means "abortion will no longer be available in vast stretches of Texas."</seg>
<seg id="13">"This fight is far from over," Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion statewide.</seg>
<seg id="15">The court's order is temporary until it can hold a complete hearing, likely in January.</seg>
<seg id="16">The restrictions are among the toughest in the nation and gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June.</seg>
<seg id="17">Davis has since launched her own gubernatorial campaign and could face Abbott in the November 2014 election.</seg>
<seg id="18">Republican Gov. Rick Perry has said he will not seek another term.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law that the Legislature passed this summer also bans abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy and beginning in October 2014 requires doctors to perform all abortions in surgical facilities.</seg>
<seg id="20">Officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified in the trial that Yeakel oversaw that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision.</seg>
<seg id="21">Many hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there, while others fear protests if they provide privileges.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility, or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.</seg>

<seg id="2">TWO Victorian alpine resorts reliant on taxpayer cash are being opened to private investment in an effort to reduce state government subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort and Lake Mountain are seeking long-term private managers with the Victorian government saying it will help build a more sustainable economic future for the resorts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Environment Minister Ryan Smith says the tender process would secure the resorts' future while reducing the burden on taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Importantly, by engaging private operators, the reliance on taxpayers' pockets to subsidise these resorts will be reduced," Mr Smith said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The state government spent more than $1.4 million propping up the Mount Baw Baw resort in 2012 and around $5 million the year before, its annual report shows.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort chair Vicky Papachristos said the board's vision was to attract investment proposals that were sensitive to the local environment while ensuring the resort remained economically viable.</seg>
<seg id="8">"For some years, Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort has required additional government funding to remain operational," Ms Papachristos said.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are seeking to draw on the expertise of the private sector to reduce this burden on the taxpayer and produce a better overall offering.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lake Mountain is already under a short-term 12-month agreement with private operators which commenced in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="11">The two-stage tender process opened on Friday with private investors bidding for the right to operate and manage the resorts under a four-year agreement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Saturn moon Titan may harbour an ocean</seg>
<seg id="2">SCIENTISTS have reported on the strongest sign yet that Saturn's giant moon may have a salty ocean beneath its chilly surface.</seg>
<seg id="3">If confirmed, it would catapult Titan into an elite class of solar system moons harbouring water, an essential ingredient for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Titan boasts methane-filled seas at the poles and a possible lake near the equator.</seg>
<seg id="5">And it's long been speculated Titan contains a hidden liquid layer, based on mathematical modelling and electric field measurements made by the Huygens spacecraft that landed on the surface in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="6">The latest evidence is still indirect, but outside scientists said it's probably the best that can be obtained short of sending a spacecraft to drill into the surface.</seg>
<seg id="7">The research looks convincing, said Gabriel Tobie of France's University of Nantes.</seg>
<seg id="8">"If the analysis is correct, this is a very important finding," Mr Tobie said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The finding by an international team of researchers was released by the journal, Science.</seg>
<seg id="10">The scientists pored over data from the orbiting Cassini spacecraft, which flew by Titan half a dozen times between 2006 and last year and took gravity measurements for a glimpse of its interior.</seg>
<seg id="11">They found Titan got squeezed and stretched depending on its orbit around Saturn, suggesting the presence of a buried ocean.</seg>
<seg id="12">If Titan were solid rock and ice, such deformations would not occur.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Titan is quite squishy," said Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University, part of the research team.</seg>
<seg id="14">Previous estimates suggested the ocean could be 48 to 99km deep with traces of ammonia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Titan is one of the few worlds in the solar system with a significant atmosphere, and an underground ocean could help explain how Titan replenishes methane in its hazy atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="16">Its body of water would also make Titan an attractive place to study whether it could support microbial life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jessica Mauboy</seg>
<seg id="3">Whole other level: Jessica Mauboy exercises her sweet tooth.</seg>
<seg id="4">Photo: Joe Armao</seg>
<seg id="5">High tea at the five-star Langham Hotel seems a rather fancy lunch choice for pop star Jessica Mauboy, whose easygoing nature is referenced in everything you read about her.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when we meet at the hotel's Aria Bar, she explains why: it reminds her of her grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="7">Growing up, we always had it at my grandparents' place.</seg>
<seg id="8">They were very traditional when it came to coffee and tea so when guests came over my Oma from my dad's side - he's Indonesian Timorese - she'd have everything prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">She'd have pretty cakes made, very traditional and all sweet, lots of things with coconut milk, and a very sweet green cake, made from pandan leaves.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our three-tiered tiffin tray arrives and it's a daunting display: ribbon sandwiches with smoked salmon, cream cheese and chicken, champagne truffles, chocolate eclairs, fruit cake and scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream.</seg>
<seg id="11">And chocolate-dipped strawberries decorated to look like they're wearing mini-tuxedoes.</seg>
<seg id="12">High tea: Classy confections.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not quite the high tea of Mauboy's childhood, but, she says, almost as colourful.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a whole other level!</seg>
<seg id="15">Growing up there was a lot of colours on the table.</seg>
<seg id="16">A lot of colourful cakes and desserts.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was a dessert called 'gara-susu' - 'susu' means milk or breast in Indonesian - and it was almost like a jelly cake, but made from milk, that was always served with coffee.</seg>
<seg id="18">That was a favourite of mine.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mauboy, 24, was born in Darwin, the fourth of five girls.</seg>
<seg id="20">Her father, Ferdy, is Indonesian and her mother, Therese, is indigenous, but learnt to cook Indonesian cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="21">Food has played a big part in Mauboy's childhood, from family celebrations at home to their annual family trips to Kefamenanu in West Timor, where Ferdy is from.</seg>
<seg id="22">And while she says she doesn't often get the time, Mauboy reckons she's not a bad cook herself.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ribbon sandwiches.</seg>
<seg id="24">I love to make fish curry, almost like a fish stew with carrot and potato to make it hearty, and ginger and lemongrass to give it spice.</seg>
<seg id="25">We should have had a cooking class!</seg>
<seg id="26">Let's set that up next time and I will cook for you.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's been seven years since Mauboy was runner-up in the 2006 season of Australian Idol, and in that time she's become an international star, as renowned for her acting roles in Bran Nue Dae and the massive hit The Sapphires as her extraordinary voice.</seg>
<seg id="28">In September she even performed at the Emmys Governor's Ball in Los Angeles.</seg>
<seg id="29">She's doubtless had the requisite media training - she's careful, for example, when discussing some of the nastier comments she received during Idol, conceding only that she prefers the more "nurturing" format of The Voice on which she appeared as a judge - but there's no doubting her enthusiasm for her work, and when she discusses home and family, she's positively radiant.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mauboy moved to Sydney five years ago, but tries to get home as often as she can, and has a long-distance relationship with long-time boyfriend Themeli Magripilis.</seg>
<seg id="31">Patient fella that he is!</seg>
<seg id="32">I never see him, the poor thing," she says.</seg>
<seg id="33">But we make it work; it's been five years now.</seg>
<seg id="34">He works for the Darwin City Council, loves his fishing ... Darwin boy, Darwin girl!</seg>
<seg id="35">I'm close to his mum and dad, and he's close to my family too - he'll take my dad out fishing, and go visit Mum, and whenever I can, I'll visit his family.</seg>
<seg id="36">Themeli joins us for a time, and the pair show off photos from his phone of recent fishing trips and spectacular Darwin sunsets.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Whenever I'm at home we take the boat out for a fish," says Mauboy.</seg>
<seg id="38">We catch white fish mainly, sometimes mud crabs, which are really sweet.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'm pretty good!</seg>
<seg id="40">It's a lifestyle at odds with her hectic pop star one.</seg>
<seg id="41">I miss the quiet, really quiet!</seg>
<seg id="42">Having no schedule and not having to rush everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="43">Just being on Darwin time.</seg>
<seg id="44">We had a pretty normal upbringing, I guess ... we were always outside, playing in the dirt, in the rain, big thunderstorms.</seg>
<seg id="45">Mum would be, 'Get out of the rain, there's lightning!'</seg>
<seg id="46">You could see us in the gutters - they just filled up.</seg>
<seg id="47">That was our playground, on the road in the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="48">Mauboy was always a singer and had dreams of acting, but she always thought she'd be a community teacher.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It shocked me too when I won that award," she says of her AACTA and AFCA wins earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="50">Before Bran Nue Dae, I had only done stuff at school.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was into it though.</seg>
<seg id="52">In primary school I wrote my own version of Snow White, called Snow Black, which was meant to be funny, and used the local slang.</seg>
<seg id="53">I did get quite a good score for that!</seg>
<seg id="54">I was always watching Disney musicals and I loved The Sound of Music.</seg>
<seg id="55">All the things where you could see the whole body just working and singing ... and I dreamed of doing that one day.</seg>
<seg id="56">It didn't really come out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="57">She also knew she wanted to help inspire others.</seg>
<seg id="58">Once at primary school we had Cathy Freeman come in, and I remember going 'oh my God, I want to be just like that!'</seg>
<seg id="59">I wanted to visit schools and be looked up to, you know?</seg>
<seg id="60">I wanted, not just to have a passion for music, but be a mentor, or student teacher and teach kindergarten or year two or three.</seg>
<seg id="61">Kindy teacher aside, she's achieved all her goals: Mauboy is in demand as a spokeswoman, and is the official ambassador for the Yipirinya School in Alice Springs.</seg>
<seg id="62">"They have more than 200 Aboriginal kids and it's probably the only school that allows their own language and culture to be incorporated," she says.</seg>
<seg id="63">I do a lot of charity things but I just feel like if I do too many am I really making a difference?</seg>
<seg id="64">I want to be a part of one where I can really make a difference, and I think Yipirinya is that for me.</seg>
<seg id="65">Her latest single, To The End of The Earth, is a love song to her hometown.</seg>
<seg id="66">I write easily when I sing about lovey-dovey stuff, but in my head I wanted to switch it up on a personal level.</seg>
<seg id="67">I was missing home that day.</seg>
<seg id="68">Her new album, Beautiful, is a slight change of pace, somewhere "in the middle of the first and second albums," she says, with a mix of more dance-oriented tunes and her usual R&B sound.</seg>
<seg id="69">"I didn't want to go too dancey, too extreme, and confuse my fans," she says.</seg>
<seg id="70">This month Mauboy starts a national tour, her first headlining on her own.</seg>
<seg id="71">I'm so excited ... to be able to take the lead and control what I want the tour to be, how I want it set out, do I want to mash it up, what kind of lighting ... it's cool - I'm boss lady!</seg>
<seg id="72">And when she's not calling the shots on the national tour, she's reading film scripts.</seg>
<seg id="73">I've had lots of meetings with directors, local and international and I'd love to do more acting.</seg>
<seg id="74">Maybe one day but I'm so comfortable with music right now.</seg>
<seg id="75">Mauboy is not ruling out an eventual move to the US to pursue this path, although she'd want to take Themeli with her, she says, finishing off a scone.</seg>
<seg id="76">Poor fella - no more fishing!</seg>
<seg id="77">■ Jessica Mauboy's album Beautiful is out now.</seg>
<seg id="78">She plays the Melbourne Plenary on November 9.</seg>

<seg id="6">London: The phone hacking trial has taken a tabloid-style turn, with claims that star defendants Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson were lovers.</seg>
<seg id="7">Brooks, then editor of the News of the World, and Coulson, her deputy editor and successor, were in the midst of their affair when a private detective hacked the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler on the NOTW's behalf, a court has heard.</seg>

<seg id="9">Prosecutor Andrew Edis, QC, continued his opening statement to the jury in the London trial on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rebekah Brooks, former News International chief executive, was having an affair with former News of the World editor Andy Coulson while overseeing phone hacking and bribery, according to the prosecution's Andrew Edis QC.</seg>
<seg id="11">Photo: AFP Photo</seg>
<seg id="12">He detailed some of the phone hacks that became stories in the News of the World - concerning royals, politicians and celebrities - and argued that Brooks and Coulson must have known how the information in the stories was obtained.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said their affair was uncovered by police who searched Brooks" home and found a letter - "intelligent, elegant and well-written" - she wrote to Coulson in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="14">"You are my very best friend, I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you, we laugh and cry together," Mrs Brooks wrote.</seg>
<seg id="15">Without our relationship in my life I am not sure I will cope.</seg>
<seg id="16">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was someone Rebekah Brooks wrote was her 'very best friend' in a letter read to the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">It demonstrated that "what Mr Coulson knew, Mrs Brooks knew too ... that's the point," Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="18">[They] are charged with conspiracy and, when people are charged with conspiracy, the first question a jury has to answer is how well did they know each other?</seg>

<seg id="20">He said it was highly likely they were exchanging confidences, including details of phone hacking carried out by, and on behalf of, the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="21">By 2004 they had been having an affair for at least six years, but it appeared Coulson was trying to break it off, causing Brooks "a lot of grief."</seg>
<seg id="22">Both journalists were married to other people at that time - Brooks since 2002 and Coulson since 2000.</seg>
<seg id="23">Edis said their affair covered much of the period in which their newspaper was publishing stories sourced from hacked voicemails.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2005 Brooks told a lunch companion that a story about a row between Paul McCartney and Heather Mills (headlined "Macca throws Heather's Ring out of Hotel Window - Exclusive") was obtained by phone hacking, Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Much of the evidence on Thursday was concerned with private detective Glenn Mulcaire, who has already pleaded guilty to phone hacking.</seg>
<seg id="26">The court heard that Mulcaire hacked the phones of Mail on Sunday reporters.</seg>
<seg id="27">"In the dog-eat-dog world of journalism, in the frenzy to find out this story ... you hack the competition," Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was a "cheap and easy" way to find out what they were chasing, and prepare a spoiler story.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mulcaire also hacked the voicemail of Milly Dowler when she disappeared in 2002, the court heard, on the instructions of NOTW news editor Neville Thurlbeck - who has also pleaded guilty.</seg>
<seg id="30">The next edition of NOTW contained direct quotes from the missing schoolgirl's voicemail, Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="31">He said Brooks, Coulson and another accused, former NOTW managing editor Stuart Kuttner, were "criminally involved" in the hacking of Dowler's phone.</seg>
<seg id="32">Brooks was on holiday in Dubai when the Dowler hack occurred and Coulson was editing the newspaper, however the two were in regular contact, which increased as the paper's deadline approached.</seg>
<seg id="33">Brooks also called the newsdesk.</seg>
<seg id="34">Edis said it would be "simply incredible" if both editors did not know how the information in their newspaper's stories on Dowler was obtained.</seg>
<seg id="35">The court also heard about the hacking of phones associated with former home secretary David Blunkett, while Coulson was editor.</seg>
<seg id="36">The News of the World used the voicemails to source a story that he was having an affair with a married woman, Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="37">The next day The Sun newspaper - edited at the time by Brooks - picked up the story and named the woman, then reported she was pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="38">Both editors knew the facts to be true because of hacked voicemail messages, Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="39">The court heard a tape recording of Mulcaire "blagging" (or getting for free through guile) a voicemail password.</seg>
<seg id="40">They saw emails where he passed voicemail PINs to NOTW staff, so they could do their own voicemail hacks.</seg>
<seg id="41">He kept detailed notes, which revealed names such as then-minister Tessa Jowell and her husband David Mills.</seg>
<seg id="42">Another defendant, Ian Edmondson, former news editor of the paper, also hacked Tessa Jowell's voicemail using information provided by Mulcaire, Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="43">Mulcaire also targeted the private messages of deputy PM John Prescott, via his advisers" mobiles.</seg>
<seg id="44">An email detailing the hacking of Prescott was "the email that closed the News of the World," Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="45">He told the court Mulcaire also hacked Lord Frederick Windsor, the son of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent - and that the police found tape recordings of some of his voicemail messages.</seg>
<seg id="46">He said Coulson would have asked "the editor's question: how do I know this is true?"</seg>
<seg id="47">Mulcaire was on a £92,000 ($155,000) exclusive retainer, boosted to £100,000 a year under Coulson, Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="48">He was also given spot payments, and worked on a weekly basis for the royal editor Clive Goodman - another of the defendants in the trial.</seg>
<seg id="49">Edis said the paper's managing editor Stuart Kuttner signed off £413,000 in payments to Mulcaire between 2000 and 2007 and "must have known" what the money was being spent on.</seg>
<seg id="50">And he said Brooks was actively involved in the paper's budgets and kept tight control over costs and yet had never apparently questioned the payments to Mulcaire.</seg>
<seg id="51">In fact the payments continued after his arrest and only stopped with his first phone hacking conviction in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="52">All defendants have denied the charges against them.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trial continues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Executioners in Saudi and Egypt tell of their love of killing people</seg>
<seg id="2">Hajj Abd al-Nabi says he used to strangle and drown animals as a child, making him the perfect candidate for the roll of Egypt's chief executioner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Courtesy MemriTV</seg>
<seg id="4">Even takes his children to executions ...</seg>
<seg id="5">Saudi Arabia's executioner Abdullah al-Bishi beheads people for a living.</seg>
<seg id="6">THEIR careers are to kill people.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meet Egypt's official executioner, Hajj Abd al-Nabi, and Saudi Arabia executioner Abdallah Al-Bishi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Al-Nabi favours strangulation while his Saudi counterpart brandishes a sword.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier today we told how al-Nabi recently boasted of killing more than 800 people - and loving every minute of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">In all honesty, I love my work.</seg>
<seg id="11">I just love it!</seg>
<seg id="12">I never say 'no' when they need me at work," al-Nabi says in a bizarre interview with Egypt's Video 7.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the video, translated this week by the respected Washington-based MEMRI (Middle East Media Research Institute), al-Nabi animatedly discusses his calling with more than a hint of pride.</seg>
<seg id="14">The hangman says he kills only criminals and is doing Allah's work.</seg>
<seg id="15">I love people, and people love me,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">But when it comes to carrying out my job, I am tough.</seg>
<seg id="17">Egypt's hangman Hajj Abd al-Nabi has killed more than 800 people.</seg>
<seg id="18">Picture: Video7 via MEMRI TV Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="19">The interview is extremely strange, by Western standards - but not even opponents of MEMRI have challenged its authenticity, and a spokesman for the institute assured us the clip is real.</seg>
<seg id="20">More on MEMRI below</seg>
<seg id="21">Al-Nabi throws his massive hands around excitedly throughout the four-minute clip, saying he learnt his skills as a child.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I was a little Satan," he admitted.</seg>
<seg id="23">As a 13 and 14-year-old "my hobby was to catch a cat, to place a rope around its neck, to strangle it, and throw it into the water.</seg>
<seg id="24">I would get hold of any animal - even dogs.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would strangle these animals and throw them into the water - even dogs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strangulation was my hobby.</seg>
<seg id="27">When I applied for the job and did well on the tests - proving that I could take the psychological pressure and so on - they said: 'Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, grow a moustache' " - presumably a reference to moustaches being a sign of machismo in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hajj Abd al-Nabi says he was a "litte Satan" as a child and would hone his skills on cats and dogs.</seg>
<seg id="30">But al-Nabi, the chief warrant officer in Egypt's police and prison authority, admits that he "has a heart of stone."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Only if you have a heart of stone can you be content in this line of work," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Saudi Arabia's leading executioner is Abdallah al-Bishi, who like his father before him can execute 10 people in one single day.</seg>
<seg id="33">His style of killing is by decapitation, using a sword (sulthan).</seg>
<seg id="34">He also removes limbs by his sword under the country's sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="35">Any executioner who wants to work in this field must know how to apply the theoretical knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="36">If he knows how to stand next to the person he is executing, how to concentrate on the blow, and how to land it, the rest is easy," he said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="37">At work, if I let myself feel mercy or compassion for the person I am executing, he will not die at the first stroke.</seg>
<seg id="38">He will suffer.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the heart is compassionate, the hand fails.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can take two, three, four, or five strokes.</seg>
<seg id="41">God knows how many.</seg>
<seg id="42">He might not even die.</seg>
<seg id="43">If the heart is compassionate - that's it.</seg>
<seg id="44">The hand cannot function properly.</seg>
<seg id="45">Your hand betrays you.</seg>
<seg id="46">Once the mission is done, I feel relieved.</seg>
<seg id="47">I come home relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="48">I play with the children.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have fun.</seg>
<seg id="50">We have lunch.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sometimes we go out.</seg>
<seg id="52">Other times, we stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="53">Everything is normal.</seg>
<seg id="54">It has no effect on me.</seg>
<seg id="55">Al-Bishi's son said that he would join him at an execution.</seg>
<seg id="56">Hussein Urni is a district hangman, an Ashmawi, in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="57">"The first time it is a little difficult, the second time it gets a little easier, but from then on, it becomes run-of-the-mill," he said, in another interview transcipt from MEMRI.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's not different than a cameraman.</seg>
<seg id="59">That's his job, and he likes it.</seg>
<seg id="60">Like anyone who is trying to make a living, he goes to work, and prepares the chains and the ropes.</seg>
<seg id="61">My line of work as an executioner has no effect on my personal life.</seg>
<seg id="62">The proof is that people come up to me on the street...</seg>
<seg id="63">You'd have thought people would consider an executioner to be grumpy.</seg>
<seg id="64">A man's job is one thing, and his personal life is another.</seg>
<seg id="65">The first time children came to my kids at school ...</seg>
<seg id="66">Once, they saw my picture in a newspaper, and the kids wanted to be friends with my children, and were proud of them because their father was a celebrity.</seg>
<seg id="67">The institute states its mission is to "explore the Middle East and South Asia through their media," providing translations and analysis to "inform the debate over US policy in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="68">It is independent, nonpartisan and nonprofit with a number of well-known names from government and media on its board of directors - among them former President George W. Bush's right-hand man Donald Rumsfeld and former US ambassador to the UN John Bolton.</seg>
<seg id="69">However critics say it is anti-Islam and pro-Israel, providing only selective insights into Middle Eastern culture that ignore the mainstream and skew Western views.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UK's Muslim Public Affairs Committee argues the clips it provides from Arabic media are often "very loosely" translated and many are "themed around pro-violence and anti-semetic sentiments within fringe elements of Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="71">MEMRI executive director Steve Salinsky rebuffed that criticism, noting the MPAC is an "extremist organization associated with Holocaust denial."</seg>
<seg id="72">Discussing the al-Nabi video, he said "unfortunately, it's not a fake."</seg>
<seg id="73">MEMRI staff monitor Middle Eastern TV for clips which it then posts with translations.</seg>
<seg id="74">Mr Salinsky said it wasn't unusual for Middle Eastern TV to screen interviews with state-appointed executioners.</seg>

<seg id="2">by:</seg>

<seg id="5">adelaidenow</seg>
<seg id="6">Adelaide's Scott Camporeale is sick of hearing about what the Crows did and didn't do last season.</seg>
<seg id="7">ADELAIDE is tiring of living off the memory of its bitter, five-point preliminary final loss to Hawthorn last September - the game labelled as showing the Crows were "a kick away from the Grand Final."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Crows face Hawthorn tomorrow for the first time since that epic final that was supposed to spur Adelaide to another top-four finish, which now seems far away from Brenton Sanderson's group, particularly with the loss of key forward Taylor Walker with a season-ending knee injury.</seg>
<seg id="9">Crows midfield coach Scott Camporeale today tried to dismiss the notion that Adelaide players are still living off the back-slapping tributes of 2012 when they lifted the club from 14th to second in the home-and-away series.</seg>
<seg id="10">"To be quite honest, I'm sick of hearing about that," said Camporeale.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year was last year and this club has not achieved anything.</seg>
<seg id="12">All we did last year was gain a little bit more respect back from the competition.</seg>
<seg id="13">""Playing in the preliminary final was a bonus for us.</seg>
<seg id="14">We understand where we're at - we all have to improve.</seg>
<seg id="15">We haven't spoken once about the preliminary final.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's last year.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have more as a club and a team to worry about than what happened last year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Adelaide's search for answers after a disappointing 2-3 start brought savage internal questioning at West Lakes this week.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Just clarity," said Camporeale of the result of the frank discussions between players and coaches this week.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clarity in what is expected from the individual and the group.</seg>

<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- An instrument that will give forecasters better data about world weather systems is ready to go into the satellite that will take it into orbit, NASA says.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Advanced Baseline Imager will be the primary sensor on the new generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, GOES-R, the agency reported Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ABI instrument on the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration satellite will track and monitor cloud formation, atmospheric motion and more data of weather, oceans, and the environment, scientists said.</seg>
<seg id="5">It will aid in forecasting severe weather, volcanic ash advisories, fire and smoke and other hazards, they said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The United States is home to some of the most severe weather in the world including tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms, floods, and wildfires," said Mary Kicza, assistant administrator for NOAA's Satellite and Information Service.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ABI offers breakthrough technology that will help NOAA develop faster and more accurate forecasts that will save lives and protect communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first satellite in the GOES-R Series, being built by Lockheed, is currently scheduled for launch in early 2016, NASA said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Venezuela will establish an exchange rate for tourists</seg>
<seg id="2">Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was reported on November 1 by the agency Bloomberg citing the government decree.</seg>
<seg id="4">Foreign travelers will be permitted to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand American dollars per year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars they acquired in the country when departing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The precise rate of bolivars against the dollar will be established later.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, on the black market one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the start of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.</seg>
<seg id="10">In September, inflation in Venezuela amounted to almost 50 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">The minister of the oil industry and vice president of economics Rafael Ramirez on October 18 announced that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to unofficial data, which the agency cited, Caracas could nonetheless decide to reduce the rate of the national currency after municipal elections in December.</seg>
<seg id="13">The policy of restraining prices on products and goods of mass consumption, as well as the high level of over-regulation of the Venezuelan economy have led to a deficit of a number of goods and to the functioning of a black currency market.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the spring of this year, mass media reported that a shortage of toilet paper was noted in Venezuela.</seg>

<seg id="1">A snowboarder was specially photographed for an Olympic banknote</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued into circulation a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi where already this winter the Olympics will take place.</seg>
<seg id="3">The face value of the banknote is 100 rubles.</seg>
<seg id="4">But online bloggers are already actively mocking the commemorative banknote.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30 they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in image banks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Specifically - in the free photo archive StockExchange, where the photo in question is dated 2005.</seg>
<seg id="7">That same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, it was already used in an advertisement for RugGear smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic banknote was designed in a dark blue-light blue color gamut.</seg>
<seg id="10">At one side a snowboarder flying over Sochi is displayed,  at the other - the view of an Olympic stadium and the Firebird.</seg>
<seg id="11">The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, winner in the competition among students of Saint Petersburg's Academy of Arts n.a. Repin.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the presentation it was noted that several sports were examined - downhill skiing, freestyle and ski jumping, but in the end snowboarding was selected since it is a relatively young type of sport.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to an "Izvestia" source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to public opinion relating to the wide distribution of an image of a snowboarder from an Olympic banknote and it is now studying the situation.</seg>
<seg id="14">However in Gosznak they are not too worried by the buzz surrounding the Olympic banknote.</seg>
<seg id="15">The head of the press service of Gosznak Natalia Nikiforova told "Izvestia" that all discussions regarding plagiarism are ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="16">The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, on online photographs - to the left, specified Nikiforova.</seg>
<seg id="17">The person in the photo session to create the banknote was photographed from various points, then the final image was selected, with a typical pose of a snowboarder on it.</seg>
<seg id="18">She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote since the artist received payment for the work.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to experts, the discussion surrounding the image on the Olympic banknote is entirely positive.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recognizability of the image on the banknote is a plus for its promotion, - believes the CEO of NP "RusBrand" Aleksei Popovichev.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is rather difficult to prove one hundred percent resemblance of the images on the banknote and in photo banks, therefore claims to dispute intellectual property for this image will unlikely arise.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first ever Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative banknote for 10 yuan was issued for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russia decided to support this tradition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in "airplane" mode.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
<seg id="15">For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes," the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.</seg>
<seg id="19">The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing.</seg>

<seg id="2">WASHINGTON Fannie Mae sued nine major banks Thursday, alleging the banks' participation in the rigging of a key global interest rate cost the mortgage giant hundreds of millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">The banks sued include Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and others that set the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, which is the basis for trillions of dollars in contracts, including mortgages and bonds.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fannie claims it lost $800 million from transactions that were based on the banks' false submissions of their borrowing costs used to calculate LIBOR.</seg>
<seg id="5">The banks deliberately held down the value of LIBOR to benefit their trading positions and boost profits, Fannie said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Four of the banks - Britain's Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, Switzerland's largest bank UBS and the Dutch Rabobank - have been fined a total $3.6 billion by U.S. and British regulators for manipulating LIBOR.</seg>
<seg id="7">Spokesmen for Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan declined to comment on Fannie's lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="8">The other two banks sued are Germany's Deutsche Bank and Switzerland's Credit Suisse.</seg>
<seg id="9">The lawsuit says the three U.S. banks, as well as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, remain under investigation in connection with alleged manipulation of LIBOR.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fannie's smaller sibling Freddie Mac filed similar suits against 15 LIBOR-setting banks in March.</seg>
<seg id="11">The inspector general for the Federal Housing Finance Agency reported last year that Fannie and Freddie together may have lost more than $3 billion on their transactions from the banks' rate-rigging.</seg>
<seg id="12">FHFA oversees Fannie and Freddie, both of which were rescued during the 2008 financial crisis and are now government controlled.</seg>
<seg id="13">The legal action by Fannie and Freddie added to a flurry of lawsuits filed by cities and municipal agencies in the U.S. against some of the banks that set LIBOR.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cities and agencies are seeking damages for losses they say they suffered as a result of an artificially low rate, because they hold bonds and other investments whose value is pegged to LIBOR.</seg>

<seg id="14">The three wounded victims are being treated in hospital, with one said to be in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="15">The incident, which took place at about 9.30am local time, prompted the evacuation of some passengers, while others were locked down in airport restaurants and lounges.</seg>
<seg id="16">Officials said at a news conference they believed the gunman acted alone, adding they saw no further threat to the nation's third largest airport.</seg>

<seg id="1">High Minds by Simon Heffer, review</seg>
<seg id="2">Those minds were both male and female and drawn not only from the ranks of the ruling classes.</seg>
<seg id="3">All, Heffer shows, were distinguished by a sense of purpose, ambition and the determination to do things quickly.</seg>
<seg id="4">"National progress is the sum of individual industry, energy and uprightness," asserted Scottish reformer Samuel Smiles.</seg>
<seg id="5">Little wonder that so-called "Victorian values" have so often been appropriated by needy politicians.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Heffer's account is more than a chronicle of piously good intentions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The issues that dominate Heffer's period are weighty: the alleviation of poverty; the extension of the franchise; education, health care and housing provision; rights for workers and rights for women; secularisation and technological progress.</seg>
<seg id="8">Repeatedly in their lofty campaigns Heffer's dramatis personae employ heart as well as head.</seg>
<seg id="9">High Minds is partly social history, partly a history of ideas.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the personalities involved that contribute such liveliness to this assured and magisterial narrative.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are all spoiled tarts," recorded 19th-century novelist Samuel Butler, a surprising statement for any eminent Victorian.</seg>
<seg id="12">Butler's metaphor was drawn from his school days at Shrewsbury, where one Mrs Brown sold off tarts that had spoiled in the baking at a cheap price.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They most of them looked pretty right till you handled them," Butler remembered.</seg>
<seg id="14">His imagery is clear.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among the defining features of the period was the ubiquity of the desire to avoid "spoiled-tart" status, the enthusiasm with which so many men and women embraced Matthew Arnold's allusion to the Sermon on the Mount: "Be ye therefore perfect."</seg>
<seg id="16">Victoria herself lamented, "how sadly deficient I am"; in happier mood she celebrated the onset of a period of happiness and calm in her domestic life as "an epoch of progress."</seg>
<seg id="17">Heffer's period overlaps with what Victorianist Asa Briggs labelled "the age of improvement."</seg>
<seg id="18">As High Minds shows, it is a tag which applies to more than the spread of railways or the postal system.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stories, as the great Victorian novelists understood, require heroes and villains.</seg>
<seg id="20">So too, perhaps, readable history.</seg>
<seg id="21">Heffer offers us both.</seg>
<seg id="22">High Minds celebrates the achievements of churchmen, politicians, reformers, philanthropists, architects, scientists, schoolmasters, princes and public servants.</seg>
<seg id="23">Above them all tower Gladstone and the Prince Consort.</seg>
<seg id="24">For Heffer, Gladstone's "was perhaps the highest mind of an age densely populated with them: he embodied the drive to pursue perfection, promote civilisation and improve the lives of the British people."</seg>
<seg id="25">The flip side of the coin in High Minds is Gladstone's political bête noire, Benjamin Disraeli, a cynical popinjay with an eye to the prize.</seg>
<seg id="26">Heffer has not attempted to portray Victorianism in all its facets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rather, he captures aspects of the period's idiosyncratic pursuit of perfection with supreme assurance, gravitas and flashes of humour.</seg>

<seg id="1">The agency "Rosbalt" was deprived of media status for obscenity</seg>
<seg id="2">On October 31 the Moscow Municipal Court resolved to annul the license of registration of the agency "Rosbalt", writes "Lenta".</seg>
<seg id="3">Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status for systematic and blatant violations of the law on mass media.</seg>
<seg id="4">A disagreeable precedent was created during the trial: the court considered it feasible to close the media outlet, virtually depriving the agency of the right to put forth counterarguments.</seg>
<seg id="5">What is "Rosbalt"</seg>
<seg id="6">Closed joint-stock company "Information Agency Rosbalt" was founded in Saint Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">In subsequent years the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also with the agency operate representative offices in countries of the former USSR.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since 2001 "Rosbalt" has developed and functioned as a federal informational-analytical agency.</seg>
<seg id="10">By the middle of the 2000's the agency was entered into the list of the most recognizable private Internet media resources in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, "Rosbalt" always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of exclusive publications of the agency composed (and compose to this day) news items with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="12">Conversations about the proximity of the publication to security structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="13">While "Rosbalt" possessed an extensive base of sources in various agencies, the fact that Natalya Chaplina - wife of Victor Cherkesov - stood at the head of the project also spoke in favor of such assumptions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, the role of Chaplina in the management of "Rosbalt" is not fully clear: most commonly they call her "project manager".</seg>
<seg id="15">The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, chief editor - Nikolai Ulyanov.</seg>
<seg id="16">Recently "Rosbalt" did not figure in the ratings of federal media resources - not by citation, not by audience.</seg>
<seg id="17">In October the agency occupied 25th place in the visibility rating of websites of Russian media based on the version of LiveInternet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Based on that same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the website rosbalt.ru amounts to approximately 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - approximately three million unique visitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the list of the most popular materials over the last five months - news items on the powerlessness of the Kremlin in relation to Ukraine, death of the soloist of the group "King and Fool", pogroms in the capital's Biryulevo.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conflict of "Rosbalt" with Roskomnadzor began in July of 2013 when amendments to the law on media prohibiting journalists from obscenities took effect.</seg>
<seg id="21">The agency discovered prohibited vocabulary in two video clips published on the website of the agency ("The horseman from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil derricks").</seg>
<seg id="22">What came next the parties describe differently.</seg>
<seg id="23">Based on the discovered video materials, Roskomnadzor accused "Rosbalt" of blatant and systematic violation of the law on media and took legal action demanding to take away the agency's license.</seg>
<seg id="24">At "Rosbalt" they declared that the claims of the agency were unjustified: firstly, the clips were not editorial materials, secondly, the obscenities in them were masked, and, thirdly, the clips were removed from the website immediately after the warning.</seg>
<seg id="25">Representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor in a magistrate court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow Municipal Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, examination of those complaints still continued.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, already on the 25th the magistrate judge reached a decision not in favor of "Rosbalt": chief editor Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each clip.</seg>
<seg id="27">Evidently this is what predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow Municipal Court - if we dismiss the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.</seg>
<seg id="28">On October 31 the court reached a decision to annul the certificate of registration of "Rosbalt", in effect depriving the agency of the status of a media outlet.</seg>
<seg id="29">It cannot be said that "Rosbalt" over the course of this confrontation was all alone.</seg>
<seg id="30">Deputies of the State Duma supported the agency (a declaration addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).</seg>
<seg id="31">The unlawfulness of closing the publication was declared by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential Council on Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with certain guarantees that the matter will not go as far as revocation of the license.</seg>
<seg id="33">The trial of "Rosbalt" demonstrated: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be for a media outlet in Russia today is a huge question.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wake up!</seg>
<seg id="2">In Bulgaria, students take the streets to "change [their] future"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Wake up!" chanted some 2,000 protesters rallying in front of Sofia University after students, who have been occupying part of the university since October 25, called for faculty and anti-government protesters to join their demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="4">Protesters marched in the streets of Sofia to the beat of drums, chanting "Resign!" and "Red trash!," blocking the traffic in downtown Sofia, AFP reports.</seg>
<seg id="5">The students" recent actions have had rejuvenating effects on the anti-government movement, fledging after 141 days.</seg>
<seg id="6">Boïtcho Pentchev, a literature professor, told AFP he hopes that "the student movement will give a new momentum to the protests happening since June."</seg>
<seg id="7">Near the end of the demonstration, some protesters tried to cordon the Parliament building with a human chain in an attempt to block MPs inside, local media reports.</seg>
<seg id="8">Riot police intervened, leading to clashes between anti-government protesters and police force.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Bulgarian Prime Minister Oresharski, main target of the protests since June, remained unfazed.</seg>
<seg id="10">He criticized the students" actions: "I expected a different kind of protest demands from the students - a professional one, about education, because education is not in excellent shape, while their demands are typical political ones,"</seg>
<seg id="11">November 1 is a highly symbolic day for students and professors to lead an anti-government rally.</seg>
<seg id="12">On that day, "Bulgaria celebrates its "national enlighteners" - a collective term for all the revolutionaries, clergy and educators that played a key role in the Bulgarian Revival period and the independence fight against the Ottoman Empire," explains the Sofia Globe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inside occupied universities; students organise their struggle</seg>
<seg id="14">Sofia University has been occupied since October 25, and classes cancelled since last Monday, with several other universities and colleges joining the movement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among them, the Bulgarian National Academy For Theatre and Film Arts, the New Bulgarian University, the University of National and World Economy, the Medical School and Plovdiv University, about 120km away from the capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">On social media, the hashtags #Occupy272, in reference to the lecture hall that was first occupied, and #OccupySU have joined the traditional #ДАНСwithme hashtag used by protesters for more than 4 months.</seg>
<seg id="17">Stanislav Kaschiyski, one of the students that occupy Sofia University, told euronews by e-mail that for him and his fellow occupiers, a typical day starts early.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We get up early, some of the students leave the building early in the morning, so the others have to keep control of the entrances and react to the media, which is very active from 7am to 9am because of the morning shows, " explains this last year journalism student .</seg>
<seg id="19">He would know.</seg>
<seg id="20">At 22, Stanislav works as an editor for the Saturday morning show on the national TV.</seg>
<seg id="21">"When that ends, we have to control the arrival of the administration staff (we allow them to come into the building) and of other students, that have chosen to sleep at home (some of us really need to do that occasionally)," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rest of the day is equally busy, according to Stanislav: "By 6pm a group of us goes outside the university and joins the ongoing #DANSwithMe protests."</seg>
<seg id="23">By 9pm - 10pm, we gather at the largest hall at the university 272 (the one we occupied at first) and discuss and vote for different things.</seg>
<seg id="24">A look inside occupied Sofia University</seg>
<seg id="25">Students have hopes that go beyond "the mass resignation of the current government" explains Nikolay Dyulgerov, an occupier of Sofia University and one of the student in charge of the leading Facebook page of the movement, with 20,000 likes and counting.</seg>
<seg id="26">A veteran of the anti-government protests since June, Nikolay hopes for a "long-term awakening of the Bulgarian society and mainly - student society."</seg>
<seg id="27">What he means it that, from "now on the society will be more active in withstanding its position regarding the decisions of the government and showing its discontent, instead of being resigned to the situation."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Basically, I hope this movement manages to kill a lot of the apathy that's surrounding us" he told euronews by e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="29">Fighting the apathy is a common theme among the students.</seg>
<seg id="30">Stanislav, the journalism student, explains that, from what he saw, "students there want to stay in Bulgaria."</seg>
<seg id="31">But to be here and keep your, let's say pride, is hard, so we are out to change our future.</seg>
<seg id="32">We are out to do something so we don't have to run away from our country, as our friends did.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also involved in the protests since this summer, Stanislav thinks the movement can topple the government.</seg>
<seg id="34">What our occupation has done is to show the people outside, who have lost hope, that things can change, that there is future and we should not fail.</seg>
<seg id="35">But he also hopes that "we'll build the foundations of a democratic society which has faith in itself."</seg>
<seg id="36">"If we fail I think we will have to wait another 15 years for new people to come that haven't been hammered with pessimism," he concludes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The main target of the students, Bulgarian Prime Minister Oresharski criticized the students" actions: "I expected a different kind of protest demands from the students - a professional one, about education, because education is not in excellent shape, while their demands are typical political ones," the PM told the media while on a visit in the town of Kotel.</seg>
<seg id="38">"There are many issues that have to solved within the next few years and we are aware of the fact that one year is not enough in order for them to be solved," he said before adding a jab to the student movement: "I agreed to participate in a debate with the students, but don't know what exactly happened so that the debate didn't took place."</seg>
<seg id="39">The protests were originally sparked by the controversial appointment of businessman and MP Delyan Peevski as the new head of the State Agency for National Security in June this year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Public anger eventually led to his removal but the demonstrations have continued, albeit less intensely, and are now calling for the Socialist-led government to resign.</seg>

<seg id="6">The US is relaxing its rules to allow air passengers to listen to music, play video games and watch films on their phones and tablets during takeoffs and landings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The change allowing the use of electronic devices from gate-to-gate will not, however, extend to making mobile phone calls during flights.</seg>
<seg id="8">Connections to the internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will also still be banned below 10,000 feet and heavier devices like laptops will have to be stowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">In flight: The US is relaxing its rules to allow air passengers to listen to music, play video games and watch films on their phones and tablets during takeoffs and landings</seg>
<seg id="10">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">The US Federal Aviation Authority confirmed the move last night, although it will be up to individual airlines to decide how soon to meet the new criteria.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change will mean that on transatlantic flights British passengers will be able to use their gadgets as they land on American soil.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, when they take off from Britain they will not be able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="14">Under rules drawn up by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, electronic devices cannot be used during taxi, takeoff and landing on all fights entering or leaving British airspace.</seg>
<seg id="15">Safety: Connections to the internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will also still be banned below 10,000 feet</seg>
<seg id="16">However the rules could also change in Britain and across the world if the American research is shown to be credible.</seg>
<seg id="17">An American travel industry group welcomed the changes yesterday, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>
<seg id="19">Air safety officials backed the changes after agreeing that the electronic gadgets do not interfere with navigation systems and that data used to draw up the ban - typically imposed in aircraft across the world - was from back in the 1960s when such devices were very different.</seg>
<seg id="20">Phones are excluded in the rule change because they were not involved in the FAA research, although safety officials are now expected to look at this issue separately.</seg>
<seg id="21">The original rules in the US were written in 1966 when it was thought that electromagnetic interference from computers and other devices could cause problems with navigation systems on board the plane.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nowadays passenger jets are "much more tolerant" to such interference and the gadgets themselves are much safer.</seg>
<seg id="23">The report says that this is because they use less power, transmit weaker signals and "stay within a tighter range of frequencies."</seg>
<seg id="24">One key factor behind the US decision has been the sheer number of air passengers ignoring the rules.</seg>
<seg id="25">One survey found that, by accident or on purpose, one third of passengers had left their gadgets on when they should be turned off.</seg>
<seg id="26">The CAA in the UK is said to be "monitoring" the situation.</seg>

<seg id="2">By Mike McCarthy, North of England Correspondent</seg>
<seg id="3">A car salvage company has been fined £40,000 plus £25,000 costs after a mechanic was engulfed in flames underneath a van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lee Roberts, 33, was working in a vehicle inspection pit in Chorley, Lancashire, when he was set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">CCTV of the incident at Douglas Valley Breakers Ltd was played to a judge at Preston Crown Court.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company was prosecuted after a joint investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service discovered multiple health and safety failings.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Roberts said in a statement released by the HSE: "I still remember the noise of the petrol fumes igniting and a wave of blue flames engulfing the pit."</seg>
<seg id="8">""They put me into an induced coma to stop the pain and it was at least a couple of days later when I came round.</seg>
<seg id="9">When I woke up, I could feel the pain immediately.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even now, more than three years later, I still suffer flashbacks that cause me to wake in the middle of the night in a cold sweat.</seg>
<seg id="11">The court heard that workers at the salvage firm used electric drills to puncture fuel tanks and an extension lead in the pit may have caused ignition.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company had no fire alarms or detectors and the fire became so bad that the building was eventually condemned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lancashire Fire and Rescue treated the blaze as a major incident.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the sentencing, HSE Inspector David Myrtle said Mr Roberts was lucky to be alive.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "The company had the right equipment to do the job properly but instead it allowed workers to stand in a pit surrounded by fuel vapours where just one spark could start a fire."</seg>
<seg id="16">Douglas Valley Breakers - which pleaded guilty to five charges of breaching safety regulation - said it has taken steps to make sure a similar incident doesn't happen in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1">How the countryside could lose David Cameron the 2015 general election</seg>
<seg id="2">If all this is true it represents, as others have noted, not so much a threat to the Tories" hold on their heartlands - the kind of seat where the Conservative Party could put up a fox as its candidate and still win handsomely - as to their chances in more marginal seats.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's because it's claimed (who can tell if it's true?) that in 2010 between 12- and 15,000 CA supporters took part in a campaign organised by Vote-OK, to help Tory candidates unseat vulnerable Labour (and Lib-Dem) MPs, on the assumption that, once safely (or, in some cases, precariously) installed at Westminster, they would then obediently vote to let the hunting dogs out.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, Vote-OK's impact may have been greater in 2010, although, as in 2005, we'd also have to consider those voters actively put off voting Tory by a knock on the door from the green welly brigade.</seg>
<seg id="5">Certainly, it's hard to believe that the thousands of pounds worth of DVDs that they delivered (you can see the invoices here) will have persuaded many people to change their mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">That said, we shouldn't dismiss all this out of hand as a classic bit of push-polling that garners its instigators a nice bit of publicity for their particular issues - for two reasons.</seg>
<seg id="7">First, it is one of those straws in the wind - yet another illustration of the disillusionment felt by self-styled traditional Tories with a leadership made up of, in their view anyway, metropolitan, even metrosexual liberals.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's a sentiment which may bite the party on the proverbial at the European elections, a time when voters are either too apathetic to care or else much less shy about giving their regular choice a bit of a kicking.</seg>
<seg id="9">Second, it's a reminder that boots - even Wellington boots - may well count more than ever at the next general election.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both main parties are furiously trying to copy the sophisticated voter-identification techniques pioneered by the Republicans and particularly the Democrats during the last US Presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But that game is a game of two halves.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's one thing to find out, in minute detail, who is most likely to vote for you.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's another to have enough people to do the phoning, facebooking, and knocking on doors required to actually get them down to the polling station to put their cross in the right box.</seg>
<seg id="14">Labour's relationship with the unions may be a little rocky right now, but it will almost certainly remain good enough to ensure that, with the additional assistance provided by its slightly bigger (and probably younger) membership, it will perform as well in the second half as the first half of that game.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if the economy is going gangbusters by the spring of 2015, winning an overall majority at the next election is going to be, as they say nowadays, a big ask for the Tories.</seg>
<seg id="16">That means they're going to need all the help that they can get.</seg>
<seg id="17">Losing a little support in the shires might seem worth it as long as what loses Mr Cameron that support helps him gain it across the nation as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="18">And more building, lower spending, and foregoing the chance to kill more foxes probably all fall into that category.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it might not be as simple as all that.</seg>
<seg id="20">And anyway, as countryside Conservatives, especially if they're church-goers too, might well remind the Prime Minister, "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"</seg>

<seg id="2">SMSF trustees have been accused of causing a housing price bubble.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Sam Mooy Source: TheAustralian</seg>
<seg id="4">THE one million-plus Australians who invest via a self-managed super fund may have been getting concerned recently that their desire to take control of their retirement savings plans had made them financial saboteurs.</seg>
<seg id="5">SMSF trustees have been accused of pumping up a residential property price bubble or exploiting tax loopholes to gain an unfair advantage - or both.</seg>
<seg id="6">But they are not going to bring the Australian financial system to its knees any time soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Indeed, the Reserve Bank's Financial Stability Report in September noted for the first time that SMSFs are a significant segment of our financial system and an important barometer of household financial health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Oddly, there is a tendency to demonise the role of SMSFs within the broader super industry, the same industry that bemoans the lack of engagement by members with their superannuation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The residential property market in Australia is more than $4 trillion in size.</seg>
<seg id="10">At June 30, according to tax office data, SMSF property investments were worth $76 billion, of which $58 billion was commercial property.</seg>
<seg id="11">Residential property investment within the SMSFs is a much more modest $17.5 billion, which makes it hard to reconcile how it could move market values, given the size of the overall market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The bubble speculation also ignores the basic fact that SMSFs are simply the vehicle individuals invest through.</seg>
<seg id="13">The same people could just as easily negatively gear to buy a property outside the super system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Reserve Bank is responsible for our financial system's stability, so it is entirely reasonable that it raises awareness where it sees the potential for risks to emerge.</seg>
<seg id="15">The RBA was clear that "this sector does not currently pose material risks to financial stability," but its concern comes from SMSFs being "a new source of demand that could possibly exacerbate property price cycles."</seg>
<seg id="16">What keeps a central banker awake at night is seeing household debt increasing faster than incomes, particularly where banks may be relaxing lending standards in order to gain or maintain market share.</seg>
<seg id="17">SMSFs can certainly help inform the RBA about the level of savings and/or financial stress within a major segment of Australian households.</seg>
<seg id="18">The red flag that the RBA raised was the increasing opportunity for - and promotion of - gearing within SMSFs to buy property.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a relatively new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clearly the banking sector has responded to the perceived demand from SMSFs buying property both by developing new product offers and by increasing promotion of their offers.</seg>
<seg id="21">The latest Vanguard/Investment Trends survey of SMSF investors in April showed that less than 6 per cent were using borrowed funds to invest in residential property, while about 30 per cent of people intending to set up an SMSF wanted to invest in property.</seg>
<seg id="22">The issue here is not so much that SMSFs may be buying property but rather the advice, or lack of it, that they are getting when making that decision.</seg>
<seg id="23">The figures do not support the notion that SMSFs are rushing headlong into residential property.</seg>
<seg id="24">Indeed, 83 per cent of respondents said their next investment was destined to be shares.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Google SMSF and property and you will find pages of material clamouring to tempt SMSF investors to buy property.</seg>
<seg id="26">The simple fact for people considering setting up an SMSF is that if you are doing it just to buy a residential property, there are many simpler ways to do that.</seg>
<seg id="27">If the public swirl around SMSF investment trends prompts investors to review and question their SMSF's portfolio, that is a good outcome.</seg>
<seg id="28">But where the public swirl has raised concerns or caused anxiety, the best antidote is to seek advice from a licensed adviser with specialist training and qualifications in the SMSF world.</seg>

<seg id="1">RBS: the good, the bad and the ugly</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr Market has spoken.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland is 8 per cent less attractive to investors after its long awaited strategic review than it was before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Given that the headline measure - an internal bad bank - is far less radical than some of the alternatives that were on offer, this is perhaps a surprising response.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the good bank/bad bank shuffle leaves investors with a clear and attractive investment proposition, then it might be worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="6">But RBS is neither.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several parts of the announcement are troubling.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first is in the detail of the internal bad bank.</seg>
<seg id="9">At £39bn it is broadly the same size as the existing non-core division.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the two are not identical.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some assets that were previously seen as core will now be in the bad bank.</seg>
<seg id="12">And £12bn of assets that were previously non-core will now be in the good bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">A bank that endlessly shuffles assets between baskets confuses matters more than it clarifies them.</seg>
<seg id="14">And the accelerated run down of the bad bank will leave shareholders nursing a £4.5bn impairment charge in the fourth quarter of this year.</seg>
<seg id="15">Lex</seg>
<seg id="16">Another part of the rejig involves an accelerated disposal of Citizens, its US business.</seg>
<seg id="17">An IPO is pencilled in for next year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The disposal will help on the capital front but will hurt earnings - the US accounted for just over a tenth of group profits in the first nine months of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to analysts at Deutsche Bank, stripping out the US contribution increases RBS's valuation from 11 times 2014 core earnings to more than 13 times.</seg>
<seg id="20">Still, it may have had little choice in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="21">RBS needs more capital and the UK government, which owns 82 per cent of the bank, is hardly in the mood to stump up for an equity issue.</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, chancellor George Osborne is more interested in small business lending where he is keen for the bank to make a big splash.</seg>
<seg id="23">That would be helpful to his political aims as the UK heads towards an election.</seg>
<seg id="24">But if it leads to unprofitable lending it is not so good for investors and, by extension, for the government's chances of selling its shares.</seg>
<seg id="25">More detail on small business lending will come in February, when investors will be treated to yet another strategy announcement.</seg>
<seg id="26">On top of all that, the bank released underwhelming third quarter numbers.</seg>
<seg id="27">They missed analysts" forecasts and there was another £250m charge for insurance mis-selling.</seg>
<seg id="28">Add all that together and Mr Market's assessment looks far from harsh.</seg>

<seg id="1">After Fraud, the Fog Around Libor Hasn't Lifted</seg>
<seg id="2">Michael Kooren/Reuters</seg>
<seg id="3">The authorities said fraud was carried out by more than two dozen traders and managers at Rabobank offices around the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Libor market, we now know, was a fraud.</seg>
<seg id="5">There were few - if any - real trades backing the indicator.</seg>
<seg id="6">This week the scandal claimed its second top European banker and treated us to more of those delightful emails and electronic chats in which traders discuss their deceptions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Don't worry mate - there's bigger crooks in the market than us guys!" wrote an official of Rabobank, the large Dutch lender, after he agreed to a request from one of the bank's traders in 2007 to submit a phony rate for Libor rates in yen.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was right about that.</seg>
<seg id="9">As more cases are disclosed, there will no doubt be more big fines and more assurances from senior executives that they had no idea what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even without fraud, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said this week in a speech at Harvard, Libor rates "are basically more akin to fiction than fact."</seg>
<seg id="11">Unfortunately, nothing fundamental is being changed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Libor lives on.</seg>
<seg id="13">Regulators who wanted to change that, most notably Mr. Gensler, have been outmaneuvered by those who did not want to risk damaging one of the biggest and most lucrative markets around.</seg>
<seg id="14">This week's penitent financial institution, Rabobank, showed just how international a fraud this was.</seg>
<seg id="15">The bank settled with authorities in the Netherlands, Britain, Japan and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="16">The authorities said the fraud was carried out by more than two dozen traders and managers at the bank's offices in London, New York, Utrecht, Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="17">The bank's chairman resigned.</seg>
<seg id="18">When the Libor scandal exploded last year, with Barclays as the initial villain, there was a narrative that made the violations seem understandable and perhaps provoked at least a little sympathy for the banks.</seg>
<seg id="19">They had lied about their borrowing costs during the financial crisis, concealing how difficult a time they were having.</seg>
<seg id="20">Perhaps they should not have done so, but who was really harmed?</seg>
<seg id="21">It turns out that the financial crisis did not cause the fraud; it merely made it so obvious that regulators finally noticed.</seg>
<seg id="22">It had been going on for years, aided by an international culture that treated market manipulation as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="23">If a bank did not have its own good reason for manipulating the market, then a trader would agree to do so as a favor for a trader at another institution.</seg>
<seg id="24">Why not?</seg>
<seg id="25">Maybe he would need a favor on another day.</seg>
<seg id="26">"You know, scratch my back, yeah, and all," a Rabobank trader said after he agreed to a request from a "geezer at UBS" to submit a figure as low as possible.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Yeah, oh definitely, yeah, play the rules," replied the broker who had relayed the request.</seg>
<seg id="28">The complaint filed by the C.F.T.C., which included the exchange, helpfully explained that the "geezer" was a senior yen trader at the Swiss bank.</seg>
<seg id="29">It did not give his age.</seg>
<seg id="30">Libor - the London interbank offered rate - is supposed to represent the costs that each bank would face if it received an unsecured deposit from another bank.</seg>
<seg id="31">Each day, banks report Libor rates for maturities ranging from overnight to 12 months, in numerous currencies.</seg>
<seg id="32">The announced Libor rates are based on averages of bank submissions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In Europe, there is a similar Euribor.</seg>
<seg id="34">Banks cheated on both.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the U.S.," Mr. Gensler said in his speech, "Libor is the reference rate for 70 percent of the futures market and more than half of the swaps market."</seg>
<seg id="36">It is the reference rate for more than $10 trillion in loans.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such a huge market created ample incentives to cheat.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometimes traders wanted to influence the rate so that their derivatives positions would benefit.</seg>
<seg id="39">Other times banks knew that a lot of loans they had made had interest rates that would reset on a certain day, based on a particular Libor rate.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then they wanted to push that rate up, if only for one day.</seg>
<seg id="41">At Rabobank, the people who submitted the Libor number each day were not even trained to determine what the real market rate was.</seg>
<seg id="42">If there was no request from someone at the bank to push rates up or down, the submitters were told to just repeat the previous day's number.</seg>
<seg id="43">All of this makes it appear as though Rabobank got off easy, even though it will pay more than $1 billion to settle with all the prosecutors and regulators.</seg>

<seg id="1">US court upholds Texas abortion law</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 15:33</seg>
<seg id="3">A third of Texas abortion clinics can no longer provide the procedure after a federal court allowed new restrictions to take effect in the state.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Republican-led state legislature passed a law in July requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among other restrictions, it limits the use of abortion-inducing drugs.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Thursday appeals court ruling reversed a lower court decision that the restrictions were unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Monday, Federal District Judge Lee Yeakel ruled that the new requirement for doctors performing abortions to have patient-admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles (48km) unconstitutionally restricted women's access to abortion.</seg>
<seg id="8">He barred the state of Texas from enforcing the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott then filed an emergency appeal against Mr Yeakel's decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">And on Thursday, a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed it, ruling the Texas law could take effect on Friday while an appeal is argued in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Abbott, a Republican, is expected to run for governor of Texas against Democratic State Senator Wendy Davis, who has been an outspoken opponent of the new abortion restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="12">The legislation also bans abortions at the 20th week of pregnancy and requires doctors to perform abortions at special surgical facilities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Far from over</seg>
<seg id="14">This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights</seg>
<seg id="15">End Quote Cecile Richards Planned Parenthood foundation president</seg>
<seg id="16">After the law passed in July, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers in the state sued, arguing the law would force many to close.</seg>
<seg id="17">In his ruling on Monday, Mr Yeakel found the admitting privileges provision "places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable foetus and is thus an undue burden to her."</seg>
<seg id="18">In overturning his decision, the court of appeals found the state had provided "a rational basis" for the physician hospital privilege requirement, including offering evidence it "fosters a woman's ability to seek consultation and treatment for complications directly from her physician, not from an emergency room provider."</seg>
<seg id="19">"This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women," Mr Abbott said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Women's health advocates have argued the law will require women in some areas to travel several hours on two days to obtain abortions.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion state-wide," Planned Parenthood Foundation President Cecile Richards said.</seg>
<seg id="22">This fight is far from over.</seg>

<seg id="1">IRS eases rules on healthcare flexible spending accounts</seg>
<seg id="2">Workers faced with forfeiting unused money in their flexible spending accounts for healthcare expenses may be getting some relief under a new federal rule.</seg>
<seg id="3">The U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service changed the use-it-or-lose-it rule for flexible spending arrangements, or FSAs, to allow account holders to carry over as much as $500 from one year to the next without penalty.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many workers have been reluctant to put money into the plans for fear of losing whatever they don't use, resulting in long-standing complaints about how the pretax FSAs work.</seg>
<seg id="5">Typically, they must estimate before the year starts how much they might spend on healthcare, and employers regularly deduct money from their paychecks before taxes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Any amount left over at the end of the year would go back to the employers.</seg>
<seg id="7">With less risk of such forfeitures now, experts predicted that more workers, particularly lower- and moderate-income employees, would take advantage of the deductions for everyday medical expenses, such as co-pays, over-the-counter drugs and other items not normally covered by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are always looking for ways to provide added flexibility and common-sense solutions to how people pay for their healthcare," Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Treasury officials began taking public comments on the change last year, and they said the response was overwhelmingly in favor of giving workers more leeway.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new rules go into effect immediately, but they aren't mandatory for employers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Firms can decide whether to make the change and when to make it.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a recent survey of large employers, 86% offered FSAs for healthcare expenses, but only 23% of workers participated, according to Mercer, a benefits consulting firm.</seg>
<seg id="13">In all, federal officials estimated that 14 million American families use the spending accounts.</seg>
<seg id="14">Federal officials said employers could take advantage of this new rule as soon as this year.</seg>
<seg id="15">But benefits consultants said it will be difficult for most employers to make the switch that fast with open enrollment season already underway at most companies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Starting Jan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"1, 2015, I think there will be greater uptake simply because of the timing," said Laura Baker, a principal at Mercer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because the funds are deducted from paychecks on a pretax basis, less of a worker's earnings are subject to tax.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average worker contribution was $1,484 last year, according to Mercer's survey of large employers.</seg>
<seg id="20">The percentage of overall dollars forfeited was 4%.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treasury officials said they didn't have figures on how much is lost annually, but they said the new rule could eliminate most forfeitures, which are often below $500 in value.</seg>
<seg id="22">One benefits administrator, Alegeus Technologies in Waltham, Mass., estimated that 1 in 4 flex-spending participants suffers a forfeiture each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Treasury Department has eliminated the most significant barrier to FSA participation, namely consumers' fear of losing their money," said Bob Natt, executive chairman of Alegeus.</seg>
<seg id="24">This will certainly lead to growth in FSA adoption.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employers are not allowed to return the money to individual employees.</seg>
<seg id="26">Health experts said most use it to offset the cost of administering employee benefit programs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The rule change also could reduce the incentive by workers for unnecessary spending at year-end to avoid losing the money set aside.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some employers offer a grace period to workers, allowing them to use prior-year balances until March 15 of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="29">Treasury officials said employers would have to pick between a grace period or the rollover option because they won't be allowed to do both.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) praised the new flexibility from the Obama administration.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Allowing Americans who have one of these accounts to roll $500 over to the following year just makes sense," Hatch said.</seg>

<seg id="1">As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough.</seg>
<seg id="2">But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="5">Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great double act."</seg>
<seg id="10">They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.</seg>
<seg id="12">Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="13">The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mrs Howells said: "The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping."</seg>
<seg id="15">He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after.</seg>
<seg id="17">The way he has started he'll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I'm sure he'll do well.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony."</seg>
<seg id="19">They are a great team together.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring.</seg>
<seg id="21">They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm sure Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part.</seg>

<seg id="10">Where the 1981 Burt Reynolds classic was a comedic twist on a race inspired by real-life rebellion over the mandated 55-mph speed limits of the 1970s, Bolian set out on a serious mission to beat the record for driving from New York to Los Angeles.</seg>
<seg id="11">The mark?</seg>
<seg id="12">Alex Roy and David Maher's cross-country record of 31 hours and 4 minutes, which they set in a modified BMW M5 in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bolian, a 28-year-old Atlanta native, had long dreamed of racing from East Coast to West.</seg>
<seg id="14">A decade ago, for a high school assignment, Bolian interviewed Brock Yates, who conceived the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, aka the Cannonball Run.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yates, who played the previously quoted organizer in the film he wrote himself, won the first Cannonball in the early 1970s with a time of 35 hours and 53 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I told him, 'One day I'd like to beat your record,' " Bolian recalled.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ounce of prevention</seg>
<seg id="18">It sounds like great outlaw fun -- and certainly, Hollywood added its embellishments, like the supremely confident, infidel-cursing sheik with a Rolls Royce and Sammy Davis Jr. in a priest getup -- but Bolian said it took 18 months of research and groundwork.</seg>
<seg id="19">Beginning in 2009, about the time he started working for Lamborghini Atlanta, Bolian researched cars, routes, moon phases, traffic patterns, equipment, gas mileage and modifications.</seg>
<seg id="20">He went into preparation mode about 18 months ago and chose a Mercedes CL55 AMG with 115,000 miles for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Benz's gas tank was only 23 gallons, so he added two 22-gallon tanks in the trunk, upping his range to about 800 miles.</seg>
<seg id="22">The spare tire had to go in the backseat with his spotter, Dan Huang, a student at Georgia Tech, Bolian's alma mater.</seg>
<seg id="23">To foil the police, he installed a switch to kill the rear lights and bought two laser jammers and three radar detectors.</seg>
<seg id="24">He commissioned a radar jammer, but it wasn't finished in time for the trek.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was also a police scanner, two GPS units and various chargers for smartphones and tablets -- not to mention snacks, iced coffee and a bedpan.</seg>
<seg id="26">By the time he tricked out the Benz, which included a $9,000 tuneup, "it was a real space station of a thing," he said, describing the lights and screens strewn through the car's cockpit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet he still wasn't done.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The hardest thing, quite honestly, was finding people crazy enough to do it with me," he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Co-driver Dave Black, one of the Atlanta Lamborghini dealership's customers, didn't sign on until three days before they left, and "support passenger" Huang didn't get involved until about 18 hours before the team left Atlanta for Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="30">If his difficulty finding a copilot wasn't an omen, Manhattan would deliver one.</seg>
<seg id="31">While scouting routes out of the city, a GPS unit told Bolian to take a right on red, in the wrong direction down a one-way road.</seg>
<seg id="32">He was quickly pulled over.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bolian got a warning -- and a healthy dose of relief that the officer didn't question the thick odor of fuel as he stood over the vents pumping fumes from the trunk.</seg>
<seg id="34">Record run begins</seg>
<seg id="35">The trio ignored what some might have considered a harbinger and the left the Red Ball Garage on East 31st Street, the starting point for Yates' Cannonball, a few hours later.</seg>
<seg id="36">To be exact, they left October 19 at 9:55 p.m., according to a tracking company whose officials asked not be identified because they were unaware that Bolian would be driving so illegally when he hired them.</seg>
<seg id="37">It really isn't something we need a whole band of lunatics doing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Ed Bolian</seg>
<seg id="39">They hit a patch of traffic in New York that held them up for 15 minutes but soon had an average speed of about 90 mph.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Pennsylvania, they tapped the first of many scouts, one of Bolian's acquaintances who drove the speed limit 150 to 200 miles ahead of the CL55 and warned them of any police, construction or other problems.</seg>
<seg id="41">They blew through Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, hitting St. Louis before dawn.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Everything possible went perfect," Bolian said, explaining they never got lost and rarely encountered traffic or construction delays.</seg>
<seg id="43">By the time they hit southern Missouri, near the Oklahoma border, they learned they were "on track to break the existing record if they averaged the speed limit for the rest of the trip," he said.</seg>
<seg id="44">Yeah, right.</seg>
<seg id="45">This wasn't about doing speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="46">They kept humming west, and as they neared the Texas-New Mexico border, they calculated they might beat the 30-hour mark, a sort of Holy Grail in transcontinental racing that Bolian likened to the 4-minute mile.</seg>
<seg id="47">Never one to settle, "we decided to break 29," Bolian said.</seg>
<seg id="48">The unnamed tracking company says the Benz pulled into the Portofino Hotel and Marina in Redondo Beach, California, at 11:46 p.m. on October 20 after driving 2,803 miles.</seg>
<seg id="49">The total time: 28 hours, 50 minutes and about 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Most of the time, we weren't going insanely fast," Bolian said, not realizing his definition of "insanely" is a little different from most folks'.</seg>
<seg id="51">When they were moving, which, impressively, was all but 46 minutes of the trip, they were averaging around 100 mph.</seg>
<seg id="52">Their total average was 98 mph, and their top speed was 158 mph, according to an onboard tracking device.</seg>
<seg id="53">"Apart from a FedEx truck not checking his mirrors before he tried to merge on top of me, we didn't really have any issues," Bolian said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do not try this at home</seg>
<seg id="55">He concedes his endeavor was a dangerous one, especially when you consider Bolian slept only 40 minutes of the trip, and co-driver Black slept an hour.</seg>
<seg id="56">But Bolian went out of his way to make it as safe as possible, choosing a weekend day with clear weather and a full moon -- and routes, when possible, with little traffic or construction.</seg>
<seg id="57">"I had plenty of people at home praying I'd make it safely, and, more importantly, had my wife praying that I wouldn't have to do it again," he said, adding he has no children, which was also a factor.</seg>
<seg id="58">That was one of the spurs to go ahead and get this over with.</seg>
<seg id="59">That's probably the next adventure.</seg>
<seg id="60">Asked if the technological advances since the previous record holders made their run gave him an advantage, Bolian replied, "Absolutely."</seg>
<seg id="61">Because two teams broke the 32-hour mark in 2006 and 2007, he had a detailed "guide book" on how to do it, where they had to rely on word-of-mouth tales from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="62">I thank Alex for that.</seg>
<seg id="63">"We're all adding chapters to the same story of American car culture," Bolian said.</seg>
<seg id="64">Alex Roy did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="65">Bolian had hoped to revisit that high school interview and tell Yates he'd followed through on that promise to break his record, but Yates now suffers from Alzheimer's.</seg>
<seg id="66">"I'll pay him a visit just for the sake of it," Bolian said, "but I can't tell him."</seg>
<seg id="67">Where the Cannonball scofflaws aimed to make a statement about personal freedom, Bolian said he has the utmost respect for law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="68">His goal was merely to "add myself and pay tribute to this chapter of automotive history," he said.</seg>
<seg id="69">Bolian also hopes that he shattered Roy's record by such a stark margin that it discourages would-be Cannonballers from attempting to break his record, and it's not just a matter of his own legacy, he said.</seg>
<seg id="70">"It really isn't something we need a whole band of lunatics doing," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says</seg>
<seg id="2">Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country's north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.</seg>
<seg id="21">A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."</seg>
<seg id="22">It added that, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."</seg>
<seg id="23">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I salute the fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," the watchdog's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="31">The cause of the blast was not known, he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tipping Points - NYTimes.com</seg>
<seg id="2">I recently moved to the mecca of small coffee shops.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many have tip jars on the counter.</seg>
<seg id="4">When I receive my change, I usually drop the coins into the jar.</seg>
<seg id="5">I figure this is better than no tip at all, and I don't like carrying lots of change.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it occurs to me that this may come across as cheap and insulting.</seg>
<seg id="7">If I were a barista, I might not want a customer's dimes and pennies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should I tip?</seg>
<seg id="9">And if so, only with dollar bills?</seg>
<seg id="10">Zoe, Manhattan</seg>
<seg id="11">Whatever you do, do not investigate this question on the Internet or listen to more than three versions (in a row) of "Pennies From Heaven," which has been sung by everyone from Billie Holiday to Regis Philbin.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's an hour of your life you will never get back, and the song will make you want to slap someone.</seg>
<seg id="13">People have lots to say about tip jars.</seg>
<seg id="14">Let me synthesize: Baristas are typically paid minimum wage, unlike waiters in restaurants (who are often paid less because of the tips we leave them).</seg>
<seg id="15">Many people take this as a strong argument against tip jars.</seg>
<seg id="16">But I suspect these same folks have never tried to subsist on minimum wage or worked gigs where less than full-time employment is the norm.</seg>
<seg id="17">Tipping lives at the crossroads of social custom and personal choice.</seg>
<seg id="18">Traditionally, we don't leave tips on over-the-counter transactions.</seg>
<seg id="19">But this is changing, because of the more personalized services being offered (marked by such words as "skinny" and "no-foam") and the harsh realities of our economy.</seg>
<seg id="20">I prefer to err on the side of generosity - by which I do not mean three pennies of change on your $2.97 latte.</seg>
<seg id="21">Toss the pennies into the jar and dig up another quarter (or two).</seg>
<seg id="22">Heck, make it a crisp dollar bill, if you can swing it and feel like it.</seg>
<seg id="23">If everyone added a few dimes, a worker's wages might grow by a few bucks over her shift.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you want to limit your tip to the change you receive (or skip the tip), that's your choice, too.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just don't claim the exorbitant cost of your caffeinated confection as an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="26">The people serving you do not take a cut of the revenue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yes, Thanks, I'm Tall</seg>
<seg id="28">My 9-year-old son is tall for his age.</seg>
<seg id="29">When adults learn how old he is, they often say: "Wow!"</seg>
<seg id="30">You're tall.</seg>
<seg id="31">Although this seems like a compliment, it is awkward to reply: "Thank you."</seg>
<seg id="32">So my son mumbles agreement.</seg>
<seg id="33">We'd like to find a polite reply for him.</seg>
<seg id="34">And why is it O.K. to comment on height, but not other physical characteristics?</seg>
<seg id="35">Beth, Darien, CT</seg>
<seg id="36">Ninety percent of what (irrelevant) adults say to children is idiotic, and most of it involves their size: "You've grown a foot since last month!" and "What a big girl you are!"</seg>
<seg id="37">I don't know how they bear it.</seg>
<seg id="38">Arm your son with a pat response: "Yes, I'm the second tallest boy in my class."</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, you are correct: It is a bad idea to comment on people's physical characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="40">But when it comes to males and height, something in our pioneer stock (or Darwinian natural selection) makes tallness a reliably good trait.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another independence scare story.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, a non-story, then.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the "independence means passport controls" canard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.</seg>
<seg id="31">Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where does this leave Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">No bond for Tennessee man accused of killing ex-wife in Germantown; had cash, hair dye</seg>
<seg id="2">The 62-year-old statistician with a PhD is charged with the Oct.</seg>
<seg id="3">12 killing of his ex-wife, Preeta Paul Gabba, 49.</seg>
<seg id="4">Also charged is Taneja's current wife, Raminder Kaur, 63.</seg>
<seg id="5">Court records made public Thursday indicate detectives believe that Kaur fired the fatal shot.</seg>
<seg id="6">At issue Thursday were bond review hearings for the couple and whether they should be allowed to leave the county jail before their trials.</seg>
<seg id="7">District Judge John C. Moffett, citing the allegations against Taneja and the possible flight risk, ordered him to remain held on no-bond status.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge delayed reviewing Kaur's bond because a Hindi interpreter was not available.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thursday's hearing shed more details on a case that involves a messy divorce, cellphone records and recently purchased hollow-point bullets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Taneja and Gabba married in 2002 in India.</seg>
<seg id="11">They came to the United States and in 2010 separated, according to court papers in their divorce case.</seg>
<seg id="12">Taneja and Gabba each claimed that the other was abusive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Taneja said that Gabba was trying to control him and his business associates, while Gabba said that Taneja physically abused her, according to the records.</seg>
<seg id="14">Elements of the dispute included control over an Amway business in India.</seg>
<seg id="15">Taneja then married Kaur, and they recently moved to Nashville.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Sept.</seg>
<seg id="17">28, according to Montgomery police, the couple walked into Specialty Arms, a shop in Nashville, and bought a Ruger LCR revolver, a Ruger GP100 revolver and rounds of .38-caliber hollow-point bullets, which are designed to expand after hitting their target.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a telephone interview Thursday, John Arnold, the owner of Specialty Arms, recalled speaking to the couple.</seg>
<seg id="19">All conversation centered on personal protection.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They made a purchase and did a background check and cleared the background check," Arnold said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Basically, it was a cut-and-dry, everyday transaction.</seg>

<seg id="23">11, according to Taneja's cellphone records, he was on the move, driving through Virginia and into Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="24">Detectives also alleged that Taneja checked into the Red Roof Inn in Rockville that night.</seg>
<seg id="25">A clerk there told detectives that he did so with an Indian American female.</seg>
<seg id="26">The next morning, Gabba was hit by at least one bullet while crossing a street outside her apartment.</seg>
<seg id="27">A witness allegedly told others at the scene that Gabba had been shot by a woman, according to police.</seg>
<seg id="28">After using cellphone records, looking at gun-purchase history and speaking with at least one family member, detectives quickly closed in on Taneja and Kaur.</seg>
<seg id="29">When Taneja and Kaur were arrested in Nashville, officers found two handguns, the wig, the hair dye and the cash, according to Ayres.</seg>
<seg id="30">Police said a bullet found at the scene matched the firing characteristics of a Ruger LCR, one of the models the couple had bought at the gun shop.</seg>
<seg id="31">In court, Taneja's attorney, Rene Sandler, painted a picture of a man who had neither been in trouble nor connected to violence.</seg>
<seg id="32">He had held jobs at the Hospital Corporation of America and, before that, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Sand­ler said.</seg>
<seg id="33">She also questioned parts of the case against Taneja, among them the notion that he was upset over the divorce.</seg>
<seg id="34">In an interview after the hearing, Sand­ler noted that her client had paid more than 21/ 2 years" worth of monthly $2,284 alimony payments - and had to do that only for three years.</seg>
<seg id="35">"He was within three months of completing them," Sandler said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Private companies possessing their own computerized motordrome will be able to hold exams for drivers' licenses.</seg>

<seg id="2">Northrop Grumman Corporation logo.</seg>
<seg id="3">PRNewsFoto/Northrop Grumman Corporation</seg>
<seg id="4">31, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) and the U.S. Navy successfully completed the first flight of the next-generation MQ-8C Fire Scout unmanned helicopter at Naval Base Ventura County, Point Mugu, Calif.</seg>
<seg id="5">Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20121024/LA98563LOGO</seg>
<seg id="6">Photos accompanying this release can be found here: http://media.globenewswire.com/noc/mediagallery.html?pkgid=21956</seg>
<seg id="7">At 12:05 p.m. the MQ-8C Fire Scout took off and flew for seven minutes in restricted airspace to validate the autonomous control systems.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second flight that took off at 2:39 p.m. for nine minutes was also flown in a pattern around the airfield, reaching 500 feet altitude.</seg>
<seg id="9">The aircraft was operated by a ground-based Navy/Northrop Grumman flight test team also located at Naval Base Ventura County.</seg>
<seg id="10">"First flight is a critical step in maturing the MQ-8C Fire Scout endurance upgrade before using the system operationally next year," said Capt. Patrick Smith, Fire Scout program manager, Naval Air Systems Command.</seg>
<seg id="11">The systems we've developed to allow Fire Scout to operate from an air-capable ship have already amassed more than 10,000 flight hours with the MQ-8B variant.</seg>
<seg id="12">This system's evolution enhances how unmanned air systems will support maritime commanders.</seg>
<seg id="13">The MQ-8C Fire Scout is designed to fly twice as long and has three times the payload capacity of the current MQ-8B variant.</seg>
<seg id="14">Based on a larger commercial airframe with additional fuel tanks and an upgraded engine, the MQ-8C will be able to fly up to 12 hours or carry up to 2,600 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">Operating the MQ-8B Fire Scout from Navy ships has proved extremely successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"During at-sea deployments, operators saw the need for a system that carried the same intelligence-gathering capabilities of the MQ-8B, but fly longer and carry additional payloads," said George Vardoulakis, Northrop Grumman's vice president for medium range tactical systems.</seg>
<seg id="17">Changing out the airframe, installing control systems and avionics, and then conducting a first flight of the system in a year is truly remarkable.</seg>
<seg id="18">I couldn't be more proud of the team.</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently, the MQ-8B Fire Scout is on itsseventh at-sea deployment supporting antipiracy missions on board Navy frigates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The system has also been used extensively in Afghanistan since early 2011 to provide airborne surveillance to ground commanders.</seg>
<seg id="21">Using on-board sensors to capture full-motion video, Fire Scout can identify targets and then distribute the information in real time to various users.</seg>
<seg id="22">This capability allows ship-based commanders to maintain awareness of a specified area or keep an eye on a target of interest for long periods of time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Production of the MQ-8C Fire Scout is being completed at the Northrop Grumman Unmanned Systems Center in Moss Point, Miss.</seg>
<seg id="24">The MQ-8C Fire Scout industry team includes Bell Helicopter, Rolls-Royce, Summit Aviation, Cubic Corporation, General Electric Aviation, Sierra Nevada Corporation and Honeywell.</seg>
<seg id="25">Northrop Grumman is a leading global security company providing innovative systems, products and solutions in unmanned systems, cyber, C4ISR, and logistics and modernization to government and commercial customers worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="1">Video shows Iran aiding Syrian regime's fight against rebels</seg>
<seg id="2">(CBS News) Iran has long denied that it is directly involved in the Syrian civil war, but that is a lie.</seg>
<seg id="3">CBS News has photographic proof that Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard is engaged in combat alongside Syrian government forces to put down a popular revolt that began two-and-a-half years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hadi Baghbani, a Tehran cameraman, filmed members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard fighting in the Syrian civil war.</seg>
<seg id="5">Why does it matter?</seg>
<seg id="6">A human rights group reported Thursday that the death toll in the war has now reached 120,000, including nearly 43,000 civilians.</seg>
<seg id="7">And the State Department told CBS News one-third of Syrians have now lost their homes - the equivalent of 100 million Americans being displaced.</seg>
<seg id="8">We've seen rare pictures of Iranian advisers in Syria before, but we haven't seen them fighting like this: Members of the elite Revolutionary Guard on the frontlines of Syria's civil war.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video was shot by Hadi Baghbanis, a Tehran cameraman who was invited to film a guard unit under the command of 33-year-old Mohsen Ismail Haideri, who offers a guided tour on camera of his battle sector on the outskirts of Aleppo.</seg>
<seg id="10">Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey says Iran is training and building a militia in Syria</seg>
<seg id="11">Haideri has spent eight of the past 18 months here - and the local kids now know he's good for a handout of candy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this Revolutionary Guard unit, there are about a dozen soldiers, specialists in communications and weapons and even a cleric to lead the soldiers in prayer.</seg>
<seg id="13">The unit lives in a former school that now functions as their base.</seg>
<seg id="14">Haideri, relaxed and confident, describes how just 24 hours ago, his unit fought off a rebel attack.</seg>
<seg id="15">"One hundred and fifty of them came here in vehicles," he said, "but we hit back and killed 10 or 15."</seg>
<seg id="16">They had to retreat.</seg>
<seg id="17">Video footage shows the Iranian Revolutionary Guard taking the Syrians out into rebel territory on a reconnaissance mission.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Revolutionary Guard's main job is to make hardened fighters of these Syrians - civilian men armed by President Bashar Assad to beef up the over-stretched military.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the Iranians are starting with the basics.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Get your head down," said the lieutenant to a man standing on a tank.</seg>
<seg id="21">You'll get it blown off if you stand up there.</seg>
<seg id="22">In one scene, the Iranians are taking the Syrians out into rebel territory on a reconnaissance mission, but what the men don't know as they get into position is that the rebels have spotted them and they have prepared an ambush.</seg>
<seg id="23">Once the rebels start shooting, the Iranians realize they are in trouble - running out of ammunition and pinned down by enemy fire outflanked.</seg>
<seg id="24">Suddenly the camera goes to black.</seg>
<seg id="25">The cameraman and Commander Haideri were killed, and both were mourned at elaborate funerals back in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="26">As for what difference the Iranian force made to the Syrian dictatorship in its fight against the rebels, it's been decisive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not only have Iranian-backed militias turned the tide in the government's favor in several key battles, but also this year alone Iran has lent Syria more $3.5 billion to buy oil, without which the country would have probably collapsed by now.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 15:51</seg>
<seg id="3">A man who left dogs inside a vehicle during a hot summer day has been banned from keeping animals for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Robert Porter was found guilty of causing his two Jack Russell terriers suffering in a Clydebank Shopping Centre car park on 4 June.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 54-year-old, from Glasgow, was convicted after an investigation by the Scottish SPCA.</seg>
<seg id="6">At Dumbarton Sheriff Court, Porter was given a deprivation order, meaning the dogs will not be returned to his care.</seg>
<seg id="7">'Unfit' owner</seg>
<seg id="8">He was also ordered to pay the Scottish SPCA £250 in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The animal charity's senior Inspector Nicky Scott said: "What makes this case all the more worrying is that one of our inspectors had advised Porter of the dangers of leaving his dogs in his vehicle just weeks before, yet he chose to ignore their welfare needs to go shopping on one of the hottest days of the year."</seg>
<seg id="10">""Porter also changed his story saying that his dogs had been left for only 20 minutes to actually having been left for over an hour-and-a-half.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are pleased Porter has received a ban on keeping animals as, in our opinion, he is unfit to provide proper care.</seg>
<seg id="12">Both dogs will now be found a loving new home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Fonterra has taken a 6 per cent stake in Bega Cheese.</seg>
<seg id="3">SHARES in cheesemaker Bega Cheese have surged to a record high after the world's biggest diary exporter Fonterra bought a 6 per cent stake.</seg>
<seg id="4">The New Zealand-based giant is expected to continue its buy-up of Bega shares, but the century-old NSW company has a 10 per cent shareholder cap.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fonterra Co-operative announced today it had bought the stake in Bega, paying $4.95 a share, or a 12 per cent premium on Bega's closing price yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Follow BusinessDaily on Twitter</seg>
<seg id="7">The news of Fonterra's $46 million share buy-up sent Bega shares to a record high of $4.94 as the Australian market opened today.</seg>
<seg id="8">They soared 12 per cent, or 53c.</seg>
<seg id="9">They slipped later but were still up 9.5 per cent at $4.83 in afternoon trade.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fonterra already licenses the Bega brand and has a cheese supply contract with the Australian company.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is looking to build a 10 per cent stake in Bega, hiring Goldman Sachs to broker the deal.</seg>
<seg id="12">The acquisition comes as Bega is embroiled in a takeover battle for Warrnambool Cheese and Butter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bega owns about 18 per cent of Warrnambool Cheese.</seg>
<seg id="14">It has offered $7.29 in cash and 1.2 Bega shares for each share in the Victorian dairy producer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fellow Warrnambool Cheese shareholder Murray Goulburn Co-operative has offered $7.50 a share.</seg>
<seg id="16">Both have been trumped by an $8-a-share bid from Canada's Saputo, which has the backing of the Warrnambool Cheese board.</seg>
<seg id="17">Japan's Kirin is complicating the takeover tussle further, buying a 10 per cent stake through its Lion subsidiary earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lion bought dairy maker National Foods in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="19">``There has recently been a lot of consolidation in the Australia dairy industry," Fonterra chief executive Theo Spierings said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Co-op Group set to take axe to bank</seg>
<seg id="2">The Co-operative Group is poised to radically shrink its banking arm as it repositions the lender for a new ownership structure controlled by hedge funds and other investors.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bank will be relaunched on Monday as a smaller, simpler, lender, focused on its core UK retail and small business customers, said people familiar with its plans.</seg>
<seg id="4">The cuts will be focused on its corporate lending business, which has suffered crippling losses in recent years, largely as a result of loans the Co-op inherited from its disastrous merger with Britannia building society.</seg>
<seg id="5">The restructuring is expected to trigger significant cost cuts and thousands of job losses.</seg>
<seg id="6">It will be announced by the Co-op Group's new chief executive, Euan Sutherland, alongside a dramatic reorganisation of the Co-op Bank's ownership structure.</seg>
<seg id="7">As part of its race to fill a £1.5bn capital hole at the bank, the Co-op is handing over a majority stake in the lender to holders of its lower tier two bonds, including US hedge funds Aurelius Capital Management and Silver Point Capital and other institutional investors.</seg>
<seg id="8">Retail investors, who own about £60m of debt and, as the lowest ranking creditors, were in danger of being wiped out by the restructuring, will be protected to some degree, said people close to the process.</seg>
<seg id="9">These investors - which include large numbers of pensioners and Co-op members - will be offered new, income-paying bonds as part of the rescue package.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will still have to take a hit on their investments as the new bonds are expected to have either a lower coupon - or interest rate - or a shorter duration.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless one person familiar with the restructuring said it would be a "very decent deal" for retail investors.</seg>
<seg id="12">The lower tier two bondholders will share 70 per cent of the equity in the bank, as well as receiving a relatively small amount of new bank bonds.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Co-op Group will end up with a 30 per cent stake in the bank, making it the lender's largest single shareholder.</seg>
<seg id="14">The mutual parent is expected to inject about £300m into the bank, which will come from the sale of its insurance businesses.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Co-op was forced to restructure its bank after the regulator exposed a £1.5bn capital hole in June this year.</seg>
<seg id="16">Initially it had planned to hold on to a majority stake but was forced to give that up after a group of bondholders threatened to block the original proposal.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Co-op will on Monday promise to enshrine the bank's purported ethical values in the new structure, meaning it will, for example, continue to turn business away from companies whose policies it disagrees with.</seg>
<seg id="18">The bondholders have also indicated that they support that stance.</seg>

<seg id="1">RBS creates £38bn 'bad bank'</seg>
<seg id="2">Pat McFadden, member of Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards</seg>
<seg id="3">So, RBS will have an internal bad bank, as it has had for 5 years...</seg>
<seg id="4">Andre Spicer, Professor of Organisational Behaviour at Cass Business School</seg>
<seg id="5">The decision to create an internal bad bank and delay privatization will mean senior managers are not distracted with complex restructuring and the bank is not sold off for a bargain basement price which would lose the tax payers billions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Keeping RBS in public hands for a period may not be such a bad thing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Publicly owned banks tend to be more efficient, and they also force their private sector competitors to be more efficient too.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sadly, there is little evidence that publicly owned banks are better at lending to individuals and SMEs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Analysts at Bernstein</seg>
<seg id="10">Beneath the noise of markets restructuring/ Government intervention, lies a leading UK retail franchis and the biggest and most profitable UK Corporate banking franchise.</seg>
<seg id="11">With good progress on non-core rundown, the core franchise value of one of the dominant UK retail and wholesale banks is likely to come to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="12">The reduction in the market's business may be a short term negative but actually takes the overall franchise to a portfolio which could see significant investor interest in outer years - a fact that should catalyse the Government's exit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a very messy update with a lot of moving parts.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, we feel the outcome of the "bad bank" split is a lot less onerous than it could have been.</seg>
<seg id="16">As such we think there should be a sigh of relief from the marke</seg>
<seg id="17">Ed Balls, Shadow Chancellor</seg>
<seg id="18">The tests for these changes at RBS are whether they see the taxpayer ultimately get its money back and whether they actually boost business lending and radically transform this bank to put an end to business as usual.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the banking system more widely, business and the public are right to be concerned that lending to business is still falling while the radical reforms we need are being watered down.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, he is still refusing to implement the Parliamentary Commission's call for a backstop power that would allow for full separation of all the banks, not just one or two, if ring-fencing proves ineffective and does not deliver the cultural change we need.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS</seg>
<seg id="22">Plan will "create a bank that can reward the faith of UK taxpayers and all our investors ...</seg>
<seg id="23">We are hugely indebted to the public of the UK for putting their hands into their pockets and saving this great institution.</seg>
<seg id="24">Andrew Tyrie, Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee</seg>
<seg id="25">The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards concluded that RBS" current strategy is unlikely to remedy its many problems - among them, poor SME lending policies and management, a balance sheet weighed down by bad assets and continued Government ownership - quickly or decisively enough.</seg>
<seg id="26">To tackle this, the Commission pressed the Government urgently to re-examine the options for RBS, including a detailed analysis of splitting RBS and putting its bad assets in a separate legal entity.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Government has now done the analytical work we asked for.</seg>
<seg id="28">The two reports published today have come to the same conclusions as the Commission: RBS is not serving SMEs, or the wider economy, as it should.</seg>
<seg id="29">In one important respect, we are now in a better place - we have agreement that vigorous action is required to sort out RBS" SME lending strategy.</seg>
<seg id="30">And we now have everyone focusing on achieving the best value for the taxpayer and securing a higher quality bank as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Treasury Committee will look closely at the detail of the Government's proposals.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of RBS's biggest 10 private investors</seg>
<seg id="33">RBS already has an internal bad bank, so it's just a question of moving some assets into it, shuffling loans around the disclosures; nothing really changes.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the U.S. a new name has finally taken hold for the "Russian mafia" - "Brotherly Circle"</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the "Russian mafia" blacklist in America was replenished with new names and four companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">The U.S. Department of the Treasury entered three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the "Brotherly Circle".</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the U.S. suspects of transporting money for members of the group.</seg>
<seg id="5">In total in the U.S. black list are 22 persons linked to the "Brotherly Circle", and six organizations affiliated with it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nonetheless many experts are expressing doubts that such an organization actually exists.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The announcement about the 'Brotherly Circle' looks more like an attempt to merge disconnected criminal groups," previously stated the expert on organized crime and professor of New York University Mark Galeotti.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to him, the "Brotherly Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," the American Center for Research of Corruption and Organized Crime cites Mr. Galeotti.</seg>
<seg id="10">George Mason University professor Louise Shelly also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Even if they operate jointly, then this looks more like a criminal network, but not an organization," she is quoted by the Center for Research of Corruption and Organized Crime.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti conjectured that the "Brotherly Circle" to a large extent unites those those close to the Russian "thief in law" Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hasan.</seg>
<seg id="13">The crime boss was killed in January of this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, the activity of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakhary Kalashov, who augmented the list in 2012, was tightly linked to Grandpa Hasan, and another entry in the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Grandpa Hasan.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that several of the persons have no relation to Usoyan.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to him, common financial and criminal interests, for example, deliveries of narcotics from Afghanistan, more likely united them all.</seg>
<seg id="17">Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion into the "Brotherly Circle" of Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian president Vladimir Putin - caught the attention of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id="18">Naturally, we expect to receive from our American colleagues-partners more detailed information based on which such a decision was made, why they added him to such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="19">In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.</seg>
<seg id="20">His interests will be protected just as the interests of all citizens of the RF.</seg>

<seg id="11">Broken down into its most basic elements, the rules around managing your own superannuation fund are this: 1) You need a written plan about what you want to do with your funds which is a sensible and suitable for your investment strategy and 2) If you will gain an immediate personal benefit from the investment other than the money it returns to you, you probably can't do it.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, buying an apartment with your super fund for your kids to live in is not okay.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nor is it wise to put all your eggs in one basket - ie: investing every dollar of your super in property.</seg>
<seg id="14">And if you are in a super fund with another member, you need them to sign off on any investments you make - even if they are your spouse.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this will all be audited.</seg>
<seg id="16">So you can't go out one Saturday and come home with a new property "for the super fund" - unless this is what you have agreed beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="17">Crunch your numbers</seg>
<seg id="18">Sadly, the numbers did not stack up with Kylie Davis' budget.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have my head in property data on a daily basis and had been monitoring a handful of suburbs that I thought had potential for a super investment for about six months.</seg>
<seg id="20">My criteria was to buy in an area that had good transport, at under $300,000 and get a positive return.</seg>
<seg id="21">That meant I was looking for an area that had average weekly rents over $320 a week.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lakemba was on the train line, about 20 minutes from Sydney and met the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="23">Don't invest anywhere you don't know</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Creighton and Andrew Main discuss the "knotty question": Should you borrow money in your super to buy property?</seg>
<seg id="25">Taking Andrew Winter's advice, we spent a couple of weekends hanging out in Lakemba.</seg>
<seg id="26">One Saturday we spent wandering Haldon St, checked out the local real estate windows and got a feel for where the schools and transport were.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the second visit, we went to some open for inspections, checked out the property stock that was on the market and the prices being asked to work out what we could afford with our budget and the best streets to buy in.</seg>
<seg id="28">These visits revealed Lakemba was a real melting pot of cultures.</seg>
<seg id="29">It had a high Muslim population, great food and while apartment living dominated, these were mainly rented by families, especially new migrants.</seg>
<seg id="30">We realised now we were looking for a 1960s-70s brick apartment with at least two bedrooms and should expect leases that ran for about six months to one year.</seg>
<seg id="31">Avoid negative gearing</seg>
<seg id="32">Superannuation is taxed at a lower rate than income tax, so there is little benefit to negative gearing a property bought with a DIY super fund.</seg>
<seg id="33">Doing so can also potentially be in breach of your approved investment strategy.</seg>
<seg id="34">The bigger the deposit as a proportion of the value of the property, the better the return is likely to be, which also lowers your risk.</seg>
<seg id="35">Our share portfolio - like everyone else's - had taken a bath during the GFC, so I was reluctant to liquidate shares to get the cash.</seg>
<seg id="36">So while I was researching and watching the market, we simply saved and waited until we could put down enough money, without wiping out our entire superannuation cash reserves.</seg>
<seg id="37">Have your structure set up before you buy</seg>
<seg id="38">If you are going to need any kind of finance as part of your superannuation property purchase, you need to have this set up BEFORE you put in any kind of an offer on a property.</seg>
<seg id="39">The complicated nature of DIY Super Property Investment, means the title of the property is owned by a trustee on behalf of the SMSF.</seg>
<seg id="40">The SMSF is ultimately responsible for loan payments, but the property title is held by a bare trust (or custodian trust) until the loan is fully repaid.</seg>
<seg id="41">The bare trust and its corporate trustee are completely separate from your DIY Super Trust, which should be the recipient of the rent but should not borrow any money itself. (are you still with me?</seg>
<seg id="42">Hint: don't try this at home.</seg>
<seg id="43">This is real accountant territory).</seg>
<seg id="44">If the deeds on your super fund allow, you can use an existing personal finance facility to lend money to the bear trust.</seg>
<seg id="45">But it needs to be in a separate account.</seg>
<seg id="46">The structure is designed to protect the other assets in your super fund.</seg>
<seg id="47">If for some reason, the investment falls over (ie: because you both lose your jobs and the rent fails to cover the repayments) the only recourse the bank has is to liquidate the property or go after the guarantors (which is you).</seg>
<seg id="48">But the remaining assets within the SMSF can't be touched.</seg>
<seg id="49">Setting this up can take several weeks, and will cost around $3000 with your accountant.</seg>
<seg id="50">Another hint: the right company names need to be on the documentation at time of settlement or you risk paying additional stamp duty to transfer the title if you get it wrong.</seg>
<seg id="51">You should therefore use a solicitor with expertise in this area.</seg>
<seg id="52">It may cost a little more but it could save you a lot later.</seg>
<seg id="53">Buy your property</seg>
<seg id="54">With everything in order, I woke up one Saturday morning, realised the market was on the move and I needed to act.</seg>
<seg id="55">That weekend, I went to six open for inspections for properties that met my criteria and were in my price bracket.</seg>
<seg id="56">The second property ticked all my boxes.</seg>
<seg id="57">It was neat and tidy, had recently been renovated, and had a car space.</seg>
<seg id="58">Nothing needed to be done before tenants could move in.</seg>
<seg id="59">Others I looked at were slightly larger, but required work to make presentable and not enough of a price discount to warrant the work.</seg>
<seg id="60">Before each open, I sat out the front with my iPad on my bank's loan calculator typing in the price and comparing the repayments to my budget and the rent I could expect.</seg>
<seg id="61">I wrote everything down and made sure I compared each property the same way.</seg>
<seg id="62">This was informative.</seg>
<seg id="63">It showed me that the bigger apartments, although "nicer" to live in, were not as good an investment as the higher prices were out of proportion to the rent they could return.</seg>
<seg id="64">One top level apartment was big and bright and had a better layout.</seg>
<seg id="65">It was also $320,000 and would return $330, compared to the second apartment which at $285,000 could return $310.</seg>
<seg id="66">I rang my husband.</seg>
<seg id="67">We're not going to live in it.</seg>
<seg id="68">It's an investment.</seg>
<seg id="69">Go with the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="70">Salient advice.</seg>
<seg id="71">I put in an offer on the second unit.</seg>
<seg id="72">Pay any loans down quickly</seg>
<seg id="73">Here is my top DIY Super Investment property tip.</seg>
<seg id="74">If your expected rent does not cover the cost of your finance, the property you want to buy is either too expensive to purchase for your fund, or you are lending too much money.</seg>
<seg id="75">We currently pay 75 per cent of our super contributions onto the mortgage plus the rent and using this formula we expect the property to be paid off in less than five years.</seg>
<seg id="76">If either of us lost our jobs, the rent could still pay the loan, albeit over a longer period.</seg>
<seg id="77">We are aware we could probably earn more with the super contributions if they were invested elsewhere but our financial plan - and risk profile - is to get rid of the mortgage as quickly as possible so that the investment is revenue positive by the time my husband retires.</seg>
<seg id="78">Happy investing</seg>
<seg id="79">I got a real buzz out of buying our unit with our super funds.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's not the most glamorous property, but the numbers work, it's been consistently tenanted and since purchasing, and is returning a yield of roughly 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="81">According to RP Data, the median sale price for units in the area has risen 9.4 per cent over the past 12 months so my asset is also appreciating.</seg>
<seg id="82">Happy days!</seg>
<seg id="83">With thanks to my accountant Paul Simeoni who patiently stepped me through the process repeatedly over two years until I was comfortable with it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The University Hospital of Wales delivers around 6,000 babies every year, with between 600 and 1,200 women having a miscarriage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ms Wheatley, now mum to healthy eight-month-old baby Ella, went to the 1,000-bed hospital nine weeks into her pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="4">She was told she needed an operation to remove the dead child, following a Doppler Ultrasound and transabdominal scan.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the next day Ms Wheatley went to Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, where nurses gave her a transviginal scan and found the baby was still alive.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I feel angry at the decision to not follow a simple process which could have prevented this misdiagnosis," she said."</seg>
<seg id="7">""It's just unbelievable that there are potentially other women out there who have been diagnosed with having a silent miscarriage."</seg>
<seg id="8">Peter Tyndall, the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales, said: "Were it not for the fortunate circumstance of this woman seeking her post-miscarriage care at an alternative hospital it seems likely that these failings would have resulted in the medical termination of a healthy, viable pregnancy."</seg>
<seg id="9">""The clinical practices of midwives at the University Hospital of Wales in respect of the diagnosis of early miscarriages have been potentially flawed.</seg>
<seg id="10">I expect women who have been diagnosed with early miscarriages and subsequently underwent uterine evacuation will find this extremely disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Cardiff and Vale Health Board, which oversees the hospital, offered an unreserved apology after admitting "unacceptable actions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Director of nursing, Ruth Walker, said: "Ms Wheatley was let down by our care and that's not acceptable."</seg>
<seg id="13">""We do not underestimate the distress that this has caused her and may cause other women who have experienced miscarriage.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I read the report I felt very devastated for Ms Wheatley - we failed in our duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">""The policies and procedures that the midwives followed at the time were not as up-to-date as they should have been."</seg>

<seg id="1">Office towers' future resides in apartments</seg>
<seg id="2">AS the residential upturn gathers pace, expect to see a rash of older and less efficient office buildings converted into apartment towers.</seg>
<seg id="3">House price growth is strong, with capital city values rising 3.4 per cent in the three months to October 31, according to RP Data-Rismark, with home loan volumes up and building approvals on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="4">The market is also being underpinned by population growth, a shortage of dwellings and low interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="5">Meanwhile, investor interest is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="6">The latest available data shows that lending to investors for residential dwellings rose by nearly 26 per cent in the year to August.</seg>
<seg id="7">That is the fastest pace of growth in nearly six years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Office towers in the western corridor of the Sydney CBD have already piqued developers' interest.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jones Lang LaSalle and Knight Frank are marketing an office building at 286 Sussex Street.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tower, managed by Cornerstone Properties, could trade for more than $45 million, after being bought in 2011 for $32.5m.</seg>
<seg id="11">Designs by architects Crone Partners suggest the site could sustain about 180 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="12">Foreign investors are also jumping on this trend, especially Asian-backed groups.</seg>
<seg id="13">Separately, the Blackstone-owned Valad Property Group is reported to be close to selling its 227 Elizabeth Street office building to an offshore developer.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 23-storey B-grade property with approval for 114 units is expected to sell for around $145m, well ahead of initial expectations of $120m.</seg>
<seg id="15">Earlier this year, China's Greenland Group snapped up the former Sydney Water Board site in Bathurst Street for a $600m project including what will be the city's tallest apartment tower.</seg>
<seg id="16">Traditional demand for office towers is heavily linked to white-collar employment.</seg>
<seg id="17">The jobs market is subdued, particularly for full-time work, with employment growth likely to remain modest over the coming year, causing the office vacancy rate to drift higher.</seg>
<seg id="18">Office space net absorption for next year is likely to be below the long-term average.</seg>
<seg id="19">The ageing of Australia's office stock and subdued jobs growth means conversions of older and lower grade office buildings are opportunities being embraced, especially where demand for residential apartments is strongest.</seg>

<seg id="2">Italian unemployment is breaking records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Data published Wednesday showed that now 12.5% of country residents are unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Situation has not been this bad since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="5">This indicator is several times higher among the youth.</seg>
<seg id="6">40.4% of residents between the ages of 15 and 24 years have no employment.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of elderly workers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Such an experiment is already being conducted by the largest energy company in the country, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide for a portion of early retirement for experienced workers.</seg>

<seg id="2">A DRUG-fuelled learner driver caught behind the wheel of a stolen vehicle and a motorcyclist cruising in a bicycle lane are among more than 100 road users nabbed during a five-hour police blitz in Melbourne's southwest.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two road users were also found driving after having their licences cancelled, five failed to even hold a licence and nine had suspended licences.</seg>
<seg id="4">Police also detected 22 unregistered vehicles as part of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="5">State Highway Patrol members used new automatic numberplate recognition technology to check more than 5000 cars as they drove past their post on Point Cook Rd in Seabrook between 1pm and 5pm on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police revealed the details of the road policing exercise on the same day it unveiled its latest weapon to crackdown on road users flouting the law - four new police vehicles boasting numberplate recognition cameras.</seg>

<seg id="1">Challenging the status quo - Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="2">Spotify may have 10 million tracks but what the mass market really wants is great music, well curated.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want to create the best music playlist of all time, it will be made up of the songs people have bought over the last 60 years, which is the charts.</seg>
<seg id="4">I Like Music makes a healthy £1.5m turnover working with publishers across the world - it has an exclusive contract to supply the BBC with music for its programme content across TV, radio and online.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We supply 10,000 users at the BBC," explains Hill.</seg>
<seg id="6">The B2B market pays the bills.</seg>
<seg id="7">But I Like Music goes beyond pure licensing.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has developed a raft of products that allows it to work with third parties to add value to music so that punters want to pay for tracks.</seg>
<seg id="9">One deal, with card maker Funky Pigeon, adds a QR code to birthday cards allowing the recipient to play The Soundtrack of Your Life.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's a streamed version of every number one from every one of your birthdays," says Hill.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another innovation is the Virtual Jukebox.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Anyone with a mobile phone can walk into a bar, scan a code or visit a url, and up comes a jukebox," explains Hill.</seg>
<seg id="13">You select tracks on your phone and it plays in the bar.</seg>
<seg id="14">Four of the UK's leading brewers have already signed up and I Like Music is in the process of signing a trade deal with a Chicago-based distributor too.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Bars don't have a £2,000 jukebox on the wall so there's nothing for drunken punters to punch or kick," says Hill.</seg>
<seg id="16">They just get a little box from us.</seg>
<seg id="17">I Like Music has been playing it safe with the B2B market in recent years but Hill is about to make his first foray into the consumer market.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has secured a £750,000 loan from Santander, and plans to launch a pop up shop in Brick Lane to sell a range of I Like Music merchandise, and a series of products for the gifting market.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We are creating a gift card with an annual subscription so that if you enter any date, you get that week's chart hits," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">We also have t-shirts, bags and hats that feature a QR code that streams a curated playlist.</seg>
<seg id="21">Gifting is the sweet spot, he argues.</seg>
<seg id="22">You don't want to give someone a dodgy track you've downloaded from Limewire for their birthday.</seg>
<seg id="23">This new revenue stream is forecast to increase turnover threefold by 2016.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only way to reinvigorate this industry is to innovate," says Hill.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you're bringing added value to music then people will buy it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Publishing industry rebound</seg>
<seg id="27">The printed book market continues to decline while the worldwide e-reader market (including the ubiquitous Kindle) is estimated to hit over $6bn in revenue by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="28">Three authors have joined forces to take a second look at the tired book publishing industry, and place the power back in the hands of authors and readers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Unbound was launched by Dan Kieran, John Mitchinson (the creator of the QI series) and Justin Pollard in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="30">The company allows authors to pitch ideas for books and runs a crowdfunding platform where supporters can offer their financial backing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The firm has funded 50 new books to date, with over £1m pledged.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dan Kieran believes that this model could truly be the salvation of the publishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Most publishers don't really know who reads their books," he says.</seg>
<seg id="34">They just publish the ones they know retailers will stock.</seg>
<seg id="35">They often aren't willing to take a risk on left field projects.</seg>
<seg id="36">In contrast, Unbound's projects only come to life once the readers themselves lend their backing.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kieran has found that once people want to read a book, they are willing to put up a fair wedge of cash.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The average pledge price is £35, which is seven times the average price of a book," he says.</seg>
<seg id="39">One author, Dr Sue Black, raised £30,000 in three days.</seg>
<seg id="40">Authors are flocking to the company in droves because of its unique profit share model.</seg>
<seg id="41">The split is 50/50, whether you're a first time writer or an established author.</seg>
<seg id="42">In traditional publishing, royalties stand at 5pc-10pc.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The average author earns £14,000 a year but if you take out the JK Rowlings and Stephen Kings, that drops to just £4,000," explains Kieran.</seg>
<seg id="44">Part of the appeal of an Unbound book is the workmanship.</seg>
<seg id="45">"We're not giving 65pc of the cover price to the retailer so our books are incredibly beautiful," says Kieran.</seg>
<seg id="46">This is part of the secret to ensuring that books stay in vogue, he argues.</seg>
<seg id="47">My son is eight and can't stand digital books.</seg>
<seg id="48">He sleeps with his favbourites under his pillow.</seg>
<seg id="49">You wouldn't do that with a Kindle.</seg>
<seg id="50">Betting on customer service</seg>
<seg id="51">Back in the golden age of bookmaking, well-to-do gentlemen would visit their bookies in Mayfair, Park Lane and Carnaby Street to place bets on the horses, collect winnings and engage in some spirited repartee.</seg>
<seg id="52">Some of today's biggest gambling houses have their roots in this private service: William Hill had an off-track betting shop in Park Lane in the thirties.</seg>
<seg id="53">Now one entrepreneur is looking to bring back that personalised service through bespoke bookmakers Fitzdares.</seg>
<seg id="54">Balthazar Fabricius founded the company in 20006 and took his first bet in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="55">Today, his firm boasts 1,200 members and placed £88m in fixed odds bets last year.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Most betting shops today are corporate monolithic businesses," says Fabricius.</seg>
<seg id="57">They have become gaming operators with online casinos and bingo betting emporiums.</seg>
<seg id="58">There is a demand for a high level of service.</seg>
<seg id="59">That the original customer has been forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="60">Fabricius has brought back the telephone betting model, with a twist.</seg>
<seg id="61">"The market all thought we were mad," he says.</seg>
<seg id="62">It was the one part of everyone's business that was declining.</seg>
<seg id="63">But if you swap the word telephone for mobile, that's actually the one part of every bookmakers that's growing exponentially.</seg>
<seg id="64">We pioneered text message betting.</seg>
<seg id="65">By giving each member an exclusive phone number and a dedicated bookie, Fabricius brought back the old world charm of gambling.</seg>
<seg id="66">He also introduced a series of perks for his customers, from top seats at an Eric Clapton concert in Floridita to free bets on their birthdays.</seg>
<seg id="67">"We gave a £5,000 free bet to one guy the other day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="68">He just couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="69">There are no membership fees, but Fitzdares only opens accounts through referral.</seg>
<seg id="70">New customers are tempted in by Fitzdares prices: "We operate the John Lewis model of never being knowingly undersold," says Fabricius.</seg>
<seg id="71">And an active social media profile across Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and the company blog has drawn in a much younger audience than the original "British horse racing" member.</seg>
<seg id="72">Fancy a flutter on Strictly Come Dancing or a punt on the Ashes at 2am?</seg>
<seg id="73">Fitzdares will accommodate.</seg>

<seg id="1">They may interrogate Snowden in Russia</seg>
<seg id="2">Former employee of American intelligence agencies Edward Snowden most likely will not leave Russia to provide testimony on the matters regarding the wiretapping of telephone conversations of the chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a source familiar with the situation stated to Interfax, the American can respond to the questions of representatives of the German Prosecutor's Office in writing or face-to-face in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The departure of Edward Snowden beyond Russia is virtually excluded.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In such a case he would lose the status of a refugee and may be turned over to Washington by allied countries of the U.S.," said an agency source.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Instead, basically the Prosecutor's Office of Germany could send its representatives to the RF or submit written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that this issue must be handled at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previously, deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Stroebele reported that Edward Snowden is ready to provide testimony on the matter regarding the wiretapping of conversations of the chancellor of Germany by American intelligence agencies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Snowden is ready to provide testimony to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="9">The former employee of the CIA indicated that he knows quite a lot.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA has obstructed all of his movements, Snowden is willing to come to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, for that it is necessary to clearly define all conditions of his arrival," reported Stroebele to the television channel Euronews.</seg>
<seg id="12">Snowden's lawyer Anatoliy Kucherena, commenting on the statement by the Interfax source, announced that his client may collaborate with German investigators, but when and how - he will decide himself.</seg>
<seg id="13">The U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who had worked in the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May of 2013, after which he disclosed information on secret operations of U.S. intelligence agencies regarding internet surveillance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rory McIlroy loses ground to Dustin Johnson in HSBC Champions in China</seg>
<seg id="2">That left the two-time major winner on seven under and five shots behind Johnson, who had charged through the field with a course record-equalling 63.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Disappointing, frustrating," was how McIlroy summed up his round to reporters.</seg>
<seg id="4">I obviously played nicely on the front nine and then started to hit a lot of sloppy shots on the back.</seg>
<seg id="5">I missed the last six greens in a row, seven on the back nine, so a bit of work is needed on the range this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="6">I hit a couple of bad shots and then I guess I let it affect me a little bit and then I started to doubt myself sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="7">I didn't hit a lot of quality shots on the back nine.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would have been nice to play a bit better and start tomorrow with a few more shots in hand but I guess I'm in a decent position going into the weekend, and still have a great chance at winning this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="9">Johnson, four behind McIlroy following an opening 69, birdied six of his first seven holes - his only par coming on the third - and narrowly missed further birdie chances on the eighth and ninth to be out in 30.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big-hitting American dropped his first shot of the day after missing the green on the 10th, but responded with birdies on the 13th, 14th, 16th and 18th.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Yesterday I doubled my third hole of the day, the 12th, and played really well after that and this morning on the range I worked on a few things and hit it really well coming out of the gates and obviously putted well," Johnson told Sky Sports.</seg>
<seg id="12">This course is great, you put this in America and it would hold up to any of them over there.</seg>
<seg id="13">I think it's a great course, it's in great shape and the greens are really good but you have to be spot-on with your iron shots because there is a lot of undulation and today I controlled my distance really well and drove it really well.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are still two more days of golf left so I will come out tomorrow and try to do the same thing I did today.</seg>
<seg id="15">I don't tend to play defensively, I just play my game and I play pretty aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="16">McIlroy shared second place with 2012 Masters winner Bubba Watson and former Ryder Cup player Boo Weekley, the American duo recording rounds of 69 and 67 respectively.</seg>
<seg id="17">Six players are a shot behind on six under, defending champion Ian Poulter carding a 67 to join fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, Spanish duo Sergio Garcia and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano - winner of the BMW Masters on Sunday - Ernie Els and Graeme McDowell in fifth place.</seg>
<seg id="18">US Open champion Justin Rose and Open champion Phil Mickelson are among a seven-strong group on five under.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mickelson, who took nine on his penultimate hole on Thursday in an opening 71, birdied five of his last six holes in his 68, dropping a shot on the reachable par-four 16th after hooking his tee shot into the water.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The last time I made a quadruple bogey, on the 14th hole at East Lake in 2009, I won the tournament, the Tour Championship, so it's an omen," Mickelson said.</seg>
<seg id="21">I've made too many mistakes but I am going to continue to play aggressively out here because I have to make birdies to catch the lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hopefully I'll eliminate a few mistakes here or there.</seg>
<seg id="23">Rose's water trouble came on the last, the world number five thinning a bunker shot across the green and into the hazard on his way to a closing bogey and round of 71.</seg>

<seg id="1">The head trainer of "Colorado" Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to unleash goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov in the first minutes in the final match with "Dallas", expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars has not shaken his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas staff reporter from "Sport Express" Natalia Shmeleva.</seg>
<seg id="2">But what should we expect, said Roy after the morning skate of the "Avalanches".</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be good for him to get out on the ice today.</seg>
<seg id="4">We want him to get out on the ice and demonstrate his usual level.</seg>
<seg id="5">In other words, you are completely confident that the situation in no way has affected the performance of the goalkeeper?</seg>
<seg id="6">Well today we will see.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without a doubt our players will support Varly in that they will help him protect the goal, as was the case in the previous matches of this season.</seg>
<seg id="8">Above all, no one on the team intends to draw any kind of conclusions until the court investigates the situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Singapore developer buys "blank canvas" in big east London site</seg>
<seg id="2">London's largest development site to come to market this year has been sold to a Singapore investor, which intends to create "an entirely new district" housing 10,000 people on the site in east London's docklands.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Wharf was sold on Friday by Ballymore to Oxley Holdings Ltd, a Singapore-listed property developer, for what people familiar with the deal say was about £200m.</seg>
<seg id="4">The developer plans to build 3,400 homes as well as commercial, retail, leisure and education facilities on the 40-acre site, which agent Knight Frank said was the largest development opportunity to come on to the market since Battersea Power Station last year.</seg>
<seg id="5">It already has planning permission.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ching Chiat Kwong, Oxley's chief executive, said that the proximity of Crossrail, London's first new underground line in 30 years, was a factor in the company's decision to acquire the site.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Custom House Crossrail station will be 1km away.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Royal Wharf . . . offers a blank canvas," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Oxley will create a vibrant district.</seg>
<seg id="10">Oxley has developed a series of residential, commercial and industrial projects in Singapore, China, Malaysia and Cambodia, but this is its first UK scheme.</seg>
<seg id="11">The eastern docklands area, one of the most rundown parts of the capital, is set to be transformed in the coming decade.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chinese developers are building a £1bn office complex at the Royal Albert Dock, while the £1.5bn redevelopment of Silvertown Quays involves 1,500 new homes being built as well as retail and business incubation space.</seg>
<seg id="13">London mayor Boris Johnson lobbied Oxley to take up the site on his trade mission to China last month.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said: "This type of deal is exactly why I spent six days meeting businessmen and officials in China banging the drum for the capital and it is further evidence of the colossal appetite of developers from the Far East and elsewhere to invest in London."</seg>
<seg id="15">Alan Selby from agent Alan Selby & Partners, who acted for Ballymore, said: "The interest generated on such a large site confirms that east London is fast becoming a location for international developers."</seg>
<seg id="16">Charlie Hart, a partner at estate agent Knight Frank who also acted for Ballymore, added: "Interest for this opportunity was very strong from both the UK and overseas."</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)</seg>
<seg id="2">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win," Glading said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.</seg>
<seg id="26">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
<seg id="38">But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.</seg>
<seg id="41">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>
