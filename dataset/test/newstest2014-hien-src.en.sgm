<seg id="1">Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.</seg>
<seg id="6">How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.</seg>
<seg id="15">The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.</seg>
<seg id="28">The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="33">Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.</seg>
<seg id="34">While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.</seg>

<seg id="1">BT has scored an early goal but this match with Sky has a long way to go</seg>
<seg id="2">If the company can maintain this momentum, as new chief executive Gavin Patterson hopes, then it will have been a gamble worth taking.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, Mr Patterson will have a number of obstacles to negotiate before a true judgment can be made.</seg>
<seg id="4">BT is likely to compete aggressively for the rights to broadcast the Champions League football tournament, which stands alongside the Premier League as the biggest draw for sports fans.</seg>
<seg id="5">If it bids successfully, another large number will be tacked on to BT's total spending.</seg>
<seg id="6">If it fails, Sky will remain the premier destination for sports fans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Other bidding wars will no doubt follow and, as the rivalry intensifies, competition will force both to shell out ever-increasing sums.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, it remains to be seen if the growth shown on Thursday is able to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sky, Virgin Media et al are unlikely to sit back and let their numbers suffer.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is still a long way to go - in football terms the supporters are still settling into their seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">But BT's impressive start suggests it's going to be a close match.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wealthy foreigners are an easy target</seg>
<seg id="13">There is something inequitable in the fact that, if you're a British resident and owner of a second property in this country after your main home, you are likely to pay capital gains tax on any profits made when it is sold.</seg>
<seg id="14">If you are a non-resident non-dom, on the other hand, and the owner of a multi-million-pound mansion in London's Belgravia, for example, where values have soared in recent years, you will not be hit with the additional tax bill.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, slapping that additional property tax on the wealthy foreigners who have in recent years flocked to London in droves - as now seems to be under ministerial consideration - does not really seem the right answer, even though it would doubtless prove a popular move.</seg>
<seg id="16">Wealthy foreigners who buy property are easy to demonise and many politicians have whipped up the sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Simon Hughes, for instance, Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark and Bermondsey - which is one of the capital's central, but in some parts poorer, districts - has talked repeatedly of the danger of London property becoming "a mere commodity for the global super-rich."</seg>
<seg id="18">Remarks like this may please some audiences and play to the idea that rich, overseas buyers of highly priced London homes are somehow to blame for the fact that there are too few affordable properties for ordinary families.</seg>
<seg id="19">But they take no account of how much these foreign property buyers spend on other goods and services in this country, beside their luxurious homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The world's super-rich have always wanted to stay or live in London, drawn by its world-beating combination of commerce, culture, legal security and much else besides.</seg>
<seg id="21">And their presence brings many benefits.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whether the benefits outweigh the allegedly malign impact these foreign buyers have on the property market, seems largely unexplored territory.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most of the statistics relating to foreign buyers of property in London suggests their preference for central, newly built properties of the sort not likely to be within the sights of first-time buyers or families.</seg>
<seg id="24">The properties they prefer, say agents and developers, are typically one or two-bedroom apartments in new, multi-storey, serviced blocks where prices average £600,000 or more.</seg>
<seg id="25">A tax on rich foreigners will bring in some money very easily, and at the same time strike a populist tone.</seg>
<seg id="26">But it won't solve the housing problems of London and other densely populated centres.</seg>
<seg id="27">It could also do far worse, by taking some of the shine off London, when it is still a much-needed magnet with which to draw capital and commerce into the country.</seg>
<seg id="28">Less hot air and more action on energy please</seg>
<seg id="29">The furore caused by the decision taken by four of the "Big Six" energy companies to ramp up prices for gas and electricity has both sides of Government spinning.</seg>
<seg id="30">Michael Fallon, the energy minister, wants to level the playing field by raising the customer threshold before green taxes kick in for smaller energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="31">This, he hopes, will encourage more competition in the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">His Liberal Democrat colleague, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, proposes criminalising energy bosses who manipulate the market to unfairly overcharge customers.</seg>
<seg id="33">This strategy, Davey hopes, will keep the energy companies honest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The danger is that both are falling into the political trap of promising wide-ranging reforms to the issues that are now threatening the nation's energy security, but not doing enough to make these changes happen.</seg>
<seg id="35">A good start would be to make good on the Government's repeated promise to scrap green taxes.</seg>
<seg id="36">Doing more to encourage the opening up of gas fracking, which could provide cheaper fuel would help, too.</seg>

<seg id="2">Marco Lavoie became stranded after a bear attack.</seg>
<seg id="3">The family gave this photo to police to help in their search.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bear attacked Marco Lavoie's campsite, leaving him without tools for survival</seg>
<seg id="5">The bear ate his food and ruined his equipment</seg>
<seg id="6">Police found him near death three months after he began trip</seg>
<seg id="7">(CNN) -- If Marco Lavoie had not been rescued when he was, the Quebec man probably would have perished within 48 hours.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was hypothermic, dehydrated and near starvation in the unforgiving cold of northwestern Quebec when police rescued him Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lavoie's survival might be called miraculous, as he had been in the wilderness for more than three months.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 44-year-old is an experienced outdoorsman, but an encounter with a bear changed his luck, Quebec police said</seg>
<seg id="11">At some point during a planned two-month canoe trek in the Lake Matagami area, a bear attacked Lavoie's campsite, eating his food and ruining his equipment, police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The bear did not injure Lavoie but left him without the tools or resources to survive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Police say they have yet to speak with Lavoie to get details.</seg>
<seg id="14">Minnesota hiker falls from cliff to his death near Yosemite waterfall</seg>
<seg id="15">"In these parts, there's a subculture of people who go on these long trips into the middle of nowhere, but sometimes we forgot how dangerous it can be," Gerald Lemoine, mayor of a small town near Matagami, told the Montreal Gazette.</seg>
<seg id="16">The rescued canoeist began his adventure July 16, Coulombe said.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't until three months later, on October 21, that his family called authorities because too long had passed without Lavoie's return.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police conducted searches for eight days, weather permitting, with no luck.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rescuers in a helicopter finally spotted Lavoie on Wednesday, but they could not safely land at that spot, Coulombe said.</seg>
<seg id="20">So officers had to hike in to pick him up and carry him more than a mile to the chopper.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lavoie's condition was such that he was barely able to speak and at first couldn't even drink water, the Gazette reported.</seg>
<seg id="22">Had he spent another day or two in the elements, he would have starved to death, police spokesman Ronald McInnis said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The man had lost half of his body weight, he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was Lavoie's German shepherd who scared the bear away on the day of the attack, but the dog did not survive the ordeal, McInnis said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Up there, in the Canadian shield, there's little plant life to live off, so he would have been slowly, painfully dying when they found him.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It's an amazing feat that he was able to keep himself alive this long with almost no equipment," survival instructor Caleb Musgrave told the Gazette.</seg>
<seg id="27">When you start to go hungry, you get mood swings, your mind breaks, and you cramp up all over your body.</seg>

<seg id="2">Charles Gibson, 45, 'fought with wife Tanya Beckett about their divorce'</seg>
<seg id="3">PC Aaron Walker arrived and him and Gibson 'grappled for 11 minutes'</seg>
<seg id="4">Gibson, the son of Baron Ashbourne, denies any wrongdoing</seg>
<seg id="5">By Inderdeep Bains</seg>
<seg id="6">Claims: Charles Gibson, the son of a peer, is alleged to have fought with PC Aaron Walker who tried to arrest him</seg>
<seg id="7">A baron's son who allegedly attacked his BBC presenter wife during a row was pepper-sprayed as he fought with a policeman who was trying to arrest him, a court heard.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Hon Edward Charles d'Olier Gibson is accused of punching an officer despite being sprayed twice in the face and struck repeatedly in the shins with a baton after resisting arrest for assaulting his wife.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police were called to the former city financier's £1million home after he allegedly dragged his wife of 12 years, BBC World News presenter Tanya Beckett, by the hair as they rowed about whether they should get a divorce.</seg>
<seg id="10">Gibson, 45, appeared at Oxford magistrates" court yesterday charged with assaulting 47-year-old Mrs Beckett and PC Aaron Walker.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Oxford-educated son of Edward Barry Greynville Gibson, 80, fourth Baron Ashbourne, denies both charges.</seg>
<seg id="12">PC Walker told the court that Gibson had made him fear for his well-being after the father managed to throw him to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer said he was called to the five-bedroom detached home the couple shared near Watlington, Oxfordshire, in the early hours of June 8.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mrs Beckett had reported that Gibson had threatened her and grabbed her hair during a discussion about getting a divorce.</seg>
<seg id="15">The officer said that the couple, who have three children, had been drinking heavily and that when he arrived, he discovered one of Gibson's shotguns was unaccounted for.</seg>
<seg id="16">The policeman told District Judge Tim Pattinson that this led to a search of the grounds of the home.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then, at around 2.30am, the defendant's car pulled into the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="18">PC Walker said Gibson ignored his instruction to stay put.</seg>
<seg id="19">After he tried to restrain Gibson, the pair grappled for 11 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Strength: Gibson, pictured with his wife at a Mayfair party in 2006, carried on fighting while handcuffed and simply wiped pepper spray out of his eyes</seg>
<seg id="21">PC Walker, who said he weighs 13-and-a-half stone, told the court that even though he handcuffed one of his hands, Gibson managed to throw him off as if he weighed "nothing."</seg>
<seg id="22">He added: "At some point, he has taken a swing at me, which I moved to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"He said to me, "you're not arresting me, I'm going home."</seg>
<seg id="24">I then reached for my capacitor (pepper spray) and sprayed it directly into Mr Gibson's eyes.</seg>
<seg id="25">He stood there, wiped it from his eyes and called me a coward.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is the first time I have ever had a capacitor fail on me.</seg>
<seg id="27">'Dragged by the hair': Police attended after Mrs Beckett reported that Gibson had threatened her and grabbed her hair during a discussion about getting a divorce</seg>
<seg id="28">The officer said he then drew his baton and hit Gibson as hard as he could, three times on his shins, which also had no effect.</seg>
<seg id="29">He said: "This was an "Oh no" moment on my part, because I have never come across a person I have not been able to physically overpower."</seg>
<seg id="30">PC Walker then described being punched in the side by Gibson as he tried to grab him again.</seg>
<seg id="31">The policeman claims Gibson then told him that he was "nobody and did not have the power to arrest somebody like him."</seg>
<seg id="32">Wife: Gibson is accused of assaulting BBC World News presenter Tanya Beckett, whom he married in 2001</seg>
<seg id="33">Presenter: Gibson, pictured top left with colleagues at the launch of LBC radio in 2003, is a broadcaster</seg>
<seg id="34">The armed response unit had to be called as back up before Gibson was eventually taken into custody, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="35">Edmund Gritt, defending, suggested to PC Walker that his client had never said such words and the officer had failed to identify who he was.</seg>
<seg id="36">The officer denied this.</seg>
<seg id="37">The trial was adjourned until later this month.</seg>

<seg id="1">"I still find it difficult to imagine a father presenting his favourite daughter with a certificate for a gold-linked exchange traded fund on her big day," says one senior policy maker.</seg>
<seg id="2">That's from a long Diwali read on India's gold obsession by Avantika Chilkoti and James Crabtree which is well worth your time and to which we might add a cheeky few thoughts - it seems the RBI's attempts to offer alternative to India's gold-lust says more than a little about the limitations facing the central bank and Rajan.</seg>
<seg id="3">There's obviously myriad reasons for gold demand in India (religious, cultural, dodgy, investment all oft satisfied by smugglers) but since so much of it comes from rural areas, as Chilkoti and Crabtree note, "ending the lust for gold is likely to mean grappling with more basic factors, such as access to bank accounts."</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a sensible point that has wider resonance when you consider Rajan's attempts to curb inflation and influence the economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the same way that introducing savings certificates indexed to inflation into a market this immature is not going to do much in the short-run, attempting to exert some monetary dominance in a country like India, where there is only so far the balance of power can shift away from the fiscal powers and the states, might also have a little bit of the Sisyphus to it.</seg>
<seg id="6">This isn't to say that monetary policy doesn't matter or that Rajan can't pull more power and independence into his central bank, it's simply to say that since rather significant swathes of the country are outside of his scope, GDP data is sketchy and the central bank is starting from such a constrained point, the process is going to be slower.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Mark Bergen wrote of Rajan in Caravan recently:</seg>
<seg id="8">... monetary policy is only a slim portion of his job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Much of the Indian economy churns outside the control of formal interest rates, and the central banker's role in regulating the banking and finance sector likely has a more significant effect on the large informal economy.</seg>
<seg id="10">For some financial observers, this is disconcerting - they doubt Rajan's ability, as a bureaucratic outsider, to steer and challenge India's stodgy scheduled banks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The battle over banking licenses will be one to watch while, tbf, the limits of his powers are something the man seems to be aware of, taking pains to talk down the significance of his role and to put more weight where weight is needed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finally, these points about India's informal economy may be obvious to some but for those not familiar with how dramatic it is (it's comparable to sub-Saharan Africa) here are some stats and a little comment from Credit Suisse's Neelkanth Mishra with more on banking here:</seg>
<seg id="13">Unlike in the developed economies where informality is purely a deliberate choice to avoid taxation or regulations, in India it is more structural: a reflection of the lack of development and limited government reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">This drives low tax revenues and low risk-taking by individuals who lack labour protection or access to a financial system.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, one could claim that the formal part of India's economy is among the most heavily taxed in the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">It also makes GDP calculation more of an exercise in estimation than reporting.</seg>
<seg id="17">The pace of formalisation in India has been slow for most sectors.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is not surprising: in 2005 India had 42 mn enterprises - at least since 1980 enterprises have been growing faster than employees, and the number of employees per enterprise had fallen to 2.4 by 2005.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore, while the number of company registrations is seeing a steady increase, the share of the informal economy is likely to stay significant for a while.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, the flip side of this is that the informal economy is also a source of massive, potentially underestimated, growth which may put paid to fears of missing out on a demographic dividend, and put inflation fears in context, but more on that here.</seg>

<seg id="1">Harsh truths about the decline of Britain</seg>
<seg id="2">The ONS analysis shows that we are now going the other way.</seg>
<seg id="3">The amount of our income accounted for by "essentials" - housing, water, sewerage, energy bills and fuel - has risen over a decade from 19.9 per cent to 27.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Once food is taken into account, the numbers are more striking still.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cumulative inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index - the yardstick used by the Bank of England - has been roughly 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet the Tullett Prebon Essentials Index - which takes in most of the necessities of modern living - has gone up by more than 60 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Consumers" discretionary spending has been eroded even more severely than that fall in disposable income suggests.</seg>
<seg id="8">This inflation seems to be a very British disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Stripping out the effect of tax rises, the eurozone as a whole is now in deflation, with even energy prices down 1.7 per cent year on year.</seg>
<seg id="10">A deflationary spiral is never something a highly indebted economy like ours would want to get into, but just a smidgen of falling prices would be more than welcome right now.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exhibit C: education.</seg>
<seg id="12">An international survey by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has found standards of literacy and numeracy among school-leavers in England and Northern Ireland to be among the lowest in the developed world.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shockingly, older people leaving the workforce were better educated than those joining it.</seg>
<seg id="14">This may be the first time in recorded history that such a phenomenon has occurred, with the young worse educated than their parents.</seg>
<seg id="15">The upshot, as the OECD observes, is that the "talent pool of highly skilled adults is likely to shrink relative to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="16">The implications for living standards are close to disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="17">The average worker in the highest literacy band will earn 94 per cent more than someone in the lowest.</seg>
<seg id="18">With rare exceptions - usually driven, entrepreneurial types - you cannot dream of entering the "global race," let alone winning it, with such poor levels of educational achievement.</seg>
<seg id="19">In identifying the causes, we can safely discount the amount of public money thrown at education, which as a percentage of GDP is roughly in the middle of the OECD pack, and actually higher than some countries that score better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would also be too easy to blame poor standards of teaching and/or relatively high levels of low-skilled immigration, though these things obviously play a part.</seg>
<seg id="21">A more fundamental cause is widening levels of social inequality, with their attendant - and growing - deficit in aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="22">Studies from the US show that achievement gaps start to widen as early as 18 months into a child's life.</seg>
<seg id="23">By three, children of professional parents will have heard 30 million more words than those from low-income homes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Exhibit D: health.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a report this week from the World Health Organisation, Britain faces a public health "time bomb."</seg>
<seg id="26">Obesity, female life expectancy and child mortality rates are among the worst in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="27">Again, the amount spent on public health care - which is roughly average for OECD countries - is not the problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">Much more fundamental is that a poor start to life will significantly impair later health outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some of the right things are being done to address these failings - in education and welfare in particular - but they are too slow, and insufficiently bold, to produce a meaningful turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="30">The result is that Britain is living on borrowed time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Yet much of the political debate remains mired in complete or positively harmful irrelevancies - price controls, windfall profit taxes, government support for a feel-good bounce in the housing market, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sad to say, we still have our heads buried in the sand over the supply-side revolution the UK so desperately needs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golden Eagle voted Scots" favourite wild animal</seg>
<seg id="2">THE iconic golden eagle has emerged as the clear nation's favourite in a competition run by Scottish Natural Heritage and VisitScotland to vote for Scotland's favourite wild animal.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bird of prey attracted almost twice as many votes as the red squirrel in second place with the red deer, otter and harbour seal taking the other top five places.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thousands of votes were recorded online following the campaign launch in the Spring and voting closed yesterday .</seg>
<seg id="5">Paul Wheelhouse, Scotland's Environment and Climate Change Minister, said: "While we can be enormously proud of all our native wildlife, it is fitting that the magnificent golden eagle has topped this poll of Scotland's "Big 5" species."</seg>
<seg id="6">At present Scotland is home to all of the UK's breeding pairs of golden eagles, and the species has done well to recover after almost being wiped out in the last two centuries.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, recent incidents have shown that the golden eagle is still threatened by illegal persecution in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have a responsibility to protect this wonderful bird so that future generations can continue to enjoy its presence in our skies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ian Jardine, the SNH chief executive said: "The response to the campaign has been brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of people have voted for their favourite from Scotland's Big 5 list.</seg>
<seg id="11">There have been several alternative lists put forward for seabirds, game animals, trees and plants, and support for rarer species like the pine marten and wildcat.</seg>
<seg id="12">It has got people thinking about and talking about wildlife, and showing how much affection and pride people have, not just for the five species on the list, but for Scottish wildlife generally.</seg>
<seg id="13">An SNH spokesman explained: "Through the partnership with SNH, VisitScotland promoted the campaign to millions of potential visitors and where best to see them in their natural environments."</seg>
<seg id="14">This saw all of Scotland's Big 5 championed through a series of billboard advertisements in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh.</seg>
<seg id="15">Alongside this, TV personality Neil Oliver lent his voice to an extensive radio campaign, with written press and online content specially developed throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, added: "We've been absolutely delighted with the response that Scotland's Big 5 campaign has received, and it has been a cornerstone of our celebrations for the Year of Natural Scotland 2013."</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the key pillars of the year was to get as many people here at home out seeing parts of Scotland that they may not have been to before, and the Big 5 campaign has given us a fantastic opportunity to promote even the most remote areas of our wonderful country.</seg>

<seg id="5">A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.</seg>

<seg id="12">She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom.</seg>

<seg id="1">Senate GOP blocks two Obama nominees</seg>
<seg id="2">Senate Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's nominees to lead an influential federal court and a housing agency on Thursday, despite Democratic warnings of a return to last summer's partisan brawl over who wields power in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="3">In rapid succession, Democrats failed to overcome GOP delaying tactics against Patricia Millett to join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Rep. Melvin Watt to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">The votes were 55-38 to free Millett's nomination for final passage and 56-42 for Watt's, but both fell short of the 60 votes needed to break the Republican procedural blockade.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Millett nomination was the flashpoint because the D.C. circuit court rules on federal agency and White House actions, and Millett's confirmation would have given that court's judges a 5-4 tilt toward those chosen by Democratic presidents.</seg>
<seg id="6">Appointments to that court, which currently has three vacant judgeships, are lifetime positions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Republicans argued that the D.C. court's workload was lighter than other districts and didn't merit an additional judge.</seg>
<seg id="8">They also said Democrats want to turn that court, considered second in power only to the Supreme Court, into a rubber stamp for Obama administration policies.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This is the court that can rule for or against the executive orders of this administration," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.</seg>
<seg id="10">We need to maintain checks and balances of the government.</seg>
<seg id="11">Democrats say caseload totals for the D.C. circuit are close to its 10-year average.</seg>
<seg id="12">They also say that when Republicans held the White House, they voted to fill the D.C. court's ninth seat with John Roberts, now the chief justice of the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="13">They also said GOP opposition to Millett is based strictly on politics and warned they might use their 55-45 Senate majority to weaken the Senate minority party's powers to block nominations.</seg>
<seg id="14">"If Republican senators are going to hold nominations hostage without consideration of individual merit, we will have drastic measures," said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last July, Democrats abandoned a threat to change Senate rules after Republicans agreed to supply enough votes for approval of several Obama nominations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Those included his choices to head the Environmental Protection Agency and the Labor Department.</seg>
<seg id="17">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., indicated that Democrats might not act immediately, saying, "I appreciate" a suggestion by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that the two parties talk about the next steps.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Always willing to do that," Reid said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Reid switched his vote to "no" on the roll calls for both Millett and Watt, a procedural move that gives him the right to force fresh votes on both nominees.</seg>
<seg id="20">Millett was an assistant solicitor general, representing the administration before the Supreme Court, under both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.</seg>
<seg id="21">She has argued 32 cases before the highest court.</seg>
<seg id="22">Obama has also nominated attorney Cornelia "Nina" Pillard and U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins to bring the court to its full strength of 11 judges, nominations that have yet to reach the full Senate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Republicans are backing a bill by Grassley and others to eliminate one of the D.C. court's 11 judgeships and transfer two others to districts with heavier workloads.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Federal Housing Finance Agency oversees government-owned mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</seg>
<seg id="25">Watt is a 21-year House veteran who has served his entire tenure on the House Financial Services Committee.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the housing agency, he would succeed acting director Edward DeMarco, a George W. Bush appointee criticized by Democrats for not letting Fannie and Freddie reduce principal costs for homeowners risking foreclosure.</seg>
<seg id="27">Democrats have praised Watt for having a pro-consumer record, including opposing risky Wall Street behavior that helped produce the 2008 financial industry collapse.</seg>
<seg id="28">He's won support from the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders.</seg>
<seg id="29">Republicans said Watt was short on technical expertise needed to oversee Fannie and Freddie and said he lacked political independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">He also faced opposition from the influential conservative groups Heritage Action for America and the Club for Growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">They warned Republicans that their votes on Watt would be counted in their ratings of 2014 candidates.</seg>

<seg id="6">JAMES Ashby's lawyers say his sexual harassment action against former Speaker Peter Slipper was denied procedural fairness-- and are fighting to have the case allowed its day in court.</seg>
<seg id="7">The pair have both appeared in Sydney's Federal Court flanked by family members, with an appeal hearing told the judge who threw the case out "failed to find facts."</seg>
<seg id="8">The case was thrown out of the Federal Court by Judge Stephen Rares last December, after six months of pre-trial hearings and a failed attempt at mediation, with the judgment saying Ashby had set out to destroy his former boss's reputation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ashby, who briefly worked for Slipper as a media advisor, said he had been sexually harassed by his boss and hundreds of text messages between the pair were revealed in court.</seg>
<seg id="10">Slipper, who has been supported in court by his wife Inge, resigned from his position as parliamentary speaker before the case was dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ashby's solicitor Michael Harmer has joined the appeal, after Judge Rares said he engaged in a conspiracy with his client and Slipper's political rival Mal Brough.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Harmer's lawyers say there is "no evidence whatsoever" to suggest the conspiratorial link between himself and Brough.</seg>
<seg id="13">Barrister Michael Lee SC said "not a jot of evidence" exists to prove Mr Harmer showed misconduct in his dealings in the case.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ashby, flanked by his parents Colleen and Darryl and spokesman Anthony McClellan is sitting on the opposite side of the courtroom to Mr Slipper.</seg>
<seg id="15">This appeal, before a full bench of the Federal Court, will determine if Mr Ashby's claims should be allowed to return to court for a hearing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.</seg>
<seg id="16">While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Double Down" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Possibly," Martin replied.</seg>

<seg id="9">One week before the shocking attack, Portelli, now aged 47, had threatened Charlotte O'Brien, aged 27, at her unit, forcing her to clamber out her bedroom window and jump fences to get away from him.</seg>
<seg id="10">About 4.30am on November 16 last year, Portelli was full of a cocktail of drugs - ice, cannabis, GHB and Zanax.</seg>
<seg id="11">He again visited Ms O'Brien's unit and, after asking for hug, slid one arm around her waist and the other around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="12">""You were not offering her affection," Justice Dixon said."</seg>
<seg id="13">Portelli then cut Ms O'Brien's throat with a razor blade.</seg>
<seg id="14">""She had no chance to avoid the attack," the judge said."</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite Ms O'Brien telling Portelli she was pregnant, he continued the attack by pushing a pillow on her face.</seg>
<seg id="16">""I'm sorry, I love you," he told her."</seg>
<seg id="17">He then grabbed a knife and cut the plucky Ms O'Brien again.</seg>
<seg id="18">She bit at his fingers and grabbed at the blade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms O'Brien feared she was going to die in a pool of blood and asked Portelli to cuddle her as she was cold and did not want to die alone.</seg>
<seg id="20">Portelli dozed off next to her.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he woke up, Ms O'Brien called 000.</seg>
<seg id="22">Armed with a knife in each hand, Portelli confronted arriving police and slid a knife across his own throat.</seg>
<seg id="23">He then burst through the security door and charged police.</seg>
<seg id="24">A male constable fired a shot at him and fell over backwards.</seg>
<seg id="25">A female senior constable then opened fire to protect her male colleague.</seg>
<seg id="26">With gunshot wounds to his right bicep and chest, Portelli retreated back inside the unit and, in a bizarre move, re-heated some Chinese takeaway while standing with a frying pan and three knives stuffed down his pants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He told Ms O'Brien, who'd lost two litres of blood, he was armed with the utensils so as to force the police "to go for a head shot.""</seg>
<seg id="28">Critical incident response team police stormed the unit about 11.30am and arrested him.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ms O'Brien, suffering near fatal injuries, and Portelli, with self-inflicted knife wounds and the gunshot injuries, were both taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Justice Dixon condemned the "savage" pre-planned attack."</seg>
<seg id="31">""Your assault was not a spontaneous reaction to rejection," Justice Dixon said."</seg>
<seg id="32">""This is the second occasion on which you have offended during a period of suspension of a term of imprisonment and the circumstances of each breach have involved offences of personal violence.</seg>
<seg id="33">This is a significant aggravated circumstance.</seg>
<seg id="34">Portelli pleaded guilty to intentionally causing serious injury and three counts of assaulting police.</seg>
<seg id="35">Justice Dixon sentenced him to a maximum term of 11 ½ years' jail with a minimum of eight years and three months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge rules in placement of boy who killed neo-Nazi dad</seg>
<seg id="2">The boy, dressed up for court with his unruly blond hair slicked down, whispered with his lawyer but showed no reaction when a judge decreed that he be confined to a juvenile lockdown facility for murdering his neo-Nazi father when he was 10.</seg>
<seg id="3">He is 13 now, but the case is still a source of anguish for those involved.</seg>
<seg id="4">The murder of an American Nazi</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's hard not to get attached to him," said Deputy District Attorney Michael Soccio, the veteran prosecutor who argued that a secure facility was preferable to a residential treatment center.</seg>
<seg id="6">He's so peculiar and yet charming and a lost soul.</seg>
<seg id="7">Following Thursday's decision, Soccio said he plans to visit the boy and try to help him to be "as undamaged as possible" when he gets out and faces life as an adult.</seg>
<seg id="8">The teen, neatly dressed in a vest and white shirt, peered at the judge's seven-page written ruling through thick eye glasses but his lawyer said he did not really comprehend it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the boy had anger issues well before his father become involved in white supremacist causes.</seg>
<seg id="10">At age 5 he stabbed a teacher with a pencil during his first day in kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also tried to strangle a teacher with a phone cord.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He was born with a very troubled spirit, a lot of anger," said Soccio.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was unable to control his anger from the time he was tiny.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBS station KCBS reports the boy had been living in the county's juvenile hall since the killing.</seg>
<seg id="15">He spent about three months at a state youth detention center, where he was evaluated to see whether a placement there could serve his needs.</seg>
<seg id="16">He attends class, gets regular therapy and has made progress in controlling the violent outbursts that got him kicked out of almost every school he attended.</seg>
<seg id="17">He has even, with time, won the affection of the prosecutor who got him convicted.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I enjoy watching him grow and change," Soccio told KCBS, "but I am convinced he has done better in a quasi-military penal environment."</seg>
<seg id="19">He seems to like it, he knows what the rules are and what is expected and he is treated with dignity.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judge who found him guilty of second-degree murder in January said she thought long and hard about the appropriate placement for him.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is an individual with exceptional needs," Judge Jean R. Leonard said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The boy shot his father, Jeffrey Hall, 32, at point-blank range as he slept off a night of drinking on a sofa in their home on May 1, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="23">In this Oct.</seg>

<seg id="26">The youth told police he was afraid he would have to choose between living with his father or stepmother if the couple divorced.</seg>
<seg id="27">The boy would have been sentenced to 40 years to life in prison had he been convicted as an adult, the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="28">The longest he can be held as a juvenile is until age 23, and he will become eligible for parole in seven years or less depending on good behavior.</seg>
<seg id="29">Defense attorney Punam Grewal, who fought for a less harsh confinement, said afterward: "This is a complete miscarriage of justice."</seg>
<seg id="30">She planned to appeal.</seg>
<seg id="31">She said the boy, whose name is not being used by The Associated Press because of his age, will be the youngest prisoner In the juvenile system and will have no opportunity for education because there is no middle school tutoring available.</seg>
<seg id="32">The boy has been held in state and county juvenile lockups since his arrest but he has felt unsafe there because of his age, his attorneys have said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Grewal said the boy called her two days earlier and asked: "Are things going to get better?'"</seg>
<seg id="34">"They will, but not right now," she replied.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."</seg>
<seg id="6">But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders are sceptical about this.</seg>
<seg id="17">Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.</seg>
<seg id="24">A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction."</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has always taken place.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.</seg>
<seg id="33">For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.</seg>
<seg id="35">Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="42">A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."</seg>
<seg id="43">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies."</seg>
<seg id="44">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="45">Nobody is fooled.</seg>

<seg id="1">New cases of deadly virus emerge in Middle East</seg>
<seg id="2">By Susanna Capelouto, CNN</seg>
<seg id="3">October 31, 2013 -- Updated 2206 GMT (0606 HKT)</seg>
<seg id="4">Four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome reported, with one person dead</seg>
<seg id="5">World Health Organization says first report of illness in Oman</seg>
<seg id="6">Investigation is ongoing on how the virus may have spread</seg>
<seg id="7">63 have died of virus which has been confirmed in 149 people in Middle East</seg>
<seg id="8">(CNN) -- Four more cases of a possibly fatal respiratory virus have been confirmed in Oman and Saudi Arabia, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">Three people in Eastern Saudi Arabia contracted the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and one of the patients has died, the WHO said.</seg>
<seg id="10">They ranged from 49 to 83 years old and all three had underlying medical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">The WHO is investigating what exposure might have caused their infections.</seg>
<seg id="12">The viral respiratory illness was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and since spread to at least four countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</seg>
<seg id="13">The WHO says it has confirmed the first case of the virus in Oman, where a 68-year-old man from Al Dahkliya region became ill October 26 and was hospitalized two days later.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since September of last year the WHO has confirmed 149 cases of MERS-CoV and 63 people have died from the illness.</seg>
<seg id="15">No cases have been identified in the U.S., according to the CDC, and it's believed the virus has spread through close contact with ill people.</seg>
<seg id="16">Symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and -- in severe cases -- renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome with shock.</seg>
<seg id="17">The WHO is asking member countries carefully review any case of severe acute respiratory infections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Contraceptive pill as popular as condoms among under-15s</seg>
<seg id="2">Paul Eastwood, who compiled the HSCIC report, said: "Our data only deals with people who are dealing with NHS community contraception clinics and it is important to recognise that contraception is also available via other methods such as a GP and many can now be bought over the counter."</seg>
<seg id="3">""One interesting fact was around the most popular method [of contraception].</seg>
<seg id="4">Last year it was 15 year olds where oral contraception became the most popular, this year it is more popular for under-15s as well.""</seg>
<seg id="5">The report also exposed a wide variation in the use of contraceptives across the countries, with the popularity of different methods varying around the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the West Midlands and Yorkshire, for example, one in four women opted to use condoms but in the South West the figure was just one in seven.</seg>
<seg id="7">The contraceptive pill was more commonly used in the south of the country, accounting for more than half of all visits to clinics in the South Central, South East and East of England regions, whereas in Yorkshire and the North East it was used by four in ten women.</seg>
<seg id="8">Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), such as implants, continued to become more popular in all age groups last year with almost one in three women who visit clinics now requesting them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their use across the country also varied, however, with 43 per cent of women in the North East asking for LARCs compared with just 23 per cent in the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="10">Across all age groups some 2.3 million people used NHS contraceptive clinics, a drop of 194,000 or eight per cent compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"A Department of Health spokesman said: "Contraception is the best way to avoid unintended pregnancy and STIs and we're pleased to see that there were more than two million attendances at these services last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Teenage pregnancies are at their lowest level for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">A minority of under 16s are sexually active, and it is important that they get good advice about contraception and preventing STIs and discuss issues around coercion and abuse.</seg>

<seg id="1">$325m rescue package for Tassie health</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state," Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.</seg>
<seg id="7">An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.</seg>
<seg id="8">There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little "unless it's followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing."</seg>
<seg id="14">He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list," Mr Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash</seg>
<seg id="2">With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
<seg id="7">After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="3">Death rates from prostate cancer in Scotland have fallen by 18% in the past 20 years, according to figures compiled by a leading charity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cancer Research UK (CRUK) said the downward trend is largely the result of new approaches to treating the cancer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Each year 2,700 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="6">From a peak in the early 1990s when there were about 29 deaths per 100,000 men in the population, there are now about 24 deaths per 100,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charity said the improved treatment includes earlier and more widespread use of hormone therapy, radical surgery and radiotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also cited earlier diagnosis linked to the use of the PSA test.</seg>
<seg id="9">Prof Hing Leung of CRUK, who is based at the Beatson Institute in Glasgow, said: "This new report shows we've come a long way in improving the treatment of prostate cancer in the last couple of decades."</seg>
<seg id="10">And improvements in how we treat prostate cancer have been key to reducing deaths of men diagnosed with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="11">""But a lot more work still needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="12">Martin Ledwick, CRUK's head information nurse, said: "The symptoms for prostate cancer are similar to a number of benign and harmless conditions but it's worth being aware of them and getting anything unusual checked out with your GP."</seg>
<seg id="13">""Things such as having to rush to the toilet to pass urine and difficulty urinating should be checked out, especially if it's getting you up several times during the night.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's also worth remembering prostate cancer is more common in men over the age 60, anyone who has had a relative diagnosed with the disease and men of African-Caribbean descent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Analysis: Aquino's Mr Clean image skewered by Philippine pork barrel politics</seg>
<seg id="2">By Manuel Mogato</seg>
<seg id="3">MANILA (Reuters) - A scandal over lawmakers' misuse of public funds has become the biggest crisis of Philippine President Benigno Aquino's three-year rule, tainting his carefully crafted image as a corruption fighter and undermining his ability to push economic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aquino has struggled to keep the scandal at arms length since late July, when a whistleblower revealed that some lawmakers, including the president's allies, were stealing up to half the money being allocated to local projects from discretionary government funds.</seg>
<seg id="5">While corruption allegations are far from new in the Philippines, the revelations have struck a chord with Filipinos because of the scale of the wrongdoing and the shock that little had changed despite Aquino's reform drive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Aquino, the only son of democracy icon and former president Corazon Aquino, has tried to tap into the public mood by saying he too is outraged by the corruption, which was corroborated in a detailed report by the state auditing body.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the allegations have drawn closer to the presidency, suggesting Aquino has failed to convincingly tackle a culture of political patronage that centers on the $586 million Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), widely known as the "pork barrel."</seg>
<seg id="8">His popularity rating plunged by 15 points in a recent opinion survey to 49 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">The focus has now shifted to a separate development fund set up quietly in 2011 by Aquino's administration, the Disbursement Acceleration Program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among its disbursements were transfers totaling 1.1 billion pesos ($25.5 million) to 18 senators last year after they voted to impeach the Supreme Court chief justice, who was seen as an Aquino rival.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aquino has vehemently denied allegations this amounted to political bribery, accusing his opponents of trying to distract attention from the real scandal.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have never stolen.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am not a thief.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I am the one who goes after thieves," Aquino said in a national television address on Wednesday night to explain his position.</seg>
<seg id="15">Aquino, 53, won office on a platform of curbing the corruption that has drained government coffers and entrenched poverty in the Philippines, a country of 97 million people.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since then the Philippines has recorded strong growth, improved its public finances and been awarded investment grade ratings, partly dispelling its "sick man of Asia" reputation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Investors cite the anti-corruption drive as an important reason for the growing belief the rebound is sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, the Philippines' position on Transparency International's corruption perceptions index has improved, rising to 105th out of 176 countries and territories last year from 129th in 2011, overtaking Indonesia and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id="19">A higher ranking means a cleaner public sector.</seg>
<seg id="20">Aquino said in July that the country loses 200 billion pesos a year to corruption, or about 1.8 percent of economic output.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The mistrust will affect confidence, and confidence affects investors' perception," said Astro del Castillo, managing director of Manila-based investment house First Grade Finance Inc.</seg>
<seg id="22">The president has taken a tough line on tax evaders and launched criminal cases against former officials, including his predecessor Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, her family and allies.</seg>
<seg id="23">Aquino led efforts to remove the head of the anti-graft agency on allegations of corruption while the anti-corruption agency ombudsman filed graft charges against police generals over the inflated price paid for helicopters and the fake repair of armored vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the current scandal shows how discretionary funds are a crucial mechanism for controlling the two-chamber Congress in a country where party loyalties are weak.</seg>
<seg id="25">After initially resisting calls for "pork barrel" reform, Aquino announced in August that he would abolish for next year the PDAF of 70 million pesos for each lower-house member and 200 million pesos for each senator, a total of 25.2 billion pesos ($586 million).</seg>
<seg id="26">The funds are meant for local development projects such as schools, health centers and road construction, as well as for the distribution of medicine and fertilizer.</seg>
<seg id="27">The abolition of the fund could severely inhibit Aquino's ability to push through reforms such as a planned increase in mining taxes seen as crucial to attract investment into the moribund sector.</seg>
<seg id="28">It could also delay implementation of a complex peace deal to end a long-running Muslim rebellion in the resource-rich south.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The executive needs the pork as badly as the legislature because the executive needs laws to be passed; he needs elbow room to convince these legislators," Leonor Briones, a former national treasurer, told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Filipinos were shocked by media accounts of the opulent lifestyle of the woman who is suspected of running a massive kickback scheme for lawmakers.</seg>
<seg id="31">Janet Lim Napoles, the wife of a former Marine major, has been accused by the Department of Justice of setting up fake non-government organizations that since 2007 received lawmakers' pork barrel funds and then routed the money back to them.</seg>
<seg id="32">The whistleblower, a former associate of Napoles, testified to the Senate in a public hearing that the businesswoman received so much cash she would stash it in the bathtub of her luxury Manila home.</seg>
<seg id="33">Napoles was arrested and charged with plunder in September, along with 30 others including three senators and five former congress members.</seg>
<seg id="34">Before her arrest, Napoles denied involvement in the scheme and said her wealth came from her family's investments in coal mining in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The accusations that Aquino himself used public funds to buy off senators has forced him on the defensive and distracted him from his economic agenda.</seg>
<seg id="36">Last week, he reorganized his communications staff and reduced the exposure of two spokespersons who had struggled to deal with the media.</seg>
<seg id="37">The scandal has also sharpened questions over how much Aquino has achieved since he took power in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="38">Despite investigating hundreds of tax evasion and smuggling cases, his government has yet to win a single conviction.</seg>
<seg id="39">Critics say Aquino has failed to support reform measures to reduce the influence of money politics, such as the pending anti-graft Freedom of Information Act.</seg>
<seg id="40">They also say his efforts have targeted political foes far more than allies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This perception endangers what gains he has made in the past three years and curbs the potential for any sustained gains in the long-term fight against corruption," said Mars Buan, senior analyst at Pacific Strategies and Assessments in Manila.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar</seg>
<seg id="2">English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="3">The exam will also feature "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading;</seg>
<seg id="4">A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped.</seg>
<seg id="5">From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will make changes in other core subjects next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.</seg>
<seg id="9">Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a "widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."</seg>
<seg id="10">Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="12">While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.</seg>
<seg id="13">The syllabus will place a greater focus on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ricky Ponting calls destroyer Kevin Pietersen the key to the Ashes and 'a prototype' for Aussie players</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, centre, talks with England's Kevin Pietersen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Tom Hevezi.</seg>
<seg id="4">RICKY Ponting believes England talisman Kevin Pietersen is the prototype for Australia's Test rebuild and key obstacle to Ashes redemption.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Ponting says former Test skipper Mark Taylor isn't blameless in Australia's Test decline following a tumultuous week promoting his autobiography At the Close of Play.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ponting was stung by respected statesman Taylor's criticism of typically honest appraisals of Cricket Australia and Clarke's leadership in a comprehensive review of his extraordinary 168-Test, 20-year career.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ponting, 38, notes Taylor was on Cricket Australia board during a period from 2004 where stewardship of the game stagnated and the Argus Review misfired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Interestingly, Mark was probably on the board when I was pushing for a lot of these things to change and they didn't," said Ponting who wished his heartfelt recommendations to the Argus review were more closely considered.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am not saying things for book sales.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ponting believes his perceived criticism of Clarke's leadership input and dressing room presence have been distorted.</seg>
<seg id="11">He contacted Clarke this week, determined that Australia's Ashes preparation won't be compromised and, significantly, offered any hands-on assistance required.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's important for me he has a clear head going into the Ashes.</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to be around to help all the boys in the side.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I am not trying to assassinate anybody," said Ponting of successor Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ricky Ponting looks on as Kevin Pietersen scores another boundary.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a couple of weeks all the negatives will be gone and we can focus on winning an Ashes series.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, to avoid a fourth consecutive Ashes loss Australia must believe and be bold in the mould of Pietersen.</seg>
<seg id="18">England's middle-order destroyer is set to play his 100th Test in the series opener at the Gabba.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Pietersen is the key, loves the big stage, has the confidence to go out and win, play according to the situation in the game and that is the confidence we have still to instil in our young blokes," said Ponting who struck an incredible 13,378 Test runs at 51.8 before retiring last December.</seg>
<seg id="20">South African-born Pietersen's absolute aggression reminds Ponting of a psyche common among the greats of Australia's golden era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pietersen has 23 Test tons but it was his maiden 158 at The Oval that derailed Ponting's champion side containing leg-spin great Shane Warne in England's famed 2005 Ashes ambush.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They have to go out and back themselves, skills, no matter who is bowling at them," said Ponting, also backing George Bailey to fill Australia's vacant No.6 Test lot having "not put a foot wrong" as limited overs captain.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what the great teams had, that is what Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist and Damien Martyn had.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cricket Australia bowling coach Craig McDermott gives an update on the nations fast bowling stocks.</seg>
<seg id="25">CA boss James Sutherland this week hit back at claims by Ponting that Australia had underinvested in the game citing a $36 million increase in the high performance budget during his 2003-10 Test captaincy.</seg>
<seg id="26">They were always going to bring figures to back up their points.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The expenditure on the team went up but I would like to see where that was spent," Ponting told The Advertiser.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ponting suspects the high performance spend was well intentioned but misguided.</seg>
<seg id="29">I know we had added staff but we certainly didn't have added coaches.</seg>
<seg id="30">"High performance for me in cricket is about scoring runs, taking wickets and holding catches," said Ponting, with 48 wins in 77 Tests commanding Australia.</seg>
<seg id="31">I am not sure the right money was spent on the right people.</seg>
<seg id="32">""Even around the Centre of Excellence ...</seg>
<seg id="33">I don't think that has run at its optimum for the last 10-12 years.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think to be totally honest they just missed the boat at the really important time when everyone was trying to catch up with us.</seg>
<seg id="35">Ponting is frustrated England pilfered Australia's pioneering blueprint for world domination and bettered it from the grass roots up.</seg>
<seg id="36">Australia lagged in appointing a bowling coach until enticing Troy Cooley back from England in 2006 in the aftermath of Ashes defeat.</seg>
<seg id="37">Justin Langer was belatedly appointed batting coach in November 2009 after Australia again relinquished the Ashes in England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The thing I am most disappointed about is their whole model was based on what we had here in Australia and they had a little bit bigger and better than ours," he said.</seg>
<seg id="39">However Ponting credited CA with the appointment of head coach Darren Lehmann to replace South African Mickey Arthur in the fall-out of poor results and team discipline issues last June.</seg>
<seg id="40">"I believe he's exactly the sort of person we need back around Australian cricket, I love seeing those hard-nosed experienced players being involved again," said Ponting of former Test teammate Lehmann.</seg>
<seg id="41">Get that Australian way of playing back, playing on the edge, being aggressive, taking every situation on.That is what we hope these young guys can bring to the table in the near future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Holiday Reindeer Meat Sales Bring Protests Against "Eating Rudolph"</seg>
<seg id="2">Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="3">A supermarket chain in Britain intends to sell reindeer meat for the holiday season, although some object that the idea of "eating Rudolph" violates the Christmas spirit.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Lidl chain, which has 600 stores in Britain, said they tried out deluxe diced Siberian reindeer meat in 2010 and quickly sold out, with most stores selling all their reindeer within a week.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The demand from our customers has been huge," Clare Norman, a PR manager for Lidl, told ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="6">We aim to offer our customers a wide variety of traditional Christmas products, as well as those they may not have had the opportunity to try before.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reindeer meat sells for £7.99 for 500 grams, or about $12.80 for 17.6 ounces of meat.</seg>
<seg id="8">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, howver, argue that eating reindeer at Christmas goes against the spirit of the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="9">"No one likes the idea of eating Rudolph at Christmas," said Ben Williamson, a spokesman for PETA.</seg>
<seg id="10">The charity group Viva! has also spoken out against Lidl's campaign.</seg>
<seg id="11">While eating reindeer is not uncommon in parts of the world, Justin Kerswell, Viva!"s campaigns manager, says that it's not just the spirit of Christmas that is being damaged by the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Apart from the significant welfare issues around industrialized reindeer production, you can now add the systematic destruction of wild animals, such as wolves, to protect commercial reindeer herds," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Kerswell, bears as well as endangered wolves are shot in order to protect reindeer herds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Norman at Lidl denied reindeer sales hurt the environment.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We only source products that meet our high standards of food safety, hygiene and animal welfare while never compromising on quality," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Norman said that Lidl's reindeer come from one of the world's largest herds in Siberia, "herded by indigenous nomad-farmers with reindeer farming playing an enormous cultural and economical part in the lives of the people in this region."</seg>
<seg id="17">Reindeer will be hitting Lidl's shelves on Nov.7.</seg>

<seg id="9">Rachel Poole, 31, was talking to her husband, Justin Pele Poole on FaceTime Wednesday night when a man identified as 19-year-old Corey Moss broke into their El Paso home and lunged at her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an arrest affidavit obtained by KFOX14, Mrs Poole recognized her assailant as a man who owed her husband money and screamed out his name.</seg>

<seg id="14">The couple plan to name her Isabella.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to police, the wounded victim was able to call 911 and give the name of the suspect to police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Justin Poele called the 19-year-old's co-workers, who helped apprehend Moss and seized the knife allegedly used in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suspect: Cory Bernard Moss, 19, allegedly admitted to the knife attack, which was reportedly sparked by a money dispute</seg>
<seg id="18">Following his arrest, police said Moss admitted to stabbing Rachel Poole</seg>
<seg id="19">The teenager has been charged with criminal attempted capital murder and was ordered held on $60,000 bond.</seg>

<seg id="24">Joy and sorrow: Mr Poole (top right) wrote that their unborn baby girl (bottom right) is doing fine, but his wife (left) had lost an eye</seg>
<seg id="25">A short time later, police say Moss came out of hiding and surprised Rachel Poole from behind, repeatedly stabbing her with a stainless steel knife and beating her.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the affidavit, the victim instantly recognized Moss as her husband's debtor and yelled out his name several times so Justin could hear it over the phone.</seg>
<seg id="27">Following the attack, police say Moss fled and called a co-worker to pick him up and drive him to Fort Bliss.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Justine Pele Poole called Moss' colleagues to tell them about the stabbing and alert the suspect's imminent return to the base.</seg>
<seg id="29">The 19-year-old's co-workers intercepted him and found the knife in the car where he was riding.</seg>

<seg id="2">BOMBINGS and shootings around Iraq have killed 22 people and wounded more than 50.</seg>
<seg id="3">The attacks in Shiite neighbourhoods and on security forces underscore how deadly Iraq remains, even though violence has dropped dramatically since a few years ago when the country appeared about to descend into civil war.</seg>
<seg id="4">Over the past month, more than 200 Iraqis have been killed in attacks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The latest deadliest strike came about 9.30am local time in the Shiite Muslim neighbourhood of Washash in western Baghdad, where eyewitnesses said a taxi exploded outside a local market.</seg>

<seg id="7">Bombings generally are a hallmark of Sunni Muslim insurgents linked to al-Qaeda, and Shiites remain one of their main targets.</seg>
<seg id="8">Baghdad operations command spokesman Colonel Dhia al-Wakil said no overall conclusion about Iraq's security can be drawn from the overnight attacks, which he said are believed to be unrelated.</seg>
<seg id="9">He described Iraq's security as "generally stable, and these attacks by no means should be taken as an indication that the terrorists are able to defy our security forces."</seg>

<seg id="11">While violence has dramatically dropped from the wide scale sectarian fighting between 2006 and 2008, deadly bombings and shootings in Iraq still happen almost every day.</seg>
<seg id="12">The recent increase in attacks comes as the government is embroiled in a months-long political crisis in Iraq that has Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds calling for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to resign for sidelining his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Texas can enforce its new restrictive abortion law while it is appealed, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday as it overturned a lower court order.</seg>
<seg id="3">The three-judge panel granted Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott's request to lift an injunction that kept the state from enforcing a requirement that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic, The Dallas Morning News reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel ruled Monday that the requirement was so onerous it would keep many women from having abortions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The American Civil Liberties Union promised the legal fight against the Texas law will continue.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The result of this ruling is not academic," said Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">Women in many parts of the state will lose access to care they count on because clinics will close.</seg>
<seg id="8">If the State of Texas cares about women's health and safety, as it claims, it should take steps to reduce the need for abortion rather than closing clinics in already underserved parts of the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The appeals court did not deal with another section of the law that Yeakel largely upheld involving the protocol for medically induced abortions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Texas officials argue that the stricter abortion law protects the health of women seeking abortions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moment sham marriage suspect is led to police van just minutes before he was due to wed Czech woman at registry office</seg>
<seg id="2">27-year-old Pakistani man was about to wed a 25-year-old Czech woman</seg>
<seg id="3">Immigration officers stopped the ceremony at a registry office in King George's Hall, Blackburn, Lancashire at 10.30am on Thursday</seg>
<seg id="4">Man found to be in the country illegally after over-staying a student visa</seg>
<seg id="5">Two days earlier another man, 26, was arrested in similar circumstances</seg>
<seg id="6">Both now set to be deported back to Pakistan</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the moment a sham marriage suspect was arrested only seconds before he was due to walk down the aisle with an Eastern European woman.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 27-year-old Pakistani man was about to wed a 25-year-old Czech woman at a registry office located in King George's Hall, Blackburn, Lancashire, the Home Office has said.</seg>
<seg id="9">It added that two immigration enforcement officers, acting on information the relationship may not be genuine, arrived at the venue 10.30am on Thursday - just as the ceremony was about to take place.</seg>
<seg id="10">Arrest: A 27-year-old Pakistani man was detained by police outside King George's Hall in Blackburn, Lancashire</seg>
<seg id="11">The man was arrested and checks revealed he was in the country illegally having over-stayed his student visa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The woman he had been due to marry was interviewed by officers and later released.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Home Office also said that two days earlier another suspected sham marriage was prevented in a second raid.</seg>
<seg id="14">Officers arrested a 26-year-old-man who was in the country illegally having also overstayed his student visa.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was due to marry a 18-year-old Latvian woman.</seg>

<seg id="19">Measures outlined in the Immigration Bill include extending the marriage and civil penalty notice period to 28 days in England and Wales, and 70 days in some circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="20">We are determined to stop migrants abusing the marriage system to cheat immigration rules</seg>
<seg id="21">This will give our officers and registrars more time to investigate, prosecute and remove those attempting to stage sham marriages</seg>
<seg id="22">A sham marriage or civil partnership typically occurs when a non-European national marries someone from the European Economic Area as a means of attempting to gain long-term residency and the right to work and claim benefits in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="23">A crackdown on the problem has been launched after a number of high profile cases, including large scale sham marriage rings operating in Accrington and Blackburn, were revealed by police.</seg>

<seg id="4">THERE is no such thing as a certainty in racing - unless it was Black Caviar.</seg>
<seg id="5">At least that is what rivals to the Chris Waller-trained Zoustar are hoping going into the Group 1 $500,000 Coolmore Stud Stakes (1200m) at Flemington today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Zoustar, Sydney's super colt, is the shortest-favourite on Derby Day at $1.85 favourite and so dominates betting that it is $9.50 or longer odds for the rest of the field.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Hall of Famer John Hawkes, who co-trains promising Not Listenin'tome, doesn't believe Zoustar has a mortgage on the race.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Zoustar is a very nice horse but they are all beatable," Hawkes said."</seg>
<seg id="9">""It all depends on how they turn up on the day.</seg>
<seg id="10">Every horse can have a good day or an 'off' day.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are not machines.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chris Waller-trained Zoustar has a nibble on some trees at Flemington.</seg>
<seg id="13">Picture: Colleen Petch.</seg>
<seg id="14">Look, he is probably too good but stranger things have happened.</seg>
<seg id="15">""You have got to be in it to win it."</seg>
<seg id="16">Not Listenin'tome won his first two starts brilliantly at Bendigo and Ballarat then was given his chance at stakes level last week when narrowly beaten by Thermal Current in the Telstra Stakes at Moonee Valley.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hawkes saw enough in Not Listenin'tome's defeat to give him a chance in the Group 1 Coolmore Stud Stakes.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He probably should have won but he still ran very well," Hawkes said."</seg>
<seg id="19">""He should develop into a very nice horse.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is his first race preparation so he has done a very good job but he will comeback a better horse in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But he will run well (today) no matter what.""</seg>
<seg id="22">Waller said Zoustar has benefited from two hit-outs along the Flemington straight and is approaching today's race with justifiable confidence.</seg>
<seg id="23">Chris Waller chats with Francesca Cumani at his Flemington stables.</seg>
<seg id="24">""The straight is always a problem for any horse going there for the first time but I think we are lucky now that they appear to all come up as one group," he said."</seg>
<seg id="25">""He only needs to bring his form from Sydney and I am sure he is the horse to beat."</seg>
<seg id="26">Waller wants to take Zoustar to Royal Ascot next year so he will be watching closely how the colt performs under race-day pressure along in the straight course.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I think this race is a great test for (Royal) Ascot, or any of the tough European tracks, where you need to run up the straight and need to be strong," Waller said."</seg>
<seg id="28">""Obviously it is every trainer, jockey and owner's dream to get over there and if we get our chance next year I would be willing to take Zoustar.""</seg>
<seg id="29">""I guess he is the best young horse I have trained, he is certainly the most valuable at this stage of his career and he looks untapped."</seg>

<seg id="1">Firefighters to stage strike ahead of Bonfire Night</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 03:01</seg>
<seg id="3">Firefighters in England and Wales are set to stage a fresh strike in a row with the government over pension ages.</seg>
<seg id="4">Members of the Fire Brigades Union will walk out between 18:30 and 23:00 GMT on Friday and for two hours on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a result, fire chiefs urged people to put back any domestic firework displays to Saturday or go to an organised event.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ministers described the union action as completely unnecessary and damaging to the reputation of firefighters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Way forward</seg>
<seg id="8">The latest action comes after a four-hour stoppage in October, followed by an abandoned strike when an agreement to the dispute was anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="9">The union wants assurances about terms of employment after government plans to raise the retirement age for firefighters from 55 to 60.</seg>
<seg id="10">FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "It is ludicrous that after two years of negotiations the government has still not sorted out this mess.</seg>
<seg id="11">Firefighters are keen for these issues to be resolved through discussion, but the government won't even listen to its own evidence, which highlights that the schemes are unworkable and unaffordable.</seg>
<seg id="12">Firefighters want a pension scheme that takes account of the hazardous nature of the job, is affordable, and workable for them and for the taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="13">We hope this brief strike will mean the government returns to negotiations so we can agree a sensible way forward.</seg>
<seg id="14">The FBU said it had timed the strike to avoid Bonfire Night and the Saturdays either side.</seg>
<seg id="15">Severely depleted</seg>
<seg id="16">London Fire Brigade said Friday was likely to be one of its busiest days of the year, ahead of Bonfire Night on Tuesday and Diwali on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="17">London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: "Serious emergencies will be attended but smaller incidents won't, so we are calling on the public not to put themselves at risk by lighting fireworks and bonfires."</seg>
<seg id="18">South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said its emergency response would be "severely depleted."</seg>
<seg id="19">Fire Minister Brandon Lewis said: "We offered firefighters similar fitness principles to those the FBU accepted in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="20">The FBU should reconsider their decision to strike, announced just four days into discussions, and work for a resolution to this dispute.</seg>
<seg id="21">The public will be baffled by the FBU's course of action when they hear that the deal being offered to firefighters gives them one of the most generous pension schemes in all the public sector.</seg>
<seg id="22">Industrial action has been avoided in Scotland through talks with the Scottish government although there is no final agreement in place as yet.</seg>

<seg id="1">'DO HIS PHONE': What Andy Coulson told senior journalist Ian Edmondson over Calum Best exclusive, hacking trial told</seg>
<seg id="2">Andy Coulson, the former editor of the News of the World, told a senior colleague who was investigating the celebrity Calum Best to "Do his phone," the phone hacking trial was told today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A jury at the Old Bailey heard that victims of hacking by the newspaper had included a long list of famous figures including Sienna Miller, Jude Law, politicians Lord Archer, Nigel Farage and Mark Oaten, pop singer Kerry Katona and various individuals connected to the Royal family including spokesman Paddy Harverson, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, a private secretary to Princes William and Harry, and Tom Parker-Bowles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Coulson, another former NotW editor Rebekah Brooks, former managing editor Stuart Kuttner and former news editor Ian Edmondson all deny charges of conspiring to unlawfully intercept communications.</seg>
<seg id="5">Andrew Edis QC, for the prosecution, said the newspaper had in 2006 targeted Calum Best, son of the late Manchester United star George Best, because he was "thought at the time to be the father of a child that was about to be born."</seg>
<seg id="6">The prosecution produced a series of emails between Mr Coulson, the editor, and Mr Edmondson, news editor on the paper, in which the pair discussed the possibility that they might lose a possible exclusive story.</seg>
<seg id="7">"You think Calum a leak?" asked the editor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Edmondson referred to the paper's informant as "a nightmare" and said that Calum Best had been "bragging" he had friends inside the paper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Do his phone," Mr Coulson replied.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Edis said that these three words were very significant and told jurors they would have to weigh up what he meant.</seg>
<seg id="11">Earlier he told the court how Mr Coulson had confronted the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke over a false rumour that he had been having an affair.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Edis showed the jury an email written to Mr Coulson and his deputy Neil Wallis in 2005 by Jules Stenson, features editor of the paper.</seg>
<seg id="13">It referred to "a tip that Home Secretary Charles Clarke is having an affair with his blonde, attractive special adviser Hannah Pawlby."</seg>
<seg id="14">He got this from a Westminster insider who fancied Pawlby, was going to ask her out and was told 'Don't bother wasting your time - she's with Charles.</seg>
<seg id="15">The email continued that the paper's news desk had, separately from the features desk, "been working on this for a while."</seg>
<seg id="16">The prosecution said that Ms Pawlby had been targeted by the NotW's phone-hacking specialist Glenn Mulcaire in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mulcaire had listed in his notebooks details relating to Pawlby and her family and neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="18">"That is a task which was designed to lead to the investigation of this rumour," said Mr Edis.</seg>
<seg id="19">The chief prosecution counsel said to the jury: "Was Mr Coulson involved in this, yes he was!" he then described how Mr Coulson had contacted Ms Pawlby to tell her that "I have got a story that we are planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."</seg>
<seg id="20">I wouldn't do this in the normal course of events but it's quite a serious story.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr Edis said that Mr Coulson had a role in the production of NotW investigations.</seg>
<seg id="22">He's the man who comes to put the story to them to see what they say, hoping they will say something that confirms it and that allows him to put it in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="23">He added: "They're all working as a team aren't they, isn't that the point?"</seg>
<seg id="24">And he's the boss of the team.</seg>
<seg id="25">The prosecution said that no story had been run because there was no affair.</seg>
<seg id="26">The court heard of the wide range of the paper's hacking victims.</seg>
<seg id="27">One target was a hairdresser called Laura Rooney, who the paper wrongly assumed to be a relative of the footballer Wayne Rooney.</seg>
<seg id="28">"That just shows the slightly random way this works," said Mr Edis.</seg>
<seg id="29">She's a hairdresser who does not know Wayne Rooney but finds herself investigated just in case she did.</seg>
<seg id="30">Before he read out a long list of high profile hacking victims, Mr Edis said that phone hacking was not always the source of a story but was a technique often used in conjunction with other investigative methods, including surveillance and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="31">The involvement of phone hacking in the investigation process, he said, amounted to a "perfectly rational but entirely illegal system."</seg>
<seg id="32">The case is expected to continue until next Easter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Secular Turkish Government Permits Religious Symbol</seg>
<seg id="2">Adem Altan/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="3">Nurcan Dalbudak, center, was greeted by her fellow lawmakers on Thursday, when a ban on wearing Islamic head scarves in the Parliament was lifted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three other women also wore scarves.</seg>
<seg id="5">ANKARA, Turkey - Before Thursday, the last time a female lawmaker entered Turkey's Parliament wearing an Islamic head scarf was in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was taunted, expelled from the building and later stripped of her Turkish citizenship after it was revealed that she also carried an American passport.</seg>
<seg id="7">But today there is a different Turkey, reshaped over a decade of governing by the Justice and Development Party, which has its roots in political Islam, and so when four of the party's female members entered the Assembly on Thursday wearing head scarves they were largely accepted, even as it represented, for some, an unwelcome break with Turkey's secular traditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">For many others, inclined to see the issue as one of personal freedoms, it was an important marker of Turkey's maturing democracy.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the session, Mevlut Cavusoglu, a senior lawmaker in the governing party, sat in a garden outside Parliament and said, simply, "This is democracy."</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier, Gulay Samanci, a member of Parliament from Konya, a religiously conservative town in central Turkey, had walked into the Assembly, watched by a horde of Turkish journalists, wearing a black-and-white silk scarf on her head and was greeted by colleagues with hugs, kisses, handshakes and the snapping of cellphone cameras.</seg>
<seg id="11">The issue has long been a divisive one in Turkish society, pitting secularists versus Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the entrance of female lawmakers wearing head scarves on Thursday was seen as a milestone for Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it underscored the depth of change within the society over the last 10 years under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an Islamist leader whose party, known by its Turkish initials A.K.P., has sought to allow a great role for religion in the public sphere.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lifting of the head scarf ban was part of a package of democratic changes Mr. Erdogan unveiled in September.</seg>
<seg id="15">While some opposition lawmakers from the secular Republican People's Party, or C.H.P., expressed opposition, much of the Turkish public seems ready to move beyond the issue: More than 70 percent of the public, in an October survey, supported lifting the ban, according to Ozer Sencar, the director of Metropoll, an Ankara-based polling firm.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It's an unnecessary and useless debate," said Saban Kardas, a professor at Ankara's University of Economics and Technology.</seg>
<seg id="17">C.H.P. is digging itself deeper.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Last weekend, I was at a wedding and the bride was wearing a head scarf and the witness was wearing modern dress and a short skirt," Dr. Kardas added.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is modern Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="20">Still, some lawmakers protested: one female member of C.H.P. wore a T-shirt that bore the face of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and imposed a secular system.</seg>
<seg id="21">Another C.H.P. member made a different argument: that the head scarf issue, while portrayed by the governing party as an advancement for individual liberties, has served to mask a spotty record on women's rights.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I expect them to explain why my country is 120th in a global ranking on women's rights," the lawmaker, Safak Pavey, said in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="23">She added, "The greatest insurance for religious freedom is not about controlling our future with religious guidance but providing flawless secularism."</seg>
<seg id="24">The ban on head scarves in Parliament was not enshrined in law but part of the Assembly's traditional dress code.</seg>
<seg id="25">The code also bans pants for women.</seg>
<seg id="26">The lifting of the head scarf ban comes at a time of deep polarization here, even if the country is not as divided as it once was over the matter of female dress.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those divisions - between the rural, pious classes and a more secular urban elite - were laid bare by violent protests that began in May in Istanbul and swept across the country.</seg>
<seg id="28">The protests represented the most severe political crisis faced by Mr. Erdogan in his decade in office, and highlighted the degree of anger against his style, which a growing number of Turks view as authoritarian.</seg>
<seg id="29">While advancing democracy on a number of counts - including overcoming a history of coups by securing civilian authority over the military - he has alienated a significant segment of the population by telling women how many children they should have (sometimes it is three, sometimes five), and involving himself personally in controversial urban development projects in Istanbul, the original catalyst for the protests.</seg>
<seg id="30">Still, Mr. Erdogan, who maintained his core constituency of religious conservatives, who make up about half the electorate, emerged from the protest crisis with much of his domestic power intact, even as his image was tarnished abroad.</seg>
<seg id="31">The C.H.P. chairman, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said the lifting of the head scarf ban was timed by Mr. Erdogan to rally his base before an election cycle that will begin in the spring with a vote for municipal leaders, followed by a presidential election in the summer and end in 2015 with parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="32">Outside Parliament on Thursday afternoon, Nurcan Dalbudak, an A.K.P. lawmaker, cast it in different terms.</seg>
<seg id="33">"There is no longer this issue in Turkey, it has been excluded from the agenda," she said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today is a historical, beautiful day.</seg>

<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Protesters gathered outside as former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney spoke in Toronto Thursday, calling him a war criminal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cheney addressed the Toronto Global Forum hosted by the International Economic Forum of the Americas.</seg>

<seg id="5">Before Cheney's arrival, Lawyers Against the War, a group based in Canada, asked the Toronto police chief to arrest him as a war criminal, Canada.com reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">Protesters outside made the same point.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is a shame he is here," James Campbell told the Star.</seg>
<seg id="8">Canada is aiding and abetting all of Dick Cheney's crimes by letting him speak here.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cheney was clearly aware of his reputation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Welcomed With Kisses, Stanford Freshmen Risk the "Kissing Disease"</seg>
<seg id="2">STANFORD, Calif. - It is minutes to midnight.</seg>
<seg id="3">A sultry full moon hangs over Stanford's Memorial Church, bathing the campus's red roofs and adobe-toned walls.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Quad, thousands of students mill around, some bobbing drunkenly, some giggling nervously, most of them wearing clothes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Finally, a male senior saunters over to a group of the youngest-looking women and asks: "Hey!"</seg>
<seg id="6">You freshmen?</seg>
<seg id="7">Can I kiss you?</seg>
<seg id="8">As the Stanford Band plays and a giant screen shows famous movie clutches, the bravest women step forward and receive the traditional welcome to one of the nation's most prestigious universities: a big wet upperclassman smack.</seg>
<seg id="9">Days later, another tradition arrives: flu and mononucleosis, the "kissing disease," sweep the dorms.</seg>
<seg id="10">Full Moon on the Quad - normally celebrated beneath the academic year's first full moon but this year held on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="11">22 because of a conflict with Homecoming Week - is an event unique in American education: an orgy of interclass kissing reluctantly but officially sanctioned by the university.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a domestic example of a new field in public health, "mass-gathering medicine."</seg>
<seg id="13">The best-known example is Saudi Arabia's multimillion-dollar efforts to keep the annual pilgrimage to Mecca as epidemic-free as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">For Stanford, the struggle is: Since officials can't outlaw it (yes, they have tried), how can they make it safer?</seg>
<seg id="15">The first step, said Dr. Ira M. Friedman, director of the Vaden Student Health Center, is to make consent paramount.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We try to create an environment in which they don't feel they must participate in the exchange of oral secretions," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">His center also offers shots against what it can fight: flu and meningococcal meningitis, a rare but sometimes dangerous infection known as "freshman meningitis."</seg>
<seg id="18">To make it safer, the evening is overseen by student sobriety monitors and decorated with hand-drawn signs - of the ilk that usually say "Beat Cal" - but bearing slogans like "Consent is Sexy."</seg>
<seg id="19">But the most crucial role is played by the "peer health educators" who live in each dorm.</seg>
<seg id="20">They meet with freshmen before, and ask any with cold symptoms to feel free to watch, but not to kiss anyone.</seg>
<seg id="21">And they teach safe kissing.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We tell them, "Don't floss beforehand, don't brush, don't do anything that could create microabrasions in your gums for germs to get in," said Michelle Lee Mederos, a former educator who graduated in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="23">And we have tables where we offer mints and little Dixie cups of mouthwash.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mouthwash is the main line of defense.</seg>
<seg id="25">This year there were two tables dotted with paper cups, along with condoms and other sexual health supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">The educators also have square latex dental dams to offer, "but they're generally made fun of," said Ms. Mederos, who used them in dorm demonstrations of how to safely perform oral sex on a woman.</seg>
<seg id="27">In two years of ordering supplies, I had to order them only once - for those demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Although the conventional wisdom is that mononucleosis spikes after the event, the health center has never compiled that data, Dr. Friedman said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's also flu season," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But we do think the event is a potentiator.</seg>
<seg id="31">The event's origins are lost in the fog of history; legend holds that it began in the late 1800s with senior men presenting freshman women with roses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Later, it waxed and waned, reputedly practiced sometimes by some fraternities.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many graduates over age 40 have never heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1988, several student officers made it formal.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It was folklore," said Julie Lythcott-Haims, one of those officers.</seg>
<seg id="36">We took it off the shelf and dusted it off.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had roses, a string quartet, maybe some champagne.</seg>
<seg id="38">A couple of hundred students showed up.</seg>
<seg id="39">When she returned a decade later as an administrator (she eventually became the beloved "Freshman Dean Julie"), it had "become a thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thousands were showing up.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was crazy, it was wild.</seg>
<seg id="42">There were concerns about alcohol and safety.</seg>
<seg id="43">Starting in 2002, deans debated outlawing it, rejected that as futile and decided to impose order instead.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now the Quad is barricaded.</seg>
<seg id="45">Campus police check student IDs.</seg>
<seg id="46">Paramedics stand by.</seg>
<seg id="47">A concert is held so nonkissers have something to do.</seg>
<seg id="48">It has been canceled only once: in 2009, the "pandemic swine flu" year.</seg>
<seg id="49">After East Coast schools, which open earlier, reported outbreaks, "we decided we couldn't live with the risk," Dr. Friedman said.</seg>
<seg id="50">So we made a very unpopular decision.</seg>
<seg id="51">Francisca Gilmore, a freshman that year, said in an email interview from an internship in Cambodia that she and some classmates braved the odds anyway.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Unofficially, a bunch of overeager freshmen and intoxicated upperclassmen gathered on the Quad and upheld the tradition," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="53">Dr. Friedman conceded that the ban "didn't work 100 percent, but I think it made some difference."</seg>
<seg id="54">Lots of students got flu, "but we weren't as high as national or even regional rates," he said.</seg>
<seg id="55">Since 2002, new traditions have emerged, leaving yesterday's roses looking wilted.</seg>
<seg id="56">One co-op's contingent attends wearing just body paint.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is a "same-sex kissing" area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Are these the 10 best attractions in Europe?</seg>
<seg id="2">Cappadocia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Wadgey, Flickr Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="4">NINE months ago Peter Shaw quit his job in Perth to set off on a journey without an end date.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here he reveals his picks of the places you can't afford to miss while in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's tough putting together a list of the 10 best tourist attractions in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, Europe's a big place and there are a ridiculous number of great sites to experience.</seg>
<seg id="8">So following my list of the worst attractions in Europe, here are some of the best.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cappadocia, Turkey</seg>
<seg id="10">Hoodoos, fairy chimneys, earth pyramids - whatever you want to call them - they look awesome.</seg>
<seg id="11">These earthly towers of cool are about as common in Cappadocia as carpet salesmen are in the Grand Bazaar, and to make them even more interesting, a large portion have been hollowed and carved out to form dwellings that look like they'd be more fitting to a sci-fi film like Avatar than Central Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Try to imagine one of the most interesting and desolate places on earth with a solid dose of history, a dash of adventure and spectacular sunsets and you have Cappadocia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lying on the ancient Silk Road, the region has been inhabited since the latter part of the Bronze Age and the remnants of the various civilisations who once called the area home now lie scattered across the region.</seg>
<seg id="14">Underground churches, real life Flintstone houses and hot air ballooning make the Cappadocia experience possibly one of the more memorable in your life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Travel tip: Hire a scooter or four-wheeler and go off-road; exploring the fairy chimneys around Goreme.</seg>
<seg id="16">When it gets too steep leave the bike and keep going on foot for some truly breathtaking views.</seg>
<seg id="17">I'd recommend packing a bottle of (great) locally produced wine and timing your walk to catch a spectacular Cappadocia sunset.</seg>
<seg id="18">The weird sites in Cappadocia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Picture: Virtualwayfarer, Flickr Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="20">Sagrada Familia, Spain</seg>
<seg id="21">Gaudi was to architecture what Einstein was to physics, Tesla was to electricity and Leonardo was to the Ninja Turtles.</seg>
<seg id="22">In my opinion it's humanity's single greatest architectural achievement and the Pyramids, Hanging Gardens and Acropolis can all go jump in the lake.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's like nothing you have ever seen and in the words of an American tourist I overheard: "What kind of insane genius could come up with something like this?!""</seg>
<seg id="24">Gaudi described the interior of his work as a 'spiritual forest' and the building does indeed remind you of something organic, even alive ... The outside of the building is enough to keep anyone spellbound with its size, complexity and the bizarre interplay of shapes.</seg>
<seg id="25">While not as 'alien' as the exterior, the inside of the cathedral is equally powerful and interesting.</seg>
<seg id="26">The colours, shapes, columns, scale, use of light and metal make it literally breathtaking.</seg>
<seg id="27">I can't think of anything else in the world I have ever seen built by man that comes even close to this building.</seg>
<seg id="28">Travel tip: Buy your tickets online, print them out and you can skip the insane line wrapping around the block.</seg>
<seg id="29">For some reason people don't seem to research these things before arriving, and much like the Louvre, spend hours waiting in line in the hot sun.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sagrada Familia.</seg>
<seg id="31">Picture: Supplied Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="32">Bruges, Belgium</seg>
<seg id="33">It is one of the best preserved medieval towns in Europe, however the downside of Bruges is that every man and his dog knows about it!</seg>
<seg id="34">Still, it is worth a couple of days in any European itinerary.</seg>
<seg id="35">Bruges is built on the canals, is a history buff's dream and has one of the best medieval squares in the world; complete with bell tower and enough Gothic architecture to keep the Addams Family happy.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hire a bike and tour the canals from the saddle (in summer), you can circumnavigate the town in about an hour and there are plenty of quaint little lanes and cobbled streets to meander down and explore when you're not riding along the canals themselves.</seg>
<seg id="37">Travel tip: Summer pulls larger crowds than The Beatles did so I'd recommend visiting in winter, which has the added bonus of the beautiful buildings and canals being dusted in snow.</seg>
<seg id="38">Bruges - Market Square shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tower of London</seg>
<seg id="40">Maybe it's the small part of me that still holds some nerdish Game of Thrones style fantasy about being a knight sitting atop a steaming warhorse, leading my men at arms into glorious battle ... OK I admit it's not a very realistic fantasy as just the thought of medicine, hygiene and religious practices in the 12th century are enough to keep me firmly grounded in the 2013.</seg>
<seg id="41">Still, the Tower of London is a fantastic experience for anyone with an interest in English or Medieval history.</seg>
<seg id="42">The various museums within the walls and White Tower are really worth a look given the powerful historical context of the structure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Hilariously, there are also the world's biggest and smallest sets of full plate armour on display.</seg>
<seg id="44">That's right, the museum even has the armour of a giant and a dwarf.</seg>
<seg id="45">Brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="46">Travel tip: Your admission includes a free tour by one of the well-practised and hilarious Beefeaters, which are absolutely worth doing.</seg>
<seg id="47">Tower Bridge in London.</seg>
<seg id="48">Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, Berlin</seg>
<seg id="49">This place is scary.</seg>
<seg id="50">This memorial museum lets you walk in the footsteps of a concentration camp prisoner for a day.</seg>
<seg id="51">Rewarding as it is confronting, the Sachsenhausen experience is an important one for anyone visiting Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="52">Travel tip: Pack lunch and spend a day with your audio guide (cheap and totally essential in my opinion) wandering the grounds, going through each area in-depth for a powerful, moving and unforgettable experience.</seg>
<seg id="53">I spent about six hours at Sachsenhausen and felt that I could easily have spent a few more wandering the grounds, absorbing the personal stories and tragedies of its occupants.</seg>
<seg id="54">Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp.</seg>

<seg id="57">The Louvre, Paris</seg>
<seg id="58">So you've made the pilgrimage to see the Mona Lisa and noticed its somewhat underwhelming demeanour ... the best part is you now get to spend the rest of the day getting lost (both physically and metaphorically) in the labyrinthine halls of one of the world's best museums.</seg>
<seg id="59">There is so much art at The Louvre that if you spent a minute at each piece (forgetting the time spent admiring the building itself) it would take roughly 24 days to see them all.</seg>
<seg id="60">You would also have seen enough naked flesh to make Vegas blush.</seg>
<seg id="61">Travel tip: The first Sunday of every month is free and there are MULTIPLE ENTRANCES.</seg>
<seg id="62">Never wait in the main (glass pyramid) line to get in.</seg>
<seg id="63">On a recent visit this line was literally about two kilometres long and yet the side entrance I used did not have a single person waiting.</seg>
<seg id="64">The pyramid of the Louvre Museum.</seg>

<seg id="66">Orvieto, Italy</seg>
<seg id="67">An absolute must for anyone visiting central Italy, this tiny village is perched precariously atop a rocky and fortified plateau in the Umbria region (very similar to better known Tuscany).</seg>
<seg id="68">This for me is the real Italy, with rustic lanes, cobbled roads, beautiful buildings and the earthy colours all brought together with the sound of old Italian ladies pinching the cheeks of their grandkids.</seg>
<seg id="69">I can honestly say this is one of my favourite spots in all of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="70">The village is accessed via the funicular at the train station and once at the top you can easily walk around the entire town in a day taking in the amazing views of the surrounding countryside which is dominated by vineyards, fruit plantations, old churches and monasteries.</seg>
<seg id="71">There is also a rather impressive 14th century cathedral and a series of underground tunnels, passages, galleries and cellars cut deep into the rock below the town itself known as the 'Underground City'.</seg>
<seg id="72">Due to the extreme average age of Orvieto's' withered inhabitants (everybody is really, really old) there are a number of random emergency defibulators (like phone booths) situated all over the village.</seg>
<seg id="73">Some would say that they're only necessary due to the town's heart-stopping views.</seg>
<seg id="74">Travel tip: Orvieto is easily accessed out of Rome, lying only about two hours away by high-speed train.</seg>
<seg id="75">Orvieto.</seg>

<seg id="77">Santorini, Greece</seg>
<seg id="78">I feel sorry for the donkeys in Santorini.</seg>
<seg id="79">They have the unenviable job of hauling an endless supply of overweight tourists up the side of a truly monumental cliff.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's a tourism hotspot (which usually I hate) however in this case I'm going to overlook the irritations of dealing with tourists because Santorini is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="81">This crescent moon-shaped Greek Island is what's left of what was once a more symmetrical shape after one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded human history (the Minoan Eruption) disintegrated most of the island in about the year 250.</seg>
<seg id="82">Yep that's right most of the island exploded!</seg>
<seg id="83">The volcanic activity is the reason behind Santorini's famous black sand beaches (which physics dictates is also the reason so many tourists have burnt feet here).</seg>
<seg id="84">The classic town of Oia on the NW point of the island is famous for its blue domed roofs, whitewashed dwellings and as one of the best spots to watch the fabled Santorini sunsets, which alone are worth coming to the Island to see.</seg>
<seg id="85">Join the mob of eager tourists in the early evening to enjoy the sun's last hour as it plunges into the South Aegean.</seg>
<seg id="86">Travel tip: Santorini is like a magnet for cruise ships and prices reflect this so the best way to do the island is to sleep out of town, hire a four-wheeler and cruise the island at your leisure.</seg>
<seg id="87">Santorini.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Burren, Ireland</seg>
<seg id="89">What would the earth look like if people stopped planting crops, trees and grass, then decided to just grow rocks instead?</seg>
<seg id="90">Exactly like the Burren, that's what.</seg>
<seg id="91">The name 'Burren' derives from the Irish word Boireann, meaning 'great rock' ... wonder why they called it that?</seg>
<seg id="92">This rural 'Karst' landscape in NW County Clare, Ireland is filled with more rocks than soil.</seg>
<seg id="93">I have no idea what the farmers do, given 80 per cent of their land is one big stone.</seg>
<seg id="94">Like everywhere in country Ireland the people are absurdly pleasant and the quaint roads are also so narrow that every time you pass another car you get a few more grey hairs.</seg>
<seg id="95">There are some memorable sites in the area too, including the fabled cliffs of Moher, the tiny musically inclined village of Dingle and more pubs than a drunk Irishman can poke an empty Guinness glass at.</seg>
<seg id="96">The Burren is where you go to hike through the little lanes, climb ancient stone walls, gawk at standing crosses, meander through cow-laden fields and dance to excellent Irish music.</seg>
<seg id="97">It's ountry Ireland at its best.</seg>
<seg id="98">Travel tip: You need a car to really appreciate the region.</seg>

<seg id="101">The Isle of Skye, Scotland</seg>
<seg id="102">The most northerly island of the Inner Herbrides of Scotland is a beautifully picturesque, barren and untamed place.</seg>
<seg id="103">It's an amazing spot to do some camping and hiking, and has some of the most intriguing landscapes in all of the UK.</seg>
<seg id="104">Skye also has the rather unique ability to make its inhabitants constantly appear as though they have just woken up and stumbled out of bed.</seg>
<seg id="105">It's windy on Skye, really, properly, briskly, category five, Scottish windy; even in summertime (which may or may not actually exist in Scotland, the jury's still out on that one).</seg>
<seg id="106">There are two spots on the isle that turn it from just 'damn cool' to 'freaking amazing'.</seg>
<seg id="107">The old man of Storr, a large rocky pinnacle that dominates the southern approach of the Trotternish Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="108">You can see it from kilometres away and can climb up to the bottom of the pinnacle if you're careful (lots of loose rocks, and a fairly steep incline) but the view is worth the effort and with any luck the area will get covered in low hanging clouds for added atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="109">It's also been used as a location in many films due to its remarkable appearance, the latest being Ridley Scott's Prometheus.</seg>
<seg id="110">The Fairy Glen is a tiny area on the outskirts of Uig that does almost feel magical in an eerie sort of way (hence the name, genius).</seg>
<seg id="111">The glen is dominated by a number of bizarre corkscrew shaped 'twisted' hills in addition to the gnarled, old trees and enough creepy stone piles and circles to keep the Blair Witch happy (legend has it that if you get lured into a stone fairy circle by the fairy lights you will be trapped there, mesmerised by their dancing forever).</seg>
<seg id="112">Sadly I didn't see any fairies or freaky lights but the glen does make for a truly memorable experience and some very unique photos.</seg>
<seg id="113">Travel tip: Camp on Skye if you can, that or hire a camper van and stay in one of the many campsites on the island.</seg>

<seg id="5">Coroner: 'We don't know why Jack decided not to hook on the cliff'</seg>
<seg id="6">By Dan Bloom</seg>
<seg id="7">Jack Hutton-Potts, 23, died in a climbing accident off the coast of Anglesey tethered to Vaughan Holme, the teacher who had introduced him to the sport</seg>
<seg id="8">A boarding school teacher accidentally dragged a former student to his death in a climbing tragedy because they were tethered together.</seg>
<seg id="9">Vaughan Holme, 48, and Jack Hutton-Potts, 23, plunged more than 300ft to their deaths down a sea cliff.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pair had met at the prestigious Christ's Hospital School in Horsham, West Sussex, where father-of-two and housemaster Mr Holme had passed on his love of climbing.</seg>
<seg id="11">They continued meeting and were climbing The Gauntlet at Gogarth Cliffs, near Holyhead, Wales, when the double tragedy happened in June.</seg>
<seg id="12">An inquest heard Mr Holme, from Horsham, was probably leading the climb when he slipped and fell.</seg>
<seg id="13">The two men were tied together with a rope.</seg>
<seg id="14">The exact reason for his fall will never be clear, the coroner said.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, it appeared the two men had not yet hooked safety equipment which could have saved their lives into the rock face.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pathologist Dr Mark Lord said death for Mr Hutton-Potts, from Petersfield, Hampshire, was 'instantaneous' when he drowned after suffering a significant head injury.</seg>
<seg id="17">'He's fallen, become unconscious and unfortunately landed in the water and drowned,' the pathologist added.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Holme died of multiple injuries.</seg>
<seg id="19">The accident happened at Gogarth Cliffs near Holyhead, Wales.</seg>
<seg id="20">The town is on the isle of Anglesey, pictured</seg>
<seg id="21">Coroner Nicola Jones said the impact of the plunge would have been devastating.</seg>
<seg id="22">'What we have here are two men who were very competent climbers, both very safety aware and safety conscious,' she added.</seg>
<seg id="23">Clearly the only conclusion I can come to is the deaths were due to an accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">We don't know why Vaughan fell.</seg>
<seg id="25">We don't know why Jack decided not to hook on to the cliff.'</seg>
<seg id="26">The inquest heard the climb was challenging but well within the capabilities of both men.</seg>
<seg id="27">Elfyn Jones, of Llanberis mountain rescue team, said it appeared Mr Hutton-Potts was waiting to climb so there may have been a 'judgement call' about whether to use a belay, a climbing tool which would fix the rope to the rock.</seg>
<seg id="28">'Had they been belayed it's possible the fall wouldn't have had the consequences it had,' he added.</seg>
<seg id="29">Lifeboats and an RAF rescue helicopter took part in a major search after the pair were reported missing.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mr Jones abseiled down the cliff after the accident and spotted impact marks matching the colour of Mr Holme's helmet.</seg>
<seg id="31">Teacher Catherine Butters, from Liverpool, was taught to climb by Mr Holme and said he was 'very safe, very careful'.</seg>
<seg id="32">Christ's Hospital School was founded in the 16th Century and now sits on a 200-acre site.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although boarding fees are £28,000 a year, the school is rare in offering almost all its places for free or a reduced rate through a charitable scheme which funds 70% of pupils' fees.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the time of the accident, headmaster John Franklin said: 'Christ's Hospital is a very close-knit community and the tragic loss of a popular teacher and a young Old Blue, who were both experienced climbers, has shocked and saddened staff, pupils and the Old Blue community.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.</seg>
<seg id="4">The study is published in the journal Current Biology.</seg>
<seg id="5">Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="6">Here we attempted to look at it in other species.</seg>
<seg id="7">He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="8">To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="9">They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other</seg>
<seg id="11">Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="12">When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="13">But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.</seg>
<seg id="20">And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="21">He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.</seg>
<seg id="22">A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="23">"While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.</seg>

<seg id="2">THE first catch of seafood from Japan's Fukushima coast since last year's nuclear disaster is being sold after passing radiation tests.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Fukushima Prefectural (state) fishing cooperative said only octopus and a marine snail known as whelk were going on sale today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people</seg>
<seg id="5">Cast your vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="8">That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not easy," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people can die because they are waiting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.</seg>
<seg id="26">Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="29">And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their luck doesn't always hold out.</seg>
<seg id="33">They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We are receiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="38">They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This will change my future with my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I'm not sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.</seg>
<seg id="54">He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="57">That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.</seg>
<seg id="58">The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="59">But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He's a hero, without a doubt," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="61">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.</seg>
<seg id="62">For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.</seg>
<seg id="63">Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think about my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees what I am doing.</seg>
<seg id="67">To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after the police in Bahrain raided the offices of an opposition party to confiscate materials being used in an exhibition on the security crackdown following the 2011 uprising, the authorities released a video statement in which a spokesman contended that the display of painting, spent tear-gas canisters and the belongings of dead protesters was being used to illegally "reinforce hatred."</seg>
<seg id="3">The opposition activist Ala'a Shehabi heaped scorn on the police spokesman's attempt to justify the crackdown on remembering the crackdown, calling it a "tragicomedy."</seg>
<seg id="4">Two spokesmen for the party, al-Wefaq, denounced the raid on its "Revolution Museum" exhibit at a news conference on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the exhibition was shut down, supporters of the uprising against the kingdom's monarchy documented it on YouTube and in images posted on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="6">Organizers of the exhibition told The Associated Press that the panoramas and collections of personal items were inspired in part by the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="7">As my colleague Kareem Fahim reported, the crackdown on dissent seemed to escalate again last month with the arrest of Khalil al-Marzooq, a former member of Parliament and a leader of Wefaq, mainstream opposition group which had been engaged in dialogue with the government.</seg>
<seg id="8">The struggle by activists to preserve memories of the uprisings across the Arab world in 2011 has been an ongoing theme in the region for the past two years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last month, the British-Egyptian filmmaker Omar Robert Hamilton worked with the Cairo-based scholar and researcher Mohamed Elshahed on a video for the Guggenheim documenting the ephemeral Revolution Museum that has appeared and disappeared at moments of great upheaval in Tahrir Square.</seg>

<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- In a limited time offering, Lay's, the U.S. snack maker, is expected to offer Lay's Wavy Potato Chips Dipped in Milk Chocolate.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lay's, the nation's largest salty snack maker, is expected to announce on Friday its plans to roll its chocolate covered potato chip that is scheduled to last from post Halloween to New Year's only at Target stores, USA Today reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Ram Krishnan, vice president of marketing at Frito-Lay, the parent company of Lay's, said if the chocolate potato chip is a major hit, it could become permanent.</seg>
<seg id="5">"When you try something drastically different, you have to walk before you can run," Krishnan told USA Today.</seg>
<seg id="6">We wanted to test our way through this before we go big.</seg>
<seg id="7">The product, which costs $3.49 for a 5-ounce bag, might be the first commercially available chocolate covered potato chip, but smaller chocolate makers have been providing them for dozens of years.</seg>
<seg id="8">They are especially popular in the Midwest.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mixing salt and chocolate is nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="10">There have been chocolate covered pretzels for years and Dairy Queen offered ice cream, chocolate and salty peanuts long ago, but this is new territory for Lay's.</seg>
<seg id="11">Krishnan said if the product is popular the company might try other flavor combinations using dark chocolate, white chocolate and peppermint.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over the past year, sweet and salty snacks include: Kettle Maple Bacon Potato Chips, Planter's Sweet & Salty Snack Mix, ConAgra's Crunch 'n Munch and even Sweet 'n Salty Bugles, USA Today said.</seg>

<seg id="7">Brisbane put the lowly Melbourne to the sword last Sunday and despite the significant step-up in class this weekend, Voss says the Lions must aim high.</seg>
<seg id="8">"A pass mark is always a W (win)...there's only ever one pass mark when it comes to football," Voss said before training today.</seg>
<seg id="9">So as far as we're concerned that will be what happens in the end, all we can do is make sure we provide a contest, and that's where it starts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sydney has won four of its five starts in 2013 without getting into top gear but Voss has the utmost respect for the home side.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I'm certainly not going to say anything to fire them up, but while they haven't won as convincingly or got out of the blocks as much as you'd expect, they're still a good football team and they build their wins over the course of four quarters," Voss said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Veteran midfielder Simon Black trained with the reserves at the Gabba this morning and will play one more match in the NEAFL in his comeback from a knee injury.</seg>

<seg id="7">A more considered installment emerges this time around, narrowing the focus while widening horizons to encompass the high seas.</seg>
<seg id="8">The naval battles in particular are excellent, and feel more positively integrated into the game, allowing you to spend hard-earned cash in exchange for hardier hulls and swifter sails.</seg>
<seg id="9">Behind the wheel is Edward Conway, a swashbuckling privateer who becomes mixed up in the Assassin's Order, providing a compelling hero substitute for the much-mourned Ezio.</seg>
<seg id="10">Havana, Nassau and Kingston are all lovingly rendered, with plenty of parkour potential in the cities, swamps and clifftops.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simenon is safe in Cup</seg>
<seg id="2">A tough stayer: Simenon.</seg>
<seg id="3">A long night for English trainer Willie Mullins and the connections of international hopeful Simenon has been averted after staying mare Silent Achiever was found to have injury issues and will miss Tuesday's $6million Melbourne Cup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mullins and the owners of Simenon were relieved to hear that their tough stayer had moved up to No.22 in the order of entry for the Cup and even if the winners of the Mackinnon and the Lexus Stakes gain starts in the race, Simenon cannot be displaced.</seg>
<seg id="5">Racing Victoria international recruiter Leigh Jordon said on Friday: "I spoke to Willie in Kuala Lumpur and he was very excited at the news.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was very hard for them not knowing, but now they are safe in the field they need not worry.</seg>
<seg id="7">The owner Nick Peacock was just as pleased.</seg>
<seg id="8">He's been out watching the horse work for the last week and at least they can enjoy Derby day without having to worry about missing out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jordon said that Mullins had been very happy with how Simenon had settled in Australia and was hoping the stayer could draw a good barrier on Saturday night.</seg>
<seg id="10">New Zealander Silent Achiever sustained an injury in the Caulfield Cup and although she worked strongly on Tuesday morning, she subsequently developed an infection.</seg>
<seg id="11">Top jockey Brett Prebble will reunite with Green Moon, on whom he won last year's Melbourne Cup.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the Lloyd Williams-owned galloper has not won since then, Prebble is warming to his chances in Tuesday's great race.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prebble, who has been based in Hong Kong for more than a decade, put up a kilogram overweight on the son of Montjeu when he saw off another of Tuesday's rivals, Fiorente, last year.</seg>
<seg id="14">So Prebble doesn't see the rise to 57.5 kilograms as being that drastic, considering he carried 54.5 (not the 53.5 he was handicapped at).</seg>
<seg id="15">"He made light work of it last year," Prebble told a Derby-eve lunch.</seg>
<seg id="16">He ran better this year in the Cox Plate [dead-heating for ninth, 7½ lengths behind Shamus Award) and the horse has been trained for the Melbourne Cup.</seg>
<seg id="17">The favourites have had a few gutbusters.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prebble paid tribute to the planning and vision of Williams, who will have six runners - a quarter of the field - in Tuesday's race.</seg>
<seg id="19">"To have that many in the race is an extraordinary feat," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Michael Rodd is out suspended on Derby day but he returns to action in time to partner one of Williams' sextet, Masked Marvel, on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="21">He believes the six-year-old, who he rode into 13th place in the Cox Plate, is a chance if he settles and is on his best behaviour, especially "if he reproduces his European form."</seg>
<seg id="22">His Cox Plate run was a pass mark.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hopefully there's a bit of pace on early and he can settle.</seg>
<seg id="24">He will be very strong late," Rodd said of the 2011 English St Leger winner who, like Green Moon, is a son of Montjeu.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the jockey can score aboard the former John Gosden-trained entire, he will enjoy a second Cup celebration, having won aboard another Williams runner, Efficient, in 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">Last Vegas: geezers-gone-wild in Sin City</seg>
<seg id="2">The geezers-gone-wild comedy Last Vegas, starring Robert De Niro (70), Michael Douglas (69), Morgan Freeman (76) and Kevin Kline (66), plays like a blend of The Hangover and Grumpy Old Men.</seg>
<seg id="3">You could add The Bucket List, too, since this film gave these Oscar-winning veterans their first-ever opportunity to work together on screen.</seg>
<seg id="4">Directed by Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) and written by Dan Fogelman (The Guilt Trip, Crazy, Stupid Love), the movie is a preholiday trifle that's mildly risqué and a lot sentimental.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stars play childhood friends who dubbed themselves "The Flatbush Four," and they reunite in their senior years for a Vegas bachelor party.</seg>
<seg id="6">The host is Malibu playboy lawyer Billy (Douglas), who has impulsively proposed to his 31-year-old girlfriend while delivering a friend's eulogy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The gang includes Archie (Freeman) in New Jersey, who has suffered a mild stroke and has been chafing ever since under the cautious watch of his son (Michael Ealy).</seg>
<seg id="8">In Florida, Sam (Kline) is fading away in a purgatorial retirement community; as he's leaving for Vegas, his wife (Joanna Gleason) hands him an envelope with a Viagra pill and a condom in the hope a fling will revive their sex lives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lastly, there's the surly Paddy (De Niro), who lives alone in his New York apartment and is the hardest to persuade to take the trip: He still bears a grudge against Billy, who missed Paddy's wife's funeral a year before.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shortly after they arrive in Las Vegas, Archie wins big at black jack and, hoping to win some of its money back, the casino comps them a gymnasium-sized penthouse suite.</seg>
<seg id="11">Early on, they meet the warmly engaging Diana (Mary Steenburgen in the best performance here, except for her distracting Cleopatra wig).</seg>
<seg id="12">A former Atlanta lawyer trying to make a fresh start as lounge singer, Diana is amused by the four aging adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="13">She takes them under her wing and soon rekindles an old rivalry between Paddy and Billy.</seg>
<seg id="14">There's a big party, naturally, with babes, booze and misbehaviour, and it results in the expected reversals of the men's defeatist perspectives: Sam shows his moves on the dance floor; Paddy channels his rage by decking a young punk, Sam expands his erotic horizons; and Billy rediscovers true romance.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cast members are all capable and game, but there are only so many times you can watch old, crepe-necked dudes dreamily ogling young females before you start to feel queasy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Clearly, what happens in Vegas really needs to stay there.</seg>

<seg id="4">A 14-year-old boy who has the body of a 110-year-old could die in the next few years due to a rare disease which makes him age eight times faster than normal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Daily Mail reports Ali Hussain Khan, from Bihar in India, suffers from Progeria which causes rapid ageing and affects just 80 people worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="6">The teenager, whose parents are first cousins, has seen five of his siblings die from the same condition.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although sufferers are not expected to live much beyond the age of 14, Ali refuses to give up hope.</seg>
<seg id="8">I very much want to live and I hope there is medicine for my condition out there.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm not scared of death but my parents have suffered a lot," Ali said.</seg>
<seg id="10">I'd love to live much longer for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't want to burden them with any more pain.</seg>
<seg id="12">His siblings Rehana, Iqramul, Gudiya and Rubina have all died from Progeria between the ages of 12 and 24.</seg>
<seg id="13">A fifth child, a boy who died within 24 hours of being born, is also thought to have had the rare condition.</seg>

<seg id="15">Picture: IBNLive.com</seg>
<seg id="16">Ali's father Nabi Hussain Khan, 50, said he would have stopped having children had doctors diagnosed the disease earlier.</seg>
<seg id="17">We never heard of the word Progeria, the doctors never mentioned it.</seg>
<seg id="18">"They were stabbing in the dark; they were as clueless as us," Hussain Kahn, who also has two healthy daughters, said.</seg>
<seg id="19">If a doctor had perhaps told us that our children were suffering with some kind of genetic problem and we were connected we would've stopped having children.</seg>
<seg id="20">But nothing was said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Many children with Progeria suffer from joint pain and hip osteoarthritis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents</seg>
<seg id="2">The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
<seg id="5">Google is accused of infringing seven patents.</seg>
<seg id="6">The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</seg>
<seg id="7">Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</seg>
<seg id="8">Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="11">After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe," the lawsuit said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.</seg>

<seg id="2">Newcastle hooker Danny Buderus has left hospital after scans cleared him of any major head or neck injuries following the heavy head clash that cut short his final game.</seg>
<seg id="3">Danny Buderus is stretchered from the field.</seg>
<seg id="4">Danny Buderus, in potentially his final match, has been taken to hospital after being knocked out attempting to tackle Jared Waerea-Hargreaves.</seg>
<seg id="5">COURAGEOUS Newcastle hooker Danny Buderus will see a specialist later this week with fears the sickening collision that left him unconscious for almost three minutes against the Sydney Roosters may have stirred up an old back injury that required surgery earlier this season.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although still feeling the effects of a severe concussion following his tackle gone wrong on Roosters prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, the veteran hooker was released from St Vincent's hospital Sunday morning and will spend the next few days recuperating.</seg>
<seg id="7">He spent the night in hospital under observation and undergoing scans that cleared him of a neck injury.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it's understood one of the scans showed up some inflammation around a disc in his back that he had previous surgery on early in the season.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will know later in the week after seeing his specialist whether the inflammation is any cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="10">"No one wants to finish their career this way but I have been fortunate to play the game I love for this long and for us to finish in the top four this season," Buderus said Sunday."</seg>
<seg id="11">Thank you to everyone for their well wishes and support, not just last night but throughout my career.</seg>
<seg id="12">I love this club and have said on a number of occasions I am forever indebted to it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Knights CEO Matt Gidley, one of Buderus" closest mates, described the incident as "heartbreaking" and admitted to being emotional when he saw Buderus in the dressing room immediately after he was stretchered off.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yeah, I was pretty upset.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It was a big game for him, knowing how passionate he is and to see him go out like that was hard to take," Gidley said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was real crook and even now that he is home, he is going to be sick and sorry for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="17">Gidley said the tackle that caused the concussion typified the way the Knights hooker has always played the game.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It was typical Bedsy - going in to meet a big forward head-on,"" he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">That was part of his make-up - to make big defensive statements.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's the courage of the man.</seg>
<seg id="21">The way he leads by example without any fear.</seg>
<seg id="22">His technique has always been so good, which is why he has never had too many concussions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, he got this one wrong.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it's just one of the many courageous acts of putting his body on the line for his team that Bedsy will be remembered for.</seg>
<seg id="25">Knights teammate Beau Scott admitted the loss of their inspirational hooker affected the team.</seg>
<seg id="26">"He's the number one man, the number one person to the team, the town, to everyone really," Scott said.</seg>
<seg id="27">I can't give the bloke enough accolades and just hope he is OK.</seg>
<seg id="28">Gidley said the Knights will take plenty out of the way the team battled on without him against a rampant Roosters outfit.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think what happened with him knocked a bit of the spirit out of all of us but I couldn't be prouder of the way we kept fighting on,"" he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Growing older sooner</seg>
<seg id="2">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent</seg>
<seg id="4">There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys</seg>
<seg id="7">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are important, too.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, "suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are varying explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="2">An indigenous teacher who human rights groups say was unjustly imprisoned for 13 years received a promised pardon Thursday from President Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alberto Patishtan Gomez was the first person pardoned by Pena Nieto under a recent change in Mexico's penal code that broadened a president's grounds for granting pardons.</seg>
<seg id="4">The president had announced late Tuesday that he would free Patishtan, and Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said Thursday that Pena Nieto ordered the teacher be released from prison immediately.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We identified evidence of consistent human rights violations, particularly during the legal process," Osorio Chong said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Patishtan was detained in June 2000 and charged with participating in the ambush and killing of seven police officers in the southern state of Chiapas, home to the Zapatista rebel uprising.</seg>
<seg id="7">The newly approved law published Wednesday allows the president to pardon prisoners "when there are consistent indications of grave human rights violations" against them.</seg>
<seg id="8">The code already allowed some other kinds of limited presidential pardons.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shortly after being released, Patishtan maintained his innocence.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They wanted to finish me, but I'm innocent before God and in my own eyes," he said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now 43, Patishtan was being held at the National Institute of Neurology, where he was transferred from prison to undergo treatment for a brain tumor.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was serving a 60-year sentence for charges associated with the ambush, including murder.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said he was simply participating in protests in a state marked by the emergence of the Zapatista rebel movement.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said that it was the mayor of a Chiapas town who incriminated him unfairly and that he did not have the resources to defend himself against the charges.</seg>
<seg id="15">Amnesty International and other rights groups have said the case against Patishtan was plagued with irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mexican courts refused to overturn the conviction and sentence, saying defense lawyers didn't provide sufficient evidence.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mexico's Supreme Court refused to hear the case.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed</seg>
<seg id="2">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough</seg>
<seg id="3">The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="4">Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
<seg id="5">A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.</seg>
<seg id="7">The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="14">Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.</seg>
<seg id="18">Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.</seg>
<seg id="20">The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.</seg>
<seg id="32">He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will find you and put you before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.</seg>
<seg id="43">On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.</seg>

<seg id="1">No more monkey business as governor steps in</seg>
<seg id="2">Last call: Performing monkeys owned by Surmidi and chained at their home in Kampung Cipinang Besar.</seg>
<seg id="3">The hairy creature inside the baby doll mask jerks oddly on its rocking horse, the hollow eyes the stuff of nightmares or Halloween horror films.</seg>
<seg id="4">But on the street corners of Jakarta, attached to the face of a long-tailed macaque, the mask is just part of a long tradition of children's entertainment called "topeng monyet."</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the masked monkey show is being stopped after a campaign by animal cruelty activists.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Jakarta government last week announced it would buy up all the creatures and send them to the zoo.</seg>
<seg id="7">The owners have been promised retraining.</seg>
<seg id="8">Show time: A trained monkey wearing a mask during a "topeng monyet" (masked monkey) show in east Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's been talked about for years, but the wildly popular governor Joko Widodo - whom many Indonesians affectionately call "Jokowi" and hope will run for president next year - has finally cracked down.</seg>
<seg id="10">His public order officers are busy removing monkey buskers and their charges from the streets.</seg>
<seg id="11">Deep in the alleys of the slum-like Kampung Cipinang Besar, where most of them live, young buskers Malik and Pepen have no idea what they will do for a living without monkeys Dewi and Bella.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bella earns Malik up to 50,000 rupiah ($A5) a day performing at traffic lights near a mall, enough to feed his wife and child.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was grabbed by a public order officer last week but managed to escape.</seg>
<seg id="14">Before buying Bella, Malik was a street singer - a glorified beggar.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the ban, he has been scavenging metal scraps for a living, which only pays about $2 to $3 a day.</seg>
<seg id="16">Is it enough to survive on?</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have to accept that," he says, with very Indonesian resignation.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Jakarta government is offering about 1 million rupiah ($100) to buy the monkeys, and so far unspecified job training.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's unclear what uneducated young slum-dwellers such as Malik and Pepen will do with the compensation, nor what jobs they are suitable for.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ibu Sarenah and her husband Surmidi live in a different part of Kampung Cipinang Besar, and keep six topeng monyet chained in a wooden cage.</seg>
<seg id="21">They met through monkeys - Sarenah's grandfather owned them and Surmidi, just 17 at the time, was his assistant, playing the music.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now their music is electronic and the monkeys were, until last week, booked by phone and taken to perform at parties, and circumcision receptions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now our source of living is gone, stopped.</seg>
<seg id="24">We cannot make a living any more so we are confused.</seg>
<seg id="25">I'm worried about the future of my family," Sarenah says.</seg>
<seg id="26">She denies it's cruel to keep monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="27">The monkeys are good, intelligent, so I treat them the way I treat myself.</seg>
<seg id="28">But activists from the Jakarta Animal Aid Network disagree.</seg>
<seg id="29">They say the tiny creatures are trained by hanging them for a half day at a time from a metal ring around their necks to teach them an upright posture.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trainers also hit them and scorch their feet as they teach them to dance, pray, ride toy motorcycles and rocking horses, play wooden guitars, shoot toy guns and pull trolleys.</seg>
<seg id="31">Some topeng monyet even smoke.</seg>
<seg id="32">Only about 60 per cent of the monkeys survive the basic training.</seg>
<seg id="33">The governor is also worried about disease: urban macaques are known to carry the simian HIV virus or rabies.</seg>
<seg id="34">Malik does not know about disease, but agrees about the training: "I didn't train them but I know it is cruel," he says.</seg>
<seg id="35">But asked if it's cruel for the monkeys to live chained among the refuse of a slum, Malik looks around.</seg>
<seg id="36">"It hasn't crossed my mind," he says.</seg>

<seg id="2">Other professional investors, including Psigma Investment Management, have turned negative on the Invesco funds.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tom Becket, Psigma's chief investment officer, said: "We are uncomfortable with both the earnings growth prospects and valuations of some of the defensive sectors."</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Woodford's announced departure came in addition to this underlying concern.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fund managers tend to struggle to perform well when money floods out of the door.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is because they are having to unwind stock positions as opposed to buying new shares.</seg>
<seg id="7">But some influential commentators urge investors to wait at least until next April, when Mr Woodford steps down from the funds and is replaced by Mark Barnett.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown said: "Neil Woodford has more than 25 years" experience managing money at Invesco Perpetual and I believe he will continue to work hard at achieving strong performance for investors until he departs."</seg>
<seg id="9">We believe investors need not consider selling the fund now, and I myself will be remaining invested.</seg>
<seg id="10">For new investors, however, we would suggest waiting until the new manager has taken over the fund.</seg>
<seg id="11">Should I join the sellers?</seg>
<seg id="12">Gary Reynolds of wealth manager Courtiers has urged investors to sell for this reason.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said: "Money coming out of the funds will have a negative impact on performance as a number of the big stocks he holds are likely to fall in price as Mr Woodford sells out of his positions."</seg>

<seg id="1">US-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found</seg>
<seg id="2">One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.</seg>
<seg id="3">US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.</seg>
<seg id="5">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="9">They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We don't want to charge that," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.</seg>
<seg id="30">It will still give away water.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israeli Warplanes Strike Inside Syria</seg>
<seg id="2">Israeli warplanes conducted an airstrike early today on a Syrian military facility near the northern Syrian port city of Latakia along the Mediterranean coast, a U.S. official confirms to ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="3">The attack is believed to be the fifth airstrike conducted by Israel inside Syria this year.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like the earlier airstrikes, the official said the latest attack presumably targeted advanced Russian missile weapons systems headed to the extremist group Hezbollah based in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="5">An Israeli source also confirmed the attack to ABC News which like the four previous attacks this year has not been acknowledged by the Israeli government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The air strike was first reported in Israeli newspapers which cited explosions at a missile storage facility near Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The accounts differed as to what types of air defense missile systems may have been targeted by Israeli warplanes.</seg>
<seg id="8">U.S. official say that the Israeli warplanes conducting the airstrikes usually launch missiles at targets inside Syria from inside Lebanese airspace so they are not exposed to Syria's advanced air defense systems.</seg>
<seg id="9">The official Lebanese news agency reported that Israeli planes were spotted flying for several hours over various parts of Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Lebanese Army press release said "the enemy planes circled above the various Lebanese regions" before leaving Lebanese airspace.</seg>
<seg id="11">The most recent Israeli airstrike inside Syria took place on July 5 and also occurred near Latakia, targeting a warehouse that was believed to house advanced Yakhont long-range anti-ship missiles.</seg>
<seg id="12">The three earlier Israeli air strikes inside Syria all targeted Russian weapons systems that Syria was believed to be funneling to Hezbollah in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="13">Syria has been a long-time arms provider to the militant Lebanese organization.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first strike near Damascus in late January targeted a convoy carrying anti-aircraft missiles that may have been on the move to Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="15">In early May, Israel conducted two separate airstrikes, also near Damascus, that a U.S. official told ABC News targeted as many as a dozen medium range Fateh-110 missiles intended for Hezbollah.</seg>

<seg id="1">Set for Marathon, Ex-Addicts Find Their Way</seg>
<seg id="2">CORIANO, Italy - It is still dark when Sara Floriddia laces her shoes and goes running on the hilltop roads near the Adriatic coast of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="3">With every mile, she leaves her past further behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">When Floriddia, 34, came here to San Patrignano, one of the largest drug rehabilitation centers in Europe, she had been a heroin addict for five years.</seg>
<seg id="5">She remembers crying, even as she administered her doses.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now she is a part of an unusual running team of six former drug addicts who will represent San Patrignano on Sunday in the New York City Marathon.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are broken vases that have been glued together again," Floriddia said.</seg>
<seg id="8">But if we can work and live in a healthy environment, we won't break again.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tucked in the northern hills of Italy, San Patrignano is not a typical training ground for marathoners.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has 1,300 residents at its main facility, which doubles as a small farming community.</seg>
<seg id="11">The addicts submit to a four-year rehabilitation program in which they must cultivate their food, clean their rooms and undertake tasks like making cheese, raising pigs and cows, and producing wine.</seg>
<seg id="12">And some have become runners.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since February, a top marathon coach, Gabriele Rosa, has been training the program's team of runners to help improve their self-confidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The New York City Marathon is a way for the runners to pursue a dream, but there are other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We also hope that the visibility of the N.Y.C. Marathon could make our community known and available to other people in need all over the world," said Letizia Moratti, a longtime supporter of San Patrignano and the president of its United States affiliate, Friends of San Patrignano.</seg>
<seg id="16">San Patrignano, which was founded in 1979 and has two smaller branches in Italy, is not like many drug rehabilitation centers.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is free, for one.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unless the newcomers need to scale down their use of methadone, residents are not given substitution medicines.</seg>
<seg id="19">They can see a therapist but are not compelled to.</seg>
<seg id="20">Social workers and former drug addicts who have seniority in the program assist those who have just arrived.</seg>
<seg id="21">If necessary, the seniors "crowd around you and talk you off the cliff," as an American resident put it.</seg>
<seg id="22">The San Patrignano method mirrors the mental and physical discipline needed to run, forcing the participants to work methodically, Rosa said as his group of runners, who have 3 to 18 years of drug addiction behind them, went up a slope.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I am confident that they will all finish the race in a good time, out of personal motivation or out of gratitude for this community," Rosa said.</seg>
<seg id="24">For many, San Patrignano is family.</seg>
<seg id="25">About a third of the 422 collaborators and volunteers in the community were once residents there.</seg>
<seg id="26">Antonio Boschini, the community's therapeutic manager, graduated with a medical degree in the 1980s from the University of Verona while living in San Patrignano, where he still lives, with his wife and two children.</seg>
<seg id="27">He is also a member of the running team.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Drug addicts are not ill people; they are not doomed to lead a life of minor league," Boschini said.</seg>
<seg id="29">We need to show it to the world when in New York.</seg>
<seg id="30">For Andrea Grossi, 27, running is a challenge requiring his concentration at every step.</seg>
<seg id="31">"They all know it - I just don't want to run in the first 20 minutes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then I break that mental barrier, and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Grossi recounted his personal victory at the Rome Marathon in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="34">At Mile 23, he thought he could not take it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fatigue took over his mind before his legs.</seg>
<seg id="36">Yet he would not stop.</seg>
<seg id="37">Training for months and then finishing the race proved to him that he was no longer the boy who provoked 13 car and scooter accidents in a daze of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We used to be derelicts of society, people in the corner," he said, but no more.</seg>
<seg id="39">For some athletes from San Patrignano, the New York City Marathon is their first important test.</seg>
<seg id="40">Floriddia, now a nurse in the community, said it was a matter of pride for her to complete the race in less than five hours.</seg>
<seg id="41">She is also racing so that her father, an award-winning road runner now in his 60s, will be proud of her.</seg>
<seg id="42">"When I was little and we followed him to the races, I hated it," she said.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the finishing line, he was drenched in sweat; at times he would even throw up.</seg>
<seg id="44">""Why would he do it to himself?""</seg>
<seg id="45">I thought.</seg>
<seg id="46">Now, her raven-black hair stands out as the team's runners march up a hill in bright yellow shirts.</seg>
<seg id="47">She has never left Europe.</seg>
<seg id="48">She is one of the two female runners flying to New York, and the only one who is still going through the rehabilitation program.</seg>
<seg id="49">She said she felt the need to pave the way for former addicts like her, and for others who needed to learn how to keep their self-destructive tendencies out of their lives.</seg>
<seg id="50">"At times I worry that when I'll be out of here, I could get discouraged, bored or be nervous again," she said.</seg>
<seg id="51">But now I know what I'll do.</seg>
<seg id="52">I will run.</seg>

<seg id="2">Perseverance has paid dividends for Brisbane's Jordan Kahu.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Anne Moliterno Source: The Courier-Mail</seg>
<seg id="4">BRISBANE Broncos winger Jordan Kahu is determined to succeed in the career his older brother rejected.</seg>
<seg id="5">After knee injuries suffered in trial games ruined his previous two seasons, Kahu has finally cemented his place in the Broncos starting team by usurping Lachlan Maranta.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a justified reward for a man who was predicted to be a superstar at age 17 when he led Keebra Park to the Arrive Alive Cup championship.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injuries brutally halted those expectations, but his perseverance in continuing to train hard has reinforced the Broncos' culture of determination.</seg>
<seg id="8">His dream has been forged by the opportunities his older brother Jared missed out on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jared was a teammate of Alex Glenn and Josh Hoffman in Anthony Griffin's 2008 National Youth Competition outfit that made the grand final.</seg>
<seg id="10">He signed with North Queensland for 2009 but felt homesick in Townsville.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the Kahu's grandmother fell ill during pre-season, Jared travelled back to Wellington to help her.</seg>
<seg id="12">He never returned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Jordan, 22, said the opportunities that escaped his brother had driven his career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yeah they did, knowing how close he was to making it . . .</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn't want to quit so close," Jordan said.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was always going to do everything I could to get here.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jared is now playing rugby union for Wellington club Petone.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There were a few reasons," Jordan said of his brother's exit from rugby league.</seg>
<seg id="19">He signed to the Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="20">He went up there and had a pre-season, came home for Christmas, never went back.</seg>
<seg id="21">""He didn't like Townsville, he didn't have any family up there, so it was tough for him.</seg>
<seg id="22">I was lucky enough to have both my dad and brother here when I came across.</seg>
<seg id="23">Broncos hooker Andrew McCullough said Kahu's handling of giant fullback Greg Inglis in last week's loss to the Rabbitohs proved he was ready for first grade.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Jordy, when he's got the opportunity he's taken it with both hands," McCullough said.</seg>

<seg id="1">World champion Sebastian Vettel scoffs at talk he has nothing to gain at Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</seg>
<seg id="2">World champion Sebastian Vettel has dismissed suggestions he has nothing left to gain by clocking up a win in this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="4">WORLD champion Sebastian Vettel scoffed at suggestions that he has nothing to gain from the last three races of the season and is intent on a seventh straight win at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</seg>
<seg id="5">Vettel clinched the Formula One title at the Indian GP to become the youngest ever four-time champion, then allowed himself a few drinks on Sunday before focusing on this this weekend's race in Abu Dhabi - where he won the inaugural race in 2009 and sealed his first title a year later.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a great feeling.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We had a little bit of fun in the hotel bar," Vettel said.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was good to sober up after India and get ready for here.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 26-year-old Vettel's level of perfection means he will be highly demanding of himself.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We don't approach the weekend as if there is nothing to gain," Vettel said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We love what we are doing and enjoy the challenge and that is why there is not even a question about why we are here and what we have to do.</seg>
<seg id="12">We want to race the others as hard as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Red Bull has also secured the constructors' championship, and has a huge lead of 157 points over Mercedes, although that makes little difference to Vettel's mindset.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I need the team and the team needs (teammate) Mark (Webber) and myself to push the car to the limit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Behind Vettel and Red Bull, the fight for second is set to intensify.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso has 207 points and holds a 24-point lead over Kimi Raikkonen in third place.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We need to be realistic, knowing that we didn't have the chance this year to fight for the championship," Alonso said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the beginning of the year we were a little bit closer but then we were not quick enough.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are fighting now for other targets.</seg>
<seg id="20">British driver Lewis Hamilton seems too far back with 169 points in fourth, but is vital to Mercedes' bid to finish second in the constructors' race.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mercedes, with 313 points, and Ferrari, with 309, are close while Lotus is a little further back with 285.</seg>
<seg id="22">As has been the custom at most races in recent weeks, Alonso was asked whether he is still happy at Ferrari.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tensions between him and management surfaced following the Hungarian GP at the end of July.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's fantastic, obviously every weekend I repeat the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="25">"So, I guess (at the US GP) in Austin the first question in the press conference will be 'How is my relationship with the team,'" Alonso said.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was perfect, it's perfect and it will be perfect.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hamilton won the Hungarian GP to suddenly emerge as Vettel's main challenger, but his bid for a second F1 title has completely faded.</seg>
<seg id="28">While Vettel has won all six races since the midseason break, Hamilton has managed only one third-place finish.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They (Red Bull) have just raised the bar and everyone else needs to just work harder," Hamilton said.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are always lots of areas that can be improved on for me and the team and we don't want to carry any of the negatives into next year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The 2014 regulations will set the sport's engineers the challenge of completing races on a reduced fuel load.</seg>
<seg id="32">To do so, teams will switch from naturally aspirated 2.4 liter V8 engines to 1.6 liter V6 turbocharged hybrid Power Units.</seg>
<seg id="33">To achieve power outputs comparable to current levels will require a 30 percent increase in energy efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It is more of a level starting ground for everyone and you can either get it right or wrong and hopefully we can come down on the right side," Hamilton said.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Abu Dhabi GP starts in daylight and ends under floodlights, with track temperature dropping as twilight approaches.</seg>
<seg id="36">The 5.55-kilometre Yas Marina Circuit features two DRS zones which are situated on the two long back straights, and teams are expected to adopt a two-stop strategy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Glenn Davis, Beach Energy chairman.</seg>
<seg id="3">ISLAND SKY Australia has roped in SA oil and gas industry executives in its push to turn over a new leaf as a US-focused oil and gas explorer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shareholders of the former air-to-water machine maker will vote on November 21 on a series of resolutions, including a name change to Pawnee Energy, an $8 million general public offer and allotment of shares to existing and new directors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beach Energy's non-executive chairman Glenn Davis is the proposed non-executive chairman of Pawnee Energy, which has named Neil Young as chief-executive elect.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Young, who has had short stints with Santos and Adelaide Energy, is the managing director of Mongolian gas-focused company Golden Horde and director of unknown entity Santa Petroleum.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Young left AO Energy in July this year along with directors Colin Goodall and Jeremy Jebamoney to co-found Golden Horde.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cooper Energy chief operating officer and director Hector Gordon is proposed as a non-executive director along side former Sundance Energy founder Jayme McCoy and energy consultant Oliver Foster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The public offer and approvals process has been triggered by the magnitude of the change in the nature and scale of the activities under Australian Securities Exchange listing rules.</seg>
<seg id="10">Existing shareholders will get a 12.8 per cent in the newborn entity with Mr McCoy's associated entity Lateral Energy gaining a 7.8 per cent stake.</seg>
<seg id="11">Island Sky Australia has been looking for a new direction through acquisitions since last year when it sold 75 per cent of the air-to-water machines business, Island Sky Corporation, to ISC chief Richard Groden.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Groden remains a shareholder and managing director of Pawnee Energy while Island Sky Australia chairman will be a non-executive director.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shareholders will also need to approve Island Sky Australia's agreements with international company T.H. McElvain Oil and Gas LLLP to acquire prospecting rights to onshore oil and gas acreage in the US.</seg>
<seg id="14">If all resolutions are approved on November 21, Pawnee Energy will relist in December with a market capitalisation of a little over $10 million and with more than 51 million issued shares.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.</seg>
<seg id="6">We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."</seg>
<seg id="12">Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.</seg>
<seg id="14">Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.</seg>

<seg id="1">Psyching Us Out: The Promises of 'Priming'</seg>
<seg id="2">Reports of psychological experiments are journalistic favorites.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is especially true of experiments revealing the often surprising effects of "priming" on human behavior.</seg>
<seg id="4">Priming occurs when a seemingly trivial alteration in an experimental situation produces major changes in the behavior of the subjects.</seg>
<seg id="5">The classic priming experiment was one in which college students had been asked to form various sentences from a given set of words.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those in one group were given words that included several associated with older people (like bingo, gray and Florida).</seg>
<seg id="7">Those in a second group were given words with no such associations.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the linguistic exercise, each participant was instructed to leave the building by walking down a hallway.</seg>
<seg id="9">Without letting the participants know what was going on, the experimenters timed their walks down the hall.</seg>
<seg id="10">They found that those in the group given words associated with old people walked significantly slower than those in the other group.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first group had been primed to walk more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Similar experiments have revealed a cascade of priming effects, operating on a range of human behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="13">People primed with thoughts of larger numbers say they are willing to pay more for merchandise and give higher estimates of people's ages or the size of cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">Those primed by engaging in abstract thought are more willing to agree with the idea of killing one person to harvest organs to save the lives of many others, while those who have been thinking of money are less willing to help strangers who have dropped pencils.</seg>
<seg id="15">(There is now some controversy raised by experimenters who have been unable to replicate some priming effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">This needs sorting out, but the sheer number of reported effects over many years makes it unlikely that the phenomenon will turn out not to be real.)</seg>
<seg id="17">Priming experiments are fascinating to read about, provide great conversation starters, and are good reminders of how vulnerable we are to irrational forces.</seg>
<seg id="18">But much more is claimed for them.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is often said that they overturn a long entrenched view of human beings as models of rationality.</seg>
<seg id="20">A review in "The Economist" of Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking Fast and Slow" (a book that summarizes a great deal of work on priming and related phenomena) says: "As Copernicus removed the Earth from the centre of the universe and Darwin knocked humans off their biological perch, Mr Kahneman has shown that we are not the paragons of reason we assume ourselves to be."</seg>
<seg id="21">Such judgments ignore the enormous emphasis religious, philosophical, and literary writers have placed on our irrationality, and mistake homo economicus, the idealized rational actor of economic theory, for the prevailing human self-conception.</seg>
<seg id="22">Apart from grandiose claims about their philosophical significance, priming experiments are often thought to provide powerful new tools for influencing human behavior.</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial magazine Forbes and Morningstar, the investment research firm, have cited the immense practical value of what they call "behavioral economics" (a common but odd name for applications of psychological research on priming).</seg>
<seg id="24">But a closer analysis does not support such claims.</seg>
<seg id="25">The reason is that priming experiments seldom tell us how important priming is in realistic situations.</seg>
<seg id="26">We know that it has striking effects under highly simplified and controlled laboratory conditions, where the subjects are exposed only to the stimuli that the experimenters provide.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is very difficult to know how significant priming stimuli (thinking about money, large numbers, abstract questions) would be in a real-life, uncontrolled environment, where all sorts of stimuli might be conflicting with one another.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also, there is seldom any reason to think that even a strong priming effect will last very long.</seg>
<seg id="29">As Jonathan Ellis has noted, even Kahneman ignores these points when, after summarizing the walking-like-the-elderly experiment, he says: "Although you surely were not aware of it, reading this paragraph [which contained many words relating to the elderly] primed you as well."</seg>
<seg id="30">If you had needed to stand up to get a glass of water, you would have been slightly slower than usual to rise from your chair . . .</seg>
<seg id="31">John Bargh, one of the main researchers on priming, acknowledged in a 2006 article the failure to extend priming to real-life situations.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is what experimenters call the problem of "ecological validity."</seg>
<seg id="33">Priming studies, he said, had come to their "childhood's end."</seg>
<seg id="34">Now "we must seek to extend the findings of nonconscious perceptual, appraisal, motivational, and behavioral effects from our laboratories, where they have mainly been studied in isolation from each other, into the complex and noisy real world in which they all combine, somehow, to drive our actions."</seg>
<seg id="35">However, in their detailed 2012 survey of recent work on priming, Bargh and colleagues cite only laboratory experiments and a few "field experiments," where circumstances in the real world are, for a brief period, carefully controlled.</seg>
<seg id="36">There is no automatic transfer of a laboratory result to the real-world events we want to control.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the natural sciences we can typically control and probe inert bodies any way we like to yield precise quantitative measures of effects.</seg>
<seg id="38">But the complexity of humans, the interdependence of key variables, and ethical limitations on constraining human subjects make such control far less likely in the human sciences.</seg>
<seg id="39">These limits are well illustrated by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's best-selling book, Nudge.</seg>
<seg id="40">The authors begin with excellent discussions of priming and similar experimental results and then put forward numerous public policy proposals, most of them quite sensible, allegedly inspired by these results.</seg>
<seg id="41">But hardly any of their proposals depend on the results of behavioral economics.</seg>
<seg id="42">Their ideas are mostly a matter of common sense or of strategies long practiced in the business world: in giving people options (regarding decisions like retirement plans or organ donations), make the choice you prefer the default option; provide more or less information on a credit card bill depending on whether you want people to pay just the minimum each month; arrange food in a cafeteria or supermarket so the items you want chosen are most accessible.</seg>
<seg id="43">As Benjamin Friedman pointed out in his review of the book, "we don't need behavioral economics . . . to think such proposals might be helpful."</seg>
<seg id="44">Priming experiments remain important sources of information about the details of how our minds work.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's possible that they might someday yield valuable techniques for modifying real-world behavior.</seg>
<seg id="46">Here is one promising if very preliminary example.</seg>
<seg id="47">But for now claims that they have deep philosophical significance or major practical consequences have scant support.</seg>
<seg id="48">Gary Gutting is a professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, and an editor of Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews.</seg>
<seg id="49">He is the author of, most recently, "Thinking the Impossible: French Philosophy since 1960," and writes regularly for The Stone.</seg>
<seg id="50">He was recently interviewed in 3am magazine.</seg>

<seg id="2">31 October 2013 Last updated at 18:58 By Mark Ward Technology correspondent, BBC News</seg>
<seg id="3">Google has officially unveiled the latest incarnation of its flagship Nexus smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Made by LG, the handset is smaller, slimmer and lighter than the Nexus 4 but its 4.96in (126mm) touchscreen is bigger.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Nexus 5 has been developed to show off the capabilities of the new version of the Android operating system.</seg>
<seg id="6">Called Kitkat, the software has been designed to work well on both high-end smartphones and cheaper feature phones.</seg>
<seg id="7">The alliance with Google has helped bolster LG's fortunes even though, according to statistics from Gartner, it is still a long way behind rivals Samsung and Apple.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the April-to-June quarter, the consultancy indicated 3.8% of all smartphones sold were LG handsets putting the South Korean firm in third place.</seg>
<seg id="9">By contrast, Apple accounted for 18.8% of all sales and Samsung 29.7%.</seg>
<seg id="10">Memory cut</seg>
<seg id="11">The specifications for the new phone were widely leaked before it was announced on the official Google blog.</seg>
<seg id="12">The gadget shares some of the hardware from LG's G2 handset and can record and play back HD video at the full 1080p resolution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Its camera also has a rapid burst system that captures several photographs at the same time so owners can pick the best shot.</seg>
<seg id="14">The handset is due to go on sale on 1 November in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and Korea.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Nexus devices serve an important function for Google," said Ben Wood, head of research at analyst firm CCS Insight.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company collaborates closely with the chosen phone maker as it rolls out a new version of the Android operating system and this results in a 'vanilla' version of the software that acts as a reference platform for developers and tech enthusiasts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Google said a base 16GB version of the device would cost $349 in the US (£299 in the UK), unlocked and without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 32GB version should cost $399 (£339 in the UK).</seg>
<seg id="19">With Android Kitkat, Google said it had made the software use less memory so it could be used on handsets with much lower specifications than top end smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, Google has begun moving some services off Android's core software and onto its app store.</seg>
<seg id="21">Many see this as a way for it to maintain more control over the security of the software and its associated applications.</seg>

<seg id="2">Leaving the market: First home buyers now make up 13.7 per cent of loans, the lowest since 2004.</seg>

<seg id="4">Australia's housing market is experiencing its strongest run in three years, with Sydney emerging as the engine of growth for the nation.</seg>
<seg id="5">But rising prices are raising fresh concerns about worsening housing affordability after the limited breathing room delivered by the recent slump is being wiped away.</seg>
<seg id="6">Affordability constraints are increasingly being flagged as a new danger area, particularly in the country's east.</seg>
<seg id="7">The number of finance commitment for first home buyers has plunged nearly 22 per cent in the last year despite the record low interest rate, according to the Bureau of Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="8">First timers now comprise only 13.7 per cent of loans, which is their lowest market share since early 2004.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It confirms what we already know - that housing is becoming more and more unaffordable," said Jacqui Phillips of Australians for Affordable Housing.</seg>
<seg id="10">The government needs to talk about the elephant in the room which is the role the current taxation system plays in creating distortions in the housing market, including negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Capital city dwelling values rose 1.3 per cent in October, the latest in a series of solid months that has pushed the annual growth rate up to 7.9 per cent - the highest it has been since the last boom fizzled in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="12">The eastern seaboard has been the nexus of activity, with Sydney values rising 2.4 per cent in October after already increasing 2.5 per cent in September, according to new figures from RP Data-Rismark.</seg>
<seg id="13">""The strength is in those three big cites,"" analyst Cameron Kusher said.</seg>
<seg id="14">""Prices are really on a tear in Sydney, and Melbourne is not far behind."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Even Brisbane is now showing signs of growth.""</seg>
<seg id="16">The solid performance has come after years of underperformance in Sydney, where dwelling values barely kept pace with inflation, RP Data says.</seg>
<seg id="17">The run has seen Sydney values rise 9.1 per cent over their last peak.</seg>
<seg id="18">Melbourne, where the boom didn't end until mid 2010, is now experiencing a steady return to growth after flagging for several years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dwelling values rose 1.2 per cent in October after increasing 2.4 per cent the month before.</seg>
<seg id="20">It now sits just 0.8 per cent below its previous peak.</seg>
<seg id="21">""From an investors perspective, you've lost the chance to enter those markets because yields are falling.</seg>
<seg id="22">The exception is Brisbane where housing is looking a lot more affordable,"" Mr Kusher said.</seg>
<seg id="23">In Brisbane, values rose 1.4 per cent for the month but remain 8.4 per cent below their last high.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the growth is not being evenly spread around the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Dwelling values were relatively flat in Adelaide (0.3 per cent) and fell in Perth (-0.2 per cent), Canberra (-1.5 per cent) and Hobart (-2.3 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="26">Darwin's rose by 1.6 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="2">A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland 'must do better'</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 07:45</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a simple overarching message from the flurry of announcements about Royal Bank of Scotland this morning: the giant largely nationalised bank has to work harder if taxpayers are to stand a chance of getting back the £46bn they've invested in it.</seg>
<seg id="4">As expected, the chancellor has shied away from physically extracting £38bn of toxic loans sitting on RBS's balance sheet into a new so-called bad bank owned 100% by the state.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead these poor quality assets will be managed separately within RBS, and re-named RBS Capital Resolution Group.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new plan is for RBS to somehow get rid of up to 70% of this radioactive debt - which contains the worst of the bank's commercial property and Irish lending - over two years, with a hope that perhaps it can all be gone within three years.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means selling some of it at a bigger loss than would otherwise have been the case, to the mild detriment of RBS's capital, the vital financial resources it holds to cushion depositors from shocks.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the idea is that when it's all gone, RBS will feel liberated - since the sheer poisonous quality of these loans means they "consume" a whole fifth of RBS's capital, such that the relevant 20% of capital is not available to support new credit and healthy credit creation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lacking momentum</seg>
<seg id="10">RBS's board, supported by the chancellor and the regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), has also determined that the bank doesn't have quite enough capital, for three reasons.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, like most banks, it fears that the penalties, fines and compensation payments it faces from its sins during the boom years will escalate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr McEwan recognises the importance of fixing SME lending, not only for the health of the bank but for the growth prospects of the British economy</seg>
<seg id="13">End Quote</seg>
<seg id="14">That looks a shrewd judgement on a day when the US state-backed mortgage giant Fannie Mae is suing nine banks, including RBS and Barclays, over the manipulation of the Libor interest-rate benchmark, and RBS has suspended two currency traders connected to regulators' investigations into whether banks rigged the foreign exchange market.</seg>
<seg id="15">Second, RBS expects to be told by the PRA in December that it needs to hold more equity capital, following completion of a review by the regulator of the specific risks each of the biggest banks poses to UK financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="16">Third, and perhaps most embarrassingly, RBS's business in the round lacks what the bank describes as adequate "momentum" to generate the relevant capital simply by generating bigger profits.</seg>
<seg id="17">Putting these three factors together, RBS's board has determined that by the end of 2016 it needs a 12% ratio of loss-absorbing capital to assets weighted by the riskiness of individual loans on the "fully loaded" Basel lll measure (or the new international rules for how much capital banks must hold).</seg>
<seg id="18">That is a full third more capital than RBS currently holds.</seg>
<seg id="19">And it may seem a tall order for RBS to raise all that capital without asking taxpayers to supply more.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, it would probably be a resigning issue for the chancellor if his stewardship of the bank required it to receive more state aid.</seg>
<seg id="21">And RBS says it can raise the relevant capital by doing two things.</seg>
<seg id="22">It plans to accelerate the disposal of its big US bank, Citizens, by floating it on the US stock market next year, with the ambition of getting rid of all its shares in Citizens within three years.</seg>
<seg id="23">And the bank will work harder in general to remove from its balance sheet the loans and investments that consume most of its capital while contributing the least profit.</seg>
<seg id="24">New focus</seg>
<seg id="25">Does this bring the risk that RBS still won't provide the loans desperately needed by British households and businesses after many years of the bank shrinking its support for the UK economy?</seg>
<seg id="26">Some will fear it does.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, RBS's new chief executive, Ross McEwan, says he has the opposite plan in mind.</seg>
<seg id="28">He says that since his bank is no longer a weapon of lethal mass wealth and economic destruction - for which he thanks his predecessor, Stephen Hester - it can now become focused as a very British commercial bank, serving the needs of British people and companies.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr McEwan's plans can be seen as the culmination of the rolling back of so much of the expansion of RBS that took place during the boom years, under the leadership of its tarnished former chief executive, Fred Goodwin.</seg>
<seg id="30">First on the agenda is fixing the way RBS provides finance to small and medium sized enterprises (or SMEs), following the publication this morning of a damning report into the bank's performance in this economically vital activity, which it commissioned from the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir Andrew Large.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sir Andrew confirms what much of the world was saying about RBS since the crisis of 2008, that it was turning away too many businesses wanting finance and providing far less credit to small companies than it should have been doing, given its market leading position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Perhaps most important for Mr Osborne, he believes that he, the regulator and the board of RBS now all share a common belief about the direction RBS should be taking</seg>
<seg id="33">And Sir Andrew has uncovered a number of causes: the fragmentation of how SME lending was managed; unrealistic targets being set for lending; too much risk aversion by relationship managers and risk officers; and - perhaps most damningly - the inadequate skills of the lending bankers.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr McEwan recognises the importance of fixing SME lending, not only for the health of the bank but for the growth prospects of the British economy - as RBS's natural share of lending to small business should be about a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="35">It will have no place to hide when trying to mend its performance, given that the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Chambers of Commerce are launching a new and supposedly authoritative annual league table of all banks' performances supporting smaller companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">This survey will identify Britain's best small-business bank - and that would not have been RBS in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="37">Can do better</seg>
<seg id="38">But what Mr McEwan says he wants to fix goes wider.</seg>
<seg id="39">He complains that it takes longer than should be the case for anyone to open an account at RBS.</seg>
<seg id="40">In general he thinks the bank does not serve its customers well enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">In a letter to his tens of thousands of employees, he says: "We still receive far too many complaints, often on issues that would never arise if our systems and processes were more effective."</seg>
<seg id="42">And he points out that the return the bank is earning on its investment capital - its "core return on equity" - has actually been falling, in spite of a revival of the British economy.</seg>
<seg id="43">And that is not a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="44">As Mr McEwan says: "We must do better and we can do better."</seg>
<seg id="45">As for the Chancellor, George Osborne, he takes heart from a couple of things.</seg>
<seg id="46">First, the last of the special additional support that was provided to RBS to prop it up after the 2008 debacle has been unwound: a Treasury facility to provide £8bn of new capital to RBS in an emergency, which is costing the bank £300m a year, has gone a year earlier than planned.</seg>
<seg id="47">But perhaps most important for Mr Osborne, he believes that he, the regulator and the board of RBS now all share a common belief about the direction RBS should be taking.</seg>
<seg id="48">There may be another way of seeing this: all those public denials by RBS and the Treasury that they were not at loggerheads during the Hester years don't seem quite so compelling, on a morning when Mr Osborne says it's brilliant that he, RBS and the Bank of England are at last all singing the same song.</seg>

<seg id="4">The golden age of polar exploration is long gone, but that hasn't stopped adventurer Tim Jarvis from embarking on headline-capturing feats of endurance.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lisa Clausen talks to him about following in the footsteps of Ernest Shackleton.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dark was falling over the malaysian jungle as the five children tried to find their way home.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was 1978.</seg>
<seg id="8">They'd got lost on a school biology excursion and they were alone.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were tears and panic.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then one of the children, a tall English boy named Tim, spoke up.</seg>
<seg id="11">He would lead them east towards what he hoped was the coast, and then south to their school camp.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the dark his frightened classmates followed him for hours through the thick jungle, talking about ordinary things to keep calm.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then relief - they saw the lights of the camp, and a worried search party heading out to find them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-five years later, the tall boy can still remember what he realised there in the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No one else seemed to step up to the plate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">And I could see what had to be done.</seg>
<seg id="17">Out there, taking it on, you think there is nothing apart from this.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the still heart of a leafy Adelaide suburb, Tim Jarvis, adventurer, environmental scientist and restless spirit, opens his front door, his 195-centimetre frame filling the doorway.</seg>

<seg id="24">We're both in the game of trying to do simple things well and learning from those experiences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ice man â€¦ expedition leader Tim Jarvis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Photo: Ed Wardle/Shackleton Epic</seg>
<seg id="27">That's one way of describing his latest polar expedition.</seg>
<seg id="28">In January, 47-year-old Jarvis led a six-man team retracing British explorer Ernest Shackleton's legendary 1916 Southern Ocean journey.</seg>
<seg id="29">That original voyage remains a miracle of bravery, pathos and survival, which began on the way to Antarctica, when Shackleton and 27 crew were trapped aboard their ship Endurance for 10 months in the Weddell Sea as it was crushed by pack ice.</seg>
<seg id="30">When the ship finally sank, the expedition members were forced to camp for five months with little food on a drifting ice floe.</seg>
<seg id="31">Then, when the floe broke up, they made a five-day dash crammed into three lifeboats to reach uninhabited Elephant Island.</seg>
<seg id="32">From there, Shackleton and five companions set off on a 1300-kilometre odyssey in their tiny boat, chipping ice off its sails, bailing for their lives in ferocious seas, surviving monster waves and a huge storm to reach the gale-scourged island of South Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even then there was no rest: Shackleton and two of his shipmates had to cross the island's uncharted mountainous interior to reach its whaling station, with just some rope and a carpenter's adze.</seg>
<seg id="34">When they staggered into the station, 18 months after leaving civilisation, the first people who saw them fled in terror.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I have a challenge for you," Shackleton's granddaughter Alexandra said when she called Jarvis six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="36">Jarvis was still recovering after retracing the grim Antarctic journey of Australian explorer Douglas Mawson, who'd walked 500 kilometres across crevasse-ravaged terrain in 1912, exhausted and starving, after both his colleagues died.</seg>
<seg id="37">As if the trek wasn't tough enough, Jarvis had decided to do it Mawson's way, wearing replica clothing, using antiquated equipment and surviving on the same starvation rations, to see how he measured up.</seg>
<seg id="38">Weak and famished, he'd even lowered himself into a crevasse and pulled himself out, just as Mawson had.</seg>
<seg id="39">Alexandra Shackleton was impressed.</seg>
<seg id="40">Would he attempt the same for her grandfather's epic, described by Edmund Hillary as "the greatest survival story ever"?</seg>
<seg id="41">Shackleton's expedition had been a disaster, but the rescue he secured for the entire crew, as well as his resolutely optimistic and selfless leadership - "So now we'll go home" he said to his men as they watched the Endurance sink - had made the flawed, charismatic explorer a hero.</seg>
<seg id="42">No one had ever replicated Shackleton's feat, though several teams had tried.</seg>
<seg id="43">"He was compassionate and strong, calculated but daring, he was fun, he liked a drink - I think everybody wants to be Shackleton," says Jarvis.</seg>
<seg id="44">Despite it promising to be his most dangerous expedition yet, he agreed on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="45">Southern exposure â€¦ the expedition at King George Island.</seg>
<seg id="46">Photo: Tim Jarvis/Shackleton Epic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Even sitting here on his sofa in suburbia, Jarvis, imposingly tall and powerfully built, looks made for endurance.</seg>
<seg id="48">Behind him is a full bookshelf, his treasured collection of first editions of explorers' tales on the top shelf, which helps fuel a relentlessly busy mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I have always been interested in doing everything," he says.</seg>
<seg id="50">When he was a boy, Jarvis's mother would say she never knew what he would get up to next.</seg>
<seg id="51">It's still true today.</seg>
<seg id="52">Based in Adelaide as an environmental scientist for international consultancy Arup, the British-born Australian citizen has lived in six different countries and has belongings in storage around the world.</seg>
<seg id="53">He's a veteran of numerous expeditions - including walking 1100 kilometres in the first unsupported crossing of Australia's Great Victoria Desert, and a 500-kilometre crossing of an Arctic island - and holds the record for the fastest unsupported trek to the South Pole.</seg>
<seg id="54">It was so cold on that 47-day journey in 1999 that three of his teeth fillings shrank and fell out, and on 17 consecutive days he wrote in his journal, "That was the hardest day of my life."</seg>
<seg id="55">He lost nearly 20 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="56">But he was soon back for more.</seg>
<seg id="57">Antarctica had bewitched him, as had the thrill of testing his limits.</seg>
<seg id="58">"You experience life when you're there at such a different level," he says.</seg>
<seg id="59">It's just you and the place, and whatever you experience down there is pretty much about what you can bring.</seg>
<seg id="60">He has what used to be called grit, and his training in it began early.</seg>
<seg id="61">When he was seven, Jarvis's accountant father took a job in Kuala Lumpur, and moved his family from northern England to the heat of Malaysia.</seg>
<seg id="62">His parents weren't outdoor types, but their son was soon exploring the surrounding jungle with his dog Mungo, building camps and tree houses.</seg>
<seg id="63">Boarding school in the UK as a teenager, where he excelled in sport, strengthened his sense of self-sufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="64">He travelled, graduated in environmental science, but was dissatisfied: "I always had a desire to do more."</seg>
<seg id="65">Skipper Nick Bubb.</seg>
<seg id="66">When he was 29, chance intervened.</seg>
<seg id="67">He met an Olympic rower at a gym in England who was so taken by Jarvis's stamina on the rowing machine that he asked if he could train him for the indoor rowing national championships.</seg>
<seg id="68">Jarvis was a novice but agreed and came third, beating a host of elite rowers.</seg>
<seg id="69">Driving home from the competition, he had an epiphany: "I suddenly realised what I thought was pushing it was probably way back from the edge of what I was actually capable of."</seg>
<seg id="70">It made me hungry for more of that and I thought, 'Let's take it up a level and see what's there.'</seg>
<seg id="71">Soon after, the polar regions, so alien after the lush tropics of his youth, caught his eye.</seg>
<seg id="72">Keeping his promise to Alexandra Shackleton began with four fraught years organising permits, sponsors and insurance for the $1.1 million expedition.</seg>
<seg id="73">"Initially the euphoria of having been asked carried the day," he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">In my quieter moments, however, I was often daunted at the prospect of what lay ahead.</seg>
<seg id="75">From the outset, though his own sailing experience was limited, Jarvis was determined to do it as Shackleton had.</seg>
<seg id="76">Shackleton's vessel, the James Caird, was a basic wooden lifeboat, just under seven metres long, with an open cockpit and, crucially, no keel.</seg>
<seg id="77">Jarvis's boat, the Alexandra Shackleton, was built almost identically.</seg>
<seg id="78">To sail her, Jarvis picked five men (the Shackleton family ruled out the inclusion of women for historical accuracy) with a striking pedigree, including world speed-sailing record-holder Paul Larsen, the Royal Marines' mountain leader chief instructor Barry Gray, and, as skipper, round-the-world sailor Nick Bubb.</seg>
<seg id="79">They wore replica clothing - heavy woollen jumpers and gabardine outers, which proved useless at keeping them dry and were guaranteed to weigh them down if they'd gone overboard.</seg>
<seg id="80">Their vintage equipment included a sextant and a compass.</seg>
<seg id="81">They would have to navigate the world's stormiest ocean by the sun, the stars and instinct.</seg>
<seg id="82">Bosun Seb Coulthard.</seg>
<seg id="83">Littered with icebergs, pounded by gale-force winds, Antarctica's Southern Ocean is brutal, grey and lethally cold, with water temperatures hovering around two degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="84">End up in it and you have maybe 10 minutes before hypothermia paralyses your limbs.</seg>
<seg id="85">Setting off from Elephant Island on January 23, for 12 days the Alexandra Shackleton lurched her way across the sea in swells of up to eight metres, waves sometimes towering over its mast.</seg>
<seg id="86">It was just as unpleasant below cover where, with no bunks or toilet, the men ate and slept squashed together under damp reindeer-skin blankets in a space the size of a double bed.</seg>
<seg id="87">"There was a lot of spooning," laughs Jarvis.</seg>
<seg id="88">The pemmican meals, a mix of lard and beef seasoning which Shackleton's team relied on, were foul.</seg>
<seg id="89">Temperatures outside swung between zero and minus five.</seg>
<seg id="90">There were moments of beauty, with whales surfacing and albatross hanging on the wind, just as they did for Shackleton.</seg>
<seg id="91">But mostly it was hard and horrible.</seg>
<seg id="92">"We could have laid down in a puddle and not been any wetter," says navigator Paul Larsen.</seg>
<seg id="93">But when we were miserable and didn't want to be there, we knew we were probably doing it right.</seg>
<seg id="94">Seasick and drenched, the crew had no way of knowing how close they were to South Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="95">And yet, says Jarvis, "When you are out there, taking it on, you think there is nothing apart from this - we're surviving in this place and doing it ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="96">It's liberating in a funny sort of way.</seg>
<seg id="97">Without a keel, their boat was unstable, tricky to manoeuvre and couldn't sail upwind, let alone turn around in bad weather to rescue anyone.</seg>
<seg id="98">They knew from sea trials before setting off that if it capsized, their only hope would be for anyone inside to flood the cabin to increase ballast and pray for a big wave to right it.</seg>
<seg id="99">For those in the water, there would be no keel to hold onto.</seg>
<seg id="100">And though their support vessel Australis was only 20 nautical miles behind, ready to intervene in an emergency, the team knew the chances of it finding anyone in the water, particularly in a storm or at night, were slim.</seg>
<seg id="101">Each time they clambered out of the damp pile of sleeping bodies to take the helm, the thought struck them that going overboard was a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="102">Yet they rarely used their life jackets - almost impossible to find in the chaos below but more importantly, says Jarvis, "It just didn't seem in the spirit of it."</seg>
<seg id="103">Mountaineer Barry Gray.</seg>
<seg id="104">Despite the shadow of their support vessel, and the emergency survival suits stored on board, staying true to the spirit of what Shackleton and his men went through was a point of honour.</seg>
<seg id="105">Larsen was often at the helm in the icy darkness where, with no external lighting on the ship, his only way of checking the compass was by candlelight.</seg>
<seg id="106">More than once, the candle went out.</seg>
<seg id="107">He would call out for a match, and down below, his sleeping crew mates would stir.</seg>
<seg id="108">But in a cramped cabin lit only by a vintage oil lantern, they weren't much help.</seg>
<seg id="109">"They're rooting around in the dark, everyone sitting on everyone else, and an hour later you're still waiting for that match," says Larsen.</seg>
<seg id="110">And you're thinking, really, a single battery could fix this whole trip.</seg>
<seg id="111">The life jackets did go on when they finally reached South Georgia in fog and rough seas.</seg>
<seg id="112">Like the original expedition, the Alexandra Shackleton only just avoided disaster on the island's perilous coast.</seg>
<seg id="113">When they landed a century ago, Shackleton, navigator Frank Worsley and Tom Crean, leaving three crew mates exhausted on the beach, got lucky with a full moon and rare clear weather.</seg>
<seg id="114">Without maps, tent or climbing gear, they pushed themselves on for 35 kilometres across the island's glaciers and 3000-metre peaks to Stromness whaling station.</seg>
<seg id="115">Shackleton didn't sleep once on the 36-hour journey.</seg>
<seg id="116">Jarvis and his team, meanwhile, were pinned down for several days on the beach, then in the mountains, by gusting 85-knot winds and zero visibility.</seg>
<seg id="117">They had to resort to a tent.</seg>
<seg id="118">At that point, when it seemed everything might unravel, Jarvis focused on staying upbeat, which he believes is the secret to every successful expedition.</seg>
<seg id="119">"The worse things became for us, the more I convinced myself that was the way it should be," he says.</seg>
<seg id="120">In the end, with navy officer Seb Coulthard, skipper Bubb and expedition cameraman Ed Wardle sidelined with trench foot (similar to frostbite), it was Jarvis, Gray and Larsen who set off in awful weather.</seg>
<seg id="121">On land, Jarvis was back in his element.</seg>
<seg id="122">"He was like the Energiser bunny - he just kept going," says Larsen.</seg>
<seg id="123">Cameraman Ed Wardle.</seg>
<seg id="124">Ninety-six hours later, the spent trio reached the former whaling station.</seg>
<seg id="125">It was 19 gruelling days since they'd left Elephant Island.</seg>
<seg id="126">They had made history of their own, though Jarvis, who has just published a book about the expedition, Shackleton's Epic: Recreating the World's Greatest Journey of Survival, is under no illusions that Shackleton's was the greater victory.</seg>
<seg id="127">There was no safety net 100 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="128">Instead Shackleton had 22 men on a lonely island depending on him, eating albatross eggs, packing their kit each morning in hope of rescue, and sleeping huddled together under their upturned boats.</seg>
<seg id="129">He was the first to leap off the rescue boat when it finally arrived at Elephant Island.</seg>
<seg id="130">"They were iron men," says Jarvis, "and their journey was brave, audacious and utterly incredible - an example for all of us of what can be achieved if we show belief, endurance and work together."</seg>
<seg id="131">Did you have a good time on your boat, Daddy?</seg>
<seg id="132">Will asked when Jarvis arrived home.</seg>
<seg id="133">Not many children can take their father to kindy and introduce him as an explorer.</seg>
<seg id="134">But family life and the dangers of expeditions are not an easy mix.</seg>
<seg id="135">The families of Shackleton's men waited months for news of their fate; this time there were daily</seg>
<seg id="136">updates from the expedition's blogger on board the Australis.</seg>
<seg id="137">When Jarvis trudged into Stromness, wearing the clothes he'd set sail in, he could call his family straight away.</seg>
<seg id="138">His wife, Elizabeth, a high-school English teacher who first met Jarvis as a five-year-old when he was a friend of her older brother, stayed in Adelaide with Will and Jack, 2, and waited out the expedition with "a mix of trust, denial and choosing not to think about what could happen."</seg>
<seg id="139">She adds: "It would be very easy to get incredibly stressed about it."</seg>
<seg id="140">For his part, fatherhood has made Jarvis more aware of risk.</seg>
<seg id="141">But he rates the recent collision he had with a bus while cycling in Adelaide as more dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="142">You never go on these trips thinking you are going to die.</seg>
<seg id="143">Navigator Paul Larsen.</seg>
<seg id="144">He's more preoccupied with making the leap from Antarctica, with its siren call of intensity and self-reliance, back to the trivia and extravagance of modern life.</seg>
<seg id="145">You have two choices - you can either go back there and spend more and more time there where you think things are more real, or you develop a coping mechanism back here.</seg>
<seg id="146">His tactic is throwing himself into exploring everyday life, which means his family, learning the drums and photography, a summer climbing trip in Tasmania, even riding a different route to the post office.</seg>
<seg id="147">He plans to expand his environmental advocacy, perhaps write a book on leadership, and has two expedition ideas brewing - a journey up the great rivers of Papua New Guinea, possibly to look for thylacines, and a trek in the north Canadian wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="148">Nothing annoys him more than when people ask him if he's done with the Antarctic.</seg>
<seg id="149">Now that I have experienced it, why on earth would I try to exorcise it?</seg>
<seg id="150">It's not something you grow out of.</seg>
<seg id="151">You want to keep reacquainting yourself with it.</seg>
<seg id="152">Shackleton, who died of a heart attack in 1922 on the day he returned to South Georgia for another expedition, had the good fortune to be alive in the golden era of polar exploration, when there were still maps to be drawn and an adoring public that feted explorers, dead or alive, as national heroes.</seg>
<seg id="153">"He was a man who lived life on the largest stage he could find," says Jarvis.</seg>
<seg id="154">He's happy to have avoided that grand spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="155">"I don't feel as though I am an exceptional person - I just decided to go and try to do things," he says.</seg>
<seg id="156">But like those iron men of old, he is driven to push himself as far as he can.</seg>
<seg id="157">He still dreams at night of the ice.</seg>
<seg id="158">He is still that 12-year-old schoolboy who watched night fall over the jungle and thought, "Let's see if I can do this."</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 11:43</seg>
<seg id="3">A man who admitted sexually abusing a young boy and girl has been jailed for six years and five months.</seg>
<seg id="4">Leslie Low, 59, began sexually and physically abusing the boy when he was aged nine.</seg>
<seg id="5">The attacks happened between 1997 and 2003 in Glasgow and Girvan.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also attempted to rape the girl once in Girvan when she was six years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the High Court in Glasgow, temporary judge Sean Murphy QC described Low as "despicable."</seg>
<seg id="8">Low will be monitored for two years after his release.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cruel and degrading</seg>
<seg id="10">Jailing Low, judge Murphy told him: "You have committed appalling and despicable crimes."</seg>
<seg id="11">""You abused this boy in a shameful manner for your own sexual gratification.</seg>
<seg id="12">Your treatment of him was cruel and degrading.</seg>
<seg id="13">You also abused a young girl on one occasion.</seg>
<seg id="14">Judge Murphy told Low he would have jailed him for eight years, but for his early guilty plea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The court heard how Low grabbed the boy by the throat and then abused him while saying: "Shush, it will be alright."</seg>
<seg id="16">The young victim was told to keep the abuse a secret and when he was interviewed by police and asked how many times he was abused he said: "Too many to count."</seg>
<seg id="17">The boy, who is now in his 20s, said that he felt helpless during the years of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="18">The court was told that both of Low's victims had been left traumatised by what he did to them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall</seg>
<seg id="2">Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.</seg>
<seg id="5">Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
<seg id="12">But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.</seg>
<seg id="15">Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.</seg>
<seg id="19">That will happen all through the flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15," said Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="25">Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.</seg>
<seg id="30">The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="35">The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law</seg>
<seg id="2">"It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government "a stranglehold over the media," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "dealt a major blow" and lambasted the bill as "draconian."</seg>
<seg id="7">The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.</seg>
<seg id="10">Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."</seg>
<seg id="13">It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."</seg>
<seg id="14">By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.</seg>
<seg id="18">In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax on foreign property owners to burst London's bubble</seg>
<seg id="2">The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Cook said: "Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system."</seg>
<seg id="5">"But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning "domestic market" with the city's south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills.</seg>

<seg id="2">Shares in Macquarie Group climbed to their highest level in four years after the investment bank's half year profit rose by 39 per cent to $501 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">Macquarie has also pointed to a stronger full year result, lifted its dividend payment and decided to transfer its holding in Sydney Airport directly to its shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="4">The shares hit a high of $53.44 on Friday, their highest value since October 2009, before closing at $53.10, up $2.06, or four per cent.</seg>
<seg id="5">Macquarie's net profit in the six months to September 30 was up from $361 million last year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chief executive Nicholas Moore said its annuity business recorded a 24 per cent increase in profit, while earnings from the capital markets business also rose significantly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The improved performance was likely to continue into the second half of the bank's financial year, assuming market conditions do not deteriorate significantly, he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We think for the full year the group will be up on where we were last year," Mr Moore said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Improving share markets and corporate activity have boosted Macquarie's performance, and it is well positioned to take advantage of the pick up in markets over the medium term, he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company will pay interim dividend of $1 per share, up from 75 cents for the same time last year.</seg>
<seg id="11">It will also distribute its holding in Sydney Airport directly to shareholders, who will receive one Sydney Airport share for every Macquarie share they own.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morningstar analyst David Ellis said the result suggested Macquarie was rebounding after underperforming in recent years due to weakness in stock markets.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The strong operating performance and the Sydney Airport distribution confirms our positive view and suggests Macquarie is on the way back to doing what it does best - taking full advantage of the recovery in equity and investment markets," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Ellis expects Macquarie's full year profit to grow by more than 25 per cent to almost $1.1 billion, which would be its largest annual profit since the global financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="4">In his first sit-down interview since being appointed Parramatta coach, Arthur told News Limited his team would play next season with "an attitude of win-at-all-costs.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's a new time for Parramatta.</seg>
<seg id="6">Arthur said he was keen to make the Eels a rugby league powerhouse again.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reminded Parramatta had claimed two successive wooden spoons, Arthur said: "Yeah, well we won't be getting three . . . we definitely won't be getting three wooden spoons."</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked how he could be so certain, Arthur said: "Number one, the young blokes that are here who have come through the club in the last 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then we have the new players like Nathan Peats, Corey Norman, Lee Mossop and Will Hopoate.</seg>
<seg id="10">And then you mix that with Jarryd Hayne, who has averaged 12 or 14 games over the past couple of years.</seg>
<seg id="11">We want to make sure we get him nice and fit, nice and strong and playing his best footy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Timmy Mannah, Joseph Paulo, Luke Kelly - there's good talent already here.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will be training all pre-season with a positive attitude and come round one we are in the same position as everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="14">Everyone is fighting to make the top eight and our goal won't be any different.</seg>
<seg id="15">We want to make sure we are taking the field with an attitude of win at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="16">I know we won't win ­every game but we need to make sure we have a winning attitude.</seg>
<seg id="17">Daily Telegraph sports editor-at-large Phil Rothfield says he is disgusted with the behaviour of Sam Burgess and the inconsequential penalty handed to him for his hit on Sam Thaiday.</seg>
<seg id="18">We want the fans to know that every week we will be playing with passion and that we're playing for our logo and our fans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Parramatta players have been sapped of confidence in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="20">Aside from wooden spoons, despondent players have been forced to contend with sacked coaches, axed CEOs and fractured boards.</seg>
<seg id="21">Arthur said the club is now only looking forward.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We have new players, it's a new time for Parramatta, a new coach and I have my own philosophies and style," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">I know we won't be re-living or talking about what has happened here in the past.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's about what is going to happen and everything is going to be positive from here on.</seg>
<seg id="25">Parramatta are classic under-achievers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Four premierships in 66 years - all crammed in six years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Everyone is asking me why do I want to go back to Parramatta," he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">The obvious answer to people is that I want to coach an NRL team.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's more than that.</seg>
<seg id="30">I played all my juniors here, I played SG Ball here, under-21s, a bit of reserve grade.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is more to me than just a job - it is a passion.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Vampire facials:" A spooky-sounding way to rejuvenate skin?</seg>
<seg id="2">In the quest against aging, some people are turning to the same substance vampires use to stay young forever: blood.</seg>
<seg id="3">They're not drinking it, but getting injections of blood plasma in their faces in a process nicknamed "vampire facials," CBS News' Teresa Garcia reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">Results last six months to a year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Technicians draw a vial of a patients blood which is then spun in a centrifuge, to separate red blood cells from plasma, which is then smeared into tiny holes poked in the patient's skin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Paul Nassif, a plastic surgeon at Spalding Drive Plastic Surgery and Dermatology in Beverly Hills, told CBS News the procedure helps reduce pore size and helps with fine lines to rejuvenate the skin.</seg>
<seg id="7">You're aging.</seg>
<seg id="8">You're on a conveyor belt, and the bottom line is when you do this procedure, we pick you up on the conveyor belt and move you back," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kim Kardashian underwent the procedure on "Kourtney and Kim Take Miami" in March, CBS Miami reported at the time.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is controversy with this treatment," her physician, Dr. Julio Gallo of the Miami Institute for Age Management, said in March.</seg>
<seg id="11">Is it the panacea for aging?</seg>
<seg id="12">No.</seg>
<seg id="13">Or a replacement for a facelift?</seg>
<seg id="14">But, is it a good treatment for maintaining and looking fresh and new?</seg>
<seg id="15">It is.</seg>
<seg id="16">The platelets found in the plasma contain substances called "growth factors" that are supposed to activate and rejuvenate cells, explained Dr. Jennifer Walden, an aesthetic plastic surgeon based in Texas, to CBSNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="17">Walden is currently involved in research of one plasma treatment combined with lasers, which she says shows promise.</seg>
<seg id="18">"However, the efficacy and safety of (platelet-rich plasma) for cosmetic treatment have not been extensively studied in controlled clinical trials," she said in an email.</seg>
<seg id="19">The good news is there is very little risk for rejection, infection or an allergic reaction using one's own cells as a skin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The procedure costs about $2,000, but not all experts are convinced it will help the skin.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It makes no clinical sense that this would help at all," New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Michele Green, told CBSNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="22">I think it's literally crazy.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent skin aging, she points out people can wear sunscreen and reduce their time in the sun, eat a healthy diet or use moisturizing products.</seg>
<seg id="24">She adds that $2,000 could purchase other more widely used laser and chemical skin rejuvenation treatments, or injections of FDA-approved products such as Botox, Restylane and Sculptra.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Lots of things you can do to turn back the clock instead of putting blood in your face," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings powers back to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels" regulatory approach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama, al-Maliki to address Iraq's violence spike at White House</seg>
<seg id="2">Nuri al-Maliki expected to ask for assistance like weapons, intelligence-sharing</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 6,000 civilians have been killed in attacks there this year</seg>
<seg id="4">U.S. senators blame Iraq's prime minister for security problems</seg>
<seg id="5">Washington (CNN) -- Iraq's prime minister, facing an insurgent al Qaeda affiliate and sectarian strife, will appeal to President Barack Obama on Friday for new assistance from the United States, even as some lawmakers question Nuri al-Maliki's ability to lead his nation.</seg>
<seg id="6">A fresh rise in suicide bombers affiliated with al Qaeda has left more than 6,000 people dead this year alone, according to United Nations estimates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Violence has been on the upswing: On Wednesday, a suicide bomber killed at least nine people and wounded 25 others at a police checkpoint west of Mosul.</seg>
<seg id="8">Al-Maliki is expected to ask for assistance in the form of weapons, equipment and intelligence-sharing in a bid to quell the bloodshed, two years after the United States withdrew almost all its troops from Iraq after Baghdad refused to renew a security agreement to extend legal immunity for American forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">A bipartisan group of senators harshly criticized al-Maliki in a letter to Obama on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">They wrote that the recent security deterioration in Iraq was partially the Prime Minister's fault, citing what they cast as an exclusionary government.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Unfortunately, Prime Minister Maliki's mismanagement of Iraqi politics is contributing to the recent surge of violence," the senators wrote.</seg>
<seg id="12">Signatories included Republicans John McCain, James Inhofe and Bob Corker and Democrats Carl Levin and Robert Menendez.</seg>
<seg id="13">"By too often pursuing a sectarian and authoritarian agenda, Prime Minister Maliki and his allies are disenfranchising Sunni Iraqis, marginalizing Kurdish Iraqis, and alienating the many Shia Iraqis who have a democratic, inclusive, and pluralistic vision for their country," the lawmakers continued.</seg>
<seg id="14">Al-Maliki and Iraqi officials met with Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday and Thursday in Washington, where they discussed the current threats.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, the Iraqi prime minister said in a speech that he was looking for greater support from the United States in ending the violence in his nation.</seg>
<seg id="16">We are talking with the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are telling them we need to benefit from their experience, from the intelligence information, from training for those who are targeting al Qaeda in a developed, technical, scientific way," he said at the United States Institute of Peace.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Friday, Obama and al-Maliki will continue to hash out ways for Iraq to better counter fighters associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, an al Qaeda-affiliated group whose leader is thought to be based in war-torn Syria.</seg>
<seg id="19">That effort could include some equipment and weapons sales, and the sharing of intelligence, according to a senior U.S. administration official, who said Iraq's current resources don't allow the nation to effectively target al Qaeda insurgents in the western part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. supports separate weapons and air defense systems in Iraq, and a delivery of U.S. F-16 fighter jets is still planned for next fall, the official said, noting that Iraq had just submitted a deposit of more than $600 million after signing a contract last year for them.</seg>
<seg id="21">U.S. officials are also asking Iraq to do more to end Iranian shipments to Syria's regime that utilize Iraqi airspace, a request originally made by Secretary of State John Kerry seven months ago during a surprise visit to Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We'd like them to do more," the official said of Iraq's progress on ending the over-flights from Iran.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who Made That Referee Shirt?</seg>
<seg id="2">Jens Mortensen for The New York Times</seg>
<seg id="3">"In the early days of football, the officials wore white dress shirts, often with a bow tie and usually a beret-type hat," says Paul Lukas, editor of the Uni Watch blog, which chronicles sartorial trends in sports.</seg>
<seg id="4">The notion was that a formally dressed gentleman has an air of authority, and that's what you want in an official.</seg>
<seg id="5">The trouble was that some teams also dressed in white, including a group of Arizona football players.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 1920, a quarterback passed a ball to a referee named Lloyd Olds, after mistaking his white shirt for a team uniform.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mix-up so bothered Olds, the story goes, that he appealed to a friend - George Moe, proprietor of a sporting goods store - to make an eye-catching shirt that would set him apart from the players.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fans hated it.</seg>
<seg id="9">When Olds first wore the black-and-white-striped shirt in 1921, he "received plenty of boos from the crowd, " he told an interviewer.</seg>
<seg id="10">And yet the design caught on because it did, in fact, distinguish the ref from the players.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some footballers tried to tinker with the iconic design, Lukas says.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the early 1960s, the American Football League embraced a flamboyant shirt for its refs that featured tomato-red stripes.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was the era in which TV screens went color, and A.F.L. officials seem to have been caught up in the enthusiasm for the new technology.</seg>
<seg id="14">But when the A.F.L. ceased to exist, so, too, did the shirts.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's an effective design," says Lukas of the classic zebra stripe.</seg>
<seg id="16">It functions just the way Lloyd Olds wanted it to.</seg>
<seg id="17">Besides, now it's tradition.</seg>
<seg id="18">At this point, we have almost a century's worth of strong visual associations with officials in black stripes, and it's hard to see that changing.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for Olds himself, he once wistfully remarked on his own anonymity: "If I had been a celebrity like Arnold Palmer," he said in 1981, just before his death, "I might have gotten my name on the shirt."</seg>
<seg id="20">Walter Day pioneered the practice of officiating at video-game competitions in a referee uniform.</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you begin wearing the ref shirt?</seg>
<seg id="22">It was January 1983 when my video-game parlor, Twin Galaxies, hosted history's first major video-game championship.</seg>
<seg id="23">This was filmed by the TV show "That's Incredible" at the Twin Galaxies on Main Street in Ottumwa, Iowa.</seg>
<seg id="24">Why would a video-game competition need a ref?</seg>
<seg id="25">After all, the games themselves display the score.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are switches inside the game; if you throw the switches you can make the play easier or more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the referee has to verify the settings of the game and make sure that the person is not cheating.</seg>
<seg id="28">Did the ref shirt become your version of Clark Kent's Superman outfit?</seg>
<seg id="29">Sure.</seg>
<seg id="30">Once I was at the Fun Spot video-game event in New Hampshire, and I was walking around in a sweatshirt, and then suddenly I whipped it off and changed into my referee shirt, and there was this ripple that went through the room.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was a major transformation in their psychology.</seg>
<seg id="32">Is it true that you donated your original ref shirt to the Smithsonian?</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2005, I packed up the shirt and addressed it to the Smithsonian Video Game History Collection.</seg>
<seg id="34">The spirit of the action was tongue-in-cheek because I knew that collection didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="35">And what happened next - I've never told anybody this before - is that the Smithsonian promptly sent the shirt back to me with a confused letter saying, "We don't have any collection like this."</seg>

<seg id="1">Time saved, but Gay can't say how much</seg>
<seg id="2">Unable to estimate: Duncan Gay.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Brock Perks</seg>
<seg id="4">Motorists who now drive for free along the M4 will face tolls of more than $4 each way in four years, but the government cannot say how much time they will save when the road is widened.</seg>
<seg id="5">Roads Minister Duncan Gay was incapable of providing the estimate on Thursday, as he defended the government's refusal to release estimates of how many people will use the $11.5 billion WestConnex motorway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Internal workings had never been made public for road construction and "nor are we going to do it in this case to make certain sections of the media happy," Mr Gay said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was speaking after an industry briefing on Thursday, where he announced that Business Council of Australia president Tony Shepherd would chair a new government authority to deliver the WestConnex project.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first stage opened to the public will be the existing M4 motorway widened to four lanes in each direction between Church Street, Parramatta, and Homebush Bay Drive, Concord.</seg>
<seg id="9">This motorway is at present free, but it will have a maximum toll of $3.90 when it is widened by 2017, expressed in 2013 currency rates.</seg>
<seg id="10">With inflation, that will rise above $4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Asked how much time motorists would save in return for the toll, Mr Gay initially said "the first stage will not have a $3.90 toll on it," even though the figure was included in his press release.</seg>
<seg id="12">He then said motorists would enjoy a time saving, but could not quantify it.</seg>
<seg id="13">There will be a time saving because one of the biggest pinch points at the moment is that section around about James Ruse Drive.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Putting the extra two lanes through there will remove that key pinch point and it will be a faster trip," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">A spokesman for the Sydney Motorways Project Office later said estimated time savings would be in an environmental assessment, to be exhibited next year.</seg>
<seg id="16">The government has still not finalised its plans and was keen to tell the finance and construction industry it was open to changing its mind on some aspects.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme</seg>
<seg id="2">Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters stood to personally benefit from policies.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.</seg>
<seg id="10">Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting?</seg>
<seg id="11">"We need to have a better system," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Why is it that we shouldn't have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night?</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't like it?</seg>
<seg id="15">In this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take "very seriously" his new job.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public office is about public service.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We seek no reward, except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They absolutely think their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.</seg>
<seg id="8">They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="11">What was the cause of death?</seg>
<seg id="12">Was his death the result of a crime?</seg>
<seg id="13">Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will follow the facts wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="15">My objective is to discovery the truth.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists" for a formal investigation, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."</seg>
<seg id="18">A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.</seg>
<seg id="21">A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="22">A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The teenager's parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag review</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a sketchy opening as, while the fundamentals are as decent as ever, there is little forward momentum to what you are doing, just busywork as the game continuously trots out its side quests as main tasks.</seg>
<seg id="3">By the time you are schlepping around an island with the direction to "shoot an iguana" and "air assassinate an ocelot" you wonder where all of this is going.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then you see.</seg>
<seg id="5">Out into the big blue, as you are handed over full control of your galleon the Jackdaw.</seg>
<seg id="6">A marvellous vessel, sweeping out to water as your closed city becomes open sea.</seg>
<seg id="7">Suddenly the side quests make sense, the threat of the same bloat that scuppered Assassin's Creed III cut away by a sense of purpose.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's not that there is less to do in Black Flag, far from it, just that it now largely pulls in the same direction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kenway initially has no higher cause, no grand ideas or creed, just the base motivating factor of plundering as much booty as he can.</seg>
<seg id="10">So you will chase flyaway sea shanty song-sheets as they flutter on the breeze, your loyal crew belting out a chorus line of "Sally Brown" and "Drunken Sailor" as you sweep along Caribbean waters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hunting and harpooning beasts of the deep, stringing up your prizes and selling the blubber on for gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finding treasure maps and digging up hidden chests.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hastily scrawled messages shoved into bottles can be found on island shorelines.</seg>
<seg id="14">British and Spanish ships patrol the seas to be sunk or plundered.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its enabled by a fabulously generous interpretation of 18th Century sailing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Jackdaw is heavy and bulky enough to feel substantial, but lithe enough to spin on a sixpence.</seg>
<seg id="17">Combat is a thrilling game of cat and mouse, sidling alongside your quarry and letting loose the cannons, ramming them head on, or firing mortars from a distance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Weaken their galleon and swoop aboard in a pleasingly seamless switch from seafaring to sword-fighting, gut the captain and either claim the ship for your own, use its wreckage to repair the Jackdaw or convince the crew to join your ranks.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's exhilarating stuff, helped along by the fact that pirates are curiously underserved in video games, and there's a satisfying structure in conquering the seas.</seg>
<seg id="20">The map is split into 11 sections of Caribbean waters, each guarded by a naval fort, a looming island of heavily armed grey walls.</seg>
<seg id="21">Assault the fort by land and sea, and you will then claim the area, clearing it of enemy ships and revealing any nearby secret treasures.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is a shame that its main quest and narrative is not so well served.</seg>
<seg id="23">Once again the historical jaunt is a simulation within a modern day VR rig called the Animus.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the present you play a new employee at Abstergo Entertainment, a company creating virtual reality video games based on the memories of Assassin descendants.</seg>
<seg id="25">While you will spend most of the game within the Animus exploring the Caribbean, the game will occasionally pull you out of the simulation to poke around the Abstergo offices at the behest of a shady IT technician.</seg>
<seg id="26">These present day sections are not as frequent as in previous games, but no more welcome, ripping you from your pirating for a brief but tedious first-person sojourn through a hi-tech skyscraper.</seg>
<seg id="27">These interruptions do not help Kenway's tale, which comes perilously close to incoherence as it is.</seg>
<seg id="28">What starts as a conglomerate of pirates trying to make a life for themselves outside of the laws of the British and Spanish on the island of Nassau eventually comes across the everlasting war between the Assassins and Templars.</seg>
<seg id="29">The main problem is a lack of cogency and a failure to convincingly translate the passing of time.</seg>
<seg id="30">One minute you are a new captain of a stolen ship, the next you are descending on an assassin encampment, the next it is months later and you are best mates with Edward "Blackbeard" Thatch trying to find medicine for... something or other.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is exacerbated by main missions that often have a tenuous link to the plot at hand, not to mention that you will have played at least a dozen hours before the game has stopped passing off side mission tutorials as story quests.</seg>
<seg id="32">At one point I was instructed in the art of assaulting those naval forts, despite the fact I had already claimed around a third of the Caribbean sea by bringing the islands under my flag.</seg>
<seg id="33">And when they break out of this template, the missions are rarely as good as they should be.</seg>
<seg id="34">Too often the game will require you to tail a group of adversaries as they blather on, you needing to stay within a certain distance to hear, but not being able to listen as you concentrate on staying out of sight and avoiding the game's questionable fail states.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are some notable highlights.</seg>
<seg id="36">Threading your ship through a darkened bayou as you approach your target of Charles-Towne, stopping off along the way to sabotage British alarm bells.</seg>
<seg id="37">Stalking through a jungle temple armed with blow-darts that send your foes to sleep or turn them against each other, rescuing assassin comrades and putting their captors to the sword.</seg>
<seg id="38">Using a diving bell to plunge into the deep and find the treasures below.</seg>
<seg id="39">No, wait, that one's a side mission again.</seg>
<seg id="40">But they are the highlights.</seg>
<seg id="41">The apparent distractions that together become the main attraction.</seg>
<seg id="42">Black Flag is a good game not because of its meandering plot or lumbering main missions, but because of its invigorating interpretation of swashbuckling on the high seas.</seg>
<seg id="43">A thrilling pirate's life for us.</seg>

<seg id="1">Should you buy a home or continue to rent?</seg>
<seg id="2">QUESTION: My wife and I are in our late 50s with fixed passive income of $50,000 a year from the sale of a business, until 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">We have $300,000 in bank deposits, $60,000 in managed investments.</seg>
<seg id="4">We have a guaranteed annuity income of $42,000 for life from an overseas pension from 65.</seg>
<seg id="5">No debt, now renting for $450 a week.</seg>
<seg id="6">Should we buy a home or enjoy life?</seg>
<seg id="7">Would a bank finance any home purchase without us having a job?</seg>
<seg id="8">ANSWER: Whether to purchase a home or continue to rent will be governed by two key criteria: how much income you need in retirement and how much a property will cost to buy in the area you plan to live.</seg>
<seg id="9">Once you have a clear understanding of your income needs, you will then be in a position to determine how much of your savings you will be able to allocate to a home purchase.</seg>
<seg id="10">The income on the overseas pension will likely be taxable in Australia so be mindful of this and ensure you are declaring the income received correctly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Without knowing your income needs, you can't calculate what you need to commit to servicing a debt.</seg>
<seg id="12">If we assume your living expenses were about $40,000 a year, you'd have $360,000 in investments and $150,000 in the vendor finance loan you have extended.</seg>
<seg id="13">You could buy a home with a deposit of about $340,000 and service a debt to a level you are comfortable with.</seg>
<seg id="14">If your expenses were substantially more, this would compromise what you can afford to spend on a home.</seg>
<seg id="15">If you have insufficient savings to buy a property in the area you plan to live in, you would need to consider the cost of renting as against the cost of a mortgage.</seg>
<seg id="16">A bank cannot discriminate against lending money on the basis of age.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its criteria for lending will be determined by how much you need to borrow and how you demonstrate your ability to service the debt and across what time period.</seg>
<seg id="18">Banks will treat guaranteed lifetime annuities as income.</seg>
<seg id="19">They will still want to ensure the loan can be repaid in your lifetime and will set terms accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you decide not to buy, you should invest your funds as tax effectively as possible for the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">Given you are under 65, you should use the super system to your advantage.</seg>
<seg id="22">Until 65, you can make contributions without satisfying a work test.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can contribute $150,000 a year each as a personal contribution or $450,000 each three years until 65.</seg>
<seg id="24">Income received from an allocated pension post-60 is tax-free and has tax advantages from age 55 to 60.</seg>
<seg id="25">Whether you buy a home or not, it is likely you will qualify into the future for the age pension.</seg>
<seg id="26">Get advice to make sure you are aware of the consequences of making either decision.</seg>

<seg id="1">Call for calm as thousands of WA Year 12 students start exams</seg>
<seg id="2">Eyes down: Thousands of WA Year 12 students begin their final WACE exams today.</seg>
<seg id="3">THOUSANDS of WA school leavers will start their end-of-year exams today - as experts urge them to keep calm during the most stressful time in their schooling lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 15,500 students will sit exams in the WA Certificate of Education this year, including 13,400 pupils who will sit them in four or more courses.</seg>
<seg id="5">The students are mostly in Year 12, but candidates range in age from 14 to 79.</seg>
<seg id="6">Modern History, Animal Production Systems and Physics are the first written exams to be sat today.</seg>
<seg id="7">WACE exams conclude on Friday, November 22 with Food Science and Technology and Italian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Recently, The Sunday Times revealed that schools were urging students to fill out ``worry slips," join `No Facebook Clubs' and make use of `wellbeing packs' to combat the stress of Year 12 exams.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the lead-up to the WA Certificate of Education written exams, experts had warned parents to help break the ``catastrophic thinking cycle" in the traditionally stressful time for students.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schools had also turned to new ways to alleviate the anxiety around exams, including Presbyterian Ladies' College, which has introduced ``worry slips" for students to write down the best and worse case scenario, as well as the most likely outcome.</seg>
<seg id="11">``Girls take it out after the event to see what actually happened," head of senior school, Neesha Flint, said. ``The hope is that by using these slips, you train your brain to not `catastrophise' coming events."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Peppermint Grove school also has a `No Facebook Club', where students agree to download software that blocks the social networking site for most of the week.</seg>
<seg id="13">Facebook is banned at PLC from Sunday night to Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the first time this year, the school also introduced a peace and tranquility room for students to use prior to exams.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dozens of Year 11 and 12 pupils have already made use of it and said it helped calm their nerves.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Shenton College, Year 12 students have been given their own ``wellbeing packs," clear pencil cases with exam tips and contact numbers for support agencies to allow them to talk with experts if they're feeling stressed.</seg>
<seg id="17">The packs are suitable for students to take into exams and have proved a helpful tool in reducing stress and encouraging communication, principal Mike Morgan said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In her advice to parents at Christ Church Grammar School, senior psychologist Anne Angelkovska warned parents to be mindful of possible warning signs.</seg>
<seg id="19">She said mild levels of anxiety were ``considered quite healthy and normal," but moderate to extreme levels ``have the potential to produce irrational thought processes."</seg>
<seg id="20">``If your child feels the need to answer every question correctly, then there is the potential for a meltdown early on, especially as they are studying and working on past exam papers," Dr Angelkovska said.</seg>
<seg id="21">``If you see irrational thought patterns, you need to try and help your child gain some perspective.</seg>
<seg id="22">Communication is essential.</seg>
<seg id="23">Communication does not equate to `nagging.</seg>
<seg id="24">Re-evaluating expectations with your child, setting clearly defined objectives helps break the `catastrophic thinking cycle'.</seg>

<seg id="1">An Obama voter's cry of despair</seg>
<seg id="2">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
<seg id="3">He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism</seg>
<seg id="4">Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.</seg>
<seg id="11">The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.</seg>
<seg id="18">Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was simply nothing I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of "don't ask don't tell," to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.</seg>
<seg id="22">But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.</seg>
<seg id="23">I've reached a point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="27">It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is what troubles me most of all.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.</seg>
<seg id="40">At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We've got to remember who we are.'</seg>
<seg id="43">It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.</seg>
<seg id="44">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

<seg id="2">Michelle Obama announced on Wednesday that the nonprofit organization behind the popular children's educational TV programme will allow the food industry use Elmo, Big Bird and Sesame Street's other muppet characters free of charge to market fruits and vegetables to children.</seg>
<seg id="3">The campaign will encourage children to enjoy eating fruit and vegetables by featuring the well-loved characters on shop signs, as well as fruit stickers and labels.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mrs Obama called the move an "unprecedented step," adding "And they're doing this free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Yes!" as she pumped her fists in the air before an audience seated in the State Dining Room of the White House.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first lady cited a study published last Autumn in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine in which researchers gave more than 200 boys and girls ages 8 to 11 the choice of eating an apple, a cookie or both.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most children chose the cookie.</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked to choose again after researchers put Elmo stickers on the apples, nearly double the number chose the fruit, she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Just imagine what will happen when we take our kids to the grocery store, and they see Elmo and Rosita and the other Sesame Street Muppets they love up and down the produce aisle," Mrs Obama said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Imagine what it will be like to have our kids begging us to buy them fruits and vegetables instead of cookies, candy and chips.</seg>

<seg id="4">Moody will target British import My Quest for Peace at the Group 1 Stradbroke Handicap (1400m) and insists the plan is not as crazy as it sounds.</seg>
<seg id="5">My Quest for Peace failed to stay in last year's Melbourne Cup, finishing 10th behind Green Moon, after running fifth in the Caulfield Cup under the care of Luca Cumani.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am going to have a red-hot go at the Stradbroke with this horse," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">I have never seen an import with a better turn of foot.</seg>
<seg id="8">The OTI-owned galloper was transferred to Moody after his Spring campaign and is rated a $41 Stradbroke chance in TattsBet's betting markets.</seg>
<seg id="9">The five-year-old has not run since the Melbourne Cup due to a throat infection, but the stable now believes he is in fine fettle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Moody is seeking back-to-back Stradbroke wins after Mid Summer Music won last year's prestigious sprint race.</seg>

<seg id="2">The training camp has been used by al-Shabaab to train operatives some of whom are eventually infiltrated into the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The Westgate attackers received their training from this camp," the ministry said in the statement issued late Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Spider-Man" Musical Co-Writer Spills the Beans</seg>
<seg id="2">(NEW YORK) - This summer, out of the blue, playwright Glen Berger got a call from director Julie Taymor.</seg>
<seg id="3">He assumed he was being butt-dialed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I thought, "Oh, wow.""</seg>
<seg id="5">""She sat on her phone.""</seg>
<seg id="6">""How weird,"" he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, the two hadn't spoken for more than two years following a bitter falling out during the rocky launch of Broadway's "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.""</seg>
<seg id="8">Taymor had been fired and a flurry of lawsuits began.</seg>
<seg id="9">So Berger let the call go to voicemail and was surprised when Taymor left a message asking him to call her back.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was tempted - she was a special person, after all - but he knew he had to be careful.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is how bad it had gotten: Berger called his agent first, who then insisted Berger's lawyer be consulted.</seg>
<seg id="12">The lawyer called back 10 minutes later - don't call the Tony Award winner back, he was warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">"He said, "For Glen, Julie's a siren."</seg>
<seg id="14">"He'll do anything she wants.""</seg>
<seg id="15">It turned out the advice was pointless.</seg>
<seg id="16">Taymor later called Berger back from a blocked number and he picked up.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The first thing out of her mouth was, "All right, so, am I going to have to worry about this book?""</seg>
<seg id="18">The book in question is Berger's "Song of Spider-Man: The Inside Story of the Most Controversially Musical in Broadway History" (Simon & Schuster), the playwright's attempt to make sense of a $75 million spectacle with music by Bono and The Edge that took six years of his life and turned his work into a punch line.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's a fun read, a sort of modern day "Heart of Darkness" in which Berger - a mild-mannered writer for children's TV and a playwright whose biggest hit was "Underneath the Lintel" - describes getting caught in the web of dysfunctionality, back-stabbing and out-of-control egos.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord knows, I didn't write this book to distress any one.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's such a capital-S Story that I would have had to turn in my badge as a writer if I had passed it up," he explained in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the book, Berger recounts the endless delays, frustrations, accidents, secret emails and endless hubris.</seg>
<seg id="23">At one point he was working on multiple secret scripts and plotting in the men's room.</seg>
<seg id="24">It got so weird.</seg>
<seg id="25">I was just going around everybody.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It felt like "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" he admits.</seg>
<seg id="27">The script needed to be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most blame is reserved for the absentee songwriters - U2 were on tour all the time - unproven technology and, above all, Taymor, a director and co-writer who would not alter her vision and responded to any suggest that she do so with, he writes, "the fury of a hurricane making landfall."</seg>
<seg id="29">There are no bombshells in the book that haven't already become public knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I'm not here to blab details," he says.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is a story about storytelling and a story about collaborating.</seg>
<seg id="32">After Taymor was fired, a new team including writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and director Philip William McKinley was hired to fix the show, lighten Taymor's darkness and streamline the plot.</seg>
<seg id="33">Berger, who had struggled to tame some of Taymor's vision, now found himself fighting to keep many of her ideas and stop the show from becoming milquetoast.</seg>
<seg id="34">It finally opened to critical boos, but became a big hit, only recently sagging at the box office.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Of course, I'm rooting for the show," says Berger, who continues to get checks from the musical and daily show reports.</seg>
<seg id="36">He says he's not privy to plans - if any - for "Spider-Man" after Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="37">Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the show, has dismissed the new book as a mix of fact and fiction: "If Mr. Berger had put this much imagination into his script, the producers wouldn't have had to hire Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa."</seg>
<seg id="38">Taymor's spokesman says she hasn't read the book and so had no comment.</seg>
<seg id="39">Berger has moved on, much wiser.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Emmy-nominated writer has commissions from the Alley Theatre in Houston and the Berkeley Repertory Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="41">He and composer Mark Mancina are adapting the film "August Rush" into a stage musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">His collaborations now are healthier.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The only way that you can speak your mind is if you let go of the need for job security, which I wasn't prepared to do for "Spider-Man.""</seg>
<seg id="44">"I didn't want to lose that job," he says.</seg>
<seg id="45">Berger, who is married with three children and lives near Woodstock, N.Y., doesn't look back with anger.</seg>
<seg id="46">The "Spider-Man" days were intoxicating and instructive and he loved rubbing shoulders with Bono and The Edge and Taymor.</seg>
<seg id="47">Maybe it was an artistic blip but it wasn't a life blip.</seg>
<seg id="48">"I thank the gods for giving it to me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="49">He even thinks it helped his writing: "Every now and then, you've got to put manure on the fields."</seg>
<seg id="50">This was high-grade manure.</seg>
<seg id="51">But he will be haunted by what could have been.</seg>
<seg id="52">While writing the book, he combed over six years of notes and emails and came to a startling conclusion: The "Spider-Man" musical wasn't necessarily doomed.</seg>
<seg id="53">I saw ways - glittering, gleaming ways - that it all could have been fixed so perfectly and beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="54">And I could have done it.</seg>
<seg id="55">"If I had just been given a couple of weeks and some coffee," he says.</seg>
<seg id="56">It really could have been great.</seg>
<seg id="57">It kills me.</seg>
<seg id="58">Every day.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lewis Moody: Stuart Lancaster is doing it his way and putting post-2003 errors in the past</seg>
<seg id="2">I remember being on the bench that night, sitting there and just wanting to get on.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was the biggest game of my life and I wanted to get out on that pitch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then as time ticks on and the game is so close another feeling creeps in - what if I'm sent out there and I make the mistake that costs England the World Cup?</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a fear there.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when it came to the moment to take the field all those nerves and anxiety melted away.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was so much more enjoyable being on the pitch than sitting there watching it.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is the abiding memory.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was that line-out, taking the line-out from which Jonny Wilkinson eventually dropped that goal, but that didn't feel like any big deal - that's what we did, the call, the catch and on we go.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was no pressure or fear or anxiety by then.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because we had been through it so many times in training, preparing for all eventualities.</seg>
<seg id="12">When it came to it, it was second nature.</seg>
<seg id="13">We took the pressure off ourselves by preparing so well that we just dropped into our roles.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Jonny was lining up to take the drop goal I was waving at him to let him know the option for a cross-field kick was on.</seg>
<seg id="15">All the Aussies were focused on him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was confident, dropped the goal and the rest is history.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a team we should have kicked on from that success but, sadly, that was not the case.</seg>
<seg id="18">What came after it was not so memorable and this is why it is so important that England and the RFU plan not just for the World Cup in 2015 but beyond too.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2003 we had spent so long preparing for the World Cup so, when it happened and we won and Clive Woodward stepped away, there was nothing else in place.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was the driver of England's long-term vision and after his departure it was no surprise we had some torrid years.</seg>
<seg id="21">You had to feel for Andy Robinson having to take over then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The RFU is a much tighter unit now; the England team, the RFU and all of its entities are working as one team - as they always should have done.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2003 we, the England team, knew exactly what we had to do, from the players through the coaches and the physios.</seg>
<seg id="24">Clive made sure everything was in place.</seg>
<seg id="25">But I don't think the RFU was always working as a team.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was pulling in different directions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Ian Ritchie took over, the RFU has taken giant leaps in working efficiently, making sure the team's success is now the priority, because that is what drives everything else within the RFU, the grass roots, the commercial, it drives everything.</seg>
<seg id="28">They have used the lessons of 2003, what went wrong and also what went right.</seg>
<seg id="29">2003 was a missed opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="30">We had that extreme euphoria.</seg>
<seg id="31">We then had a lot of retirements but that should not have upset us - it was purely that Clive left, because he was the focus.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was his management that was driving everything.</seg>
<seg id="33">When he stepped away we took steps backwards, England as a side and the RFU - it was all a bit chaotic and was not well thought through or planned.</seg>
<seg id="34">We were still a good side but we had nowhere near the success there could have been if there had been more forward-planning.</seg>
<seg id="35">We were flying by the seats of our pants.</seg>
<seg id="36">For too long England sides have been trying to emulate 2003 but Stuart Lancaster looks to be creating a team for 2015 and doing it his way.</seg>
<seg id="37">I like what I see.</seg>
<seg id="38">I went to watch training earlier this week and it made me itch to get back out there.</seg>
<seg id="39">Lancaster knows the history of the shirt, the pride and the culture that is so important, and like Clive he has got good guys in for the coaching and the medical staff.</seg>
<seg id="40">He is a forward-thinker and a precise planner.</seg>
<seg id="41">His strengths are organising and managing - that is what he is, a manager.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has a good team of coaches: Andy Farrell, a real presence who commands respect - guys want to play for him - Mike Catt, who has real understanding of how rugby should be played, and Graham Rowntree.</seg>
<seg id="43">Winning a World Cup is about having long-term goals, and shorter ones too to sustain the journey.</seg>
<seg id="44">Autumn has always been about blooding new talent but winning this first game against Australia is so important - win and it makes the rest of the autumn so much smoother.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are a number of big chances to be seized.</seg>
<seg id="46">Joel Tomkins is a good defender - league players seem to understand and read attacks so well when they come over - and he is also an interesting prospect in attack.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is a massive opportunity for Courtney Lawes to show Lancaster what he's about, a big, imposing, physical second row.</seg>
<seg id="48">We need someone akin to Martin Johnson, Danny Grewcock, Wade Dooley, that enforcer, and you need to ally that with someone who has the intelligence to call the line-outs.</seg>
<seg id="49">There is a lot of pressure on Lawes, as a player and as the man who calls the line-outs.</seg>
<seg id="50">It will be interesting to see how he handles the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lee Dickson is the surprise inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ben Youngs had a good summer with the Lions and I would have started with him.</seg>
<seg id="53">He gives you that exciting edge, speed around the base, and he asks a lot of defences.</seg>
<seg id="54">But Dickson has been playing well.</seg>
<seg id="55">Competition for places is what drives teams to perform.</seg>
<seg id="56">In 2003 the competition was huge.</seg>
<seg id="57">Look at scrum-half: you had Kyran Bracken, Matt Dawson and Andy Gomarsall, and Austin Healey didn't even go.</seg>
<seg id="58">You had four guys who on their day were all world-class players.</seg>
<seg id="59">That sort of competition drives individuals week in, week out.</seg>
<seg id="60">England are getting there.</seg>
<seg id="61">There are a couple of positions where I think Lancaster would want a bit more, the wings and No 8 for example - which is why it's exciting to see Billy Vunipola get his chance.</seg>
<seg id="62">He offers a physical presence off the base that Lawrence Dallaglio used to bring.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is one final point about this line-up.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at the bench: Ben Foden back in form, Youngs off the back of a Lions tour, Toby Flood with 57 caps and two World Cups, Dylan Hartley closing on 50 caps.</seg>
<seg id="65">Keep in the mind the likes of Tom Croft and Manu Tuilagi missing through injuries and it's a strong group Lancaster is bringing together.</seg>
<seg id="66">He said they need 600 caps in the side if they are going to win the World Cup and that has been proved historically.</seg>
<seg id="67">There is a long way to go but it is really exciting times.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Path From Travesty to Truth</seg>
<seg id="2">COLUMN By Matthew Dowd</seg>
<seg id="3">Watching the Congressional hearing yesterday where Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified about the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, I was struck by the reality of how far Congress (and Washington, D.C., in general) has moved from the search for the truth, and a goal to really understand and fix problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is not new to say Washington has become a culture of scoring points, avoiding fouls, hacking the opposition, and trying to "win the game."</seg>
<seg id="5">It is far removed from finding out what the truth really is, addressing the needs and hopes of average Americans and conversing in a place where you trust the other person's intentions.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that fact was on full display at this Sebelius hearing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let's review it from all angles.</seg>
<seg id="8">First, Secretary Sebelius (like many folks who have come before her) seemed to have the main goal of dodging the hacks by the opposition and avoiding any fouls.</seg>
<seg id="9">And this is advice most DC-based consultants seem to give when preparing someone to testify, and then reward them with praise if they succeed on this PR goal.</seg>
<seg id="10">It isn't about what's the best way to get the truth across or to best fix the process, it's about repairing image and trying to make it through without a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="11">Second, the Republicans yesterday on the committee were not only ill-prepared, but many were downright rude.</seg>
<seg id="12">I don't exactly know how it helps them politically, or to get to real answers, to treat someone with disrespect and to constantly interrupt.</seg>
<seg id="13">It certainly doesn't cause any non Kool-Aid drinking viewers to listen to what they might be asking.</seg>
<seg id="14">I have always been taught that a hard question, asked politely and gently, gets closer to the truth and actually might help someone.</seg>
<seg id="15">I understand most Republican representatives on the Committee are posturing for the camera and grandstanding for partisans outside the room, but it doesn't further their cause of shining a spotlight on problems of Obamacare and trying to help Americans understand.</seg>
<seg id="16">Third, Democrats on the Committee equally weren't helpful in getting to the truth.</seg>
<seg id="17">As always happens on this in DC, the party which is the same as the person testifying merely becomes a cheerleader for whatever talking points they have been handed.</seg>
<seg id="18">And really does anyone take cheerleaders seriously?</seg>
<seg id="19">Using their questions to elicit real answers would be much better for Democrats and more effective than just lauding Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="20">So how do we fix this other than trying to totally change the culture in Washington, D.C., and starting over?</seg>
<seg id="21">I would suggest one small but important fix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Committee hearings where a huge number of folks get four minutes to question the person before them while using three and half of those minutes for theater and 30 seconds for Sebelius to respond (while getting interrupted in that half minute) just doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="23">Politicians should let go of their egos (on both sides of the aisle) and drop the need to demonstrate they are somebody.</seg>
<seg id="24">Let go of the need for theater and to hear the sound of their own voices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The leaders of both sides of the aisle should come together and decide that the time at these type of committee hearings should be spent in an earnest search for the truth.</seg>
<seg id="26">And once some of that truth is revealed, let the American public decide for themselves, and then everyone can figure out how to address the needs and problems.</seg>
<seg id="27">So my proposal would be for each side of the aisle to cede their questioning to one very qualified person to methodically go through a real question and answer period with whomever is testifying.</seg>
<seg id="28">Let each side have a couple hours to try and uncover what the truth might be, and let someone like Secretary Sebelius have time to answer questions.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would give much more time for follow-ups, and Sebelius might be freed to actually give thoughtful answers to questions without worrying about the PR of the answer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Just a thought, but it seems to me both political parties, the media and the American public would benefit more from this type of exchange.</seg>
<seg id="31">It might not take the grandstanding totally out of it, but at least by giving all the time to two knowledgeable folks to ask the questions, we might actually stumble onto the truth more often.</seg>
<seg id="32">And people in Washington might realize that most wisdom is gained through the ears and not the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you have it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manchester United reports record revenues</seg>
<seg id="2">18 September 2013 Last updated at 12:34</seg>
<seg id="3">Premier League champions Manchester United have reported record revenues of £363m for the 12 months to June.</seg>
<seg id="4">The club, controlled by the Glazer family, saw a big rise in commercial revenues driven by sponsorship deals, as well as merchandising and product licensing.</seg>
<seg id="5">It made a net profit of £146m.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures are the first released by United since David Moyes took over as manager following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson last season.</seg>
<seg id="7">The club transformed into one of football's global financial powerhouses during his reign, and was floated on the New York Stock Exchange last year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ed Woodward, Manchester United's executive vice chairman, said: "We are very proud of our results.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our commercial business continues to be a very powerful engine of growth enabling the team to continue to be successful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Player costs</seg>
<seg id="11">We won our 20th English League title last season and are delighted to have David Moyes lead our football team into a new and exciting chapter.</seg>
<seg id="12">We look forward to a successful 2013-14, both on and off the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the last financial year, United signed a number of sponsorship deals that boosted commercial revenues by 30%.</seg>
<seg id="14">The merchandising machine at the company's disposal is firing on all cylinders</seg>
<seg id="15">End Quote Richard Hunter Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers</seg>
<seg id="16">They included a deal with US carmaker Chevrolet, which will become the club's shirt sponsor next season.</seg>
<seg id="17">Commercial revenues now account for £153m - 42% of the clubs total income.</seg>
<seg id="18">The rest comes from television rights, worth £102m, and match-day revenues which totalled £109m.</seg>
<seg id="19">About half of all the money brought in was spent on staffing costs, however.</seg>
<seg id="20">This included paying for new players and increased wages and bonuses for current players.</seg>
<seg id="21">The club also hired more people to help with its commercial expansion.</seg>
<seg id="22">It also reported costs of £6.2m related to "exceptional items," which included the cost of paying off former coaching staff who left as a result of Sir Alex's departure.</seg>
<seg id="23">Manchester United have seen a steady start to their season under new manager David Moyes, winning two of their four opening Premier League matches and their first group game in the Champions League.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said the on-field success of the club last season, was reflected in its financial results.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Apart from the kudos and indirect income associated with winning the Premier League - not least of which is maintaining the strength of the global brand - the merchandising machine at the company's disposal is firing on all cylinders," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">He added that the club's forecast for next season was for further strong growth in revenues and sponsorship income, based on the assumption that they would reach the quarter finals of the domestic cup competitions and the Champions League, and finish at least third in the Premier League.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fancy a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?</seg>
<seg id="2">A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.</seg>
<seg id="4">He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">So each scoop costs me around £140.</seg>
<seg id="13">It tastes pretty good though.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists</seg>

<seg id="2">The "60 Minutes" broadcast, in which Jones also recounted his clandestine visit that night to a Benghazi hospital to view the body of slain U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, helped propel a new round of partisan conflict this week over the attack.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and other Republican lawmakers referred to it repeatedly during a Wednesday news conference.</seg>
<seg id="4">Graham said he would block confirmation of all of President Obama's nominees, including Jeh Johnson as homeland security secretary and Janet L. Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve, until the administration allowed government witnesses to the attack to appear before Congress.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in a written account that Jones, whose real name was confirmed as Dylan Davies by several officials who worked with him in Benghazi, provided to his employer three days after the attack, he told a different story of his experiences that night.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Davies's 21/ 2-page incident report to Blue Mountain, the Britain-based contractor hired by the State Department to handle perimeter security at the compound, he wrote that he spent most of that night at his Benghazi beach-side villa.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although he attempted to get to the compound, he wrote in the report, "we could not get anywhere near . . . as roadblocks had been set up."</seg>
<seg id="8">He learned of Stevens's death, Davies wrote, when a Libyan colleague who had been at the hospital came to the villa to show him a cellphone picture of the ambassador's blackened corpse.</seg>
<seg id="9">Davies wrote that he visited the still-smoking compound the next day to view and photograph the destruction.</seg>
<seg id="10">The State Department and GOP congressional aides confirmed that Davies's Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">14, 2012, report, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, was included among tens of thousands of documents turned over to lawmakers by the State Department this year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Davies's book on the attack, titled "The Embassy House," by "Sergeant Morgan Jones," was published this week and largely comports with the "60 minutes" account.</seg>
<seg id="13">It says that he served 14 years in the British military before becoming a private security contractor.</seg>
<seg id="14">A person answering the telephone Thursday at Blue Mountain, based in Wales, said no one was available to discuss Benghazi or Davies, who no longer worked there.</seg>
<seg id="15">Damien Lewis, co-author of the book, said in a telephone interview that Davies was "not well" and is hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lewis said he was unaware that the Blue Mountain incident report existed but suggested that Davies might have dissembled in it because his superiors, whom he contacted by telephone once he was informed that the attack was underway, told him to stay away from the compound.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria says gunmen prevent Homs evacuation</seg>
<seg id="2">This image made from amateur video and released by Ugarit News purports to show armed civilians marching in Homs, Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">SYRIA is accusing gunmen of using Homs residents as "human shields" and of blocking government's efforts to evacuate them from the besieged central city.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Contacts have been made with the head of the UN observers and local authorities in order to facilitate the departure of innocent citizens (besieged) in Homs," the foreign ministry said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">"But the UN mission failed in achieving this goal because the armed terrorist groups blocked its efforts," it added, according to the official SANA news agency.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The Syrian government is ready to evacuate its citizens, besieged by the armed terrorist groups," the ministry said, adding that efforts to transfer Homs residents to safe areas have been underway for a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also urged "all those who can to to press the armed groups not to target innocent civilians" accusing the gunmen of using the civilians as "human shields."</seg>
<seg id="8">Syrian authorities blame "armed terrorist groups" for the violence in the country where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 14,400 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime erupted last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the weekend the opposition Syrian National Council warned of a looming massacre in Homs city, which it said is besieged by 30,000 troops and pro-regime militiamen.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Britain-based Observatory said 1000 families were stuck there and has reported daily government shelling of rebel bastions inside the city and on its outskirts.</seg>
<seg id="11">Activists and the opposition have spoken of difficult conditions in Homs, where food supplies were running low amid water and electricity outages.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN observer mission in Syria, Major General Robert Mood, urged warring parties on Sunday to "allow women, children, the elderly and the injured to leave conflict zones, without any preconditions and ensure their safety."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mood also announced the suspension of the mission's activities in Syria due to the deadly violence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian PM plays down talk of gas wars, warns Ukraine on EU</seg>
<seg id="2">MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said he saw no reason for Moscow to cut gas supplies to Ukraine over an unpaid bill for now, playing down talk of an imminent "gas war" that might disrupt gas flows to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Reuters, he denied Russia's demands for payment had anything to do with opposition to Ukraine signing agreements with the European Union this month which would mark a historic shift away from former imperial master Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the 48-year-old former president said the "special relationship" between the two former Soviet republics would change if Ukraine moved closer to Europe and that Kiev should no longer come to Moscow seeking loans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom said on Tuesday that Ukraine, which is dependent on supplies of Russian gas, had failed to settle a $882 million bill for August deliveries and demanded it be paid urgently.</seg>
<seg id="6">Medvedev said they had yet to pay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We understand that they have economic difficulties, but they still have to pay, especially after we gave them loans and financed transit," Medvedev said in the interview on Thursday, adding the transit fees cost billions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's the law - you have to pay for delivered goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's normal practice around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">Let them pay.</seg>
<seg id="11">Medvedev said Russia could resort to a system of advance payments if Ukraine did not respond to its demands.</seg>
<seg id="12">As it nears a payment crunch to service its debt over the next 18 months, Ukraine has asked for leniency from Russian creditors, including trying to extend the term of a $2 billion loan from Russia's Gazprombank by five years.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just last month, Putin said Russia would lend $750 million to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Medvedev said if Ukraine signed the agreement with the European Union at a summit on November 28-29, Brussels could then foot the bill, denying Russian pressure over the unpaid bill was connected to Kiev's choice of closer ties with the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is the sovereign choice of Ukraine, but let's hope they don't kick themselves when they see that they will not receive those dividends, those benefits which they counted on, and lose the advantages that exist because of what we have now ... a special relationship with them, an exclusive relationship," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Asked whether there would be a reduction in gas supplies to Ukraine, he replied: "No."</seg>
<seg id="17">In this sense I think that for now everything is okay ...</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't expect any complications.</seg>
<seg id="19">Harsh language used by Gazprom in the gas dispute has raised concerns of a new "gas war" over prices between the neighbors, similar to those in the winters of 2006 and 2009 which caused supplies to be disrupted to Ukraine and the rest of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ukraine's energy minister acknowledged on Wednesday the country may have fallen behind in payments for monthly supplies of Russian gas but said he expected the matter to be settled with Moscow very soon.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ukraine, which must meet conditions including releasing former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko from prison for the EU agreements, may have a safety net provided by the International Monetary Fund if Russia cuts it ties.</seg>
<seg id="22">Russia fears Ukraine could be moving out of its sphere of influence and it will stymie President Vladimir Putin's dream of a Moscow-led customs union to replace, at least in part, ties broken with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russia has put pressure on its neighbor, by tightening customs rules and banning some imports.</seg>
<seg id="24">Medvedev said it was simple choice between forming a trade pact with the 28-nation bloc or the customs union with Russia and two other former Soviet republics, Belarus and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's their position, and it has to be respected, but they have to understand that relations with us will be different," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">They constantly turn to us for credits, for example.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the end, if they have such advanced relations with Brussels ... let them get credits from Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">Investors urged to spurn Paladin share placement</seg>
<seg id="2">Chairman of Paladin Rick Crabb.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Erin Jonasson</seg>
<seg id="4">Paladin Energy shareholders have been urged to reject a controversial share placement that has drastically diluted the value of shares n the uranium miner over the past 11 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite the $88 million placement taking effect in early August, shareholders will be asked to approve it retrospectively at Paladin's annual meeting on November 21.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shareholder approval would allow Paladin to make further share placements later this year, but rejection would prohibit any more raisings, and duly close off one of the company's swiftest methods of raising cash.</seg>
<seg id="7">Proxy adviser ISS has recommended that shareholders vote against the placement on the grounds that most of them were denied the opportunity to participate, with the placement sold mostly to large institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Paladin shares were fetching $1 prior to the placement being announced in early August.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stock immediately slipped to 72¢.</seg>
<seg id="10">The stock has since slipped further, and was trading at 40¢ on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="11">ISS head of research Dr Ulysses Chioatto said shareholders should not ratify the controversial placement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The placement was very dilutive to existing shareholders and, more importantly, they never got a chance to participate, so that was quite discriminatory and definitely not good governance practice," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's really holding the current shareholders with some significant disdain by not allowing them to be involved.</seg>
<seg id="14">While a negative vote will not overturn the placement, he said it could still prove uncomfortable for Paladin executives.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is going to be quite problematic if Paladin does not receive shareholder approval," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a range of different actions that are open to shareholders if they don't approve this placement retrospectively, so there is no clear answer as to what could be done next.</seg>
<seg id="17">Paladin chairman Rick Crabb said he was "surprised" by the recommendation, and said ISS had failed to appreciate the difficult context in which the share placement was made.</seg>
<seg id="18">Paladin is listed in both Australia and Canada, and Mr Crabb said a broader rights issue in a time of falling uranium prices would have been lengthy and complicated, and might have created uncertainty about the company's ability to raise money.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We could have had a downward spiral in price, so it was a properly considered risk-management strategy we followed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other proxy advisers such as CGI Glass Lewis and Ownership Matters are expected to publish their reports on Paladin next week.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brazil's Eike Batista: From billionaire to bankruptcy</seg>
<seg id="2">SAO PAULO, Brazil - A little over a year ago, Brazilian playboy Eike Batista was reputed to be the seventh-richest man in the world and was in the habit of boasting loudly that he'd soon be No.</seg>
<seg id="3">By this week, he had become one of the world's biggest paupers.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Wednesday, his flagship oil company, OGX, filed for bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="5">A personal fortune once valued at $30 billion had collapsed into a personal debt estimated at more than $800 million.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some Brazilians, long since soured on his cocky persona, responded with glee on social networks to the news that Batista's yacht, the Pink Fleet, would soon be sold for scrap.</seg>
<seg id="7">No one wanted, or could afford, the $19-million boat intact.</seg>
<seg id="8">Batista's spectacular fall may say more about his personal failings, and what Alan Greenspan called the "irrational exuberance" of the market, than it does about Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="9">It turned out that his much-hyped empire was built on vastly overconfident assumptions - in particular, oil deposit estimates that bore no relationship to reality.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He ended up swallowed by his own myth," columnist William Waack wrote for Brazil's Globo media group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Still, as Brazil's economy sinks back to reality after boom-time highs, his implosion has served as a warning to investors, and to Brazilians at large, that much of the fabulous wealth that was on the horizon so recently was based on little more than promises.</seg>
<seg id="12">Batista "is vain."</seg>
<seg id="13">"And at a certain point his vanity prevailed over common sense," said Adriano Pires, director of the Brazilian Infrastructure Center, an energy consulting firm in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="14">The case of Batista is not just bad for him and the companies around him, it is very bad for all of Brazil, especially in a moment when we need international investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is blemishing Brazil's credibility a little all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Batista grew up the son of Brazil's wealthy former minister of mines and energy.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a country famous for corruption and nepotism, it seemed a bit more than coincidental when the younger Batista literally struck gold in the mining industry in the 1980s, despite the assertion in his autobiography, characteristically titled "The X Factor: The Path of Brazil's Greatest Entrepreneur," that his fortune was the result of hard work and ingenuity.</seg>
<seg id="18">He acquired government licenses to exploit some of Brazil's newly discovered offshore oil reserves, and created an interconnected set of energy, mining and logistics companies based around the wells.</seg>
<seg id="19">He cashed in big from international investors, selling stock at a moment when the world believed more than ever in a Brazilian boom and, after the shock of the U.S.-based financial crisis, was looking for a new place to invest.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was a heady time for Batista and for Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy was in rapid expansion, the government was extremely popular, and a rising middle class was euphoric with higher wages.</seg>
<seg id="22">Certifying the country's ascendance, Brazil was awarded the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="23">Amid assurances of big gains - each of his companies had the letter X in its title, signifying multiple returns - his personal fortune soared, even as the companies brought in little revenue.</seg>
<seg id="24">After he tapped equities markets for all they were worth, he turned to debt markets, borrowing even more to pump up his companies.</seg>
<seg id="25">"He built his empire based on what have now been proven to be very unrealistic expectations," said Tony Volpon, a New York-based economist for international bank Nomura Securities.</seg>
<seg id="26">He made the cardinal sin of using debt to finance what were very risky exploratory activities in oil, and no one does that.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He didn't understand that oil and gas projects are high-risk ventures," said Pires, of the energy consulting firm.</seg>
<seg id="28">In this business there is no certainty, just probability.</seg>
<seg id="29">He went around preaching and promising.</seg>
<seg id="30">Batista branched out into luxury hotels, rock festivals, restaurants, soccer and ultimate fighting, all without much economic logic behind them, Pires added.</seg>
<seg id="31">Things began to fall apart last year in dramatic fashion.</seg>
<seg id="32">His bodybuilder son, Thor, struck and killed a cyclist while speeding in a million-dollar Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren that the Batistas had been in the habit of keeping on display in their living room.</seg>
<seg id="33">The public was shocked by Eike Batista's response, as he took to Twitter to blame the "carelessness" of the cyclist, an impoverished cargo worker who had to commute by bike on a dangerous highway.</seg>
<seg id="34">Soon after, it became clear that some OGX wells wouldn't hit production targets, and the money began to fall away.</seg>
<seg id="35">Batista again took to Twitter, this time to attack those who didn't believe in him.</seg>
<seg id="36">After deposits he valued at more than a trillion dollars turned out to be woefully small this year, his company lost more than 96% of its value and has been unable to pay back creditors.</seg>
<seg id="37">Brazil's state-run banks, which had supported Batista's companies, backed away.</seg>
<seg id="38">Though analysts put the lion's share of the blame on Batista, he sold his projects to investors who were willing to believe him.</seg>
<seg id="39">Brazil seemed to be experiencing a once-in-a-generation moment when its deep social and infrastructure problems were forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="40">Stock investments were soaring across the board as the value of Brazil's currency was pushed up to what economists warned were unsustainably high levels.</seg>
<seg id="41">After growing more than 7% in 2010, Brazil's economy nearly ground to a halt in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="42">Then the social questions again came to the fore in what is one of the world's most unequal countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">Though inequality dropped dramatically and most Brazilians are better off than ever - the economy is expected to rebound modestly this year, wages continue to rise, and unemployment is still low - the ruling Workers' Party, during its decade in power, has not invested in much-needed transportation, healthcare or education to adequately satisfy the demands of a new and dynamic middle class.</seg>
<seg id="44">After a police crackdown on a protest against a bus fare hike, protesters with wide public support filled the streets in June, demanding better public services, and demonstrators still take aim at symbols of capitalist excess.</seg>
<seg id="45">Among the targets of their rage have been the windows of Batista's office building.</seg>
<seg id="46">Batista's fall seems, at least to some, to be a reflection of Brazil's torn social fabric.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I never liked Eike, since I don't believe it's possible to get so rich like that, especially in Brazil today, without infringing on the rights of the poorest," said Erica Alves, a 26-year-old teacher from Rio de Janeiro who is active in left-wing organizations.</seg>
<seg id="48">He became rich 'winning' rights from the government to exploit the country's resources.</seg>
<seg id="49">I wasn't surprised by his fall, because fast and easy wealth can't be sustained.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Brazil's new, more austere and more politically conscious moment, Eike Batista has had little to say.</seg>
<seg id="51">His once-active Twitter account has been dormant for 126 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aussie Ashes audit: we take a look at the progress of Australia's spin options</seg>
<seg id="2">Nathon Lyon is Australia's incumbent Test spinner, but as seen on the last Ashes tour, that doesn't mean much.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nathan Lyon (C) is likely to get first crack at England this summer.</seg>
<seg id="4">NO article about Australia's spin stocks can be complete without an obligatory reference to Shane Warne, so we'll get ours out of the way early.</seg>
<seg id="5">While the battle for pace bowling spots in Australia's Ashes side has been front and centre for the best part of a year, there has been a similar fight going on for the sole spinners' berth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps 'cold war' is a more accurate way of describing it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Australia's selectors and those in the team speak glowingly about Nathan Lyon, both in terms of his bowling improvement and his level-headed personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yet despite this, he's been dropped twice in the past year, and now finds his spot under pressure from a man who couldn't play for Australia until a few months ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">IN the final instalment of our five-part Aussie Ashes Audit, we look at the bowlers jostling for the opportunity to spin Australia to victory this summer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The incumbent: Nathan Lyon</seg>
<seg id="11">In all our previous Audit articles, we had a sub-heading entitled 'The sure thing', but it's plainly obvious that doesn't exist when it comes to Australia's spinner.</seg>
<seg id="12">Despite more than two years of reliable performances that have fluctuated between 'very good' and 'not too bad' and resulted in 85 wickets from 25 Tests, Nathan Lyon is still forced to look over his shoulder before every Test line-up is announced.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is natural after his previous experiences, when he was dropped for the second Test in India in favour of Xavier Doherty and Glenn Maxwell, and then again for the first two Ashes clashes in England when he made way for teenager Ashton Agar.</seg>
<seg id="14">He eventually returned to the Test side and looked a far more troubling prospect for England's batsmen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of them, most notably Kevin Pietersen, decided all-out attack was the best method of countering Lyon, and while the off-spinner might have conceded more boundaries than he would have liked, he also collected Pietersen's wicket on two occasions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Match figures of 7-97 in the fourth Test looked to have sealed his spot in the side for a short while at least, but heading into this summer Lyon again finds himself under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="17">Playing on the small, batsman friendly grounds used in the Ryobi Cup would have helped, although he did still pick up nine wickets for the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Lyon may still need a couple of strong showings for NSW in the Sheffield Shield to ensure he pulls on the baggy green in Brisbane in three weeks' time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The contender: Fawad Ahmed</seg>
<seg id="20">On a day when Shaun Marsh couldn?t, Fawad Ahmed played himself into Ashes calculations as Victoria stormed to innings points at the MCG.</seg>
<seg id="21">Few cricketers have had more written about them over the past six months than Fawad Ahmed.</seg>
<seg id="22">His journey from Pakistani refugee to Australian cricketer is now legendary, but it's on the pitch where his efforts are now focused.</seg>
<seg id="23">After making his international debut in the post-Ashes limited-overs series, Ahmed will need to continue his good form with the red ball if he's to earn a fairytale Ashes call-up.</seg>
<seg id="24">The leg-spinner started that quest well on Thursday, taking 6-68 on day two of Victoria's Shield clash with Western Australia at the SCG.</seg>
<seg id="25">"When you're feeling good ... it doesn't matter who you're playing against or what kind of track it is," Ahmed said on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="26">With more performances like that, 'who he's playing against' could all of a sudden become very important.</seg>
<seg id="27">The bolter: Ashton Agar</seg>
<seg id="28">If this list was compiled before the last Ashes series, Ashton Agar would have been in this category as well.</seg>
<seg id="29">In between then and now, he's played two Tests and entered Ashes folklore after his breathtaking innings of 98 at Trent Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="30">But his efforts with the ball, in which he picked up just two wickets (although he should have had one more, as he was the biggest victim in the Stuart Broad not walking saga), saw him dropped from the side.</seg>
<seg id="31">Agar's height gives him an extra string to his bow, but the left-armer will need to work more on moving the ball laterally if he's to survive at Test level.</seg>
<seg id="32">Two wickets in Western Australia's opening Shield game would have helped, but the fact he was comprehensively out-bowled by Ahmed won't have been so beneficial.</seg>

<seg id="2">A MAN in southwestern China who lived in a eucalyptus tree for more than three months to protest the planned demolition of his home is being tried for disturbing public order.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chen Maoguo was dubbed the "bird man" for his tree-top sit-in last year in the Chongqing region, staged to protest what he considered inadequate compensation for the razing of his home, the Yunnan Information News said.</seg>
<seg id="4">His home was one of many to be knocked down to make way for a shopping mall in Fengjie county.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, his unusual protest beginning last August attracted crowds and media attention, leading to his arrest in November for disturbing public order, said the report, posted on the popular Chinese web portal Sina.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">During his demonstration, Mr Chen pulled all of his food, water, clothing and other needs up by rope into the small makeshift shelter he constructed in a eucalyptus tree, it said.</seg>
<seg id="7">The report said Mr Chen was to appear in a local court today.</seg>
<seg id="8">It did not say how old Mr Chen was, or what penalties he could face.</seg>
<seg id="9">Land seizures, often involving corrupt officials and businesses eyeing real estate profits, have been a growing source of unrest in China.</seg>
<seg id="10">The problem stirred an uproar last year as a property boom and resulting rash of mass evictions caused a number of violent clashes, protests and even suicides by stubborn homeowners.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip</seg>
<seg id="2">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive special adviser," Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say," Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.</seg>
<seg id="9">What about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">Does he know about phone hacking?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says he doesn't, we say "Oh yes, he did".</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projects."</seg>
<seg id="15">During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveling to Samarkand is like taking a time machine.</seg>
<seg id="2">While making my report, I felt myself somewhere in the past, or inside a fairy-tale about Scheherazade.</seg>
<seg id="3">Our journey started in the very heart of this city, the Registan square.</seg>
<seg id="4">The name of this square means "the sandy place" because in ancient times this square used to be covered by sand.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are three madrasahs - the Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417-1420), the Tilya-Kori Madrasah (1646-1660) and the Sher-Dor Madrasah (1619-1636).</seg>
<seg id="6">Their walls can be read like books; for example, on the entrance of the oldest one, the madrasah of Ulugh Beg, one can read: ""search for knowledge even to China."" China was considered the end of the world, so this inscription encouraged students to search for knowledge everywhere on the planet."</seg>
<seg id="7">Nowadays, there is precious knowledge preserved here as many generations of renovators devote their lives to keep those madrasas as beautiful as they are.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another wonder which deserves a separate story is the native village of Great Timur, Shakrisabs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Except for the ruins of Timur's summer residence, there is much more to see.</seg>
<seg id="10">It takes tourists less than an hour to get to this wonderful city from Samarkand.</seg>
<seg id="11">The name of this city means Green Town.</seg>
<seg id="12">It saw the legions of Alexander the Great and the hordes of Genghis Khan.</seg>
<seg id="13">I advise to take a look at the Jekhangir Mausoleum and Gumbeyi Seiidan Mausoleum.</seg>
<seg id="14">The local market, such as the Siab market in Samarkand, exists since the times of Great Timur.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the way, Timur is considered to be the patron of Samarkand.</seg>
<seg id="16">Young brides and grooms come here and place flowers at the steps of his statues.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is another interesting wedding tradition in Uzbekistan.</seg>
<seg id="18">In my report, you can notice beautiful young women looking like princesses in their traditional colourful clothes.</seg>
<seg id="19">One was being photographed at the Registan square, while another one was buying sweets at the Siab market.</seg>
<seg id="20">They do not dress like this always, but only in the weeks after the marriage.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to tradition, a young wife has 40 traditional dresses which she wears during the first days of her married life; so there is a dress for 40 days.</seg>
<seg id="22">Later in Bukhara, I took a picture with one young wife, but Bukhara - is another story, as thrilling as Samarkand.</seg>

<seg id="3">Picture: Supplied Source: National Features</seg>
<seg id="4">JAPAN'S iconic Mount Fuji looks likely to win recognition as a World Heritage site.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Agency for Cultural Affairs has issued a notice saying Mount Fuji was recommended for World Heritage status by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, a body affiliated with UNESCO.</seg>
<seg id="6">Formal approval is expected in June at a World Heritage Committee meeting in Cambodia.</seg>
<seg id="7">A collection of cultural sites in Kamakura, a scenic town near Tokyo that once was the nation's capital, were not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mount Fuji would be Japan's 13th cultural World Heritage site.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 3776-metre volcanic peak is ringed by lakes, national parks, temples and shrines.</seg>
<seg id="10">It rises from the Pacific coast and is seen as a sacred part of Japan's cultural landscape both in Buddhist and indigenous Shinto traditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">About 300,000 people follow religious pilgrims of centuries past in climbing Mount Fuji each year, according to the Japan National Tourism Organisation, most of them crowding into a brief summer climbing season.</seg>
<seg id="12">Local officials are already pondering how to improve traffic access and other facilities to accommodate an anticipated increase in visitors, while preserving the area's natural beauty.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's crucial that we preserve all the vantage points from which we can view Mount Fuji," Shoji Watai, an expert on a cultural preservation panel of Fujinomiya city, one of several towns near the mountain</seg>

<seg id="2">General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury," according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.</seg>
<seg id="7">GM's truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="8">GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October.</seg>
<seg id="9">NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="11">In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.</seg>

<seg id="1">JOE Tripodi's day at ICAC took a devastating turn moments after he entered the hearing where he found himself going from a corruption watchdog witness to a person of interest yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The former ports minister, who declared suggestions he'd made decisions about retail leases at Circular Quay to "directly benefit" the Obeid family were "completely wrong," is now being investigated for misconduct in public office.</seg>
<seg id="3">He becomes the fifth former Labor minister from the previous state government to face one of six ICAC inquiries into corruption launched since Labor was swept from power in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest move, announced by assistant ICAC commissioner Anthony Whealy before Mr Tripodi's evidence began yesterday, means Mr Tripodi could be found to have "improperly exercised his official function" while in office.</seg>
<seg id="5">Former ALP powerbroker Joe Tripodi leaving the ICAC inquiry / Picture: Ross Schultz Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="6">Former minister and NSW Labor powerbroker Eddie Obeid is being investigated by ICAC for claims he misused his position as an MP to lobby four consecutive ports ministers about the Circular Quay retail leases, where his family had a secret interest and which earned the family about $2.5 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inquiry has been told the leases expired in August 2005 and weren't renewed until 2009 - without going to tender.</seg>
<seg id="8">The development followed Thursday's sensational evidence from Lynne Ashpole, Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, that he'd told her Eddie Obeid held "one or two" leases at Circular Quay and "wasn't very happy" about the decision to have an expression of interest process.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a claim that Mr Tripodi denied yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="10">"No, I (didn't say that)," he said, giving his evidence under a non-religious affirmation to tell the truth.</seg>
<seg id="11">I said to her that ...</seg>
<seg id="12">But the claims of Ms Ashpole, with whom Mr Tripodi said he had had a good working relationship, was enough for Mr Whealy to "enlarge" the inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="13">Joe Tripodi fronts ICAC / Picture: Ross Schutz Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="14">"I propose now to amend the scope of the allegation I have recited by including your client, Mr Tripodi, as one of the public officials in relation to that allegation," he told Mr Tripodi's counsel Matthew Tyson.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Whealy told Mr Tripodi his evidence had "an air of unreality" and asked if he felt let down by Mr Obeid given he now knew the family secretly held two leases.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Do you not regard his behaviour as a complete betrayal to you?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I'm very disappointed," Mr Tripodi said, adding he "would have gone straight to the Premier" if he'd known Mr Obeid was pursuing ministers about the leases while he had a financial interest sweating on the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="18">On this policy issue we were in direct disagreement.</seg>
<seg id="19">The inquiry heard suggestions Mr Obeid knew about changes to the policy as they unfolded, up until the point the decision was made to amend the agreement in favour of direct negotiations with present leaseholders.</seg>
<seg id="20">I have to listen to the industry ... and I changed the policy.</seg>
<seg id="21">I didn't like it, but given the weight of industry pressure and urging, I accepted this change was the appropriate policy for the government.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr Tripodi said that former Waterways CEO Christopher Oxenbould had told him "almost in a fatherly way (the debate about public tender or direct negotiation) has been going on for a while now."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I was alone, with no backup," Mr Tripodi said of his belief it was better to put the Circular Quay leases out to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="24">The inquiry continues on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr Obeid is due to be called to the stand to give evidence on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Former minister Carl Scully, who the inquiry heard told senior Waterways officials that he would have to run some matters "past Eddie," will also give evidence next week</seg>

<seg id="2">Google's mysterious floating barge on San Francisco Bay will feature luxury showrooms and a party deck for the tech giant to market Google Glass and other gadgets to invitation-only clients, multiple sources told CBS station KPIX.</seg>
<seg id="3">The project, which has been in the planning stages for more than a year, was created at Google[x], the secret facility that Google reportedly runs near its corporate headquarters in Mountain View.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is personally directed by Google co-founder Sergey Brin and is Google's attempt to upstage rival Apple and its chain of popular retail stores, sources said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Google's mysterious barge will be turned into luxury showrooms</seg>
<seg id="6">Floating structure in S.F. Bay linked to Google</seg>
<seg id="7">Google Glass Debut</seg>
<seg id="8">A source who has been onboard the vessel, which is moored off San Francisco's Treasure Island under tight security, told KPIX the first three floors are designed to serve as "dazzling showrooms" that can be outfitted with chrome features and floor lighting.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is an upper "party deck" meant to feature bars, lanais and other comforts so Google can fete its upscale customers.</seg>
<seg id="10">The building is constructed of interchangeable 40-foot shipping containers that can be assembled and disassembled at will, allowing it to be placed on barges, trucks or rail cars and taken anywhere in the world, the source said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Google could send it to a ski resort one day and then have it shipped to the beach a few days later.</seg>
<seg id="12">The project has been delayed in part because the U.S. Coast Guard labeled the building a "floating vessel" that requires federally approved safety features.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Coast Guard personnel have been onboard to conduct routine inspections and ensure compliance with...regulations," Coast Guard Lt. Anna Dixon said in a statement released Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Coast Guard has refused to answer any questions about the vessel's intended use.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Regardless of the company or entity involved, the Coast Guard has an obligation to protect sensitive proprietary information, as a company's competitive posture and business interests depend on it," Dixon said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google has had no comment.</seg>
<seg id="17">But a source said Google senior executives were worried that media covering the September opening of the new eastern span of the Bay Bridge would notice the unusual barge at nearby Treasure Island and start asking questions.</seg>
<seg id="18">At least one Bay Area reporter covering the bridge opening made inquiries but never produced a story, the source said.</seg>
<seg id="19">San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee is also in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They've kept a secret from me as well," he told KPIX on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="21">A spokesperson for Jane Kim, the San Francisco supervisor who represents Treasure Island, said she would have "no comment" for now.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 100 NGOs, along with the Executive Management committee of the Mahabodhi Temple, declared a World Heritage centre, were sent notices by the Department.</seg>
<seg id="3">School students are also future tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The official have started reaching out to them too.</seg>

<seg id="8">There are many sources from which to collect the remaining amount.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said an appeal is being made to tax payers to pay their advance taxes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Departmental actions are being brought against the tax defaulters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Strict Texas abortion law takes effect</seg>
<seg id="2">HOUSTON - A federal appeals court allowed most of Texas' new abortion restrictions to take effect immediately, lifting an injunction Thursday that had suspended much of the law.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision came three days after U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel in Austin blocked restrictions that he found unconstitutional, including one that requires doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and another that limits medication-induced abortions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But a three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans sided with Texas officials, who had requested an emergency stay of Yeakel's injunction so the new law could take effect while a lawsuit challenging the measure moved forward.</seg>
<seg id="5">Planned Parenthood and other opponents of the law argued that requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges would force many clinics to close, effectively depriving 22,000 women of access to services.</seg>
<seg id="6">The appellate jurists found the state had offered sufficient evidence that the requirement protected women's health and that the restrictions "do not impose a substantial obstacle to abortions."</seg>
<seg id="7">The district court's conclusion that a state has no rational basis for requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital is but one step removed from repudiating the long-standing recognition by the [U.S.]</seg>
<seg id="8">"Supreme Court that a state may constitutionally require that only a physician may perform an abortion," Circuit Judge Priscilla Owen wrote on behalf of the panel, which also included Circuit Judges Jennifer Elrod and Catharina Haynes.</seg>
<seg id="9">Owen emphasized that the panel was not ruling on the law itself, just on the injunction.</seg>
<seg id="10">But she also wrote that the state was likely to prevail in restricting medication abortions, and that there was a "substantial likelihood" that the state would "prevail in its argument that Planned Parenthood failed to establish an undue burden on women seeking abortions" or that the admitting-privileges requirement was a "substantial obstacle" for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Owen wrote that the trial judge's limits on medication abortions were "broader than necessary" but she did not entirely lift that part of the injunction.</seg>
<seg id="12">Instead, she added a small exception to allow such abortions for women who are a couple of months pregnant when a doctor determines that, "due to a physical abnormality or preexisting condition of the mother, a surgical abortion is not a safe and medically sound option."</seg>
<seg id="13">She said the appeals court would hear the full case in January.</seg>
<seg id="14">She acknowledged the possibility "that requiring all physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions."</seg>
<seg id="15">Texas Atty.</seg>
<seg id="16">Gen. Greg Abbott praised the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="17">"This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="18">Supporters of the new law were also encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We're thrilled at the action and that the 5th Circuit finds likely merits to the case," said Emily Horne, a legislative associate at Houston-based Texas Right to Life.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, reiterated her opposition.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion statewide," she said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="22">She vowed to "take every step we can to protect the health of Texas women in the wake of this ruling."</seg>
<seg id="23">Planned Parenthood said the appeals court had made access to "safe and legal abortion virtually impossible for one-third of Texas women."</seg>
<seg id="24">When Texas lawmakers were poised to pass the new abortion restrictions this summer, state Sen. Wendy Davis drew national attention by initially blocking them with a daylong filibuster.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who is retiring, called a second special legislative session, at which the Republican-controlled Legislature passed the law.</seg>
<seg id="26">Davis, a Democrat, is now running for governor, as is Abbott, a Republican.</seg>
<seg id="27">Opponents of admitting privileges requirements have blocked them in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota and Wisconsin.</seg>
<seg id="28">State courts in North Dakota and Oklahoma have struck down restrictions on medication abortion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mississippi passed a law similar to Texas' last year, and faced similar legal challenges.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a federal judge blocked the law pending a trial in March, the state's attorney general asked the 5th Circuit to lift a temporary stay and allow the law to be enforced in the interim, but the appellate court refused.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greetings were exchanged between the two in a cabinet meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister for his speech in the meditation camp for the counter attack on Narendra Modi.</seg>
<seg id="3">He also commented on his speech, saying that he didn't have any second thoughts in his mind.</seg>
<seg id="4">He wanted the party to become strong.</seg>
<seg id="5">New challenges will be faced strongly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The expression on the Chief Minister's face showed that he had taken Singh's speech in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="7">It should be noted that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the activists in the meditation camp and to protect them from the alleged harassment by officials.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he had also said that to assert his point he was also prepared for the dissolution of the cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Though, after seeing the opinions arising from the meditation camp there was a chance that the case for putting activists into government posts will also be reconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the camp the state JDU president, Vashisht Narayan Singh, had said that the nominations of the activists in the 20-point committee would be announced soon.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also indicated that the list was almost ready.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the news is coming that Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, will have a look at the list at his level.</seg>
<seg id="13">He will also examine whether or not the opinion of the legislators and Members of Parliament was taken into account when generating the list.</seg>
<seg id="14">If need be the list will be revised on a large scale to give places to older and more committed activists.</seg>
<seg id="15">The common complaint of the legislators and Members of Parliament is that their opinion was not considered while generating the list.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the people who have come from other parties are on the list but a significant number of workers, active since the Samata Party period, have been left off.</seg>

<seg id="2">Apple announced its fifth-generation iPad tablet in California last week</seg>
<seg id="3">It is 20% thinner than the previous model and Apple claims it's twice as fast</seg>
<seg id="4">The tablet costs $499 for 16GB in U.S and from £399 in UK</seg>
<seg id="5">Fans in Australia and Japan among first to get their hands on the device</seg>
<seg id="6">Reports claim the tablet has only sold out in Hong Kong</seg>
<seg id="7">By Victoria Woollaston</seg>
<seg id="8">Since Apple announced its new range of tablets last week, the new iPad mini with its rumoured short supply and release date mystery has dominated headlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">This has left the build-up for today's release of Apple's new larger iPad Air feeling a little muted, yet that hasn't stopped hundreds of fans queuing for hours to get their hands on the high-end device.</seg>
<seg id="10">Customers in Australia and Japan were the among the first to get their hands on the 9.7-inch tablet as stores opened at 8am in each country.</seg>
<seg id="11">Keen: Customers stand in a queue outside Covent Garden's Apple store in a bid to one of the first to receive the new iPad Air</seg>
<seg id="12">Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the new iPad Air, pictured, at an event in California earlier this month</seg>
<seg id="13">Philip W. Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, unveiled the newly named iPad Air earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the fifth 9.7-inch model to be sold by the Californian firm and is 20 per cent thinner than the iPad 4, with a 5MP camera.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schiller also unveiled the new iPad mini which has a 7.9-inch Retina display for the first time, plus 10 hours battery life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The iPad Air is going on sale in 41 countries around the world, making it the biggest Apple tablet launch ever.</seg>
<seg id="17">As was seen with the release of Apple's latest iPhone 5S and 5C, the new iPad is also being sold in China from launch for the first time, as Apple attempts to attract more of the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="18">By comparison, the third-generation iPad was launched in 10 countries, while last year's iPad mini and iPad 4 launched in 27.</seg>
<seg id="19">The iPad Air also went on sale on Apple's website in various regions at midnight local time, although reports claim only the Hong Kong store has sold out.</seg>

<seg id="55">Reports suggest the new iPad Mini is delayed because of production problems surrounding the device's new Retina Display.</seg>

<seg id="66">The new 2,048 x 1,536 resolution display on the iPad mini is said to cost 'substantially more' than the 1,024 x 768 version in the original mini.</seg>
<seg id="67">According to figures from analytics firm IHS, based on current supply data, shipments of the new iPad mini with Retina Display are expected to fall below 4 million units, and could drop as low as three million ahead of next month's release.</seg>
<seg id="68">Apple shipped around 8.9 million of its first-generation iPads earlier this year, and even this wasn't enough to satisfy demand.</seg>
<seg id="69">If Apple does ship only 3 million new devices - around a third of the old amount - it could leave at least two thirds of customers disappointed as the IHS iSuppli report predicts demand for the new tablet will exceed 9 million.</seg>
<seg id="70">Many of the other features of the tablet, including screen size, have remained the same meaning production should, in theory, be similar.</seg>
<seg id="71">'Apple is being rather vague about the exact availability date of the new iPad mini with Retina Display, simply stating the product would ship later in November,' said Rhoda Alexander, director of tablet research at IHS.</seg>
<seg id="72">The company has good reason to be coy about the exact release date, given that supply of the new mini is going to be ridiculously tight in the fourth quarter.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.</seg>
<seg id="4">One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="6">The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.</seg>
<seg id="8">State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.</seg>
<seg id="9">The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kids may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels like there is hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."</seg>

<seg id="1">Serious Danger of Blood Clots Halts Sale of Leukemia Drug</seg>
<seg id="2">Sales of a promising leukemia drug, Iclusig, are being suspended because of "the risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels," the Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The drug, also known as ponatinib, has been linked to severe and sometimes fatal heart attacks and strokes, blindness and loss of blood flow in the extremities serious enough to require amputation.</seg>
<seg id="4">In some cases, the problems or deaths occurred as soon as two weeks after patients began taking the drug, the agency said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It also said some of the people affected had no risk factors for heart disease, and some were in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="6">Iclusig was approved less than a year ago to treat chronic myeloid leukemia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The risk of blood clots was known, and the label carried a warning.</seg>
<seg id="8">But over time, the problems turned out to be much worse than they appeared in the studies performed before the drug was approved.</seg>
<seg id="9">In those studies, 8 percent of people taking the drug had serious blood clots in their arteries, and 3 percent had blood clots in veins.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, the F.D.A. reports, 24 percent of patients studied a median of 1.3 years and 48 percent studied a median of 2.7 years had "serious adverse vascular events."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Those are pretty significant numbers," Stephanie Yao, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said.</seg>
<seg id="12">We can't let a drug continue to be marketed with that profile.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms. Yao said the drug was not being permanently withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said the F.D.A. would work with the company to try to identify certain types of patients who might still benefit from the drug.</seg>
<seg id="15">Chronic myeloid leukemia can be fatal, and Iclusig may be able to keep some people alive when nothing else works.</seg>
<seg id="16">For now, patients who wish to keep taking the drug can do so, Ms. Yao said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are about 5,000 new cases of chronic myeloid leukemia in the United States each year, and 600 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="18">Iclusig, made by Ariad, in Cambridge, Mass., costs more than $100,000 a year, and patients were expected to need it for life.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was part of a revolution that transformed the disease from a death sentence to a chronic disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">The revolution began with another drug, Gleevec, which was intended to fight a specific genetic defect.</seg>
<seg id="21">Iclusig was meant for patients with a mutation that made their cancer resistant to Gleevec and related drugs.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's top security official said Friday he will try and find a way for Edward Snowden to speak to German officials if the former National Security Agency contractor is willing to provide details about the NSA's activities including the alleged surveillance of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone.</seg>
<seg id="3">The comments by Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich came after a German opposition lawmaker traveled to Moscow and met Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawmaker, Hans-Christian Stroebele, said he received a letter from Snowden to German authorities that he planned to present later Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stroebele, a Green party lawmaker, is a prominent critic of the NSA's alleged activities.</seg>
<seg id="6">"If the message is that Mr. Snowden wants to give us information, then we will be glad to accept that," Friedrich said, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that "we will find a way to make a conversation possible if Mr. Snowden is prepared to talk to German officials."</seg>
<seg id="8">Friedrich's spokesman, Jens Teschke, confirmed the comments, saying "we want clarification and we want further information."</seg>
<seg id="9">He added, however, that he understood Friedrich to be referring primarily to the possibility of officials speaking to Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany is seeking answers from U.S. authorities to allegations Merkel's cellphone was monitored, which prompted the German chancellor to complain to Obama last week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Germany's government, along with many others, rejected an asylum request from Snowden earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Teschke said Friday that, if Snowden now wanted asylum in Germany, he would have to come to the country and then apply for it - but noted that Germany has an extradition treaty with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="13">German federal prosecutors are looking into whether there are grounds to investigate the allegations regarding Merkel's cellphone, but it is unclear when they might decide.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thomas Oppermann, a lawmaker who heads a parliamentary panel that oversees German intelligence, said on Twitter that if there's an opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness without endangering him and without "completely ruining" German-U.S. relations, it should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="15">Oppermann is a member of the center-left Social Democrats, who are negotiating with Merkel's conservatives to form a new German government after September elections.</seg>

<seg id="4">Kintore Primary School received a barrage of complaints from parents</seg>
<seg id="5">A primary school has apologised to parents after terrified children as young as six were shown a horror film as a Halloween 'treat'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Parents said pupils were left crying and unable to sleep after watching Paul Berry-directed film The Sandman as part of a project.</seg>
<seg id="7">The nine-minute film features a demonic creature who throws sand into the faces of sleeping children to remove their eyes and feed them to its offspring.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kintore Primary School in Aberdeenshire said it had no choice but to apologise following a barrage of complaints from angry parents.</seg>
<seg id="9">One mother said her daughter was 'very upset' and claimed her husband had to sleep in the child's bed that night to comfort her.</seg>
<seg id="10">She said: 'She just keeps saying she's scared and doesn't want to talk about it.'</seg>
<seg id="11">Another parent added: 'Our son has never really been scared much of anything really, but he's been genuinely upset all day and scared to go to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is in no way a cry-baby.</seg>
<seg id="13">I would be the first one to say "get over it son - it's just a stupid movie," but this is not what I send him to school for.'</seg>
<seg id="14">One girl at the school was so badly affected that she believed there was sand in her bed.</seg>
<seg id="15">This creature sneaks into a child's room in the nine-minute film, puts sand on her face and snatches her eyes</seg>
<seg id="16">Terrifying: The film was shown to a group of six and seven-year-old children at the Scottish school</seg>
<seg id="17">The animated video clip on YouTube has attracted a number of comments from users disturbed by the content and questioning its suitability for children.</seg>
<seg id="18">One viewer said: 'OMG!!</seg>
<seg id="19">Was this actully [sic] made for kids?!</seg>
<seg id="20">The Sandman himself looks so freaky.</seg>
<seg id="21">It looks like something that just came out of your nightmares.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another added: 'Wow...</seg>
<seg id="23">I watched this thinking it was dumb and stupid but it's actually quite freaky.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, another viewer questioned the decision by other schools to show the film.</seg>
<seg id="25">She said: 'Has the British Education system gone completely mad setting this as a lesson project?!!</seg>
<seg id="26">Kids have got quite enough in life to give them nightmares without this!</seg>
<seg id="27">As the child sleeps, the evil creature approaches her bed before taking the eyes to feed to its offspring</seg>
<seg id="28">Kintore Primary School has now apologised to the parents of children who were 'treated' to the film</seg>
<seg id="29">Kintore Primary School has now written to the parents of the 24 pupils who watched the film and apologised for the 'error of judgement'.</seg>
<seg id="30">A spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council said: 'While this Oscar-nominated short animated film is recognised as an educational resource, we do not believe it was entirely suitable for some of the children who watched it.</seg>
<seg id="31">A small section at the start of the film was used to stimulate a writing project, but the teacher agreed when children asked her to let them watch the rest, as they had enjoyed the small clip.</seg>
<seg id="32">The school has written to the parents of the 24 or so pupils who watched it, apologising for the error of judgement and for any upset it caused.</seg>

<seg id="2">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader.</seg>
<seg id="8">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.</seg>
<seg id="12">UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
<seg id="13">At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market.</seg>
<seg id="14">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Banks are scouring through years" worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="16">News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks" increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that "you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices."</seg>
<seg id="19">The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained," Credit Suisse said.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.</seg>
<seg id="2">The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together."</seg>
<seg id="4">Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."</seg>
<seg id="11">We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" back Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="2">"This provides support for the view that an improving external environment (notably in the euro area) could help support UK growth, as well as the rebalancing toward a lower trade and current account deficit," said economists at Credit Suisse in a note.</seg>
<seg id="3">However they raised concerns about the decline in the "marked decline" in employment.</seg>
<seg id="4">However others took comfort from the growth in new orders.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said the data was a " strong leading indicator of future jobs growth."</seg>
<seg id="6">But he added: "The one caveat we will have to assign to the UK manufacturing remains the economic area 21 miles off our coast - Europe."</seg>
<seg id="7">Recent data from the Eurozone has remained poor, and should we see another European slowdown, we will not be unaffected here in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="8">We would expect the manufacturing sector to be the first part of the economy to show the strain as orders dry up.</seg>
<seg id="9">The manufacturing sector is still 9pc smaller than before the financial crisis, unlike the services sectors which has recovered all the ground lost during the downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">However economists said the growth was encouraging, regardless of the slowdown in the past two months.</seg>
<seg id="11">Barclays pointed out that the index is "still significantly above the long-run average of 51.3 and is consistent with a solid pace of expansion similar to what it experienced during the revival of manufacturing in 2010-11."</seg>
<seg id="12">Howard Archer, economist at IHS, added that the "very decent" data "provides some reassurance on the strength of the economy after some recent signs that it has lost some momentum after a surge in activity during the second and third quarters."</seg>

<seg id="1">British Tabloid Editors Charged in Hacking Scandal Had Affair, Prosecutors Say</seg>
<seg id="2">LONDON - A high-profile phone hacking trial in Britain turned considerably seamier on Thursday when the prosecution revealed in court that the two most senior editors of the tabloid The News of the World had an affair lasting more than six years - during the period at issue in the trial, and also while both of them married other people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Andy Rain/European Pressphoto Agency</seg>
<seg id="4">Rebekah Brooks, above, and Andy Coulson, former top editors of The News of the World tabloid, are accused of conspiring with others to hack phones and of conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office.</seg>
<seg id="5">Facundo Arrizabalaga/European Pressphoto Agency</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Coulson.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their trial involves a total of eight defendants.</seg>
<seg id="8">The two editors, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, are defendants in the case surrounding the British newspapers controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation empire, including The News of the World, a weekly that the company shut down in 2011 after the hacking scandal broke.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms. Brooks was the editor of The News of the World from 2000 to 2003 and then moved to its sister daily tabloid, The Sun; Mr. Coulson was her deputy at the weekly and succeeded her as its editor, running the paper until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="10">Andrew Edis, a prosecutor in the case, said in open court that the two began their six-year affair in 1998; Mr. Coulson married in 2000, and Ms. Brooks married in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Coulson remains married; Ms. Brooks was divorced in 2009, and then she married her current husband, Charlie Brooks, who is also a defendant in the case.</seg>
<seg id="12">The prosecutor said the Brooks-Coulson affair ended long before Mr. Coulson went to work for Prime Minister David Cameron after his election in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="13">The prosecutor's revelation made it legally permissible to publish reports of the affair, which had been widely discussed in private by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Edis justified the revelation by saying it demonstrated the closeness of the two, who are charged with overseeing a pattern of phone hacking and other illegal efforts to obtain details of the lives of prominent people.</seg>
<seg id="15">The targets of the hacking ranged from politicians and socialites to Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old who was abducted in 2002 and later found dead.</seg>
<seg id="16">The paper broke into her voice mail account while she was missing, to listen to messages left for her by her parents.</seg>
<seg id="17">The paper also hacked the phones of competing journalists.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Throughout the relevant period, what Mr. Coulson knew, Mrs. Brooks knew, too," Mr. Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="19">What Mrs. Brooks knew, Mr. Coulson knew, too.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's the point.</seg>
<seg id="21">He argued that none of the illegal acts undertaken by the paper's journalists or the freelancers it hired were likely to have been unknown to the top editors, and that they were unlikely to have kept such secrets from one another.</seg>
<seg id="22">The relationship came to the attention of the police when investigators found a letter addressed to Mr. Coulson at Ms. Brooks's home, written in February 2004 when Mr. Coulson was trying to end the affair.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The fact is you are my very best friend, I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you, we laugh and cry together," the letter said, as Mr. Edis read it in court.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without our relationship in my life, I am not sure I will cope.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Edis asserted that he was not trying to embarrass the two defendants, to intrude into their private lives or to make a moral judgment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mrs. Brooks and Mr. Coulson are charged with conspiracy and, when people are charged with conspiracy, the first question a jury has to answer is, How well did they know each other?</seg>
<seg id="27">"How much did they trust each other?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">And the fact that they were in this relationship, which was a secret, means that they trusted each other quite a lot with at least that secret, and that's why we are telling you about it.</seg>
<seg id="29">The trial, with a total of eight defendants, is expected to last many months.</seg>
<seg id="30">Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson are accused of conspiring with others to hack phones and of conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office, a reference to payoffs made to the police and other officials.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ms. Brooks also faces charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Her husband is accused of helping her to hide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="33">All eight defendants deny the charges against them.</seg>
<seg id="34">On Wednesday, Mr. Edis revealed that four other people had pleaded guilty to having hacked phone accounts on behalf of The News of the World.</seg>
<seg id="35">He argued that the jury should consider those pleas as evidence of a conspiracy, and that senior editors must have been aware of the acts of underlings.</seg>
<seg id="36">"They must have known where these stories came from, or they never would have got in the paper," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch</seg>
<seg id="2">At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there," Mrs Amirthalinga says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.</seg>
<seg id="12">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">"People are saying "the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month,"" says Mr Song.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="21">Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs," says Ms Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court Reinstates Most of Texas' New Abortion Rules</seg>
<seg id="2">AUSTIN, Texas - A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled that most of Texas' tough new abortion restrictions can take effect immediately - a decision that means at least 12 clinics won't be able to perform the procedure starting as soon as Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">A panel of judges at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said the law requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital can take effect while a lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="4">The panel issued the ruling three days after District Judge Lee Yeakel said the provision serves no medical purpose.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its 20-page ruling, the appeals court panel acknowledged that the provision "may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions."</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the panel said that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that having "the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate" a law that serves a valid purpose, "one not designed to strike at the right itself."</seg>
<seg id="7">The panel left in place a portion of Yeakel's order that prevents the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol for abortion-inducing drugs in cases where the woman is between 50 and 63 days into her pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doctors testifying before the court had said such women would be harmed if the protocol were enforced.</seg>
<seg id="9">After Yeakel halted the restrictions, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott had made an emergency appeal to the conservative 5th Circuit, arguing that the law requiring doctors to have admitting privileges is a constitutional use of the Legislature's authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women," Abbott, a Republican who is running for governor, said in a written statement.</seg>
<seg id="11">Lawyers for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers had argued that the regulations do not protect women and would shut down a third of the 32 abortion clinics in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a statement Thursday, Planned Parenthood said the appeals court decision means "abortion will no longer be available in vast stretches of Texas."</seg>
<seg id="13">"This fight is far from over," Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion statewide.</seg>
<seg id="15">The court's order is temporary until it can hold a complete hearing, likely in January.</seg>
<seg id="16">The restrictions are among the toughest in the nation and gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June.</seg>
<seg id="17">Davis has since launched her own gubernatorial campaign and could face Abbott in the November 2014 election.</seg>
<seg id="18">Republican Gov. Rick Perry has said he will not seek another term.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law that the Legislature passed this summer also bans abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy and beginning in October 2014 requires doctors to perform all abortions in surgical facilities.</seg>
<seg id="20">Officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified in the trial that Yeakel oversaw that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision.</seg>
<seg id="21">Many hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there, while others fear protests if they provide privileges.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility, or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.</seg>

<seg id="10">If one player is getting tagged, if it's Kieren or Hanners or myself, another player might get off the chain.</seg>
<seg id="11">Joey (Kennedy) and you've got O'Keefe and Jude (Bolton) and Parkes (Luke Parker) so there are a lot of guys who can step up if someone is down.</seg>
<seg id="12">You need a lot of those midfielders playing well each week to win.</seg>
<seg id="13">We've got guys in the reserves who will come through like Jed Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="14">McVeigh has led the way for the defending premiers this year with standout performances in the opening five rounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">He's averaged a touch over 103 Supercoach points per game and leads the Swans goalkicking with 11 for the year.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Sunday, the 28-year-old will chalk up his 200th game when the Swans take on Brisbane at the SCG.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jarrad's brother Mark retired last year after playing 232 games for Essendon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The McVeigh brothers will become the first New South Welshmen to achieve the double milestone since Terry and Anthony Daniher, who coincidentally played at the Swans and Essendon.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mark is sure to be there at the SCG on Sunday after returning to Sydney to take up a position with the NSWAFL in the off season.</seg>
<seg id="20">The brothers grew up kicking the ball to each other in Killarney Vale on the Central Coast and played for Pennant Hills before embarking on successful AFL careers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I learned a lot from him and went to Essendon and training sessions and really followed his career really closely," Jarrad McVeigh said.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm really proud of the way his (Mark's) career panned out and the way he played and the way he carried himself.</seg>
<seg id="23">The celebrations have been coming thick and fast for the McVeigh's -- who like the Shaw's (Rhyce and Heath) and the Reid's (Sam and Ben) were there to enjoy the Swans premiership success last year.</seg>
<seg id="24">"For me to be retiring and in the parade on the day my brother was the captain of the Swans was the greatest thing," Mark McVeigh said.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a very special moment because I know what Jarrad has come from to be the player he is.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kendrick Johnson's parents believe his death was no accident</seg>
<seg id="2">(CBS News) A federal prosecutor in Georgia said Thursday he will conduct a formal review into the death of a teenager whose body was found in his high school gym.</seg>
<seg id="3">His parents believe his death was no accident.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was Jan.</seg>
<seg id="5">10 when surveillance cameras at a Valdosta, Ga., high school captured video of Kendrick Johnson walking a hallway and then later strolling alone across the gymnasium floor.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in a rolled-up mat in his high school gym.</seg>
<seg id="7">His parents believe he was murdered.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was an unremarkable moment.</seg>
<seg id="9">But sometime in the next 24 hours, the 17-year-old three-sport athlete died.</seg>
<seg id="10">His body was found Jan.</seg>
<seg id="11">11 inside a rolled-up wrestling mat that was propped on its end behind some bleachers in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="12">A Georgia coroner ruled the death accidental and police theorized Johnson suffocated after falling headfirst into the rolled-up mat trying to retrieve a sneaker.</seg>
<seg id="13">But his family suspected foul play.</seg>
<seg id="14">They had his body exhumed and hired a private pathologist, who reported finding evidence of "blunt force trauma" on his neck.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson say they want justice for their son, Kendrick.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the state medical examiner ruled Kendrick's death accidental, his parents believe he met with foul play.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson want justice for their son.</seg>
<seg id="18">I really believe he was murdered.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You can tell by the way he looked with bruises on his face," Kenneth Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Johnson family has hired Benjamin Crump, the same attorney who worked with the family of Trayvon Martin, the African-American teenager who was shot and killed in Florida in a confrontation with Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman.</seg>
<seg id="21">Supporters of Johnson's family have held rallies alleging a cover-up.</seg>
<seg id="22">They've demanded a federal investigation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Supporters of the Johnson family held a rally, alleging there has been a cover-up in Kendrick's death.</seg>
<seg id="24">On Thursday, U.S. Attorney Michael Moore agreed to look into the case.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I do this with an open mind, neither accepting nor rejecting the opinions of anyone who has previously investigated the circumstances of his death," Moore said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moore says if he finds evidence of a possible crime, he'll press the FBI to investigate.</seg>
<seg id="27">But the Georgia chief medical examiner is standing by his finding that the death was accidental, saying there is no evidence the teenager was murdered.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Asda Nazi: Man kicked out of supermarket for browsing aisles dressed in full Nazi SS uniform</seg>
<seg id="2">Police have been called to a branch of Asda after a man was seen wandering the aisles wearing a full Nazi SS uniform.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident occurred in a Cambridge branch of the supermarket yesterday afternoon, with a 48-year-old local man taking to Twitter today to claim responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="4">Using the Twitter handle Operation Fail Safe, Paul Dutton said: "I got ejected from #ASDA for wearing something that is good enough for a #Prince 2 wear #Asda are a bunch of #Racists."</seg>
<seg id="5">He added: "I wear a Black SS armband in Asda twice a week for past 3 years..."</seg>
<seg id="6">I've shopped in Asda since the place was opened twice a week, this is how Asda repay me for my loyalty.</seg>
<seg id="7">Elsewhere on his Twitter page, which is adorned with images of Adolf Hitler and photographs of Nazi tattoos, Mr Dutton claimed that he had visited the supermarket to hand out cards promoting his website, which he says explains his reasons for wearing a Nazi outfit.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers confirmed that attended the scene but a spokeswoman said: "By the time we got there he had already left peacefully."</seg>
<seg id="9">The supermarket's manager said he asked the man to leave the Beehive Centre store after receiving a number of complaints from horrified shoppers, with several taking to social media to voice their anger.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many originally assumed the outfit was a Halloween prank.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hayley Dunn tweeted: "Just saw a man dressed up as a Nazi officer covered in swastikas in Cambridge Asda!"</seg>
<seg id="12">That is not cool man, not cool #badcostume.</seg>
<seg id="13">Speaking to the Cambridge News, Rosina Rusin, whose father was Polish and mother was of Dutch-Jewish descent, said: "I wanted to make sure he was evicted."</seg>
<seg id="14">My grandmother's family were annihilated in the gas chambers and I thought here is this bloke parading about....</seg>
<seg id="15">One lady was very upset - she was close to crying.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 60-year-old added: "I was waiting in a queue when a lady came up and she was really quite distressed about it..."</seg>
<seg id="17">People's mouths were falling open.</seg>
<seg id="18">You are not going to come out like that unless you want to draw attention to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="19">A spokeswoman for Asda said: "We had a number of customer complaints so we asked him to leave the store."</seg>
<seg id="20">The same branch of Asda attracted attention last month when it was forced to use fruit and vegetable signs in the Welsh language after a mix-up at the printers left them short of English ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">With over 200 miles separating Cambridge from the Welsh border, the bi-lingual banners came as something of a shock to shoppers, who were jokingly told by an official Asda spokesman joking that it would give them a chance to brush up on their Welsh.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just 19% of the Welsh population is fluent in the language.</seg>
<seg id="23">The previous month Asda was heavily criticised over a Halloween costume it was selling that campaigners said stigmatised people with mental health issues.</seg>
<seg id="24">After withdrawing an outfit, the supermarket made a donation to mental health charity Mind as an apology.</seg>

<seg id="1">Policing L.A.'s sheriff - latimes.com</seg>
<seg id="2">It is time to seriously consider a civilian oversight board for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider such a proposal next week.</seg>
<seg id="4">If approved, it could be a big step toward remedying some of the ongoing problems in our county jails.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last few years have been tough for the department, which has been plagued by jail scandals, committee inquiries and even a federal investigation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the efforts of committed professionals within and outside the department to monitor abuses in the jail system, the problems have continued.</seg>
<seg id="7">Meanwhile, the public has only been invited into the process once the situation has reached crisis dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="8">A citizen oversight board has the advantage of providing a constant outsider view of the operations of the Sheriff's Department, very much in the same way that the Los Angeles Police Commission monitors the Los Angeles Police Department.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rather than gearing up to deal with the next inevitable crisis, the Board of Supervisors should focus on what monitoring will be the most effective in preventing scandals in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="10">For years, I have taught law students about our county jail system.</seg>
<seg id="11">We seem to be caught in an endless loop of crises.</seg>
<seg id="12">It begins with revelations of problems in the jails and the board's criticisms of the sheriff.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then follows a promise of reforms, but these reforms do not include any mechanism for the public to monitor their implementation or efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next the public hears of the jails is another round of criticism and another set of reform pledges.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Board of Supervisors is in the process of selecting an inspector general for the Sheriff's Department.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is hoped that individual will have the expertise to investigate allegations of improper conduct by the department.</seg>
<seg id="17">But this will not break the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rather, for public confidence to be fully restored, there must be civilian overseers who will not only react to allegations of misconduct but also be proactive in making reforms.</seg>
<seg id="19">And such a board must have the power to ensure that its members' voices will truly be heard.</seg>
<seg id="20">Allocating this responsibility to the supervisors alone, or even to the supervisors and an inspector general, does not take into account what makes citizen panels so special.</seg>
<seg id="21">French historian Alexis de Tocqueville once said: "The surface of American society is covered with a layer of democratic paint, but from time to time one can see the old aristocratic colors breaking through."</seg>
<seg id="22">For those concerned about what will happen next in the supervision of the Sheriff's Department, the current system smacks a bit too much of democracy without real input from the citizenry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Certainly, a citizen can complain to her supervisor about the jails and even suggest a change or two.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, what citizens cannot currently do is engage in discussions of what causes abuse and problems and, more important, what should be done about them.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are 10 million reasons civilian oversight should play a role in reforming the Sheriff's Department and our jails - the 10 million residents of Los Angeles County.</seg>
<seg id="26">Appointed by the Board of Supervisors, a panel of civilians could give regular, informed feedback to the supervisors regarding any ongoing problems in the jails and regarding the public's perception of the effectiveness of the work of the new inspector general.</seg>
<seg id="27">Integrating residents' concerns into the decision-making process would not displace the authority of the supervisors or the sheriff.</seg>
<seg id="28">Rather, it would create a partnership in the effort to reform our jails.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a partnership is what has been lacking in prior efforts to monitor and change the department.</seg>
<seg id="30">Opponents of a civilian oversight board have argued that the Board of Supervisors alone, or now in conjunction with a newly created inspector general office, is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, neither entity brings to the table the direct voice of the community, one not filtered through a political process or limited to a lengthy fact-finding role.</seg>
<seg id="32">If legislation is needed to define the role and responsibilities of a civilian oversight board, then the supervisors should push for such legislation.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, the public should not be left again with empty promises of change.</seg>
<seg id="34">Professional monitoring by an inspector general is important, but so are the voices of the people.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jagaran Bureau, Shrinagar: The police have allegedly removed the security of the former Minister Ghulam Hasan Khan who joined Congress from the People Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="2">Khan blamed the government, saying that his security has been removed for political reasons.</seg>
<seg id="3">It may be recalled that in the year 2002 Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the 2002 elections from Shopian on a PDP ticket, was included in the cabinet, while Mufti Mohamed Sayeed was a Chief Minister.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ghulam Hassan Khan said he has had protection since 1996.</seg>
<seg id="5">I live in Shopian, which is believed to be a stronghold of terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="6">A CRPF security team under the leadership of a sub-inspector is stationed at my house.</seg>
<seg id="7">I have also bodyguards, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="8">As when the security team was leaving from my house I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and District Superintendent.</seg>
<seg id="9">But instead of restoring security they just said that they would investigate the matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, in this regard, when the Kashmir IGP, Abdul Gani Meer, was contacted he denied any knowledge of the issue and said that it was a sensitive issue.</seg>
<seg id="11">I should check it out myself. After all, how can the protection of a former minister and senior political leader be removed?</seg>
<seg id="12">The State Congress Chief, Prof. Safudin Soz, said that as far as he knew  nothing of this kind had ever happened before.</seg>
<seg id="13">If Hasan Khan's security has been compromised, then it is a very serious matter.</seg>
<seg id="14">I am in Jammu now and will be coming to Kashmir in a day or two.</seg>
<seg id="15">I will discuss this issue with the authorities concerned.</seg>

<seg id="2">Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scotland Yard said they had served a "surrender notice" on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fearing Stockholm would pass him on to the US, he sought refuge at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.</seg>
<seg id="6">Scotland Yard has "served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He remains in breach of his bail conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The embassy declined to comment on the serving of the police notice.</seg>

<seg id="2">Most Manhattanites get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of their daily commute they barely take the time to look up from their morning paper or mobile device to notice the city's sights and sounds buzzing around them.</seg>
<seg id="3">They ride the subway every day and usually see the conductors as they pull up to the platform, but it's safe to say most people have never noticed a certain unusual action every MTA subway conductor must perform as soon as they pull into the station.</seg>
<seg id="4">Each New York City subway conductor must physically point at a black and white striped board, formally known as the conductor's indication board, once the train has successfully reached the platform.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conductor's point is the sole indicator it is now safe to open the doors to let the passengers depart.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pranksters Serve Up Free Pizza With a Shocking Side of Zombie</seg>
<seg id="7">But when a pair of pranksters heard about this random fact, they decided to have a little fun with the hardworking conductors by spicing up their monotonous finger-pointing routine.</seg>
<seg id="8">"As I used the subway I started looking out for it, and they do it at every single station," Yosef Lerner, one of tricksters who created this clever video, told GoodMorningAmerica.com.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's funny that we make them do this robotic thing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lerner, 25, and his friend, Rose Sacktor, 24, both of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, saw the repetitive movement as an opportunity to quite literally stop the conductors in their tracks, ultimately making their day by putting a smile on their face.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I thought it would be funny to hold up signs about something they'd have no choice but to point at," said Lerner.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roommates Turn Friend's Room Pink in Viral Prank</seg>
<seg id="13">So they did.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Point here if you are dead sexy" was the first of the bunch.</seg>
<seg id="15">Others included "Point here if you are not wearing pants right now," "Point here if you have seen a passenger naked" and "Point here if NY is the greatest city in the world."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soliciting nothing but smiles and laughter, Lerner and Sacktor's subway experiment was a roaring success.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I saw it as an opportunity to snap them out of it," Lerner said of the conductors" isolating routine.</seg>
<seg id="18">We wanted to let them know we see you, we know you're working and we appreciate what you do.</seg>
<seg id="19">The pranksters" YouTube video documenting their time in eight different subway stations has already garnered more than 150,000 views since it was originally uploaded on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="20">30, and the positive response is prompting the pair to continue their smile-seeking efforts.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Any way we can help people snap out of their day to day and create an interesting moment for people who would otherwise feel bored and isolated, that's what we're going to do," said Lerner.</seg>
<seg id="22">Be on the lookout, because we're planning for that.</seg>

<seg id="2">BATTLER: Joel with his parents David Senge and Simone Boase at Adelaide's Women's and Children's hospital intensive care unit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Sam Wundke.</seg>
<seg id="4">THE mother of a nine-year-old Darwin boy has praised doctors at Adelaide's Women's and Children's Hospital for performing an emergency lifesaving operation to remove a large tumour from his brain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Joel Boase-Senge was medically evacuated from Darwin on Wednesday morning after doctors at Royal Darwin Hospital discovered the tumour, which was so big it was pressing against his left eye and had begun to grow down his spine.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was flown to Adelaide with his distraught parents David Senge and Simone Boase, who were told Joel had a 50 per cent chance of surviving the marathon seven-hour operation on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Doctors told the family they were shocked Joel had made it to Adelaide alive.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mrs Boase said she was "so grateful" for the support and expertise from hospital staff.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It was really hard at first, coming here from Darwin and not knowing anyone or the city, it was very daunting," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the staff have been wonderful and the support from everyone has helped keep us strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">We're relieved he made it through the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="12">She said Joel still had a "long journey" ahead.</seg>
<seg id="13">We still don't have answers as to what the tumour was or whether he'll need chemo or radiotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's so unfair because he's such a good kid," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Joel's uncle Matthew Rivas said before the operation that the Moil family was "crushed."</seg>
<seg id="16">"We are all absolutely devastated and just so crushed," Mr Rivas said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Rivas said Joel's symptoms, which included headaches and nausea, were not initially thought to be serious by doctors back in February and even thought to have been caused by Joel's overbite.</seg>
<seg id="18">But three weeks ago the symptoms became worse, with Joel experiencing double vision and severe vomiting, causing Simone to demand a scan at Royal Darwin Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="19">Simone actually said to the doctors at the hospital 'I think these are symptoms of a brain tumour.'</seg>
<seg id="20">And then at 11pm on Tuesday night they finally gave Joel an MRI and discovered the tumour on his brain.</seg>
<seg id="21">The tumour was so big that it had started to cause blindness in one of Joel's eyes, caused by the pressure on the inside of the left eye.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was also discovered in Adelaide it had grown down his spine and reached his third vertebrae.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We were given the worst-case scenario and that is that Joel had a 50-50 chance of making it through the operation," Mr Rivas said.</seg>
<seg id="24">We were then told that after waking he could be deaf in his left ear or have partial paralysis of his face.</seg>
<seg id="25">Unfortunately, surgeons won't be able to remove all the tumour because if they go too close to his spine it could lead to paralysis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Despite all this, Mr Rivas said his nephew was typically upbeat, and has maintained had kept his sense of humour.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He is just a very, very upbeat boy, with a great humour - just such a cheery kid," he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">The family will be in Adelaide for months, piling financial pressure on to the stresses they are already facing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stephen Larkham named Brumbies head coach, Laurie Fisher director of rugby</seg>
<seg id="2">The Brumbies will announce today that Stephen Larkham and Laurie Fisher will work together as head coach and director of coaching next season, following the shock departure of Jake White last month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brumbies head coach Stephen Larkham and director of rugby Laurie Fisher after the announcement of their new coaching structure in Canberra.</seg>
<seg id="4">THE Brumbies have confirmed Wallabies great Stephen Larkham and former head coach Laurie Fisher will share coaching duties for the club's next two Super Rugby seasons.</seg>
<seg id="5">Larkham will be the club's head coach, while Fisher has been appointed the Brumbies' director of rugby.</seg>
<seg id="6">As head coach, Larkham will have greater input and involvement with the overall organisation of the team and play a bigger part in recruitment and weekly selections.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fisher will control day-to-day rugby operations with elements like staffing, elite and academy program development, talent pathways and training structures.</seg>
<seg id="8">The appointments come following the shock resignation of South African-born World Cup-winning coach Jake White in September, who left just over a month after taking the side to the Super Rugby final.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the media conference to announce their appointments on Friday, Larkham was confident he and Fisher could keep the club's momentum going.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Nothing is going to change in terms of how we run the team," Larkham said."</seg>
<seg id="11">""Off the field, it's going to be the same.</seg>
<seg id="12">Laurie spoke to the forwards, I spoke to the backs, and Jake oversaw that process.</seg>
<seg id="13">Larkham, Australia's greatest modern day five-eighth, will also have greater authority over the team's overall attacking philosophies.</seg>
<seg id="14">But he indicated there would be plenty of room for Fisher's input across the park.</seg>
<seg id="15">There's robust discussions, and you put in your arguments to one another.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It's whoever argues the best point really, comes away with it at the end," he said."</seg>
<seg id="17">""We're fairly logical sort of men, so we come down and understand where the other person is coming from."</seg>
<seg id="18">Fisher, who was Brumbies head coach from 2005-'08, said the key to making the partnership work would be communication.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Whether it's a marriage, or whether it's a rugby program, if you're not talking about it, you're going to struggle," he said."</seg>
<seg id="20">""It's like any system.</seg>
<seg id="21">No one person in any environment determines exactly how it's done.</seg>
<seg id="22">Fisher said on top of his new duties, he'd continue to focus on the forwards, the breakdown and the tackle contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">We need to develop more locally bred Brumbies players.</seg>
<seg id="24">"So I'm really keen to get my teeth into that area," he said."</seg>
<seg id="25">Brumbies chief executive Andrew Fagan said an assistant coach would be appointed to assist Larkham and Fisher.</seg>
<seg id="26">""Their primary responsibilities will be defence, but will support the program as required," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash</seg>
<seg id="2">The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.</seg>
<seg id="3">"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The issue will be resolved this evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.</seg>
<seg id="8">No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.</seg>
<seg id="12">The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.</seg>

<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- The owner of a Houston key and lock shop said he and his crew spent weeks working to crack open a safe that turned out to be filled with gold coins.</seg>
<seg id="3">Robert Rivera of Robbie's Key and Lock shop said a customer brought in the old safe and told him the family of a recently deceased man had given it to him to sell as scrap, KTRK-TV, Houston, reported Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="5">I was going to get some C4 [explosives].</seg>

<seg id="8">Mike DeGuerin, an attorney for the family of the recently deceased man, said the coins are being returned to the family as part of an agreement with the man who received the safe to return any valuable contents.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jurors at the first trial to result from Bernard Madoff's enormous fraud have heard a former Madoff employee explain how he created fictitious trades and how his financier boss lied to investors.</seg>
<seg id="3">David Kugel (KOO'-guhl), who previously pleaded guilty to charges in the case, told federal jurors Thursday in Manhattan how he assembled fictitious trades for decades that could be put on statements sent to thousands of investors.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those investors learned in December 2008 that Madoff had been carrying out a gigantic Ponzi scheme for decades.</seg>
<seg id="5">Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sydney form holds the key to classic Derby</seg>
<seg id="2">THE distinct class edge of Complacent is neutralised by his wide gate in Saturday's Victoria Derby at Flemington.</seg>
<seg id="3">Complacent is rated on 102 by Victorian handicappers and the next highest are Criterion (94) and Savvy Nature (92).</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the Complacent figures were earned at his past two starts, drawing the rails barrier, whereas Kerrin McEvoy will launch him from 14 in the classic if the two reserves come out.</seg>
<seg id="5">Derby fave: James McDonald and Savvy Nature win the Vase.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dom Beirne, the Betfair form analyst, reckons the Peter Snowden pair Complacent and San Diego (six) will go forward but the jockeying for positions to the first turn will be vital.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rails barrier will be a "godsend" to local three-year-old Polanski, Beirne says, because he should box seat.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Notions that Savvy Nature (11) would be ridden closer from a good barrier draw have to be dismissed completely," Beirne said.</seg>
<seg id="9">If jockey James McDonald is in any doubt, tie him to a lounge chair and make him view replays of his ride on It's A Dundeel in the Cox Plate last Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="10">After watching the race 20 or 30 times, find the tape of Arena winning the 1998 VRC Derby from barrier 14 and show him that 20 or 30 times.</seg>
<seg id="11">Larry Cassidy, on Arena, was following the instructions of astute owner "Big" Jack Ingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Come out and go back to last," he was told.</seg>
<seg id="13">For most of the race, Cassidy scouted the rail; Racenet maintained that Arena couldn't afford to give ground away "circling the field."</seg>
<seg id="14">Riding for luck obviously came into play but McDonald can be more relaxed on Savvy Dancer going back to the tail.</seg>
<seg id="15">While Beirne sees Polanski, successful in the Norman Robinson at Caulfield last start beating San Diego, getting a smooth passage, only one winner of that race has taken the Victoria Derby in the past 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="16">San Diego, to my eye, had more scope for improvement at Caulfield.</seg>
<seg id="17">Certainly the Moonee Valley Vase, going to Savvy Nature last Saturday against common opposition, has been a better guide than the Norman Robinson.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beirne has Savvy Nature, from the John O'Shea stable, on top with Polanski a saver.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps Savvy Nature was beaten in the Spring Champion Stakes at Randwick two starts back by Complacent which had a perfect run.</seg>
<seg id="20">Savvy Nature has had the benefit of another race and blinkers.</seg>
<seg id="21">I'm comfortable with McDonald.</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe his It's A Dundeel effort wasn't flash but the entire was under a fitness cloud.</seg>
<seg id="23">A week earlier, McDonald's navigation from the 18 gate on minor placegetter Dear Demi in the Caulfield Cup was exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="24">I'm going for Sydney form and the gamble that Complacent will have to work much harder than before.</seg>
<seg id="25">Verdict: Savvy Nature 1, Complacent 2, Criterion 3, San Diego 4.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bart Cummings influence in the Carbine Club Stakes goes back to Think Big taking the 1600-metre test for three-year-olds in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="27">Subsequent winners for him include Saintly (1995) and Lunar Rise last year, so Saintly Lad, prepared by him and grandson James, has to be considered, despite a poor Victorian handicap rating.</seg>
<seg id="28">Saintly Lad, a promising but somewhat erratic maiden, is on only 64, while favourite Hucklebuck, from Adelaide, is at 80 and has to give Saintly Lad only a kilo.</seg>
<seg id="29">Team Cummings has dispensed with blinkers on Saintly Lad which will have a noseroll applied.</seg>
<seg id="30">He's also taking on the Gai Waterhouse three-year-old, Equator, another on 80.</seg>
<seg id="31">Equator was a reasonable sixth, beaten 3.2 lengths, in the group 1 Spring Champion Stakes at Randwick on October 12.</seg>
<seg id="32">Back in class and distance, with Glen Boss up, should suit him.</seg>
<seg id="33">Verdict: Equator 1, Saintly Lad 2, Hucklebuck 3, Sir Andrew 4.</seg>
<seg id="34">Kelinni, a Chris Waller import, could be ready to produce his spring credentials in the Lexus following a setback before The Metrop at Randwick.</seg>
<seg id="35">Possibly he was ninth in the Caulfield Cup last start but downed less than three lengths.</seg>
<seg id="36">Still Araldo has the best recent credentials, beating Sea Moon on a justifiable protest over the Flemington 2500 metres on October 5.</seg>
<seg id="37">And Sea Moon is very good, confirmed in the Herbert Power subsequently in which Let's Make Adeal, the granddaughter of Let's Elope, was knocked rotten.</seg>
<seg id="38">Verdict: Araldo 1, Kelinni 2, Ironstein 3, Kingdoms 4.</seg>
<seg id="39">Considering the short odds about Zoustar, Missy Longstocking for the place is the best gamble in the Coolmore Stud Stakes in the opinion of Beirne.</seg>
<seg id="40">The straight-six course concerns me about Zoustar having his first attempt but not enough to take him on, particularly if the colt gets to a black price.</seg>
<seg id="41">Divine Calling appeals as the danger.</seg>
<seg id="42">Divine Calling was beaten a length by Zoustar at Hawkesbury in May but while the Chris Waller colt has improved considerably, so has Divine Calling, particularly in Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="43">Coming back from the 1600m of the Caulfield Guineas when a gallant second isn't a big hurdle.</seg>
<seg id="44">Verdict: Zoustar 1, Divine Calling 2, Missy Longstocking 3, Thump 4.</seg>
<seg id="45">Pakal, in the Mackinnon Stakes, is a best bet from bookmaker Tom Waterhouse.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Carried 60kg to victory last start in his dominant Cranbourne Cup win," Waterhouse wrote on the Racenet poll of leading betting houses.</seg>
<seg id="47">[Runner-up] Sertorius since franked form winning the Bendigo Cup.</seg>
<seg id="48">Majority of field unsuited dropping back from 2400m of Caulfield Cup.</seg>
<seg id="49">Despite the Cranbourne Cup only being a listed event, Pakal has a 107 rating, while the best in the weight-for-age Mackinnon is Solzhenitsyn on 114.</seg>
<seg id="50">Solzhenitsyn is untested over the 2000m trip but has the benefit of Rob Heathcote and Nash Rawiller.</seg>
<seg id="51">Heathcote horses are just so consistent.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of course Jet Away, the David Hayes import, is the favourite and put up what was described as an "amazing" fourth after pulling hard in the Caulfield Cup a fortnight ago.</seg>
<seg id="53">With a crossover noseband and Glen Boss atop he should settle better from the rails gate, particularly as stewards have been notified that Mourayan intends to lead.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watch Moriarty though.</seg>

<seg id="1">Baby P's mother is released from jail: Tracey Connelly, who let her son be tortured to death, will get a new name</seg>
<seg id="2">32-year-old is also expected to have new hairstyle upon release</seg>
<seg id="3">She was granted parole earlier this month more than three years in prison</seg>
<seg id="4">Connelly admitted she allowed her 17 month old to be tortured to death</seg>
<seg id="5">By Amie Keeley and Rebecca Camber</seg>
<seg id="6">Freed: Tracey Connelly will get a new name and her appearance will be changed when she is released</seg>
<seg id="7">The mother of tragic Baby P has been released from prison.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tracey Connelly, 32, was jailed indefinitely with a minimum of five years in May 2009 after she allowed her 17-month-old son to be tortured to death by her lover.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last night, sources confirmed Connelly had been freed from jail after being granted parole earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was reported that Connelly will be given a new name and hairstyle in an attempt to live her life anonymously - but not a full new identity.</seg>
<seg id="11">The news comes days after it emerged that sacked child protection boss Sharon Shoesmith, whose council department failed to protect the child, is to receive almost £700,000 for unfair dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="12">Baby Peter suffered more than 50 injuries, including a broken back, over an eight-month period despite being registered as at-risk and repeated visits to his home by Haringey Children's services and NHS health professionals.</seg>
<seg id="13">He died in hospital after being found in his blood stained cot at his mother's flat in Tottenham, north London in August 2007.</seg>
<seg id="14">Connelly admitted the offence soon after being charged and served several hundred days on remand.</seg>
<seg id="15">She admitted she did nothing while her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his paedophile brother, Jason Owen, tortured Peter to death.</seg>
<seg id="16">In October, a parole board concluded that Connelly posed "no danger to the public" and should be released from jail.</seg>
<seg id="17">The news outraged relatives of Baby Peter's father, who said she should never be let out.</seg>
<seg id="18">A Probation Service source said Connelly could be "smuggled" out of jail to avoid her being attacked.</seg>
<seg id="19">Connelly was first arrested in 2006 after a GP noticed bruises and scratches on Baby Peter's face and chest.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was consequently put in care, but returned home just a month later.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tortured to death: Baby Peter, who was just 17 months when he died</seg>
<seg id="22">Despite being hospitalised by further abuse and police being told, Haringey Council's children and young people's service concluded that the "threshold to initiate care proceedings" had not been met.</seg>
<seg id="23">Baby Peter's death came a day after he was taken to hospital, where a broken back and broken ribs are thought to have gone undetected by doctors.</seg>
<seg id="24">Following the tragedy, a full investigation into child protection services at Haringey Council was carried out and former child protection boss Sharon Shoesmith was sacked from her £133,000-a-year job.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sharon Shoesmith, the former director of children's services at Haringey Council, was sacked over the Baby P scandal</seg>
<seg id="26">But earlier this week it emerged that Mrs Shoesmith will receive around £700,000 after winning a court ruled she had been unfairly dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yesterday it was revealed that taxpayers also paid £196,000 to fight her compensation claims.</seg>
<seg id="28">The legal fees were handed over to lawyers by Haringey Council as it tried to oppose her claims through tribunals and court hearings.</seg>
<seg id="29">It means the full price to the taxpayer of sacking Shoesmith over the death of Baby P and then paying her compensation for unfair dismissal has reached close to £1million.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Joni Mitchell generation: James Blake, Corinne Bailey Rae and others pay tribute</seg>
<seg id="2">Legions of musicians from the generations that have followed her, including Ellie Goulding and Corinne Bailey Rae, have cited her influence.</seg>
<seg id="3">Other young talents, such as Laura Marling, brought up by parents with a deep love of Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Neil Young, have drawn comparisons to the star - a benchmark of melody, lyricism and vocal prowess in folk-pop since the mid-Sixties.</seg>
<seg id="4">Joni Mitchell's lilting, melismatic vocals soar softly over piano or the gentle strumming of acoustic guitar.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her deft lyrical skill saw her intimately examine personal relationships on her most famous album, Blue (1971), in songs such as the evocative "The Last Time I Saw Richard"; she could achieve a rare complex shifting of emotions in a single song.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here we speak to some of those musicians who continue to take her inspiration into their own music, be it electro-pop, folk, jazz-inflected folk, or the soft, soulful vocals that merge with experimental glitchy electronica.</seg>
<seg id="7">Corinne Bailey Rae</seg>
<seg id="8">I was introduced to Blue by [the songwriter] Rod Bowett after he had heard a demo of my song "Like a Star."</seg>
<seg id="9">"You will love this," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Immediately I was enfolded into a world of subtle longings, of "travelling, travelling, travelling," of confessional intimacy and feminine energy.</seg>
<seg id="11">I was struck by the conversational melodies, the death-defying leaps into high registers which shook the soul and sounded like birds.</seg>
<seg id="12">I couldn't believe the titles of her songs, so evocative of memories, especially "The Last Time I Saw Richard."</seg>
<seg id="13">These titles felt like permission to write about anything and anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nothing was too romantic or too prosaic.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her songs have also defined particular places for me.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact Laurel Canyon, where I am currently living while recording my new album has, through "California," become a metaphor for shaking the dust off your feet and trying something new; for not being afraid to fail, and believing one can take flight.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rufus Wainwright</seg>
<seg id="18">Be it her music, her lyrics or her stunning personality ... the experience I had last June at Toronto's Luminato Festival of encountering all three of these elements together at the same time, live and in person, changed my life and the lives of everyone around me.</seg>
<seg id="19">She is a legend, and as with all legendary treasures - books, paintings, performers and so on - one is willingly transformed and brought to a better place when placed in their creative path.</seg>
<seg id="20">James Blake</seg>
<seg id="21">Until writing my first album I'd only listened to Blue, and after the album was made I progressed in a reverse chronology to Clouds and Song to a Seagull.</seg>
<seg id="22">As embarrassing as it is to admit how little of her discography I actually have, I like the idea that I'll enjoy Joni's work over my lifetime, as though slowly peeling back the drape to uncover the larger picture.</seg>
<seg id="23">Meeting her assured me that the process will never be dull.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a biting irony and we spent a lot of the evening laughing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Experiencing this side of her made me rethink some lyrics from Clouds and Blue.</seg>
<seg id="26">With her advice still fresh in my mind, on the plane home I wrote my second album, Overgrown.</seg>
<seg id="27">Joni's music always reminds me that melody is flexible, and that if you want to reinvent yourself as she continually has, you should command it to bend and ebb and flow, and treat it as king.</seg>
<seg id="28">She is a great remedy to melodic block.</seg>
<seg id="29">Katie Melua</seg>
<seg id="30">The first song by Joni Mitchell that I heard was "Marcie."</seg>
<seg id="31">I remember being struck by how she had used the colours, and how she was able to tell a story and convey so much in just a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As an artist, she is intoxicating.</seg>
<seg id="33">Lyrically, she is dynamite.</seg>
<seg id="34">I witnessed a friend going through a tumultuous love affair.</seg>
<seg id="35">He would listen to "A Case of You" (the orchestral version) and I saw how that song saved him.</seg>
<seg id="36">As a songwriter, that is something to aspire to - to be able to tell a story that might seem so personal to the writer yet can be shared by, and so deeply affect, the listener.</seg>
<seg id="37">Jonathan Wilson</seg>
<seg id="38">I'd say that what has consistently inspired me most about Joni is her relationship with jazz.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'm a massive jazz fan myself so it makes me so happy that despite the impending critical peril, she "went there."</seg>
<seg id="40">The records she made with Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Shorter are just stunning to me, such a forward-thinking musical twist and a satisfying musical development in her career.</seg>
<seg id="41">These may be my favourite of all of her albums.</seg>
<seg id="42">Where I obviously still love the chanteuse-with-acoustic-guitar, that side of Joni being perhaps the most instantly jaw-dropping, her voice mixed with Jaco's bass work, for example, is something I just love listening to.</seg>
<seg id="43">Her melodic and rhythmic prowess has always been essentially jazz to my ears, so adventurous and free.</seg>
<seg id="44">Marika Hackman</seg>
<seg id="45">I grew up with her music - my Mum was a massive fan so it will always have an effect on me.</seg>
<seg id="46">I don't know exactly what it is, but she'll always come through in my music and it's hard to ignore her incredible musicianship.</seg>
<seg id="47">She's been one of the leading female musicians of the past 50 years and she's still so fresh.</seg>
<seg id="48">She has a unique sound and in that way she is really brave, she's not afraid to push boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="49">That's something we are seeing more of now; musicians who aren't afraid of change.</seg>
<seg id="50">Her albums influence me in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="51">I love Ladies of the Canyon.</seg>
<seg id="52">It sounds really naive and fresh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I also love The Hissing of Summer Lawns because it's really jazzy - almost Latin-American - and so different.</seg>
<seg id="54">Obviously Blue is incredible: so raw and heartfelt, and that strikes me as something I'd love to convey through my own music.</seg>
<seg id="55">Gabrielle Aplin</seg>
<seg id="56">Along with Leonard Cohen, Joni is one of the first artists I really listened to and took inspiration from.</seg>
<seg id="57">What I love about her is that she takes all the things I love - poetry, art, music - and she combines them as a means of conveying her message.</seg>
<seg id="58">Her use of other media is really original and it's something that I aim to do myself.</seg>
<seg id="59">I think her diverse use of media is echoed in her lyrics, and what's important about her is that, rising to fame during the Sixties folk revival, she didn't simply focus her music on herself or on the boy she fancied - she made her music universally relevant, which makes it very real, timeless and inherently honest.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's something I try to put into my music.</seg>
<seg id="61">She is also very experimental; she puts her own stamp on her music, like in the organic sounds of Ladies of the Canyon.</seg>
<seg id="62">But I also think she is very careful with her music - it sounds incredibly thought out.</seg>
<seg id="63">For example, in "A Case of You," my favourite song of all time, she makes something incredibly beautiful out of something sad, just through the way she chooses to tune her guitar.</seg>
<seg id="64">I feel like she wants it to be perfect and it is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="65">Elizabeth McGovern</seg>
<seg id="66">It's no wonder Joni Mitchell found herself on "a lonely road, travelling, travelling, travelling."</seg>
<seg id="67">As a songwriter, she has always been in a league of her own.</seg>
<seg id="68">There is no one else.</seg>
<seg id="69">To say I reference her unconsciously in every song I write is to flatter myself dangerously.</seg>
<seg id="70">But she's in every pore of my being.</seg>
<seg id="71">Blue, Court and Spark, and Miles of Aisles, were only a few of the LPs I wore smooth from constant playing.</seg>
<seg id="72">To think of her again is to go back to a great era in music, when people looked to find words of interest in songs; words that meant something; that they had to think about.</seg>
<seg id="73">People now accept so much in their music that is, by comparison, either repetitive cliché, or totally meaningless claptrap.</seg>

<seg id="1">Showtime for Bond songs</seg>
<seg id="2">Art: Georgie Pinn.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since Shirley Bassey released Goldfinger almost 50 years ago, it has been tradition for a major artist to record the signature song for each new James Bond film.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, fans can recognise "Bond songs" from the opening bars alone - even the obscure ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They're quite distinct," says Simon Myers, producer of the live stage show The Songs of James Bond.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of them are epic, mysterious, with an element of sex.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have an orchestral background with a rising and falling bass and that guitar line at the start.</seg>
<seg id="8">And singers love them because the vocals are big and challenging and dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bassey, of course, is the quintessential Bond songstress, having recorded the themes for Goldfinger, Diamonds are Forever and Moonraker.</seg>
<seg id="10">Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die and Carly Simon's Nobody Does It Better were also major hits.</seg>
<seg id="11">Standing alone - stylistically at least - is Madonna's stuttering electro-dance number Die Another Day.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The less said about that, the better," Myers says.</seg>
<seg id="13">These songs can be quite divisive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some people say Adele's Skyfall is the greatest Bond song of all time; others don't like it at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">And there are those artists you might be surprised to learn have actually recorded Bond songs, like Sheena Easton and Lulu.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maria Mercedes: The glamour endures with Bond songs from the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="17">On November 8 and 9, Myers will present 23 of his favourites at Melbourne's Athenaeum Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has chosen four performers: veteran actor-singer Maria Mercedes; respected vocal coach and singer Susie Ahern; actor and former opera student Ben Mingay; and The Voice finalist Kiyomi Vella.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I've been wanting to do this for 20 years," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It started when I bought a CD of James Bond songs and I thought, wouldn't it be awesome to make a concert out of these?</seg>
<seg id="21">Some numbers will performed solo, others as duets, while Live and Let Die will feature all four singers.</seg>
<seg id="22">A 15-piece band will play on stage and visual artist Georgie Pinn will project images onto a giant screen.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's all original footage that I've shot; there are no scenes from the films," Pinn says.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fire, diamonds, silhouettes: the imagery she has chosen evokes the slick, glamorous feel of the Bond movies.</seg>
<seg id="25">"A lot of it is like the title sequences of the films," she says, "but instead of having the female characters just dancing around, we've given them a more active role."</seg>
<seg id="26">The look and sound of each Bond movie is just as important as the storyline.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I started watching some of the old ones again, to get into the mood," Mercedes says, "and my God, they were so over the top, they were ridiculous!</seg>
<seg id="28">But even if you forget the movies themselves, the songs and the glamour endure.</seg>
<seg id="29">When Mercedes began singing at 14, appearing on various television talent shows, Bassey was her role model.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I listened to her endlessly, singing Goldfinger and Diamonds are Forever," she says.</seg>
<seg id="31">The sophistication, the sexiness - I wanted to be Shirley Bassey.</seg>
<seg id="32">Myers won't reveal who will sing each song but it's a fair bet Mercedes will perform most of Bassey's big numbers.</seg>
<seg id="33">For her, the show's appeal extends beyond the songs.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's a chance for the audience to immerse themselves in mid-century glamour: a world of men in sharp suits and women in sequined dresses, stylish visual projections with a modern twist, and an orchestra taking pride of place on stage.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In this day and age, music often gets sacrificed," Mercedes says.</seg>
<seg id="36">A 15-piece-band is quite a luxury.</seg>
<seg id="37">I've got a black sequined outfit with a split up the side for the first act and a fabulous gold outfit for the second.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's not just a series of songs; it's a show.</seg>
<seg id="39">There's a real sexiness to the whole thing.</seg>

<seg id="5">Cloudy or sunny?</seg>
<seg id="6">Wall Street is sharply divided, and the social network's stock went on a roller coaster ride Wednesday after quarterly results came in much better than expected.</seg>
<seg id="7">Facebook shares jumped 15 percent after the company reported a 60 percent increase in third-quarter sales versus a loss a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the share price tumbled later after remarks during an earnings call with analysts by Facebook's Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman.</seg>
<seg id="9">He disclosed that the site is no longer the cool hangout spot for some kids.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We did see a decrease in daily users" among younger teens, he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many teenagers have been moving away from Facebook to Instagram, Pinterest and other newer social sites.</seg>
<seg id="12">But overall, Facebook is still adding users and has growing revenue from mobile advertising.</seg>
<seg id="13">The company says monthly active users grew to 1.19 billion, from 1.16 billion three months earlier.</seg>
<seg id="14">The stock market retreated from record highs after the Federal Reserve's statement revealed no change in money policy.</seg>
<seg id="15">The central bank plans to maintain its $85 billion a month bond buying program.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Fed's economic outlook was a little better than some expected.</seg>
<seg id="17">The statement spoke of "growing underlying strength in the broader economy," that may have led to investor caution.</seg>
<seg id="18">The bond buying stimulus is seen as a major factor in this year's strong performance for stocks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Dow fell more than 61 points yesterday and the S&P dropped nearly 9 points.</seg>
<seg id="20">Stock futures this morning fell.</seg>
<seg id="21">This could be good news for the economy.</seg>

<seg id="2">A wave of kidnappings and other violent crimes in Mozambique has alarmed its citizens, some of whom demonstrated against what they charge is negligence by authorities who are struggling to restore security.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thousands marched in the Mozambican capital, Maputo, on Thursday, urging the government to do more to stop crime and even accusing rogue police officers of involvement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Police have not commented on the criticism, though one member of the ruling party said Mozambique is democratic and people are free to say what they think.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unease comes amid increased political tension and sporadic violence ahead of municipal elections on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="6">20 in a country that has drawn increased foreign investment because of its energy reserves and other natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="7">The opposition Renamo group and the governing Frelimo party are locked in a dispute despite talks aimed at resolving their differences.</seg>
<seg id="8">The two sides fought a civil war after independence from Portugal in 1975; a peace deal was signed in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="9">The anti-kidnapping demonstration in Maputo followed the recent kidnapping and killing of a 13-year-old boy whose body was later found in the central port city of Beira.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some of the boy's body parts had been removed, allegedly for witchcraft rituals, which have been on the increase in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The nation's parliament has condemned the kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="12">In many cases, kidnappers have targeted businessmen and their families and demanded ransoms.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some victims are of Pakistani origin, and own supermarkets, car parks and money exchange operations.</seg>
<seg id="14">During the protest, people carried placards that read "Deaf government" and "We demand security."</seg>
<seg id="15">Among the speakers was Alice Mabota, a human rights activist who charged that some police were collaborating with kidnappers and that penalties for their crimes were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this week, nine people, including two police officers, were sentenced to 18 years in jail for involvement in kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Another group of kidnappers will soon face sentencing in a Maputo court.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="3">No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="6">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gender" on their official documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.</seg>
<seg id="25">German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="33">And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">He was given female hormones at age 12.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found out was horrifying.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.</seg>
<seg id="58">Surgery rendered him infertile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigma."</seg>
<seg id="61">"A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'" she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid it will encourage intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law is about assigning it at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'</seg>
<seg id="78">This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.</seg>
<seg id="80">We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.</seg>
<seg id="83">It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.</seg>

<seg id="2">MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian government and security services will overcome security threats and can guarantee safety at the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said.</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Reuters, Medvedev said Russia had taken a number of safety measures around the city, which borders the volatile North Caucasus region where Islamist insurgents wage nearly daily violence.</seg>
<seg id="4">"A number of threats exist in our country, so everyone is working as hard as possible - the special forces are working, and the government as a whole is trying to guarantee the absolute safety of the Olympic Games," he said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">And I believe that's what will happen.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it's clear that we should take a number of other decisions to make sure that these Games are held without a hitch, so that they will be remembered as a spectacular sporting event.</seg>
<seg id="7">He did not specify what those measures were.</seg>
<seg id="8">Spending on the February Games is expected to pass $50 billion, and they are a priority for President Vladimir Putin who wants to use it to showcase the country's modern face to the world two decades after the fall of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thomas Bach, the head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), visited Sochi to inspect preparations this week and praised the work and said he was sure the Games would be "magnificent."</seg>
<seg id="10">Security services have installed video cameras around the city and plan to use drones at the Games to keep watch over the sprawling venues that reach from the Black Sea coast, where skating events will be held, to the Caucasus Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="11">Russian police are also planned to be stationed along the perimeter between Sochi and the mountainous North Caucasus, where insurgents are fighting to establish an Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="12">The insurgency, rooted in two separatist wars in Russia's province of Chechnya, has spread through the North Caucasus, and Dagestan, some 600 kilometers away from Sochi, has become the focal point of violence.</seg>
<seg id="13">A deadly suicide bombing in southern Russia on October21, blamed on a Muslim woman from the North Caucasus, highlighted increased the security risks Sochi faces.</seg>
<seg id="14">Medvedev said that the initial idea of holding the Olympics in the sub-tropical city of Sochi, had struck him as "extravagant," but that he was convinced the Games would be a success.</seg>
<seg id="15">The city of Sochi is located in the subtropics, and it's hosting the Winter Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="16">That in and of itself is quite interesting.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I won't hide the fact that when the idea was conceived, even to me it seemed rather extravagant," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it happened that they chose Sochi, and I am sure that they will be a very interesting Games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears</seg>
<seg id="2">Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had "never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation," the Commission was told.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.</seg>
<seg id="6">He conceded the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management "from myself down" failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.</seg>
<seg id="12">Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.</seg>
<seg id="19">YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">The hearing adjourned until December 20.</seg>

<seg id="1">Autumn internationals: 'This is a defining year for us'</seg>
<seg id="2">Stuart Lancaster may have done a brilliant job in taking the drama out of England's rugby crisis following the pratfall at the last World Cup, but the red-rose coach is planning some big productions over the next three weekends of international action at Twickenham.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This is a defining year for us," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">We can't make the mistake of waiting a game or two before getting up to speed.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's our job to be ready for the here and now.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lancaster does not often talk in such terms - very much the cool and analytical technocrat, he prefers not to create hostages to fortune in advance of Test programmes featuring opponents as dangerous as the All Blacks - but he clearly feels that if England are to mount a serious challenge at the home World Cup in 2015, this autumn series is a "momentum moment."</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting with Australia is therefore a must-win match.</seg>
<seg id="8">The changes to the starting line-up were well flagged: Joel Tomkins, the one debutant, has been the odds-on favourite to replace the injured Manu Tuilagi at outside centre for weeks; Lee Dickson's form at scrum-half for the Premiership title challengers Northampton propelled him into Lancaster's thinking as long ago as mid-September; the Vunipola brothers, Mako and Billy, were selections of the "no-brainer" variety once the Lions loose-head prop Alex Corbisiero broke down with knee problems; and the Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan fell victim to his club's collapsing standards up front.</seg>
<seg id="9">It did, however, come as some surprise to learn that the young Wasps lock Joe Launchbury and the high-performing Northampton second-rower Courtney Lawes would have been paired together in the engine room even if Geoff Parling, the Lions line-out specialist, had not been forced out of the Wallaby game with concussion.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neither Launchbury nor Lawes is a middle jumper or, for that matter, what might be called a genuinely "tight" forward.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the face of it, the partnership seems dangerously unbalanced.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over the coming months, the 6ft 7in, middle-jumping Bath forward Dave Attwood should emerge as the solution to the boilerhouse conundrum.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Saturday, he must make do with a place among the replacements.</seg>
<seg id="14">The development of an Attwood-Lawes combination was a priority for Lancaster's predecessor Martin Johnson before the 2011 global gathering in New Zealand - and Johnson knew more than the most about the realities of the position.</seg>
<seg id="15">Things did not work out, for one reason or another, but the project is likely to be relaunched sooner rather than later.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Dave will certainly add some ballast to the bench and, while he hasn't quite had the game time to force a place in the starting line-up [Attwood picked up a rib injury late last month], this is a big chance for him," Lancaster said.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the start of the game, Courtney will jump in the middle while Joe will scrummage behind Dan Cole at tight-head prop.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yes, you want balance in your second row, but I think it's doing Joe a disservice to suggest that he can't play a tight game.</seg>
<seg id="19">We've been impressed by his physicality, his mauling and his defensive work this season.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dave Attwood must make do with a place on the bench - for now (Getty) This is a young England side: the average age of the starting line-up is 24, with Dickson the eldest at 28.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is, dare we say it, almost Australian in its make-up.</seg>
<seg id="22">Yet while Lancaster subscribes to the view that experience is among the most crucial elements in the make-up of World Cup-winning sides, he is not in the least spooked by the shortage of miles on his team's clock.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I'm not pursuing some misguided youth policy, trying to give every 21-year-old a game for the sake of it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people in this team deserve their status.</seg>
<seg id="25">It reflects the quality of the people coming through the programmes we've put in place.</seg>
<seg id="26">They will have to grow up quickly if they are to deal effectively with Wallaby backs as hot as the scrum-half Will Genia, the outside-half Quade Cooper and the jaw-dropping full-back Israel Folau, the multi-sport genius who set his union career in motion to such stunning effect during the Lions series last summer.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Special players create special plays," Lancaster acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="28">We know Genia is lethal around the edges, that there is real variety to Cooper's passing game, that Folau's aerial game is outstanding.</seg>
<seg id="29">No defensive system is infallible, especially against opponents of that quality, so what we have to do is make sure that the principles of our system are rock solid, that our attitude and intensity are right - and then make good decisions.</seg>
<seg id="30">Maybe James Bond - aka Sir Roger Moore - might help.</seg>
<seg id="31">A man with the defence of the nation in his hands, he was staying in the team hotel.</seg>
<seg id="32">"He must be good," Lancaster said of the famous spy.</seg>
<seg id="33">I didn't know he was here.</seg>

<seg id="2">ANOTHER general fled to Turkey from neighbouring Syria and joined the swelling ranks of rebel soldiers based close to the border, the Anatolia news agency reported today.</seg>
<seg id="3">The defection brought to 13 the number of generals seeking refuge in Turkey since the revolt against Syrian President Bashar al Assad's regime erupted 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition to the general, two colonels and some 30 soldiers flanked by their families crossed into Turkey late on Sunday, Anatolia said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The refugee camps in the southeastern provinces of Hatay, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Kilis shelter more than 33,000 Syrians, a number that surged after a recent escalation of violence in Syria, particularly in northwestern towns near the Turkish border.</seg>
<seg id="6">Monitoring groups say some 15,000 people have been killed in the uprising against the Assad regime, as UN officials say they fear a full-blown civil war in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
<seg id="9">She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.</seg>
<seg id="11">An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- The British graffiti artist known only as Banksy says he has unveiled his last work after a month-long residency in New York City.</seg>
<seg id="3">CNN said the work -- a collection of balloons that said "BANKSY!" -- were tied to the side of a warehouse near the Long Island Expressway in Queens Thursday, but was quickly taken down.</seg>

<seg id="1">UK Supreme Court should have final say on human rights cases, not Strasbourg, says Chris Grayling</seg>
<seg id="2">Last month Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said that wants to send a "very clear message" to judges who are ignoring Parliament and allowing foreign criminals to stay in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The government is introducing legislation which will mean that criminals are deported first and that their appeals are then heard abroad to end the "never-ending game of snakes and ladders" under the current immigration system.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the Conservatives are concerned that foreign criminals will remain in Britain unless European human rights laws are overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Home Secretary told the Conservative Party conference that the party's manifesto for the 2015 election will pledge to scrap the Human Rights Act.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tories are considering replacing it with a British bill of rights as part of their renegotiations with Brussels ahead of a referendum on Europe in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 2011-12 almost 177 foreign offenders who successfully appealed against deportation used the human rights act as the basis for their claim.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their claims were equivalent to 40 per cent of all successful appeals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under current legislation, all offenders from outside the European Union jailed for more than 12 months are referred for automatic deportation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Offenders from the European Union can be deported if they are sentenced to two year jail sentences unless they have committed drugs offences or sexual crimes, in which case they can be deported if they are jailed for one year.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, despite the arrest of tens of thousands of foreign criminals in London alone last year just 4,765 offenders were successfully deported from Britain.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Grayling said that the government also wants to ensure that foreign offenders serve jail sentences for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ministers are concerned that if they are deported before serving their sentences they will escape punishment.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said: "It is not easy, particularly when people are in jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm afraid I don't believe that somebody who has committed an unpleasant crime should simply be released and not have to serve a punishment.</seg>
<seg id="16">Very often these people come from countries where the prison system is overcrowded and budgets are stretched.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Metropolitan Police is so concerned by the issue that it has set up Operation Nexus to improve the police response to the problem, which has a 100-strong task force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Under the scheme, which launched in November last year, a total of 1,000 criminals including serial rapists, gang members and other serious offenders have been deported.</seg>
<seg id="19">Among those being targeted are 40 "predatory rapists" who have committed sex crimes abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their criminal history only came to light after they were arrested in Britain for minor offences.</seg>
<seg id="21">Under the scheme Lincoln Farquharson, a suspected serial rapist, was deported from Britain earlier this year after files detailing five arrests for rape were presented to an immigration tribunal.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tribunal heard that Farquharson, 46, from Jamaica, was arrested five times between March 2006 and April 2011 for alleged offences including violent assault and multiple rapes.</seg>
<seg id="23">He was tried three times but on each occasion the jury failed to reach verdicts.</seg>
<seg id="24">He appealed against deportation on grounds of his right to private and family life, but the tribunal found there was strong evidence he was violent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Under the Operation Nexus for the first time people arrested in London are having their fingerprints checked against border force records.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where possible, checks are also taking place to see if a suspect has a criminal history in their homeland.</seg>

<seg id="2">As the Kangaroos prepared to fly out for the World Cup in the UK, coach Tim Sheen has warned his troops not to get complacent about their winning chances.</seg>
<seg id="3">LUKE Douglas is not your regular World Cup ring-in.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, Douglas's Scotland eligibility is not as clear-cut as some of his Braveheart teammates competing in the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Gold Coast Titans prop, one of 26 players from Queensland NRL clubs playing in the tournament in Britain, was born in Yamba, to Australian parents, and has yet to pull on the navy blue of his grandfather's homeland.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it's an honour Douglas is grabbing with both hands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Douglas is one of seven Titans selected by five different World Cup teams.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gold Coast prop Luke Douglas will play for Scotland in the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Cowboys have the third biggest contingent of players among NRL clubs, with 13 turning out for nine separate national sides.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Roosters, with 16, will be the team most affected in their off-season training by Cup commitments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brisbane have six at the tournament, including Benjamin Garcia, a Frenchman who was a member of the Broncos' under-20s this year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brisbane recruit Daniel Vidot, the former Dragons utility, will have a break at the end of his commitments for Samoa before he starts training for the 2014 season.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brisbane-bound Daniel Vidot will play for Samoa.</seg>
<seg id="14">Douglas said he had long known he was eligible for Scotland and had called off a 2008 World Cup campaign due to injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is determined to learn more about where his grandfather Archibald Douglas hailed from and what brought him to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a bit of a war on when he was younger and he had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="17">"He moved to Moree and worked out there on farms before moving to Sydney," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">All the history and everything interests me.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hopefully we can do a trip up to Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Kangaroos finalise their Rugby League World Cup preparations with a gruelling final training session at Kogarah as they search for World Cup redemption.</seg>
<seg id="21">Douglas left the Gold Coast on Wednesday for Manchester, where Scotland will base their preparations.</seg>
<seg id="22">His father, Chris, is also making the trip, while brother Kane will be in Europe on the Wallabies" tour.</seg>
<seg id="23">Douglas's youngest brother, Jake, is living in England, playing rugby union, meaning it will be family affair in the northern hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id="24">But there'll be one notable absence.</seg>
<seg id="25">Douglas's mother, Trish, passed away earlier this year from melanoma.</seg>
<seg id="26">Her illness was discovered in November last year when she and Chris flew to England to watch Kane play.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I'm hoping to have a bit better trip than this time last year," said Douglas, who made an emergency trip to London to be by her side.</seg>
<seg id="28">I've convinced dad to go when we realised all three of us were going to be over there.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hopefully we can get some better memories.</seg>

<seg id="1">Where do Apples go to rot?</seg>
<seg id="2">Apple is set to begin selling its latest iPad Air and iPad Mini, prompting millions of folks to dump their old tablets -- along with countless iPods and iTouches.</seg>
<seg id="3">But where do all of those old gizmos go?</seg>
<seg id="4">Consumers today have a multitude of options for getting rid of their outdated technology, from Amazon to Apple to Walmart and more, and most mean you'll end up ahead, with more than a few bucks in your pocket.</seg>
<seg id="5">Not so long ago, if you wanted to sell an old iPad you were most likely looking at eBay.</seg>
<seg id="6">So what happens to all of these iPads and iPhones once they've been bought up by trade-in programs?</seg>
<seg id="7">Devices that can't be revived or that are damaged are mined for their parts and then recycled.</seg>
<seg id="8">But gear in working and retrievable condition is sold to a wholesaler and refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="9">And typically, those products end up overseas, explained Anthony Scarsella, chief gadget officer at Gazelle, a company that buys used technology and resells them to wholesalers.</seg>
<seg id="10">'The demand is global - we have buyers in Latin America, Hong Kong, Africa, it's pretty much every continent.'</seg>
<seg id="11">Anthony Scarsella, chief gadget officer at Gazelle</seg>
<seg id="12">The demand is very global - we have buyers in Latin America, Hong Kong, Africa, it's pretty much every continent.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The majority of our wholesalers are overseas," Scarsella told FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="14">To buy these products new in some third world countries is extremely expensive, with prices that are much higher than in the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="15">This thriving second economy for "bruised Apples" -- once repaired, of course -- is driven by the healthy demand for all things iPad.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Right now there's an insatiable demand in secondary markets for older and unwanted devices, and that really applies towards Apple products like the iPhone and iPad," Scarsella said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Gazelle doesn't have more specific, country by country data, however.</seg>
<seg id="18">Adds Nik Raman, founder of Usell.com, a marketplace that connects consumers directly with wholesalers who want to buy used technology, "Apple devices retain value the most."</seg>
<seg id="19">We see them depreciate by about 5 percent per month, whereas Android devices depreciate by about 10 percent per month.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not even iDevices retain their value indefinitely, though.</seg>
<seg id="21">The older your device, the less you can expect to get for it.</seg>
<seg id="22">Usell's Raman cautions that in general, if a device is more than three years old, you may not be able to sell it.</seg>
<seg id="23">But a three-year old first-generation iPad?</seg>
<seg id="24">BestBuy.com will give you $95 for a "good" condition 16GB model.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sooner you sell, the more money you can get.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gazelle's data shows a spike in consumers selling devices on the days Apple has its launch event to announce a new product.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The iPad 2 and 3 are now the iPads that are being sold the most," Scarsella said.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it's not just ancient iPads that are getting ditched: Gazelle's data shows 66 percent of iPad trades made on 10/22 -- the day the iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina Display announced -- were for iPads that Apple debuted in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="29">Apple's own trade-in program is part of its Reuse & Recycling program, which is run in partnership with PowerOn Services.</seg>
<seg id="30">While Apple declined to comment for this story, its recycling FAQ says that the company "often" can retrieve up to 90 percent of the original device's weight, recovering and reprocessing glass, metal, and plastics.</seg>
<seg id="31">While consumers can't access a tablet's battery, for recycling and reclamation purposes it's easy for batteries to be removed and safely disposed of in accordance with local e-waste laws.</seg>
<seg id="32">For those interested in ditching an aging device, trade-in programs are all the rage among big-box retailers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, GameStop, Office Depot, Radio Shack, and Walmart all have trade-in programs, and those options are in addition to services like Gazelle, NextWorth, and Usell.com.</seg>
<seg id="34">Typically, the amount you'll get depends upon the condition of your device.</seg>
<seg id="35">Do your research before accepting a trade-in deal, though, since the terms and value you'll get will vary wildly from store to store and from service to service.</seg>
<seg id="36">Some companies are more forgiving of scratches and scuffs, some refuse to accept non-working devices and others will accept both.</seg>
<seg id="37">For example, whereas Gazelle accepts a broken device, Best Buy will not.</seg>
<seg id="38">But a Best Buy spokeswoman noted that the company will reclaim parts from devices it accepts, and if a device can't be refurbished and sold, or sold via a secondary market channel, Best Buy will then recycle the device.</seg>

<seg id="1">ALP stands by its climate view</seg>
<seg id="2">Not a rubber stamp: Opposition climate change spokesman Mark Butler and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten outline the ALP's position on the carbon tax repeal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Alex Ellinghausen</seg>
<seg id="4">Australian businesses and households face months of uncertainty over energy pricing after the federal opposition resolved on Friday to stick with the unpopular carbon tax unless the government adopts its policy of an emissions trading scheme.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a move that guarantees Labor and the Greens will be able to frustrate the government's policy to scrap the carbon tax until the new Senate sits in the second half of next year, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has announced Labor wants to dump the tax but will agree to its repeal only if the government ditches its Direct Action policy in favour of Labor's ETS.</seg>
<seg id="6">"If our amendments are not successful, we will oppose the government's repeal legislation in line with our long-held principle position to act on climate change," Mr Shorten said in Canberra, fresh from his first dedicated shadow cabinet meeting since becoming Labor leader.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision locks the ALP into a potentially debilitating nine-month stand-off with the government, and could prompt Prime Minister Tony Abbott to seek a double-dissolution election - although that is unlikely given Coalition hopes of a more compliant Senate after July.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will also put Labor at odds with ordinary voters who just two months ago voted decisively in favour of the Coalition in an election dominated by the carbon price, and its perceived effect on household electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Shorten said Labor was sticking to the policy it took to the election and predicted the Senate would go through its review processes and probably send the government's repeal bills to an inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Labor will never be a rubber stamp for Tony Abbott," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We accept the science of climate change.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tony Abbott doesn't ... We won't be bullied and I won't be bullied by Tony Abbott merely because he doesn't accept the science of climate change.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some in Labor believe the party should find a way of allowing the fixed carbon price to die a quick death due to its toxic effect on Australian politics.</seg>
<seg id="14">They say Labor must ensure it is not "boxed in" to another election fight on the same ground it was defeated on last time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But others argue the party risks standing for nothing if it walks away from emissions trading as an automatic consequence of dumping the fixed-price period.</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders say they want the matter resolved after years of political warfare and policy confusion that has led to investment uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="17">Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott called on Labor to "respect the outcome of the election and not get in the way of what is a clear and fundamental Coalition government policy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The last thing business and the economy needs is for actions by the Parliament to lead to one of the world's highest carbon prices remaining in place for an extended and uncertain period," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Labor's decision to protect the carbon tax came despite well-placed sources close to Mr Shorten suggesting the Labor leader was looking for ways to get the tax off the agenda.</seg>

<seg id="2">Journalist Michael Hastings has died in a car accident in Los Angeles at the age of 33.</seg>
<seg id="3">AWARD-winning journalist and war correspondent Michael Hastings died early Tuesday in a car accident in Los Angeles, his employer and family said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hastings, who was 33, was described by many of his colleagues as an unfailingly bright and hard-charging reporter who wrote stories that mattered.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most recently, he wrote about politics for the news website BuzzFeed, where the top editor said colleagues were devastated by the loss.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Michael was a great, fearless journalist with an incredible instinct for the story, and a gift for finding ways to make his readers care about anything he covered from wars to politicians," said Ben Smith, BuzzFeed's editor-in-chief.</seg>
<seg id="7">Smith said he learned of the death from a family member.</seg>
<seg id="8">Authorities said there was a car crash early Tuesday in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles that killed a man, but coroner's officials could not confirm whether Hastings was the victim.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hastings won a 2010 George Polk Award for magazine reporting for his Rolling Stone cover story, The Runaway General.</seg>
<seg id="10">His story was credited with ending Gen. Stanley McChrystal's career after it revealed the military's candid criticisms of the Obama administration.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hastings quoted McChrystal and his aides mocking Obama administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden, over their war policies.</seg>
<seg id="12">At a Pentagon ceremony for his subsequent retirement in 2010, McChrystal made light of the episode in his farewell address.</seg>
<seg id="13">The four-star general warned his comrades in arms, "I have stories on all of you, photos of many, and I know a Rolling Stone reporter."</seg>
<seg id="14">When he died, Hastings was also a contributing editor at Rolling Stone, where Managing Editor Will Dana was quoted Tuesday saying Hastings exuded "a certain kind of electricity" that exists in great reporters whose stories burn to be told.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm sad that I'll never get to publish all the great stories that he was going to write, and sad that he won't be stopping by my office for any more short visits which would stretch for two or three completely engrossing hours," Dana said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hastings was also an author of books about the wars.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America's War in Afghanistan was published late last year and details shocking exploits of the military overseas.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2010, with the publication of I Lost My Love in Baghdad, Hastings told the story of being a young war correspondent whose girlfriend died in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the summer 2013 issue of Vermont Life magazine, Hastings was quoted telling an audience at the Burlington Book Festival that he doesn't believe in objectivity in journalism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"What I try to do is be intellectually honest in my writing," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hastings' family moved to Vermont when he was 16, a state he told the magazine was his "spiritual home."</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the magazine, he lived in New York with his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1">New politics has begun following the changes in the boards of the Municipal Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Recently, in the Santhiya Municipal Corporation's Beerbhum District, due to the party change of legislators the Congress led board changed to the Trunamool board.</seg>
<seg id="3">This change occurred because most of the legislators, including the Chairman of the Municipal Corporation, joined Trunamool.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not only from Congress, but some of the legislators from CPM, CPI, and Forward Block have also joined Trunamool.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy admits it augurs well for the party.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that the Santhiya Municipal Corporation Chairman, Virendra Parikh, and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, along with 10 Congress legislators, have joined Trunamool.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some legislators from CPM and Left Front have also joined Trunamool.</seg>
<seg id="8">All of them informed the District Collector in writing, as required by the Bengal Municipal Act, that they have joined Trunamool and because of its majority the Santhiya Municipal Corporation board will come under Trunamool Control.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Rai also claimed that everyone agrees with the development template decided upon under the leadership of the Chief Minister, Mamta Banerjee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Political leaders from Congress, the CPM, the CPI, Forward Bloc and other political leaders are moving to join the Trinamool Congress.</seg>
<seg id="11">Appropriate leaders from any party are welcome to join Trunamool.</seg>
<seg id="12">The control by Trunamool of the Santhilya Municipal Board due to the change of the party by congress legislators before the November 22nd elections to be held in 5 Municipal Corporations is considered as an important development in the political arena.</seg>
<seg id="13">Before this the Left Front-ruled Haldia and Congress-ruled Nadia Municipal boards had also come under the control of Trunamool.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the Municipal boards in the district come under Trunamool party control, due to the change of party, then the new members of the party are made very welcome in Kolkata at the Trunamool Bhavan.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy is excited about the leaders breaking away from other parties to join the Trinamool party.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said that leaders breaking away from any party were welcome to join Trunamool.</seg>
<seg id="17">He claims that the people's trust in Chief Minister Mamata Banarjee's leadership is increasing, and that this is the reason people are joining Trunamool.</seg>
<seg id="18">The main opposition CPM is claiming that grassroots leaders of the other parties are being threatened and bullied.</seg>
<seg id="19">People are joining them due to the fear of Trunamool's threats.</seg>
<seg id="20">The change in the elected local boards is being considered as a blow to democracy by CPM.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a right of any party to increase their support base in a democracy but, there are obvious questions  raised by changes of opinion on the accountability of power.</seg>

<seg id="1">How the Rob Ford implosion threatens Toronto's success</seg>
<seg id="2">The Rob Ford scandal is not just a sad story about a troubled man.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is more than a titillating diversion or an attention-grabbing headline.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its effects go beyond causing acute embarrassment for Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="5">It poses a threat to the success of Canada's biggest city.</seg>
<seg id="6">Toronto stands at a turning point in its 180-year history.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is growing as never before, taking in hundreds of thousands of people from every corner of the globe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its downtown is becoming a little Manhattan, sprouting scores of new office and residential towers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its cultural scene is a marvel, drawing crowds to its film, art and music festivals.</seg>
<seg id="10">But its governance is a mess.</seg>
<seg id="11">City council was ineffectual long before Mr. Ford came along with his promise to "stop the gravy train."</seg>
<seg id="12">He rode to office on a vow to bring a new rigour to city government, with better service for residents and more respect for taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="13">At first, he made some progress, killing an unpopular tax, trimming the budget and contracting out some services.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now his mayoralty is imploding.</seg>
<seg id="15">No less that the chief of police has confirmed that authorities have a copy of a video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="16">So much for his assertion that such a video does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">His credibility has been demolished.</seg>
<seg id="18">He can no longer claim he is the innocent victim of a conspiracy by "lefties" and media "maggots" to sully his name.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the video were not enough, the police have compiled a staggering trove of information showing the mayor consorting with a cast of shady characters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among them is Alessandro Lisi, a man who stands accused of drug offences and, now, extortion.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is hard to see how Mr. Ford can explain his way out of this even if he tried.</seg>
<seg id="22">How does he explain the suspicious packages Mr. Lisi left for him in his car?</seg>
<seg id="23">Thursday's disclosures rip the veil from a shadow life that the mayor appears to have been living - a life not remotely consistent with his role as the city's chief magistrate.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was elected to be a leader, someone to set an example for the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">Instead, he has become an example of how not to act.</seg>
<seg id="26">The irony is that the man who vowed to bring discipline to city hall has been undone by his lack of self-control.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even though the mayor does not face criminal charges - and the allegations against him have not been proven in court - there is a stain on his office that cannot be removed except by his speedy departure.</seg>
<seg id="28">If, a few months ago, he had admitted there was some substance to the mounting allegations about his behaviour, it would have been one thing.</seg>
<seg id="29">If he had said he had a problem and was seeking help, the city might have been forgiving.</seg>
<seg id="30">Instead, he has steadfastly refused to comment, lashing out at his critics at every opportunity and accusing them of drawing attention away from his accomplishments.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it is he who has become the distraction.</seg>
<seg id="32">The city deserves better.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chief Bill Blair spoke for many when he said that, as a citizen, he was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="34">He called it a "traumatic issue" for Torontonians and "the reputation of this city, and that concerns me."</seg>
<seg id="35">But the Ford scandal goes beyond the threat to Toronto's good name.</seg>
<seg id="36">It comes at a time when it desperately needs confident, intelligent leadership.</seg>
<seg id="37">If it drags on, the city could find itself tied in knots at a time when it is struggling with serious problems that could stall its recent progress - problems that range from the crumbling Gardiner Expressway downtown to an under-built, run-down transit system to a public housing system that needs hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs.</seg>
<seg id="38">The city has already been damaged by Mr. Ford's inept leadership on the transit file, causing years of delays and millions in waste as the city flipped and flopped from one transit plan to another.</seg>
<seg id="39">Imagine if he hangs on for the remaining year to the next election.</seg>
<seg id="40">The noise over this shabby business, raised to an almighty din with Thursday's revelations, will drown out everything he tries to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">His mayoralty, already adrift, has been crippled beyond recovery.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is time for him to go.</seg>
<seg id="43">After all the evasions, all the nonsense, all the denials, this should be the end of the road for Mr. Ford.</seg>
<seg id="44">For his own sake and the sake of the city, he should resign as soon as possible and let Toronto get on with building its future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama's Health Care Walk Back</seg>
<seg id="2">Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."</seg>
<seg id="3">With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">Addressing what he called the "flurry in the news" about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You're going to get a better deal," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone "miserably" since October.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am eager to earn your confidence back.</seg>
<seg id="14">An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Complacent a Victoria Derby standout: Boss</seg>
<seg id="2">Glen Boss has all but conceded the Victoria Derby to Sydney colt Complacent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Boss rides maiden galloper Bring Something in Saturday's Group One staying test for three-year-olds and rates his mount a top five chance.</seg>
<seg id="4">But he is sure the Peter Snowden-trained Complacent, winner of the Spring Champion Stakes at Randwick, is the horse to beat.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If I was riding Complacent tomorrow, I'd be very confident I just win the race," Boss said.</seg>
<seg id="6">I'd be sleeping pretty comfortably if I was Kerrin McEvoy tonight, thinking that I could win the Derby.</seg>
<seg id="7">Complacent lost favouritism for the Derby (2500m) at Flemington when he drew barrier 16 on Wednesday but retains the faith of his stable and the respect of his rivals.</seg>
<seg id="8">Spring Champion placegetter and last week's Group Two Vase winner Savvy Nature heads TAB's market at $4.80 while Polanski has been the big firmer from $8.50 to $5.50 equal second favourite with Complacent since drawing barrier one on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Boss took plenty of notice of Complacent's Spring Champion Stakes win and was suitably impressed.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The trip looks like it will be the least of his worries and I reckon he'll love Flemington," Boss said.</seg>
<seg id="11">He's well found in the market but he should be because he just looks like the winner to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">Boss, a Victoria Derby winner on Hit The Roof in 2000, has a good opinion of Bring Something but says the Derby might be coming too soon for the Ken Keys-trained gelding who the jockey described as "a work in progress."</seg>
<seg id="13">Bring Something was fourth in the Bill Stutt Stakes and fifth in the Norman Robinson.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I'm expecting my horse to run well and I think in the autumn when he furnishes you'll see a better horse," Boss said.</seg>
<seg id="15">I can't see him winning tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="16">I hope he does, but I can't see it.</seg>
<seg id="17">""I've got him in the top five, but outside the top three.""</seg>
<seg id="18">Complacent is the leading chance of Darley's three runners but Norman Robinson Stakes runner-up San Diego and Geelong Classic runner-up Tupac Amaru are also in contention.</seg>
<seg id="19">""Complacent is a high-quality colt, a striking individual and we've had him pegged as the horse with the most ability of the three," Darley's Jason Walsh said."</seg>
<seg id="20">""But they are all there deserving of their chance.</seg>
<seg id="21">We've got plenty of darts there with different racing styles and that gives us a good chance hopefully tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hugh Bowman is hoping for his third Victoria Derby win in four years when he rides Polanski, who he partnered to win the Norman Robinson Stakes last start.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I was lucky to get on him but I might have just got on him at the right time," Bowman said.</seg>

<seg id="2">I watched Gravity with Britain's starriest scientific couple, Brian Cox, who advised Danny Boyle on his sci-fi epic Sunshine, and Gia Milinovich, a seasoned television and new media expert.</seg>
<seg id="3">It must be said that, yes, there are scientific holes in Gravity big enough to fly a Saturn V rocket through.</seg>
<seg id="4">One example: an astronaut in a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU, essentially a rocket pack) would not burn his fuel with the gay abandon shown by George Clooney.</seg>
<seg id="5">But from the opening scenes in the silent abyss beyond the Earth's atmosphere, Gravity provided 90 minutes of unremitting suspense that never lost its momentum.</seg>
<seg id="6">We left the cinema enthralled by the spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="7">An astronaut tethered to the damaged space station in Gravity (Warner Bros)</seg>
<seg id="8">Two features made the non-stop thrills of Gravity soar in scientific terms.</seg>
<seg id="9">First, it popularised a scenario that is every space engineer's worst nightmare, known as the Kessler syndrome after Donald Kessler, formerly at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston.</seg>
<seg id="10">Back in 1978, Kessler and a colleague proposed that as the number of satellites rose, so would the risk of accidental collisions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Such disasters would spawn clouds of junk, sparking a chain reaction that would swiftly ring the Earth with debris from the thousands of satellites that once monitored our climate, helped us communicate, navigate and more.</seg>
<seg id="12">The precipitating event in Gravity is not an accident but a Russian missile strike on an obsolete satellite (described, but not shown in the movie) and, in the aftermath of the resulting chain reaction, the film-makers put a lot of effort into the small details of the Space Shuttle, Hubble Space Telescope, and International Space Station thanks to the vast amounts of Nasa photography and technical data that is in the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even though it was not perfect, the way the film portrays life in orbit is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many people mistakenly think that gravity does not exist in space.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, the typical orbits for human space flight vary between 120 and 360 miles above Earth's surface, where the G is anything but zero.</seg>
<seg id="16">If an astronaut on the space station drops an apple it falls just like on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it doesn't look like it's falling because the apple, the astronaut and the space station are falling together - not towards Earth but around it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Objects inside the station float because they're all falling at the same rate.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sandra Bullock and George Clooney starring in Gravity (Warner Bros)</seg>
<seg id="20">One day, no doubt, movies will be shot in the microgravity of space but until then the closest you can get is the gravity-defying parabolas of the "vomit comet," when a plane climbs and then plummets, causing a few moments of weightlessness.</seg>
<seg id="21">Given Cuarón's preference for long, elastic shots, Clooney and Bullock would have been left green and reeling if he'd used this approach.</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead he achieved a passable portrayal of the ballet of microgravity and the problems moving around in space with a hybrid of live-action, dangling Bullock on a dozen wires like a glorified marionette, special rigs, computer animation, digital rendering and a special light box.</seg>
<seg id="23">The interior consisted of 196 panels, each some 2ft x 2ft and fitted with 4,096 LED bulbs, essentially like inward-facing giant television screens, which could spin images of debris, the Moon or space station around Bullock, rather than vice versa, before a moving robot camera.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last week, in the Science Museum, I met former astronaut Jim Lovell, who survived the most famous Nasa disaster of all to see the drama of his Apollo 13 mission turned into a film of the same name.</seg>
<seg id="25">An explosion in an oxygen tank left his lunar mission doomed 200,000 miles out in space and, save a few liberties - he did not say "Houston, we have a problem" - he was impressed by the efforts of Tom Hanks, his alter ego, and director Ron Howard, who used a KC-135 aircraft to shoot the weightless scenes.</seg>
<seg id="26">No, he has not yet had time to see Gravity.</seg>
<seg id="27">And, yes, the daisy-chain of near misses for Bullock did sound unlikely but, from what he'd heard on the astronaut grapevine, it's "a marvellous creation of cinematography."</seg>
<seg id="28">Sandra Bullock during a spacewalk in Gravity (Warner Bros)</seg>
<seg id="29">Even Neil deGrasse Tyson, trigger happy after years of science abuse in Hollywood, admitted he liked Gravity "very much," though was frustrated that "we enjoy a sci-fi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it's obvious why we are thrilled by the wildly improbable adventures of Gravity more than real-life spacefaring.</seg>
<seg id="31">The former was designed by Cuarón to be dramatic and the latter by Nasa to be as predictable as possible.</seg>
<seg id="32">The white-knuckle ride of Apollo 13, with its loss of power, shortage of water and near-lethal levels of carbon dioxide was quite enough for the space agency, let alone the tragedies of two Space Shuttle disasters.</seg>
<seg id="33">Because of Cuarón's tight hold on the narrative, Gravity exerts a powerful tug on the emotions of audiences.</seg>
<seg id="34">Bullock starts out by being a tad lacking in the right stuff but her pulse-pounding story of survival and rebirth works brilliantly against the unforgiving backdrop of space.</seg>
<seg id="35">Her odyssey is made all the more vivid and compelling by Cuarón's painstaking recreation of spacesuits, the hardware and the physics of moving about, such as the bewildering - for terrestrial dwellers - reality that if you do spiral off into the void your rotation never ends.</seg>
<seg id="36">Ultimately, however, Cuarón never forgets that Hollywood exists to entertain, not educate.</seg>
<seg id="37">Heck, it's not rocket science, Neil!</seg>

<seg id="2">A Sydney man who shot dead a teenager in front of his family during an "outrageous" and violent home invasion has been jailed for at least 21 and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="3">The family of 17-year-old Devril Leuthwaite wept in relief in the Supreme Court on Friday as they learned one of their son's killers, Gavin Anthony Bell, would remain in jail until at least 2032.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there were bitter scenes outside court after a man acquitted of the same murder - Guy Michael Carroll - traded insults with the dead teenager's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bell, 27, 23-year-old Carroll and a third man, Gary Markham, 29, were all charged with murder related to the invasion of the Leuthwaites' Werrington home in western Sydney in August 2010.</seg>
<seg id="6">Devril Leuthwaite was shot dead while his brother, Robert Leuthwaite Junior, was shot but survived.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their father, Robert Leuthwaite Senior, was also wounded during the invasion, which the court heard was drugs-related.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bell, who shot Devril Leuthwaite with a sawn-off rifle, pleaded guilty to murder, while Markham, who waited outside the home, pleaded guilty to manslaughter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Markham was jailed for at least three years last year after agreeing to testify against Carroll, who stood trial this year but was found not guilty by a jury.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sentencing Bell to a maximum of 27 years and 10 months for murder, wounding Robert Leuthwaite Junior with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and assaulting Robert Leuthwaite Senior, Justice Peter Hall said he had murdered a young man "on the threshold of his adult life."</seg>
<seg id="11">The home invasion was "an outrageous piece of conduct arising out of a planned invasion" conducted solely for "personal gain in terms of money and drugs," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Such criminal self-interest has no place in society and deserves a severe punishment," Justice Hall said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The judge accepted Bell did not set out with the intent to murder Devril, but shot him after he encountered "strong resistance" from the teenager.</seg>
<seg id="14">He noted Bell "used a loaded firearm against (Devril) rather than extricate himself from the situation he and his co-offender had created."</seg>
<seg id="15">Bell, who sat with his head bowed throughout the sentence, made no reaction to the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="16">Carroll, who was in court for the sentencing, shook his head and said "He can appeal."</seg>
<seg id="17">Outside court, he and Devril Leuthwaite's relatives screamed "f***ing c***" at each other.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clutching a photo of her dead son, a tearful Dawn Leuthwaite said the courts had "done their duty."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It's never going to bring my son back, but I'm happy with the courts," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Utah Doc's Wife's Death Was Not 'Natural'</seg>
<seg id="2">Oct.</seg>
<seg id="3">Utah's chief medical examiner testified today that though a cause of death for Michele MacNeill was never determined, the prosecution's theory that she was drowned was plausible.</seg>
<seg id="4">When asked by prosecutors if it was possible MacNeill died after being drugged and held down in a bathtub full of water, Utah State Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Todd Grey said it was a possibility.</seg>
<seg id="5">MacNeill's cause of death was changed by Grey from "natural" to "undeterminable," he said, due to the possibility that drugs could have played a role in her death.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the change, Grey told the court, "I did not feel I could reach a conclusion of homicide."</seg>
<seg id="7">Dr. Martin MacNeill, 57, is on trial for the April 11, 2007, death of his wife, Michele MacNeill, 50.</seg>
<seg id="8">Prosecutors allege MacNeill persuaded his wife to have plastic surgery so he could dope her up during her recovery and then drown her -- all so he could pursue a relationship with a mistress, Gypsy Willis.</seg>
<seg id="9">MacNeill's defense lawyers said heart problems were a contributing factor in the death of the mother of eight.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dr. Maureen Frikke, a former assistant medical examiner who died in 2008, certified that MacNeill died of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and inflammation of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="11">That report was amended after Grey reviewed the case after Frikke's death.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mistress Said Doctor Told Her Secret During 'Pillow Talk'</seg>
<seg id="13">On Wednesday, one of two women who have testified that they had a sexual relationship with Dr. MacNeill while his wife was still alive, said the doctor once explained to her during "pillow talk" how he could induce a heart attack in someone while making it appear natural.</seg>
<seg id="14">Anna Osborne Walthall testified that she began an affair with Dr. Martin MacNeill in 2005, when he was a consultant at a laser hair removal clinic she briefly operated in Utah.</seg>
<seg id="15">Walthall said the doctor volunteered to serve as a "liaison" between her and her estranged husband during their divorce.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their relationship turned sexual in March 2005, she said, and ended six months later when Walthall moved out of town.</seg>
<seg id="17">She said during a "pillow talk" moment she remembered the doctor telling her there was a natural way to induce someone to have a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There's something you can give someone that's natural that's a heart attack that's not detectable after they have a heart attack," she quoted MacNeill as saying.</seg>
<seg id="19">The doctor's defense attorneys tried to discredit Walthall by mentioning she had been diagnosed with disassociative identity disorder.</seg>
<seg id="20">They also pointed out that Walthall had emailed investigators with what she believed were evidentiary tips found in her dreams, asking them if there was anything about a "white Toyota" or if the autopsy said anything about Michele MacNeill's toes.</seg>
<seg id="21">"You know I was processing and sometimes I just give too much information," Walthall said when the emails were brought up in court.</seg>
<seg id="22">Doctor's Daughter Confronted Him About Over-Medicating Mom</seg>
<seg id="23">In the days before Michele MacNeill was found lifeless in the bathtub, one of her eldest daughters, Alexis Somers, confronted her dad about over-medicating her mom as she recovered from plastic surgery.</seg>
<seg id="24">After Alexis Somers found her mother "very sedated" one day after she came home from the hospital on April 4, 2007, Somers, who was then a medical student, said she told her father, Dr. Martin MacNeill, "I'm taking over."</seg>
<seg id="25">Somers testified for the second time during her father's murder trial on Wednesday, which is in its third of five scheduled weeks in Provo, Utah.</seg>
<seg id="26">She said her mother was a reluctant plastic surgery patient who didn't like taking all of the drugs her physician husband insisted she take during her recovery.</seg>
<seg id="27">After taking a cocktail of pills that left her sedated, Somers said her mother told her she didn't want MacNeill to dispense her medication anymore since she couldn't see through the bandages on her face.</seg>
<seg id="28">"She actually had me take out every single pill from the pill bottles and she wanted to feel what the pills feel like in her fingers, so if my dad tried to give her anything, she would know what he was giving her," Somers said.</seg>
<seg id="29">On April 10, 2007, Somers said she left her family's home in Pleasant Grove, Utah, to go back to medical school in Henderson, Nev.</seg>
<seg id="30">Somers told the court her mother "was feeling really well" when she left.</seg>
<seg id="31">The next day, the mother of eight was found by her 6-year-old daughter unconscious in a bathtub full of brown water.</seg>
<seg id="32">Less than two hours later, Michele MacNeill was dead.</seg>

<seg id="35">Vanessa MacNeill, one of MacNeill's daughters, testified that she participated on a family panel to hire a new nanny days after her mother died.</seg>
<seg id="36">The only candidate her father presented, she said, was Willis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Utah Doc's Youngest Daughter Recalls Finding Mom Submerged in 'Brown' Water</seg>
<seg id="38">Sabrina MacNeill, 19, said Willis moved in shortly after her mother's death, however she never recalled Willis doing any typical nanny duties.</seg>
<seg id="39">She didn't do much.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She made spaghetti once and that was the only time she ever cooked," Sabrina MacNeill said.</seg>
<seg id="41">Even though Willis had a room downstairs at the family's home, Sabrina MacNeill said she noticed the nanny would go upstairs to her father's room at night and that the door would then be closed.</seg>
<seg id="42">I remember staying up at night and [thinking], 'What in the world?</seg>
<seg id="43">I thought she was our nanny.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Why is she up in dad's room?'" she said.</seg>
<seg id="45">The relationship between MacNeill and Willis moved full-speed ahead, and by late June, the couple were looking for wedding rings online, prosecutors noted.</seg>
<seg id="46">During a trip to Wyoming in July, just months after his wife died, MacNeill proposed to Willis at a restaurant with a four-and-a-half carat diamond ring.</seg>
<seg id="47">Willis' mother, who testified Tuesday, said the family was "giddy" to have MacNeill, who is both a doctor and lawyer, in the family.</seg>
<seg id="48">Martin MacNeill is a very impressive person.</seg>
<seg id="49">He's tall, he has a bright white smile.</seg>
<seg id="50">"He holds the title of doctor and also attorney," Vicki Willis said.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Who's Who of Doctor Who: Adorable little girl insists on dressing as 11 different Time Lords for family Halloween photo shoot</seg>
<seg id="2">Todd Dent from Dallas, Texas, spent months sourcing clothes from the internet for his two-year-old Katie to wear</seg>
<seg id="3">The costumes were made by Mr Dent's wife and the pictures taken over a period of time as each one was finished</seg>
<seg id="4">It's Doctor Who - but there's no need to hide behind the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="5">To mark Halloween and the 50th birthday of the BBC show, an adorable two-year-old girl dressed up as all 11 of the Doctors, from the original, played by William Hartnell, to 2013"s Matt Smith.</seg>
<seg id="6">Katie Kent, from Dallas, Texas, modelled the costumes after her father, Todd, had spent months scouring the internet for them.</seg>
<seg id="7">He posted the pictures on his Comic Book Literacy blog in a gallery called "Happy Wholloween," alongside pictures of the Doctors that the costumes mimic.</seg>
<seg id="8">He told MailOnline that the photos took several months to put together.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "Most clothing items were bought surprisingly cheaply on eBay."</seg>
<seg id="10">Each item was only around a dollar or two.</seg>
<seg id="11">I started looking for costume items around February of this year so it took several months to compile everything.'</seg>
<seg id="12">'We also took the pictures over the course of several months.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whenever it was time for Katie to go outside and play we would dress her up in an outfit and head out.</seg>
<seg id="14">I would just follow her around with the camera and take about 30 to 40 pictures per outfit with the hopes of getting two good pics that would work for the blog.'</seg>
<seg id="15">Katie dressed as William Hartnell, who played the Doctor in the first series, which aired in 1963.</seg>
<seg id="16">He bowed out three years later</seg>
<seg id="17">Patrick Troughton became the second doctor in November 1966 in the 'regeneration' process.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He described his Doctor as a "Cosmic Hobo," who would play a recorder when stressed</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Kent explained that Katie liked wearing all the costumes, but the ones with big coats in particular.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said: 'She likes to play dress up so she seemed to like most of them, especially the ones with long coats.</seg>
<seg id="21">I think both our favourite may be the sixth Doctor's outfit.</seg>
<seg id="22">She liked the colours and I love how the outfit came together.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was the most challenging to make.</seg>
<seg id="24">My wife is a talented seamstress and she made the coat herself.</seg>
<seg id="25">The show has been a hit with Mr Kent for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">He added: 'I've been watching Doctor Who since I was a child.</seg>
<seg id="27">Shortly after Katie's birth we started a complete re-watch of the entire series from the very first Hartnell episode.</seg>
<seg id="28">We usually watch one serial per weekend together but so far have only made it up to the fourth Doctor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Katie likes the theme song and claps along to it when we watch.</seg>
<seg id="30">Peter Capaldi has been revealed as the twelfth incarnation of Doctor Who.</seg>
<seg id="31">The 55-year-old actor, best known for playing Malcolm Tucker in The Thick Of It, was announced as the new Time Lord in a live BBC TV special in August.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Scot's appointment came two months after Matt Smith, 30, announced he was quitting following four years as the time-traveller.</seg>
<seg id="33">Matt, who joined the show in 2010, will appear in his last scenes in the Christmas Special, with the Peter appearing in 2014, joining current assistant Jenna Coleman, who plays Clara.</seg>
<seg id="34">Jon Pertwee's Doctor, who hit screens in 1970, was a little more action-packed than his predecessors and was predisposed towards slightly frilly shirts</seg>
<seg id="35">In 1974 Tom Baker arrived as the Time Lord, with his trademark long scarf and trilby.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was perhaps one of the most popular Doctors</seg>
<seg id="37">Peter Davison stepped up to the Doctor Who plate in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was known for his role in All Creatures Great and Small and outfit-wise went for a cricketing look</seg>
<seg id="39">Another Baker played the Doctor in 1984, this time with the first name of Colin.</seg>
<seg id="40">He wore colourful outfits and had a larger-than-life personality</seg>
<seg id="41">Sylvester McCoy took the Tardis helm in 1987 and in 1989 viewers watched what was apparently the final episode in the series' 26-year-run, with McCoy and his assistant walking off into the distance... but the show would return</seg>
<seg id="42">The series was revived in 1996 with Paul McGann chosen to wield the sonic screwdriver and command the Tardis.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was much-loved by UK viewers but the series didn't fare so well in America</seg>
<seg id="44">The ninth Doctor was Christopher Eccleston, who brought his tough-guy persona to the role, with Billie Piper as his companion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid</seg>
<seg id="2">Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.</seg>
<seg id="11">A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy," Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.</seg>
<seg id="13">"No," Mr Tripodi replied.</seg>
<seg id="14">I can't remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn't that.</seg>
<seg id="15">Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid.</seg>

<seg id="4">NORTH Melbourne defender Nathan Grima talks about his green thumb, his SuperCoach talents, renovating and how he misses his best buddy.</seg>
<seg id="5">So, where's your turf?</seg>
<seg id="6">I live in Ascot Vale now.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm from Tassie -- Launceston.</seg>
<seg id="8">I moved from Launceston to Hobart to Adelaide to Melbourne to come to the AFL.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was lucky that North gave me a rookie list spot when I was 22.</seg>
<seg id="10">I love Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's a good town.</seg>
<seg id="12">Outside of footy, what keeps you entertained?</seg>
<seg id="13">I enjoy just knocking around with the lads, that's probably the best part about footy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although I've just lost one of my best mates, big Hamish (McIntosh) to Geelong.</seg>
<seg id="15">How are you coping?</seg>
<seg id="16">He stayed (living) in Melbourne so we try to catch up every day still.</seg>
<seg id="17">So have you got a new wingman?</seg>
<seg id="18">Nah, he's not replaceable.</seg>
<seg id="19">What about business interests, uni, have you got any of that stuff happening?</seg>
<seg id="20">Through the club, a lot of the boys are doing a diploma in business management.</seg>
<seg id="21">Once I did that I thought I'd start up my own business.</seg>
<seg id="22">Every week you seem to read about a footy player starting a business or a stupid get-rich quick scheme, so I'm sure people will read this and think I'm a tool as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's just a small synthetic turf business (Endless Turf) with one of my friends (Stefan).</seg>
<seg id="24">It's not your clothes label like every second player's got.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who knows when your footy career could end -- Buddy Franklin kicks another 13 this week I might have to think about it sooner rather than later.</seg>
<seg id="26">I heard you are renovating?</seg>
<seg id="27">I was lucky enough to buy my first house 12 months ago in Ascot Vale.</seg>
<seg id="28">Coming from Tassie, it cost me a lot more than I ever thought I'd have to pay for a house.</seg>
<seg id="29">All off-season I was renovating it.</seg>
<seg id="30">When I first came back after the pre-season I hurt my back doing my weights program, but everyone thinks I did it on the jack-hammer.</seg>
<seg id="31">So you've actually been using the big tools?</seg>
<seg id="32">Well, I didn't use the jack-hammer.</seg>
<seg id="33">I delegated the job to a couple of the boys.</seg>
<seg id="34">Liam Anthony, he came around and helped.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now they've put me on a full ban of using any tools.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now, what are you listening to at the moment?</seg>
<seg id="37">I don't really know how to download music that well so I just get Jack Ziebell to load my iPod up every six months.</seg>
<seg id="38">What else do you play?</seg>
<seg id="39">Probably 12 months ago all the boys got into a big golf craze so I went and bought the real flash golf clubs and this massive tour bag.</seg>
<seg id="40">I look like a tool with it, Daniel Wells said I wasn't allowed to use it because I look like a tool.</seg>
<seg id="41">I haven't actually played with them because I've had the back problems.</seg>
<seg id="42">Are you responsible for anyone or anything?</seg>
<seg id="43">Is there anything you can't let die?</seg>
<seg id="44">I've become a bit of a green thumb.</seg>
<seg id="45">Everything that's in my yard at the moment I've planted myself.</seg>
<seg id="46">I've got a dog at home as well.</seg>
<seg id="47">A Samoyed puppy (Ace).</seg>
<seg id="48">He keeps us (Grima and girlfriend Jacinta) busy.</seg>
<seg id="49">Nathan Grima has had injury problems in recent seasons but has showed when he's fit that he forms an integral part of the Kangaroos' back six.</seg>
<seg id="50">Where would I find you on a Saturday morning if you're not playing footy?</seg>
<seg id="51">I love going for breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="52">There's a few different cafes I like to go to and have breakfast with the boys and read the papers, and then drag that into a lunch with the boys as well.</seg>
<seg id="53">I saw Western Bulldogs players at a hipster cafe in North Melbourne, is that allowed, them being in your 'hood?</seg>
<seg id="54">Yeah, they can go where they want.</seg>
<seg id="55">But we don't actually see too many other boys in this area.</seg>
<seg id="56">I don't think any of them would know who I was anyway.</seg>
<seg id="57">I know all of them.</seg>
<seg id="58">I'm right into my SuperCoach.</seg>
<seg id="59">I recognise rookies . . . long before they'd know who I was.</seg>
<seg id="60">Are you like, "Great game, you got me 100 points"?</seg>
<seg id="61">I'm like, "If you don't get your break-even this week, you're dead to me."</seg>
<seg id="62">Who's your best pick-up?</seg>
<seg id="63">My team is not going that well this year.</seg>
<seg id="64">Last year I finished 60th overall in the country.</seg>
<seg id="65">That's amazing!</seg>
<seg id="66">I got up to about 40th at one stage.</seg>
<seg id="67">But this year I've had a reality check and I'm way back now.</seg>
<seg id="68">What's been the highlight of the week?</seg>
<seg id="69">Obviously getting a win was great.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the Geelong game I gave away the free kick that sort of cost us the win, which has sort of sat with me a bit.</seg>
<seg id="71">Do you want to say anything else?</seg>
<seg id="72">We're not going to talk about the game at all, which is nice, because last time we played the Hawks, Franklin kicked 13.</seg>
<seg id="73">You've mentioned that.</seg>
<seg id="74">Lindsay Thomas likes to get into me and run past saying "13, 13" because he kicked the 13th goal on me.</seg>
<seg id="75">But it wasn't just you, didn't he kick four on Scott Thompson?</seg>
<seg id="76">But if you tuned in late that day you'd think the whole 13 were on me.</seg>
<seg id="77">And it was in Launceston where all my friends and family are from.</seg>
<seg id="78">I actually haven't been back to Launceston since.</seg>

<seg id="1">Week 9 N.F.L. Matchups - NYTimes.com</seg>
<seg id="2">1 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sunday Line: Chiefs by 3</seg>
<seg id="4">According to ancient Roman folklore, Fortuna is the goddess of luck who spins the wheel of fortune that determines each individual's fate, for better or for worse.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although she is believed to be either blind or blindfolded, assuring that the hands she deals are random and unbiased, people throughout the ages have tried to appease her in the hopes of staying in her good graces and receiving a blessed fortune in return.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is not known whether Andy Reid made a direct plea to Fortuna as he was being run out of Philadelphia by an angry mob of Eagles fans, but it is obvious that his position on her wheel has changed drastically.</seg>
<seg id="7">One would be hard pressed to find a luckier coach in the N.F.L. this season.</seg>
<seg id="8">To wit: since the league expanded its regular-season to 16 games from 14, only 16 teams have started the season 8-0, a group that includes the 2013 Kansas City Chiefs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Up to this point, the Chiefs have not played a team that currently has a winning record, and those eight teams are a combined 20-41.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kansas City has also reaped another early-season scheduling benefit: five of its first eight games have been played at home in Arrowhead Stadium, where the Chiefs hold a distinct home-field advantage.</seg>
<seg id="11">If all that were not enough, this will be the fourth game in five weeks that the Chiefs play a team starting a backup quarterback; possibly a rookie third-string quarterback (Jeff Tuel) at that.</seg>
<seg id="12">No wonder Kansas City fans dressed their children as Andy Reid for Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="13">The man is a living, breathing four-leaf clover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pick: Chiefs</seg>
<seg id="15">Vikings (1-6) at Cowboys (4-4)</seg>
<seg id="16">Sunday Line: Cowboys by 12</seg>
<seg id="17">It's easy to dislike the Cowboys - and man does it feel so good to do so - but is any other N.F.L. team more fun to watch right now?</seg>
<seg id="18">Dallas scores points in bunches, gives up a ton of points and has continual drama percolating from the sideline or the owner's box, or both.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Cowboys must be exactly what Vince McMahon envisioned as the model X.F.L. franchise when he conceived that league.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pick: Cowboys</seg>
<seg id="21">Saints (6-1) at Jets (4-4)</seg>
<seg id="22">Sunday Line: Saints by 7</seg>
<seg id="23">When asked for his thoughts on facing Drew Brees, Jets Coach Rex Ryan - his defense fresh off allowing Andy Dalton to pass for 325 yards and five touchdowns - did not have much to say.</seg>
<seg id="24">"That is pretty much it," Ryan said in a conference call with reporters, adding that if Brees had seen the Jets play defense last week against Cincinnati, "I know he probably already left to come here."</seg>
<seg id="25">If worrying about Brees's slicing up his secondary like a butcher were not enough, Ryan also has to worry about his brother Rob's aggressive and opportunistic New Orleans defense squaring off against the turnover-prone rookie quarterback Geno Smith.</seg>
<seg id="26">"They are creating turnovers," Ryan said of the Saints.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are getting sacks on the quarterback.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's an outstanding defense in preventing points and everything else.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the job that they have done has been outstanding, and it doesn't surprise me because I know my brother.</seg>
<seg id="30">Bragging rights in the Ryan family will belong to Rob after Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="31">Pick: Saints</seg>
<seg id="32">Titans (3-4) at Rams (3-5)</seg>
<seg id="33">Sunday Line: Titans by 3</seg>
<seg id="34">For once, wouldn't it be great if a coach were to speak honestly about going against a former team?</seg>
<seg id="35">What, are you kidding me?</seg>
<seg id="36">Of course I'm looking forward to playing against XYZ?</seg>
<seg id="37">I've had the date of this game circled on my calendar since the schedule came out.</seg>
<seg id="38">Seriously, I want to utterly vaporize them!</seg>
<seg id="39">Ah, it's nice to dream, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="40">Sadly, St. Louis Coach Jeff Fisher took the usual "it's just another game" approach when he was asked about facing the team he coached from 1994 to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="41">"There's 16 players on the roster that were there when I was there, so the roster is just about completely turned over," Fisher said of Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There's just a few coaches on the staff.</seg>
<seg id="43">So, the front office is turned over.</seg>
<seg id="44">To me, this is just another opponent.</seg>
<seg id="45">Yeah, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="46">Surely Fisher must want to get the better of his former assistant Gregg Williams, now a Titans defensive assistant.</seg>
<seg id="47">Pick: Titans</seg>
<seg id="48">Buccaneers (0-7) at Seahawks (7-1)</seg>
<seg id="49">4:05 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sunday Line: Seahawks by 17</seg>

<seg id="1">Investors back bold founders' Asia thrust</seg>
<seg id="2">Richard Hemming for wealth Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="3">THE prices of iProperty and iCar Asia have both doubled in the past six months, and the leap of faith investors are making that the two young founders' vision comes off is breathtaking.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is no accident that these two companies, putative followers of Realestate.com.au and Carsales.com, are among the few counters that you can buy on the ASX with operations directly exposed to Asian consumer markets.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are looking to dominate the online sales of property and motor vehicles and their online classifieds business model is one that has what investors love: big operating margins of 50 per cent plus, low capital investment, and big dividend-paying potential.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem is that these two companies are many years behind their bigger brothers and are trying to make headway in the online markets of Southeast Asia that are much less mature.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unlike their bigger brothers, they also don't have market dominance, which is the real secret behind their success (Realestate.com.au owner REA has a market cap of $5.5 billion).</seg>
<seg id="8">Filling this gap is the investors' faith in management, and more importantly, in the strategic direction of the founders Patrick Grove and Luke Elliott.</seg>
<seg id="9">The share price rise means that their joint-owned company, Catcha Media, which has stakes in both iProperty and iCar Asia, is now worth just under $300m.</seg>
<seg id="10">Grove and Elliot are in their mid-30s and have left the running to experienced operators. iProperty chief executive Shaun di Gregorio was previously a senior executive at Realestate.com owner REA.</seg>
<seg id="11">He says that despite their youth, Grove and Elliott have the knowledge and experience in the fast moving Asian online space: "They are passionate about online classifieds and have been in the region for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="12">They have the relationships, the networks and haven't made the mistake of landing here and within six months thinking they can achieve wins.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have gone the distance.</seg>
<seg id="14">iProperty is based in Malaysia, which is the only market in which it is currently profitable.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also has a presence in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Its big market is property developers rather than real estate agents, which reflects these countries' fast economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company listed on the ASX in 2007, has a market cap of $330 million and should only make about $18m in revenues this calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be break-even next year. iCar Asia has been listed for just over a year and has a market cap of $108m.</seg>
<seg id="19">It will be some years before it breaks even based on the $410,000 cash it received for the three months to September 30, which is before costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Both are achieving big quarterly increases in cash receipts, but this is hardly surprising considering their start-up nature, and the numbers are insignificant compared with their burgeoning market caps.</seg>
<seg id="21">But di Gregorio indicates the vast potential that the emerging Asian economies have:</seg>
<seg id="22">These markets might be six or seven years behind, maybe more.</seg>
<seg id="23">But it's not like 12m yacht racing.</seg>
<seg id="24">China's (online property classifieds business) SouFun is 100 per cent new property.</seg>
<seg id="25">Where these businesses can go to in emerging markets is twice the size of REA's revenues.</seg>
<seg id="26">In fiscal 2013, REA generated $336m in sales, and is forecast to deliver $422m in the current year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police in Belize believe Vancouver woman died in robbery attempt</seg>
<seg id="2">Police in the Central American country of Belize are investigating the bloody stabbing death of a Vancouver woman.</seg>
<seg id="3">Officers were called to the ocean-front community of Consejo Shores on Tuesday night after neighbours reported a woman screaming.</seg>
<seg id="4">Assistant Superintendent Daniel Arzu of the Corozal Police Department said officers had to use a ladder to access the two-storey home because it was locked.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Upon the police entering the building, they saw this Caucasian lady lying face down on the floor in the living room in what appeared to be a pool of blood, with several multiple stab wounds to her neck and body," Assistant-Supt.</seg>
<seg id="6">Arzu said in a telephone interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The woman has been identified as Patricia Lynn Nichiporowich, 57, of the Vancouver area.</seg>
<seg id="8">Assistant-Supt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Arzu said investigators believe the motive was robbery, but nothing appeared to have been taken from the home.</seg>
<seg id="10">There certainly was a home invasion.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said the home had not been ransacked, likely because the neighbours chased the killers off before they had time to do much more than kill the woman.</seg>
<seg id="12">Neither the neighbours nor police saw anyone leave the home.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms. Nichiporowich had been living in the community with her partner for the last six months, Assistant-Supt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Arzu said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Police have determined the woman's partner had travelled to Florida on Monday, the day before she was found murdered.</seg>
<seg id="16">We have since made contact with the Canadian embassy here in our country and have been advised that she has an only son who will be arriving in the country this Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="17">"At that point, he might determine what action he will take," Assistant-Supt.</seg>
<seg id="18">Arzu said referring to funeral arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="19">An autopsy was expected to be performed on the body on Thursday in Belize City.</seg>
<seg id="20">Arzu said the area where the woman lived was an expatriate retirement community and there is no reason to believe she had any links to crime.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We don't expect that she may have been murdered because of being a very conniving-type person or she may have owed someone or done some bad deals involving drugs etc.," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">We look at her as a very decent and responsible visitor.</seg>
<seg id="23">Murder is unusual in what Assistant-Supt.</seg>
<seg id="24">Arzu called a quite little town.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said the community has anywhere from nine to 17 criminal incidents a month, ranging from petty crime to robbery.</seg>
<seg id="26">Belize has tax laws aimed at encouraging and promoting qualified retirees from North America and the United Kingdom to live in the country and spend their money locally.</seg>

<seg id="5">"Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the "genuineness" criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about "whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."</seg>
<seg id="10">Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">The man's distraught nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comforted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the vessel.</seg>
<seg id="13">Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police attacked with missiles in Kilkeel, County Down</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 12:54</seg>
<seg id="3">Police were attacked by masked youths throwing bricks and bottles in Kilkeel, County Down, on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shortly before 21:00 GMT a crowd of masked youths blocked the Scrogg Road with a burning barricade and attacked police with bricks and bottles.</seg>
<seg id="5">About an hour later, a similar crowd blocked Newry Street with burning bins and attacked the police station with fireworks and paint bombs.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police said calm was restored at about 23:00 GMT after a "robust operation."</seg>
<seg id="7">Officers remained in the area throughout the night.</seg>
<seg id="8">Firefighters were also attacked with stones in the Scrogg Road incident.</seg>
<seg id="9">A side window in a fire engine was broken, but no personnel were injured in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sinn Féin councillor Sean Doran condemned the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What happened in Kilkeel on Thursday night was an orchestrated campaign by a group of people intent on causing trouble in the area," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The behaviour that took place last night isn't welcome in the Kilkeel area and indeed I have been contacted by a number of concerned parents today who are angry that their young children were put at risk by these people.</seg>
<seg id="13">One parent even described to me how a rocket narrowly missed striking his four-year-old daughter in the face.</seg>

<seg id="1">Free birds: This undercooked effort leaves bad taste</seg>
<seg id="2">In the 3D animated kids" movie Free Birds, a couple of turkeys time-travel back to the first Thanksgiving to get their species off the menu.</seg>
<seg id="3">The movie's animal rights, vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents - at least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 17th-century turkeys as face-painted, headband-wearing native Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">The entire movie, written by Kevin Smith's producing partner, Scott Mosier, and director Jimmy Hayward (Horton Hears a Who!), is well-intended but maladroit, with a clever premise and cute animation that are undermined by the trite sci-fi parody plot and manic, unfunny banter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Owen Wilson provides the voice of Reggie, a smart, misfit bird who can't get his fellow turkeys" beaks out of the corn long to acknowledge their imminent execution.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when he's picked by the U.S. president's daughter as the official White House-pardoned turkey, Reggie turns from prophet to sybarite at his rustic Camp David cabin, gobbling delivery pizzas and Mexican soap operas.</seg>
<seg id="7">The easy life ends when he's kidnapped by Jake (Woody Harrelson), the zealous, dopey leader of the Turkey Liberation Front who persuades Reggie to help hijack the government's top-secret, egg-shaped time machine (robot voiced by George Takei) and go back to Plymouth Colony in 1621 to reset the holiday meal.</seg>
<seg id="8">The movie's action-crammed second half drops pointless references to Braveheart to Pocahontas (with Amy Poehler as the Chief Broadbeak's daughter, Jenny), but beyond giving kids second thoughts about fighting for the drumsticks, there's little reason to be thankful for this undercooked, over-stuffed effort.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lives Lived: Paula Kerr, 68</seg>
<seg id="2">Sister, aunt, stewardess, college professor, animal lover.</seg>
<seg id="3">Born Oct.</seg>
<seg id="4">11, 1944, in St. Thomas, Ont.; died March 15, 2013, in Oxford Station, Ont., of hypertensive heart disease, aged 68.</seg>
<seg id="5">Paula Kerr was born in late 1944 while her father, Gordon, was overseas serving with the Royal Canadian Air Force's Bomber Command, so she did not meet him until she was nine months old.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her American mother, Ethel, like many wartime wives, had to run the household and take care of her then-three children during her husband's absence.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unlike the proverbial "middle child," Paula did not have to struggle for attention, as she was a sweet blond child with pigtails, freckles and an engaging personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">When company visited the Kerr household, her mother felt badly that Paula got most of the attention while her plainer siblings, John, Nancy and Wendy, took a background role.</seg>
<seg id="9">In adulthood, her brother and sisters affectionately called her "the Pretty One" in a nod to their childhood experiences.</seg>
<seg id="10">Growing up in an Air Force family, Paula had a love of pilots and planes in her blood.</seg>
<seg id="11">So it was natural that she get a job as a stewardess (as they were then called) with Pan American Airlines in 1966, one of the first Canadian women hired.</seg>
<seg id="12">Based in Miami, she flew mainly to South America, struggling with revolving sleep schedules, airplane food, a lot of partying and the demands of the airline to stay within a couple of pounds of size 10.</seg>
<seg id="13">After a decade of flying with Pan Am, the job lost its appeal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Paula took on a variety of new roles including restaurant manager, caterer, travel agent and part-time student in hospitality and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="15">After a brief marriage to her long-time love, a Pan Am captain, she moved to New York to regroup.</seg>
<seg id="16">For one year, she rode the subway at 4 a.m. every day to run an in-house restaurant for a large Manhattan law firm.</seg>
<seg id="17">But after 20 years in the United States, with aging parents in Canada, she returned to Ottawa in 1987.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a master's degree in hospitality and tourism from Florida International University in hand, she began her final career teaching the subject at Algonquin College.</seg>
<seg id="19">Having a job with somewhat regular hours allowed Paula to do something she had always wanted - foster animals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Over time, hundreds of cats and dogs from the Ottawa Humane Society passed through the Kerr household.</seg>
<seg id="21">Paula could always find room for just one more needy animal.</seg>
<seg id="22">One Christmas there were 11 dogs competing for attention in her kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="23">She especially loved fostering hard-to-place animals and rejoiced when they found happy homes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not every dog or cat moved on, however, many finding forever homes in Paula's house.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sadly, in her final years she struggled with insomnia, depression and chronic pain from a back injury suffered at Pan Am.</seg>
<seg id="26">When she passed away, she left behind three misfit dogs who adored her, six cats and two birds.</seg>
<seg id="27">She would be pleased to know that all of them, save one, found wonderful new homes after her death.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wendy Kerr Hadley is Paula's younger sister.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fairfax Radio to field ex-Australian skippers</seg>
<seg id="2">Tim Lane will lead 3AW's summer cricket coverage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Craig Sillitoe</seg>
<seg id="4">Three former Australian captains are set to feature on Fairfax Radio's commentary team as international cricket makes a return to commercial airwaves this summer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cricket Australia on Friday confirmed it had agreed on a five-year deal with Fairfax, which runs 3AW in Melbourne, 2UE in Sydney, 4BC in Brisbane and 6PR in Perth, to broadcast Tests, one-day and Twenty20 internationals, and the Big Bash League.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ABC, the traditional broadcaster, will continue to air Tests but has lost its exclusivity and will not call domestic cricket because of an impasse with CA.</seg>
<seg id="7">The alliance with commercial radio has been in the works for months and Fairfax Radio is understood to have put together the majority of its commentary team already.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will be led by Tim Lane, a Fairfax Media columnist and the former voice of cricket on the ABC who calls AFL on 3AW, and Melbourne-based commentator and journalist Bruce Eva, with another Fairfax columnist Dean Jones and former fast bowler Damien Fleming.</seg>
<seg id="9">Allan Border and Ian Chappell are also likely to be involved, while it is understood the company is also talking to Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and former England captain Michael Vaughan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Eccentric veteran BBC commentator Henry Blofeld could also end up behind a Fairfax microphone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fairfax will cherry-pick the Melbourne and Sydney Tests this summer.</seg>
<seg id="12">CA denied its foray into commercial radio is a money-grab, and said it had tried hard to convince the ABC to call the Sheffield Shield.</seg>
<seg id="13">The impasse means the public broadcaster will provide only brief score updates from shield matches during its Grandstand program.</seg>
<seg id="14">CA's head of marketing, Ben Amarfio, said suggestions the ABC had been told it could not provide comprehensive coverage of the shield were wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were very disappointed to hear the murmurings about us asking for extra money or us not being as interested in domestic cricket.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's garbage," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We want Ryobi [Cup] covered.</seg>
<seg id="18">We want shield covered if we can, but if there's no appetite for it there's no appetite for it, and we have to live with that and find other ways and means, which is why we were so strong in making sure Ryobi was covered on free-to-air TV this year.</seg>
<seg id="19">We would love to have ball-by-ball coverage of the shield on the ABC, but the facts are there hasn't been ball-by-ball coverage of the shield in the recent past and ABC to this point won't be covering shield ball by ball in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">We've tried at every level of the ABC - [CA chief executive] James Sutherland went to Sydney and sat down with [ABC managing director] Mark Scott pleading our case, but they are steadfast.</seg>
<seg id="21">CA subsidised production costs to get the Ryobi Cup on Channel Nine's digital offshoot Gem, and was pleased with an average audience of about 106,000, compared with 52,000 on Fox Sports last summer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amarfio said commercial radio would take cricket to more people and different demographics, especially younger listeners.</seg>
<seg id="23">The ABC, which is understood to have received a substantial discount on its rights, is upset that it won't be allowed to stream cricket on its website.</seg>
<seg id="24">Instead, CA will offer a choice of broadcasts on its own digital platforms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sea Sheaphard eco-fugitive Paul Watson lands in US</seg>
<seg id="2">Canadian "eco-warrior" Paul Watson has landed in the US after spending 15 months on the run from authorities at sea.</seg>
<seg id="3">FUGITIVE eco-warrior Paul Watson has vowed to continue campaigning "undaunted" by legal threats, after landing back in the United States following 15 months on the run at sea.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Canadian said on Thursday he was heading for Seattle after arriving in Los Angeles earlier this week, to defend himself from legal action there.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I have returned to the United States," he said in a statement on his Facebook page, adding that an Interpol "Red Notice" from Costa Rica "has been dropped."</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Watson is wanted by Interpol after skipping bail in Germany in July last year, where he was arrested on Costa Rican charges relating to a high-seas confrontation over shark finning in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 62-year-old arrived in Los Angeles on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Captain Paul was not arrested upon entry in the the United States and is there to testify in defence of his name in the contempt of court proceedings against himself from the illegal whale poachers from Japan," Jeff Hansen, the Australia director of conservation activist group Sea Shepherd said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Watson said he would challenge a Red Notice requested by Japan in the United States, adding that he was "heading to Seattle to defend Sea Shepherd and myself from the... civil suit launched by the Japanese whalers.</seg>
<seg id="10">We carry on with our efforts to save the oceans, undeterred and undaunted.</seg>
<seg id="11">In Tokyo, Japanese officials said they were trying to confirm reports.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government has no more information at the moment other than Japan continues to request the captain's arrest," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Watson decided to disembark to testify in a court case due to take place next week in Seattle over his marine conservation organisation's actions in Antarctica against Japanese whalers.</seg>
<seg id="14">His Facebook page was immediately flooded with thousands of "likes" and hundreds of comments.</seg>
<seg id="15">So glad you are back!</seg>
<seg id="16">Please keep up the fight for our oceans!</seg>
<seg id="17">You are a modern day hero!" wrote Melissa Smith-Janicek, while Sebastian Phillips wrote: "This world needs more like you... stay strong, outlast, change the world!"</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Watson was arrested in May last year in Frankfurt on a warrant from Costa Rica, where he is wanted on charges stemming from a high-seas confrontation over shark finning in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="19">He was released on bail after paying a fine, and was ordered to appear before police twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="20">But he skipped bail on July 22, 2012 and fled Germany.</seg>
<seg id="21">The following month, France-based Interpol issued an international request for his arrest.</seg>
<seg id="22">The organisation does not have the power to issue international arrest warrants but can ask member countries to make arrests based on foreign warrants through a Red Notice.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Watson, known to his supporters as "The Captain," had been on the run at sea since then, and even participated in a new campaign against Japanese whalers in Antarctica last winter.</seg>
<seg id="24">And when an anti-whaling fleet he had been on docked in Australia in March, he made no appearance on the ground, but the country's attorney general hinted he would not be detained if he came to shore.</seg>
<seg id="25">Japanese authorities describe methods used by Sea Shepherd against whaling ships - for example blocking the boats' propellers - as "terrorist."</seg>
<seg id="26">Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research and others are pursuing legal action in the United States, seeking an injunction against their activities on the high seas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we've not been in that situation before -- it's all completely new.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was "full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name."</seg>

<seg id="1">Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt - Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="2">Hunt then enjoyed an unusually long period in command, first of the frigate Palliser (1962-64) and, on promotion to commander, of the recommissioned frigate Troubridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">He had enjoyed acting at Dartmouth, so it was appropriate that Troubridge was the model for the fictional "HMS Troutbridge" in the long-running radio comedy The Navy Lark, and also the location for some shooting of the fictional "USS Bedford" in the 1965 film drama The Bedford Incident.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 1969 Hunt commanded the carrier Ark Royal while she was in refit and then became her executive officer.</seg>
<seg id="5">During an exercise in the Mediterranean, Ark Royal collided with shadowing Soviet destroyer which had cut across her.</seg>
<seg id="6">Russian sailors were thrown overboard, two were reported lost and five were recovered by Royal Navy boats.</seg>
<seg id="7">An eighth refused to be picked up and swam back to his ship escorted by one of Ark Royal's boats.</seg>
<seg id="8">Damage to the port side of Ark Royal after her collision with a Soviet ship</seg>
<seg id="9">Hunt returned from sea invigorated, and it was his short appointment as assistant director of Defence Policy Staff, in a tri-Service environment, which marked him as a first-class staff officer who, as his superior officer at the time noted, could "obtain quick and effective results from the stranglehold of the MoD."</seg>
<seg id="10">Hunt impressed senior officers of the other Services with his charm and his understated yet gregarious approach, beneath which lay a steely determination.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 1974, as a student at the Royal College of Defence Staff, he displayed a perceptiveness and work ethic that marked him out as the outstanding naval student of his course - this despite the fact that he left early to take command of the landing ship Intrepid.</seg>
<seg id="12">As Director of Plans (1976-78), an appointment involving strategy for war and budgeting, Hunt was described as the cleverest director of his generation by Admiral Sir Julian Oswald.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hunt became Captain, Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in October 1978, and on promotion to rear-admiral he was Flag Officer, Second Flotilla (1980-81).</seg>
<seg id="14">He was Director-General Naval Manpower and Training from 1981 to 1983, and as a vice-admiral was Flag Officer, Scotland and Northern Ireland (1983-85).</seg>
<seg id="15">Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1985 he was promoted to admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief Fleet and Allied Commander-in-Chief Channel and Eastern Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="17">He proved an inspiring figure.</seg>
<seg id="18">During one address to the staff course, Hunt strode, jacket off, on to the stage where he talked without a note but with hallmark clarity, wit and often self-deprecating asides .</seg>
<seg id="19">The audience of sceptical middle-ranking officers was won over.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was appointed KCB in 1985 and advanced to GCB on his retirement two years later.</seg>
<seg id="21">He then brought his enthusiasm to a range of causes, including Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust, leading it in a £17 million capital development programme which established it as a successful tourist destination and museum.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was deputy managing director at Eurotunnel (1987-89); commissioner of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (1988-92); director general of the Chamber of Shipping (1991-97); chairman of the South-West Surrey District Health Authority (1990-95); and chairman of Nuffield Hospitals (1996-2001).</seg>
<seg id="23">Hunt was appointed to the ceremonial role of Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom (1994-97), then Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom, and finally Lieutenant of the Admiralty, the personal representative of the Queen in her capacity as Lord High Admiral.</seg>
<seg id="24">Nicholas Hunt married, in 1966, Meriel Eve Givan, who survives him with their daughter and two sons, one of whom is Jeremy Hunt, MP, currently Secretary of State for Health.</seg>

<seg id="1">A New Account in a Murder Case Closed 21 Years Ago</seg>
<seg id="2">Chang W. Lee/The New York Times</seg>
<seg id="3">Jennifer Negron was murdered in 1992, just after she turned 16.</seg>
<seg id="4">Two men were arrested and convicted of kidnapping her.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jennifer Negron died on New Year's Day, 1992, a week after she turned 16, her beaten, stabbed body found near dawn on a corner in East New York, Brooklyn.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was the first recorded homicide victim in a year when conveyor belts of violence carried about 2,000 people to their deaths in New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only a few received public attention, and no trace of any newspaper coverage of her killing can be found.</seg>
<seg id="8">The first coherent account of what happened to Jennifer, who did it and why she was killed, is emerging only now, more than 21 years later - even though the case was marked closed a few days after she died with the arrest of two men accused of dragging her into a car outside her building and driving her off to be killed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Recently, a man who said he was visiting Jennifer's building that night and who was never interviewed by the police, spoke at length with me.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the narrative of this man, Mario Cabrera, is to be believed, Jennifer's death was the result of two intimate betrayals, and has led to the convictions of two men who had nothing to do with the crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">Instead of those two men, Mr. Cabrera said, a teenage boy - a would-be suitor of Jennifer's - lured her into a car because her mother owed money for crack-cocaine that he had been supplying her.</seg>
<seg id="12">Jennifer's mother checked into a rehabilitation center before the killing, Mr. Cabrera said, because she knew that she would be facing serious trouble if she did not pay the debt by the new year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Cabrera, who goes by Tito, and whose relatives lived for 21 years in the same building as Jennifer's family, at 851 Hegeman Avenue, said he confronted Jennifer's mother, Elsie Jimenez, in the days after the killing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I said it was her fault," Mr. Cabrera said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">She said, yes, she knew.</seg>
<seg id="16">She knew it was her fault.</seg>
<seg id="17">She said that it was because of the money she owed for these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="18">He added: "She knew they were coming."</seg>
<seg id="19">She told me so.</seg>
<seg id="20">She didn't know they were going to do what they did.</seg>
<seg id="21">Citing the account of Mr. Cabrera and other evidence, lawyers for the two men convicted in 1993 of the kidnapping, Everton Wagstaffe and Reginald Connor, said on Thursday that they would be filing a request that the conviction integrity unit of the Brooklyn district attorney's office reinvestigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr. Wagstaffe and Mr. Connor, who said they had never met until they were brought to court, have maintained their innocence since their arrests.</seg>
<seg id="23">A charge of murder was dismissed by the trial judge before the case went to a jury.</seg>
<seg id="24">Both men were sentenced to 12 1/2 to 25 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Wagstaffe remains incarcerated after more than 21 years; Mr. Connor served nearly 14 years and is on parole.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, did not respond to a request for comment.</seg>
<seg id="27">The prosecution's case rested on the testimony of a single witness, a deeply troubled woman with drug problems who had been kept in protective custody before the trial to ensure her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="28">The woman, a regular informer for detectives in the 75th Precinct, said she saw Mr. Wagstaffe struggle with Jennifer, drag her from the front of the building around 3 a.m. and force her into a car where Mr. Connor and a third man were waiting.</seg>
<seg id="29">A motive for a crime is not required by law, and none was offered.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nor did any fingerprints, hair, blood, semen or other physical evidence ever link the two men to the kidnapping or death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Cabrera's version of events may explain why: The people he described being with Jennifer that night bore little or no resemblance to the two convicted men, who were older and heavier.</seg>
<seg id="32">He agreed to talk after being contacted by me last year, and we met on three occasions.</seg>
<seg id="33">He also dictated an affidavit to the lawyer for Mr. Wagstaffe, but refused to sign it, without explanation.</seg>
<seg id="34">Over the last year, Mr. Cabrera has arranged meetings with me and not appeared for them.</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tea party is aghast.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.</seg>
<seg id="11">This really is a must for our nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is not a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars get many more miles to the gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
<seg id="25">California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People are paying more directly into what they are getting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is looking into one.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="49">The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.</seg>
<seg id="63">An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.</seg>

<seg id="6">Oracle Corp. CEO Larry Ellison told shareholders at the software maker's annual meeting Thursday that the Redwood Shores, Calif., company is trying to make the Healthcare.gov website more reliable and secure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Oracle and Red Hat are pitching in as well as Michael Dickerson, an engineer on leave from Google, according to a blog post Thursday by Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Most of us want to see our government operating efficiently and effectively and it is incumbent upon us to help them do that," Ellison said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Red Hat Inc. and Google Inc. declined to comment.</seg>

<seg id="11">He is now working directly with QSSI, the general contractor hired to upgrade Healthcare.gov, Bataille said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Exasperation with the website's buggy technology has been compounded by concerns that the service lacks the security measures needed to protect the sensitive information of people looking for insurance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scandals surfacing in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Washington, as polls show voter distaste for politicians</seg>
<seg id="2">In Los Angeles, a former aide to City Councilman Jose Huizar filed a lawsuit alleging that he had harassed and punished her when she refused to provide sexual favors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not true, the married councilman said; it was a consensual affair.</seg>
<seg id="4">Another former council aide has filed a lawsuit alleging that a second councilmember, Mitch Englander, not only allowed a harassing environment to exist in his office but also took part with inappropriate remarks.</seg>
<seg id="5">He denied it.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Sacramento, an FBI affidavit was said to claim that state Sen. Ronald Calderon (D-Montebello) had accepted more than $60,000 in bribes from undercover FBI agents, allegations first reported Wednesday by the Al Jazeera television network.</seg>
<seg id="7">By Thursday morning, as Calderon's attorney was pleading his innocence, other legislators were scrambling to avoid being sucked into the quicksand.</seg>
<seg id="8">State Senate leader Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento took issue with Calderon's claim that as a favor he had hired an unqualified woman onto the Senate staff.</seg>
<seg id="9">The woman, unbeknown to any legislator, was an undercover FBI agent.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Washington, Republicans and Democrats showed no signs of abating their partisan tit-for-tat, most recently at a congressional hearing Wednesday where Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was raked over the coals for the balky opening of the federal healthcare.gov website.</seg>
<seg id="11">The meeting was replete with multiple references to Kansas - Sebelius is a former governor of the state, which means she deals with mentions of Dorothy and Toto and not being in Kansas anymore the way Californians bear the cross of flakiness, blond hair and surfers.</seg>
<seg id="12">At few points did it appear that anyone actually wanted to solve the problems of the healthcare rollout, with Republicans castigating and Democrats defending the administration.</seg>
<seg id="13">(ABC News columnist and former Bush campaign hand Matthew Dowd had a novel suggestion: how about holding hearings to ask questions to which you actually want answers, and which might solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">No word on whether he had takers.)</seg>
<seg id="15">As the healthcare measure's tough start continued, President Obama pleaded for patience, promised the fixes would be made and blamed part of the mess on Republicans who had blocked the measure at every turn in legislatures, statehouses and the courts.</seg>
<seg id="16">All of it begged a question when NBC News and the Wall Street Journal released their newest poll.</seg>
<seg id="17">The question wasn't why 70% of the country thinks America is on the wrong track.</seg>
<seg id="18">The question: From what vat of optimism springs the 22% who think things are going well?</seg>
<seg id="19">The poll was the latest in a series of surveys to suggest indelicately that America would like its political leaders to either shape up or go away for a very, very long time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The number who thought things were going well wasn't the lowest of all time - it had actually gone up since earlier in the month - but both President Obama and congressional Republicans were suffering through their lowest numbers on record.</seg>
<seg id="21">Obama's job approval was 42%, to 51% negative.</seg>
<seg id="22">His image among Americans - historically, the repository for their good feelings toward him even if the country is sliding downhill - was only 41% positive, the lowest of his tenure in the Oval Office, and 45% negative.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Republican Party was liked even less, at 22% positive and 53% negative, also a record.</seg>
<seg id="24">The poll generated some suggestions that voters might exact revenge on Congress in the 2014 elections.</seg>
<seg id="25">But there were other suggestions that things may just continue along in the current, addled way.</seg>
<seg id="26">Asked whether they want Republicans or Democrats to control Congress next year, voters were split almost equally.</seg>
<seg id="27">Asked whether they would vote to reelect their own representative, about three in 10 said they would - a number which stands to rise as memories of the recent impasses fade (assuming they are not replaced by images of new impasses).</seg>
<seg id="28">All told, bad news all around.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not that it changed anything: Within hours the Senate was tied up in knots again, as minority Republicans blocked two Obama administration appointments, setting up the possibility of a renewed partisan fight over the Senate's filibuster rules.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany over US surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."</seg>
<seg id="9">Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.</seg>
<seg id="14">If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.</seg>
<seg id="16">However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."</seg>
<seg id="17">Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
<seg id="18">The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."</seg>

<seg id="1">The players in this team are setting new test match records everyday and now their reputation in one day tournaments is also increasing.</seg>
<seg id="2">An excellent example of this was when a strong New Zealand team was crushed by Bangladesh, who had an insurmountable lead and won the one-day series title.</seg>
<seg id="3">With Sohag Gazi and Musherfe Murtaza's strong bowling Bangladesh defeated New Zealand in the second one-day match by 40 runs and gained a insurmountable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive win in one-day matches against New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before this, New Zealand had lost the 2010 series to Bangladesh by 0-4.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chasing a target of 248 runs set by Bangladesh, the New Zealand team lost wickets at regular intervals. The team had piled on 207 runs in 46.4 overs from the spin bowling of Ghazi (34/3) and the strong bowling of Murtaza (43/3).</seg>
<seg id="7">New Zealand's Ross Taylor made the highest score of 45, while Corey Anderson scored 37 runs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kyle Mills made 27 not-out, while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but many of the team's batsmen could not convert the good start into a big innings score, so the team were defeated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier, the Bangladesh team was all out for 247 runs after 49 overs in spite of Tamim Iqbal's (58) half century.</seg>
<seg id="10">Anderson and James Nisham took eight wickets between them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anderson took 4 wickets for 40 runs, while Nisham claimed 4 wickets for 53 runs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bestselling French spy novelist Gerard De Villiers dies aged 83, wrote 'France's James Bond'</seg>
<seg id="2">French writer Gerard de Villiers, who sold more than 100 million copies of this spy thrillers, has died in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="3">PROLIFIC spy novelist Gerard De Villiers, the creator of the top-selling SAS series often described as France's answer to James Bond, has died aged 83 in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="4">De Villiers died on Thursday "after a long illness," said Eric Morain, his longtime lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Never a darling of the critics, De Villiers was nonetheless a publishing phenomenon, with his publishers claiming his books had sold more than 100 million copies worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 200th book in the series - SAS: The Kremlin's Revenge - was released last month.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instantly recognisable by their lurid covers inevitably featuring a femme fatale brandishing a gun, his work was shunned by France's literary establishment.</seg>
<seg id="8">But outside literary circles, De Villiers was often praised for his geopolitical insights and was known for cultivating a vast network of intelligence officials, diplomats and journalists who fed him information.</seg>
<seg id="9">His death came as he seemed on the verge of realising a long-cherished dream of breaking into the English-language market, with reports he had signed a deal with a major US publisher for the release of translations of several SAS books.</seg>

<seg id="1">Long odds for Tom Waterhouse revival</seg>
<seg id="2">Illustration: Rocco Fazzari</seg>
<seg id="3">Read the full story in tomorrow's BusinessDay</seg>
<seg id="4">The telegenic Tom Waterhouse vowed in May we would be seeing less of him following the controversy of his spruiking of live odds across our most popular sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">It now appears he has fresh incentive to do so.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Waterhouse may be forced to curb his marketing arsenal due to a more recent vow - to make a profit.</seg>
<seg id="7">This follows the sale of his business in August to UK bookie, William Hill, for a modest $30 million up front with a further $70 million dependent on the company turning a significant profit by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">As many suspected, the massive marketing spend by Tom Waterhouse to date means the business is expected to lose more than $3 million this year on a customer base of 75,000, according to William Hill.</seg>
<seg id="9">It could have been worse.</seg>
<seg id="10">British rival, Bet365, might be rethinking its spend after losing more than $36 million in its first year of operations here, which included a marketing campaign featuring Hollywood star, Samuel L Jackson, a significant factor.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bet365 gained 40,000 customers and revenue of just $7.7 million.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Waterhouse to receive some, or all, of the $70 million rump payment the business needs to generate an operating profit on a sliding scale between $10m and $30m for the year ending December 31, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Waterhouse said it is still important for the company to market aggressively and get a ""share of voice"" as it looks to entice punters away from TAB outlets to its online betting shop.</seg>
<seg id="14">""While TV works well as a way to advertise we will continue to use it,"" Mr Waterhouse said.</seg>
<seg id="15">But he added: ""I don't know if we will necessarily go as much on TV.""</seg>
<seg id="16">The early signs of retreat are already there to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Waterhouse brand will no longer be plastered all over Nine's NRL coverage from next year with Sportsbet - owned by Irish betting shop, Paddy Power - paying a reported $40 million to replace him as Nine's official partner.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sportsbet would not confirm the deal but said sanity is returning to pricing for sport broadcast sponsorships.</seg>
<seg id="19">""The prices that were being paid were crazy,"" said Sportsbet executive, Barni Evans.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of the price inflation was driven by hyper competition for a small number of premium assets in the marketplace and Tom Waterhouse was at the centre of that.</seg>

<seg id="2">Police are 'picking on us': Bikers</seg>
<seg id="3">Recreational bikers slam plans for a hotline they might need to call to tell police "when you're going for a ride," saying it is "still legal" to ride a motorcycle.</seg>

<seg id="5">Queensland Police want recreational motorcycle riders to give them a call before heading out on the roads, to avoid law-abiding citizens being "harassed" by police.</seg>
<seg id="6">The proposal was discussed at a private meeting between Queensland Police Minister Jack Dempsey, senior police and the Australian Motorcycle Council, which represents recreational riders and outlaw motorcycle clubs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities and the council spent more than an hour thrashing out issues surrounding the government's tough new bikie laws at Parliament House on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="10">Outlaw clubs - such as the Hells Angels and the Bandidos - were not invited.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Opposition police spokesman Bill Byrne received 10,000 signatures on a petition from casual motorcyclists complaining about harassment by police cracking down on outlaw motorcycle cycle gangs.</seg>
<seg id="12">AMC spokeswoman Eva Cripps said there had been a "huge escalation" of recreational riders being pulled over and unnecessarily searched by police in the last three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Deputy Commissioner Brett Pointing, the head of Operation Resolve.</seg>
<seg id="14">Photo: Harrison Saragossi</seg>
<seg id="15">Police say they know who the [outlaw club] members are, yet they find it difficult to identify them because they don't wear their colours any more.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The only option is to pull over all riders," she said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ms Cripps said the council was fundamentally against the idea of riders needing to inform police before heading out in groups, but said fed-up clubs were likely to support the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="18">The clubs will let the police know what they're doing to stop the harassment...</seg>
<seg id="19">"We're quite concerned about the fact that people riding a legal form of transport have to report into police to stop themselves being harassed," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Dempsey said the meeting between authorities and the AMC was productive.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said the finer points of the notification scheme were yet to be worked out, but flagged the possibility of clubs being able to use the internet to register rides with police.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I think there is going to be a greater interaction and greater understanding of legal motorcycle groups and associate clubs in the future," Mr Dempsey said.</seg>
<seg id="23">These aren't the people that we are targeting.</seg>
<seg id="24">We are targeting the criminal gangs and thugs, and we make no apologies.</seg>
<seg id="25">We're going hard, we're going fast, and we're going to go further than ever before in relation to getting rid of these parasites on the streets of Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="26">Deputy Queensland Police Commissioner Brett Pointing, the head of the state-wide Operation Resolve, said most officers had a "limited knowledge" of legitimate motorcycle groups.</seg>
<seg id="27">"One of the strategies gang members have used is to de-identify themselves straight away and that's meant we've had to undertake many interceptions throughout Queensland," he said.</seg>

<seg id="3">Picture: Simon Cross.</seg>
<seg id="4">PORT Adelaide coach Ken Hinkley remains in hospital under observation but the club is confident he will bounce back enough to make a contribution over the phone in the Power's match against North Melbourne in Hobart on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Power director of coaching Alan Richardson will lead the team after Hinkley was admitted to hospital on Wednesday night.</seg>
<seg id="6">Richardson last night said said he would be following Hinkley's game plan to the letter, and expected to be in touch with him throughout the match.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm just the mouthpiece.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It'll certainly be very much still Ken's message," Richardson told Fox Footy.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the game was here in Adelaide, he'd be coaching the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's just the fact that there's a flight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Port chief executive Keith Thomas expects Hinkley to make a full recovery but the club would not take any risks with his health.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He had really severe back pain ... we were thinking it was something like kidney stones," Thomas said.</seg>
<seg id="13">They kept him in overnight.</seg>
<seg id="14">""As it turns out it was a virus, which has caused some inflammation internally.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's nothing to be concerned about.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's pain-free today.</seg>
<seg id="17">They kept him overnight and they're monitoring him but he's well.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thomas predicted Hinkley would be in close contact with his coaching panel up until the first siren.</seg>
<seg id="19">After consultation with our club doctor Damian Newberry it has been advised that Ken should not fly this weekend while he overcomes the effects of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="20">We expect Ken to make a full and speedy recovery.</seg>
<seg id="21">"In fact, if our game was played in Adelaide this week he more than likely would have coached.""</seg>
<seg id="22">Four decisions that triggered Port's resurgence</seg>
<seg id="23">Thomas said Richardson was a logical replacement.</seg>
<seg id="24">""We've often said Ken and Alan are very similar in the way they think about the game and in terms of their philosophies," Thomas said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The club has total confidence that Alan can fill in for Ken this week and lead the team well.</seg>
<seg id="26">He has vast coaching experience in his own right and has worked closely with Ken here at Port Adelaide on game style and structures since day one of preseason.</seg>
<seg id="27">""Most importantly, Alan has the complete respect and confidence of the playing group and coaching staff and we are confident that his transition as senior coach for this week will be seamless."</seg>

<seg id="1">Two Versions of a Dominican Tale</seg>
<seg id="2">Re "Dominicans of Haitian Descent Cast Into Legal Limbo by Court" (front page, Oct.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unlike the United States, the Dominican Republic does not grant citizenship to all those born within its jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Constitutional Tribunal's ruling this year merely confirms previous court rulings and efforts by the authorities to improve compliance.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Dominican Republic has a legitimate interest in regulating immigration and having clear rules for acquisition of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="6">It should not be pressured by outside actors and other countries to implement measures contrary to its own Constitution and that would be unacceptable to most other nations facing similar immigration pressures.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Dominican government is fully aware of the plight of the children of illegal Haitian migrants born in the country who lack identity documents.</seg>
<seg id="8">This does not, however, render them stateless.</seg>
<seg id="9">As your article says, Haiti's Constitution bestows citizenship on any person born of Haitian parents anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">A key component of the Constitutional Tribunal's ruling was a mandate to provide people affected with temporary residence permits until a regularization plan is in place.</seg>
<seg id="11">These allow them to remain and work in the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Each case will be carefully examined and subject to judicial due process.</seg>
<seg id="13">Speculation about mass deportations that I have heard is therefore baseless.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Dominican Republic and Haiti may have a fractious history.</seg>
<seg id="15">Recent events, including the solidarity shown by Dominican society after the earthquake of 2010, have shown, however, that for the most part the countries are looking to the future, engaged in the hard task of finding joint solutions to common challenges.</seg>
<seg id="16">ANÍBAL DE CASTRO Ambassador of the Dominican Republic Washington, Oct.</seg>
<seg id="17">For any who thought that there was a new Dominican Republic, a modern state leaving behind the abuse and racism of the past, the highest court in the country has taken a huge step backward with Ruling 0168-13.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to this ruling, the Dominicans born to undocumented parents are to have their citizenship revoked.</seg>
<seg id="19">The ruling, retroactive to 1929, affects an estimated 200,000 Dominican people of Haitian descent, including many who have had no personal connection with Haiti for several generations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such appalling racism is a continuation of a history of constant abuse, including the infamous Dominican massacre, under the dictator Rafael Trujillo, of an estimated 20,000 Haitians in five days in October 1937.</seg>
<seg id="21">One of the important lessons of the Holocaust is that the first step to genocide is to strip a people of their right to citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="22">What will happen now to these 200,000 people - stateless with no other country to go to?</seg>
<seg id="23">The ruling will make it challenging for them to study; to work in the formal sector of the economy; to get insurance; to pay into their pension fund; to get married legally; to open bank accounts; and even to leave the country that now rejects them if they cannot obtain or renew their passport.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is an instantly created underclass set up for abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">How should the world react?</seg>
<seg id="26">Haven't we learned after Germany, the Balkans and South Africa that we cannot accept institutionalized racism?</seg>

<seg id="7">We have already informed you that Asaram is the owner of more than 400 Ashrams.</seg>
<seg id="8">Amongst these is one ashram in New Jersey, USA.</seg>
<seg id="9">Asaram and his son are accused of various crimes.</seg>

<seg id="1">BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson, Dr Jitendra Singh, said Pakistan is now working on a new strategy to infiltration of terrorist groups under the guise of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2">Citing reports from intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued on Thursday that Pakistan is leaving no stone unturned in trying to infiltrate 2,000 terrorists trained in their training camps.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is why they will never allow peace to prevail on the border.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the separatists intentions of provoking the people in Kashmir and spreading widespread unrest failed, Pakistan has become more unruly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Citing the Pakistan tour of the separatist the BJP leader said that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizb chief's Hafeez Sayeed and Saiyad Sallahuddin have predicted a rise in terrorism in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pakistan is seriously trying to complete this promise.</seg>
<seg id="7">The killing of soldiers on the border and suicide bombings in Samba, Hiranagar are part of the same strategy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Economic downturn and horse meat scandal has changed the way we eat</seg>
<seg id="3">Just four per cent rely on takeaways and 11 per cent eat ready-meals</seg>
<seg id="4">Baking has also seen a surge in popularity among British families</seg>
<seg id="5">Stretched families are saving money by cooking their own traditional meals, according to new research.</seg>
<seg id="6">A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 83 per cent said that they mostly cooked from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="7">The economic downturn has been a factor in the findings with many households saving money by cooking old-style family favourites for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">Baking Britain: A survey found that most meals are cooked totally from scratch in eight out of ten households</seg>
<seg id="9">This year's horse meat scandal also put families off ready made meals, and most now prefer to use fresh ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="10">A survey found that most meals are cooked totally from scratch in more than eight out of ten households.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the study 11 per cent of people admitted to mostly eating ready meals, while four per cent said that they relied on takeaways.</seg>
<seg id="12">Great British Bake-Off judges Mary Berry (left) and Paul Hollywood (right) who have inspired families to bake</seg>
<seg id="13">And a lucky two per cent said that they mostly eat their meals at restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="14">The researchers also asked people which home-cooked meal they make most.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bangers & mash - 77%</seg>
<seg id="16">Spaghetti Bolognese - 76%</seg>
<seg id="17">Omelette - 75%</seg>

<seg id="26">The success of Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry and their hit series The Great British Bake Off has also had an effect.</seg>
<seg id="27">Over six in ten of the Britons claimed they could bake a cake - a figure that includes over four in ten men.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wren Living, the company that commissioned the research, said that the findings show a sharp change in attitudes among families.</seg>
<seg id="29">The findings are part of an ongoing study by the company into how UK homeowners use their kitchens as part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="30">Earlier this year, a study by the Department of Health's Change4Life campaign found that just over half of families prepared meals from basic ingredients four times a week or less.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the latest findings show that the popularity of cooking from scratch in Britain's kitchens has risen dramatically since then.</seg>
<seg id="32">The company's managing director Armando Sanchez said: 'British families take a lot of stick for relying on ready meals but our findings show that some of the criticism is undeserved.</seg>
<seg id="33">'Whether it's a direct result of the horse meat scandal or because the likes of Jamie Oliver are showing us how easy it is to eat well and cook from scratch, more and more of us are giving it a go.'</seg>

<seg id="2">By Richard Kay</seg>
<seg id="3">Beauty: Russian tycoon Andrey Melnichenko, pictured with wife Aleksandra, has taken legal action over the height of a sculpture</seg>
<seg id="4">First it was the painting of his £200 million superyacht, and now it's a statue he bought from an art dealer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Either way, it has drawn the Berkshire-based Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko into a legal wrangle.</seg>
<seg id="6">So while he sues Dulux for £62million, he has also taken legal action over the height of a sculpture which he purchased for a trifling £423,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">For when the figure was delivered, Melnichenko and his stunning former supermodel wife, Serbian-born Aleksandra, discovered it was half the size they had expected it to be.</seg>
<seg id="8">The work - two huge sleeping heads entitled Sonno Grande [big sleep] - by acclaimed Polish artist Igor Mitoraj should have been more than 7ft tall, according to the Melnichenkos, who are known for their money-no-object tastes.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the sculpture which was delivered was under 4ft in height.</seg>
<seg id="10">So Melnichenko, who at 41 is one of Russia's most powerful industrialists, decided through Isle of Man-based art company Hamilton Art Ltd to sue the New York art dealer which supplied it, David Benrimon, for both breach of contract and fraud.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time he claimed a whopping £2.6million in damages.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to legal documents, Benrimon has reached an agreed settlement with the oligarch, having earlier denied selling an undersized head.</seg>
<seg id="13">In court papers filed in New York, lawyers for the dealer assert: "The claim in this case really involves nothing more than billionaires who wound up not liking an artwork they picked out, purchased, paid for and accepted."</seg>
<seg id="14">With a fortune in the region of £9 billion, chemical tycoon Melnichenko, who owns the £24 million Harewood estate in Ascot, is used to the finer things in life.</seg>
<seg id="15">He claims paint company Dulux's incompetence forced him to redecorate his 391ft luxury yacht.</seg>
<seg id="16">The vessel, named "A" after Melnichenko's wife, Aleksandra, was designed by French interiors guru Philippe Starck and boasts a dance floor with a glass ceiling - which forms the bottom of a pool on the deck above.</seg>
<seg id="17">Never let it be said Lord Archer can't take a joke against himself.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friends who have received an invitation to the peer's celebrated Krug champagne and shepherd's pie Christmas party at his Thames-side eyrie have been surprised to see a curly-haired cherub on the lavishly illustrated card with an inscription that is a nod to his jail sentence for perjury and perverting the course of justice.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cherub's name, Alex, in bold black type, is the Christian name of his new grandson on whom he dotes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Underneath is written: "Sins of the Grandfather."</seg>
<seg id="21">A friend tells me: "Jeffrey feels he's paid his dues.</seg>
<seg id="22">So why shouldn't he make a joke of it.</seg>

<seg id="27">Its lesbian theme and sex scenes caused controversy, but it won awards galore.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now the author has just learned from her literary agent Caroline Michel that BBC Worldwide has declined to renew its rights to the series, which was directed by Beeban Kidron, now Baroness Kidron, who went on to make Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">Says Jeanette: "It's actually a much wider issue than simply failing to re-license my screenplay.</seg>
<seg id="30">What it is really about is how [creative director] Alan Yentob is spending the corporation's money.</seg>
<seg id="31">The BBC is making huge cuts and spending as little as possible on the creative talent behind programmes in favour of the managers.</seg>

<seg id="36">"After a lot of soul-searching, I'm having to go this route because the banks charge too much," she says.</seg>

<seg id="42">Indeed, the usually bubbly socialite admits she was so traumatised at finding herself single at 44 that she wants to use the experience to help other women who have lost their way in life.</seg>
<seg id="43">To that end, she is to train as a life coach.</seg>
<seg id="44">I want to help other women who need direction.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It can be easy to lose your way," says Heather at a champagne party to launch London's Rosewood Holborn hotel.</seg>
<seg id="46">I found it difficult being on my own after years of being married to such an important man.</seg>
<seg id="47">Sol was a big influence.</seg>

<seg id="50">The Grade II-listed building, designed by legendary theatre architect Frank Matcham, closed in 1965 soon after The Beatles played there and became a bingo hall.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sheila, who starred at the Hippodrome as Robin Hood in Babes In The Wood in 1957, recalls: "We had a real horse in the show."</seg>
<seg id="52">One night, it wedged its backside into the door of my dressing room, blocking my way to the stage.</seg>
<seg id="53">So, in my Principal Boy's costume, with a hat with a huge feather sticking out of it, I had to crawl between its legs.</seg>
<seg id="54">It was the only time in my career that I made an entrance, with feather askew, after climbing under a horse's a***!</seg>
<seg id="55">Still working at 86, Sheila vows to "fight for my dear, lovely old Hippodrome."</seg>
<seg id="56">If the bulldozers come, I shall sit down in front of them.</seg>

<seg id="1">We Call That Failure Art: Tony Kushner's Speech to Writers: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">The following is adapted from a speech the author gave at the Whiting Writers" Awards on October 21, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">I said yes to doing this speech tonight for three reasons.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first is, of course, because the emergence of writers of talent, integrity, distinction, wit, vision, and imagination is always a cause for celebration, and, in these dark times, no opportunity to celebrate should be allowed to slip by.</seg>
<seg id="5">The second reason is that I felt I was long overdue to repay this organization for its great kindness twenty-three years ago, when I got the news that the Whiting Foundation, of which I'd never heard, had decided that I was an Emerging Writer - a Writer, mind you, not an Emerging Playwright, and, even better, an Emerging Writer worthy of a very handsome check.</seg>
<seg id="6">Uncharacteristically for me, I didn't tell anyone I was a Whiting Foundation Emerging Writer until the news was published in the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="7">Before that announcement, the award was a magic penny I kept in my pocket to rub several times a day, its potency in making me feel noticed, singular, and hopeful augmented, somehow, by remaining private, something almost exclusively mine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps I kept the news hidden because the future success that the award hinted at but by no means insured was too unlikely, too remote, a thing too sharply desired to share with others without feeling exposed and embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="9">As often happens with exposure and embarrassment, you get used to it, and so I want to thank the Whiting Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Your award did for me what I assume it's meant to do: I felt encouraged, valued, affirmed by the recognition, by the affiliation, by the swanky company of my fellow-Emergers, by the handsome check - I felt protected, at the start of what clearly was going to be a rough and bumpy ride.</seg>
<seg id="11">The third reason I agreed to do this is that I wanted to try to write a speech about writing, which is ostensibly among my assignments tonight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wanting to try to write about writing is different from wanting to write about writing, or actually writing about it.</seg>
<seg id="13">At fifty-seven years of age, having made my living as a playwright, I feel I ought to be able to write about writing.</seg>
<seg id="14">I've tried on several previous occasions and I've always failed, sometimes at great length.</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm about to fail again.</seg>
<seg id="16">Here goes:</seg>
<seg id="17">I'm a playwright - I believe I've mentioned that - a playwright who supports himself and gets his health insurance by writing screenplays.</seg>
<seg id="18">What am I, a playwright, supposed to say to you writer-writers?</seg>
<seg id="19">I could talk about our strange, amphibious craft; about the very specific problems attendant upon writing for the crossed purposes of literary readers, readers for the purpose of production, and for the non-reading, watching and listening people sitting nightly in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="20">I'd probably talk about health insurance as well - nothing unusual there; playwrights share financial insecurity with writers of every kind.</seg>
<seg id="21">But a playwright is something else.</seg>
<seg id="22">I've been working for the past few years on a screenplay and an opera libretto about Eugene O'Neill, and a while back I came across Bernard DeVoto, writing in the Saturday Review in 1936, dismissing O'Neill's play "Strange Interlude" and any misapprehension that O'Neill was a great writer.</seg>
<seg id="23">DeVoto is insistent upon the difference between writing and playwriting.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is not a derogation but only a definition to say that workable theatricality is the measure of successful playwriting.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the theater the test is not: Is this true to the realities of human experience?</seg>
<seg id="26">Instead the test is: Is this fictitious representation satisfactory to the artificial conditions of the theater?</seg>
<seg id="27">With luck - or with genius - a play may pass both tests, but it must pass the second, and if they are in conflict, the first must yield.</seg>
<seg id="28">The theater is under many limitations: the exigencies of space and time; the dictation of the literal, which requires an actual Peter Pan to swing through the air on an actual wire in the presence of practicable props; and especially the necessary conditions of people meeting together as an audience, the lowered intelligence, the lulled critical faculty, the enhanced emotionalism and suggestibility of a group, the substitution of emotional accord for the desire to experience and understand that is fed by other forms of literature.</seg>
<seg id="29">Under all these limitations, the theater succeeds in its own terms.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are the terms of the momentarily effective, not the permanently true or the permanently illuminating.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only small and superficial portions of human life can be honestly and thoroughly represented in such terms and under such limitations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Quite properly, the theater does not care: where honest and thorough presentation of life makes available material, the theater will use it; where it does not, the theater must and will cheerfully depart from it for the sake of the theatrical values.</seg>
<seg id="33">They, the theatrical values, are concerned with something else.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's not that DeVoto is entirely right; he's as wrong as can be about the audience being less intelligent than before it gathers or after it atomizes, for one thing, and there's much besides with which to take serious issue.</seg>
<seg id="35">But he's right about theatre, and the people who write for it, being shaped by and in pursuit of "something else."</seg>
<seg id="36">Regrettably, content to having put it in its subordinate place, DeVoto stops before attempting to expand upon the nature of the Something Else the theatre is in pursuit of, leaving those of us who don't accept theatre's difference as a mark of its deficiency to posit that DeVoto's Something Else is another name for what Shakespeare describes, that "thing of great constancy, but howsoever strange and admirable" - the alarming, frustrating, and profoundly human momentariness, the transparently doubled and dialectical condition that that gravity-bound and yet aloft, hung-on-a-hook Peter Pan attains.</seg>
<seg id="37">I get to play generative games with that kind of fantastically phony fairy, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</seg>
<seg id="38">That said, playwrights aren't like other writers, and I admire but am not competent at doing the kind of writing that aims at permanent truth and permanent illumination.</seg>
<seg id="39">Like other playwrights, I aim at Something Else.</seg>
<seg id="40">And so I don't know what I can say to you writer-writers that's of any value, really.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's unsuitable for me to talk to you about success, admonishing you to turn your backs on it.</seg>
<seg id="42">Perhaps you should.</seg>
<seg id="43">I don't think I can.</seg>
<seg id="44">Plays need audiences to work; plays inescapably are popular entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="45">I can't advise you to go live permanently in the woods.</seg>
<seg id="46">Playwrights have had houses in the woods, but they rarely retreat into them while plausibly designated as Emerging, and only a very few retreat permanently; playwrights need interiority and insularity as much as any other kind of writer, but then the M.O. shifts to rehearsal rooms and theatres, and, as I said, we need to be amphibious.</seg>
<seg id="47">Even if I was another sort of writer, a writer-writer, a litwright rather than a playwright, I'd be apprehensive offering you advice about writing.</seg>
<seg id="48">I could tell you that in an occupation the chief demand of which is to try hard to tell the truth, momentary truth or permanent, to generate meaning, one of the surest paths away from success, however you define it, and toward failure is to allow yourself knowingly, willingly, opportunistically to lie.</seg>
<seg id="49">I could exhort you to avail yourselves of the litwright's isolationist prerogatives, but in addition to feeling hypocritical, since I get to hang out half the time with actors, who are a lot of fun, maybe you're not the kind of writer who should go off to a cabin in the woods, maybe, instead of the wonderful books we anticipate from you, if you went off to a cabin in the woods you'd wind up writing Unabomber manifestos, maybe you'd just go crazy.</seg>
<seg id="50">I'm utterly unsuited to the task of telling you how to live a happy, disciplined writer's life.</seg>
<seg id="51">I'm a slow reader, a deliberate tortoise of a thinker rather than the intellectual gazelle I would like to be; I'm undisciplined and unhappy writing and expect to be until the writing stops.</seg>
<seg id="52">I find a remarkable number of things to do in a day much more compelling than writing.</seg>
<seg id="53">I could give you absolutely sterling advice on how to avoid writing, how when you run out of things to do other than going to your desk and writing, when every closet is reorganized and you've called your oldest living relative twice in one day to see what she's up to and there isn't an unanswered e-mail left on your computer or you simply can't bear to answer another one and there is no dignity, not a drop left, in any further evasion of the task at hand, namely writing, well, you can always ask your dentist for a root canal or have an accident in the bathtub instead.</seg>
<seg id="54">Trying every day to tell the truth is hard.</seg>
<seg id="55">There are harder things, of course - arguably, living with lies and meaninglessness, living in despair is harder, but it's hardship disguised as luxury and easier perhaps to grow accustomed to, since truth is usually the enemy of custom.</seg>
<seg id="56">There are harder things than writing, being President Obama, for instance, and having to deal with House Republicans, or trying to fix the leak at the Fukushima reactor, these are harder, but writing is hard.</seg>
<seg id="57">Again, something you know.</seg>
<seg id="58">If you know how to do it on a daily basis in spite of how daunting it is, and I suspect many of you do know this, you should be giving this speech and I should be taking notes.</seg>
<seg id="59">Maybe at dinner?</seg>
<seg id="60">I have no good advice, but here's some I gleaned from a letter Benjamin Haydon, who rarely gave him good advice, wrote to John Keats: "God bless you my dear Keats, don't despair, collect incidents, study characters, read Shakespeare and trust in Providence."</seg>
<seg id="61">And sometimes, when I'm reluctant to go to my desk, when I'm too pole-axed by fears to allow myself to surmount the not especially formidable obstacles I've placed between myself and my work, I recite a couplet William Blake wrote to get himself going:</seg>
<seg id="62">If Blake could do this when he sat down to shite, Think what he might do if he sat down to write.</seg>
<seg id="63">And sometimes that actually helps!</seg>
<seg id="64">It helps to know that even Blake needed a little prompting now and then to get to work.</seg>
<seg id="65">Finally - and I'm almost done - I realize that I might have spoken not about how to write, but why.</seg>
<seg id="66">Here, too, I'm held back by the probability that each of you writes for your own reasons, and all of us write to serve ambitions we hold in common.</seg>
<seg id="67">We write to negotiate our own relationships with momentariness and permanence, to speak with the dead, to bring them back to life, or try to, and of course we always fail to bring them back, and we call that failure art.</seg>
<seg id="68">Perhaps you're like me in clinging for dear life to an uncertainty, sometimes powerful, sometimes faint, regarding the purpose and importance of what a writer or any artist does.</seg>
<seg id="69">Perhaps you share with me a reluctance to investigate that purpose and power too extensively, deeply, closely.</seg>
<seg id="70">Perhaps like me you cherish the lingering question: Is this thing that I do superfluous?</seg>
<seg id="71">Perhaps it is.</seg>
<seg id="72">And perhaps like me you agree with Bertolt Brecht when he wrote, "It's the superfluous for which we live."</seg>
<seg id="73">All I really know about writing is that if you're a writer, writing is what you do.</seg>
<seg id="74">The work, intellectual, emotional, physical work, is everything - the means, the ends, the justifications, and the doubts, the ignominy, acclaim, disappointment, and elation, everything that can happen will happen only when and if you write.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the words of one of my favorite writer-writers, the great poet Czeslaw Milosz:</seg>
<seg id="76">The goal of an artist is to be free of violent joys and sorrows for which he had time enough during his past life.</seg>
<seg id="77">At breakfast not to think anything except that he will go to his workshop, where stretched canvases are ready.</seg>
<seg id="78">He works on a few of them simultaneously, intrigued by a surprise emerging out of the movements of the brush.</seg>
<seg id="79">He knows what he looks for, what he strives for.</seg>
<seg id="80">And that is the whole reality, a detail seen once but constantly escaping, its nameless essence not touched by anybody.</seg>
<seg id="81">Practically this means to re-create trees, landscapes, people, animals, but always with the hope that the brush will find a proper trail.</seg>
<seg id="82">That's the most I have to offer tonight: take up your brush, or rather your pen, or turn on your laptop, keep writing, find proper trails!</seg>

<seg id="2">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.</seg>
<seg id="5">South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia's export routes through Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="7">Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."</seg>
<seg id="8">Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year's end.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Study tracks risk of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) exposure in Brazil's urban areas</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe chronic systemic disease caused by the protozoa (Leishmania infantum) in South America, the Mediterranean, southwest and central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="3">These parasites lodges in defense cells and compromises the spleen, liver and bone marrow, becoming fatal if left untreated.</seg>
<seg id="4">The parasites are transmitted to human and animal hosts by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies with dogs as the main urban reservoirs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The official global burden totaled more than 58,000 human VL cases per year and more than 90% these occur in just six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Brazil and Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Brazil, during 2001 to 2011, were confirmed 39,780 VL cases.</seg>
<seg id="7">The increasing occurrence of VL cases in Brazilian urban centers is a challenge for control programs.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this context, Belo Horizonte, with nearly 2.5 million inhabitants, is one of the largest Brazilian cities with active transmission of VL: 1,604 cases were recorded from 1994 to 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">In spite of the availability of diagnosis (clinical and laboratory) and drugs for treatment, the city has one of the highest VL fatality rates in nation, with 21% of those who have the disease succumbing in 1994 and 24% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factors involved in VL transmission are poorly understood, especially in urban and densely populated counties.</seg>
<seg id="11">Assuming that the identification of risk factors for the disease can help VL control and contribute to the reduction of cases and deaths, the research group in Epidemiology, headed by Dr. Mariangela Carneiro (Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil), conducts studies on urbanization and expansion of VL in Belo Horizonte, capital of Minas Gerais State.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the studies carried out by the group, publishing in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases aimed to identify the risk areas for VL and the risk factors involved in transmission in Belo Horizonte.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the same geographical space human VL cases (n=412), canine infection, socioeconomic and environmental features were analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="14">A concentration of high-risk focal points of human VL cases was identified in the northern part of the city, marked by lower levels of education and income, and higher numbers of infected dogs per inhabitant.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is worth mentioning that the Brazilian Ministry of Health prohibits the treatment of dogs with drugs available for use in cases of human VL and instead recommends euthanasia of infected dogs.</seg>
<seg id="16">This measure has been questioned by the population, especially by animal protection groups.</seg>
<seg id="17">The spatial analysis adopted for this study is useful for the identification of focal points with a greater risk of VL and displays operational applicability in the control program for an urban environment with an unequal spatial distribution of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus, the frequent monitoring of risk of human VL according to focal points is important to direct and prioritize the actions of the control program in urban environment, especially in big cities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Why go now?</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea of Existentialist Paris existed roughly from 1945, when Samedi-Soir claimed Jean-Paul Sartre had become "the master" to "the hairy adolescents of Saint-Germain-des-Prés," to 1952, when Elle magazine posed the question "Is Existentialism passé?"</seg>
<seg id="4">During those seven years there was a vibrant mingling of philosophers (Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus), musicians (Boris Vian, Miles Davis, Juliette Gréco, Jacques Douai), artists (Jean Fautrier, Alberto Giacometti), writers (Jean Genet, Jacques Prévert) and actors (Yves Montand, Simone Signoret) in the cafés and clubs of the Latin Quarter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most of the significant figures are now dead, but their spirit of liberty, authenticity and individualism lives on.</seg>
<seg id="6">This year marks the 70th anniversary of Sartre's classic Being and Nothingness as well as the 100th anniversary of Camus' birth, on 7 November 1913.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's as good a time as any to wake up and smell the Gauloises.</seg>

<seg id="78">The best work on Existentialist Paris is Boris Vian's Manual of Saint-Germain-des-Prés published in French in 1949 and translated into English in 2005 (Rizzoli).</seg>
<seg id="79">Icing on the cake</seg>
<seg id="80">Visit Caveau de la Huchette (25) at 5 Rue de la Huchette (00 11 33 1 43 26 65 05; caveaudelahuchette.fr), the last remaining post-war cellar club and the inspiration for Liverpool's Cavern Club.</seg>
<seg id="81">The accent is on American sounds and the dance floor is soon jerking and spinning with serious jivers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Infant universe more active than thought?</seg>
<seg id="2">Nov.</seg>
<seg id="3">1, 2013 - In a major new survey of the early universe conducted from the NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, University of Massachusetts Amherst astronomer Mauro Giavalisco and colleagues at several other institutions identify the most distant, thus the earliest galaxy ever detected.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although other Hubble-based observations have identified many other candidates for galaxies in the early universe, including some that may be even more distant, this galaxy is the farthest and earliest whose distance can be definitively confirmed with follow-up observations from the Keck I telescope, one of the largest on earth.</seg>
<seg id="5">The surprise finding of a young galaxy from a survey that was not designed to find such bright early galaxies suggests that the infant universe may harbor a larger number of intense star-forming galaxies than astronomers believed possible, say first author Steve Finkelstein of the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, Giavalisco and others writing in a recent issue of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="6">This means theories and predictive models of the distribution of galaxies' star formation activity may need revision.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We expected to find a lot more small objects with this survey," says Giavalisco.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the same way physics predicts that throwing a brick through a window should produce a huge number of small shards and very few large pieces, he adds, theory predicts there should be "many small-mass galaxies but just a few large ones.</seg>
<seg id="9">And our survey was not really designed to find these early galaxies with such a high rate of star formation.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, on the first try we see this very active object.</seg>
<seg id="11">So we're not sure if we're really, really lucky or if our predictive models are slightly off.</seg>
<seg id="12">The high luminosity, powered by star formation activity, of this new galaxy "raise a tantalizing question about whether we've got the theory of galaxy formation correct in its fundamental ideas," the astronomer adds.</seg>
<seg id="13">Predictions about the star formation rate distribution of galaxies are related to the physics of gas accretion onto galaxies and subsequent gas expulsion from them.</seg>
<seg id="14">These mechanisms are not yet fully understood.</seg>
<seg id="15">The team, with researchers from Israel, Italy, Arizona, Maryland, California and Kentucky with UMass Amherst and UT, used two special cameras on Hubble as part of the largest investigation of the distant universe ever made with the space telescope.</seg>
<seg id="16">To identify this distant galaxy from among myriads of other, closer faint galaxies that obscure deep images of the sky, they used a technique called the "Lyman-break selection" developed by Giavalisco and others in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="17">It exploits the apparent colors of galaxies as a crude distance indicator.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Colors encode a lot of physical processes at work in them," he points out, "such as whether they form stars or not and how much dust is in them, because dust dims stellar light and makes their colors redder."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Thanks to the Lyman-break selection, we can cull the very rare, genuinely distant galaxies from the much more abundant dust-reddened nearby ones with great confidence, making the study of the distant universe possible," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the Lyman-break technique yields only crude distance estimates, so astronomers need to accurately determine the distance to pre-selected remote galaxies, and hence the age at which they are being observed, not only to accurately date the galaxy, but also to accurately measure its mass, luminosity and star-formation activity.</seg>
<seg id="21">To measure the distance to this record-breaking galaxy, Finkelstein, Giavalisco and colleagues needed very sensitive spectroscopic telescopes to detect a specific spectral feature emitted by hydrogen known as the Lyman-alpha emission line.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is emitted in a very narrow range of ultraviolet wavelengths, invisible to the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="23">"But if our galaxy is really so distant from us, then the fast cosmic expansion that existed at its early days would be redshifted because of the expanding universe from its apparent wavelength to infrared wavelengths," Giavalisco points out.</seg>
<seg id="24">To detect the Lyman-alpha emission from such a distant galaxy and fully confirm its nature, the team used the Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii, a very powerful spectroscopic instrument.</seg>
<seg id="25">Results yielded a redshift parameter, that is an indicator of distance, of z = 7.51, by far the most distant galaxy ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="26">At that time the universe was only 700 million years old, compared to 13.8 billion years today.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was 8.5 times smaller than today, 600 times more dense and expanding 8.5 times faster.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lyman alpha light is also a powerful probe of the early universe.</seg>
<seg id="29">It cannot penetrate the neutral hydrogen gas that envelops young galaxies because the gas's atoms very easily absorb it, Giavalisco says.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can, however, propagate freely through ionized gas bubbles around older, more evolved galaxies.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thus, detecting Lyman-alpha from a very early galaxy suggests that its neutral hydrogen volume is small.</seg>
<seg id="32">"This is a very important piece of information about cosmic re-ionization," the astronomer points out.</seg>
<seg id="33">Re-ionization is a crucial phase of cosmic evolution that happened when the universe went from being a distribution of cold neutral gas with no light sources, also known as the Dark Age, to being fully ionized.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We believe that the energy to ionize the hydrogen came from the first stars and the first quasars, which ended the Dark Age, lifted its cold fog and made the cosmos transparent to Lyman alpha light," Giavalisco says.</seg>
<seg id="35">Thus, this study moves science closer to answering a long-standing mystery about how cosmic re-ionization proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="36">If the theory of the Big Bang is correct, we must see the recombination of the ionized plasma into a neutral gas, or re-ionization.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gary Sinise builds homes and hope for wounded veterans</seg>
<seg id="2">"How many 28-year-olds do you know who actually own their own house?" asks Sgt. John Peck while at his home in Spotsylvania, Va.</seg>
<seg id="3">Peck, a new home owner, doesn't live in just any ordinary house.</seg>
<seg id="4">He resides in a smart home designed to make his life easier.</seg>
<seg id="5">He uses an iPad to help open doors, access cabinets and turn the lights on and off.</seg>
<seg id="6">A quadruple amputee, Peck was severely wounded on May 24, 2010, in Afghanistan during his second tour of duty with the Marines.</seg>
<seg id="7">While searching for improvised explosive devices with a metal detector, Peck and his fellow soldiers were going through rooms of a compound when Peck came across a 3-foot tall storage unit.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was a tall guy.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was six foot," said Peck.</seg>
<seg id="10">"And it was kind of hard for me to get into that little spot...I had to get on my hands and knees, and everything was clear and then I turn to my patrol leader and I'm like, "Hey, Sgt. Mandez, I'm going to go hold security outside.</seg>
<seg id="11">I turn around -- and boom, I stepped on the IED.</seg>
<seg id="12">He blacked out, and although he doesn't remember what happened next, Peck does recall saying to himself, "Don't let me die here.</seg>
<seg id="13">I don't want to die here.</seg>
<seg id="14">They put me on the helicopter and I saw the helicopter medic...and he's like, 'Alright, we're going to put you to sleep.'</seg>
<seg id="15">And I thought to myself, 'I'll see these guys in a few more days.'</seg>
<seg id="16">Well, I didn't wake up for three months," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Once conscious, Peck learned the harsh reality of his situation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Apparently, as soon as I got blown up, my right arm was gone, my right leg was gone just above the knee.</seg>
<seg id="19">My left leg was gone just above the knee.</seg>
<seg id="20">Peck's left arm was later amputated, and ever since, the Illinois native has been learning how to adjust to his new life.</seg>
<seg id="21">One thing that's made the transition easier is his smart-technology home.</seg>
<seg id="22">Built and funded in 2012 by the Building for America's Bravest, a joint program between Tunnel to Towers and the Gary Sinise Foundation, the house has helped provide Peck with a sense of independence.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I was expecting this little itty bitty cardboard box, and it turned out to be this monstrosity and I was quite surprised that they got that much and did all this and didn't really ask for anything in exchange -- just come help us out at the run/walk in New York and stuff like that," said Peck.</seg>
<seg id="24">Actor Gary Sinise is able to help fund houses like Peck's by hosting fundraising concerts with the Lt. Dan Band, a music group he named after the character he portrayed in the 1994 film, "Forrest Gump."</seg>
<seg id="25">Sinise plays bass in the group, which tours throughout the year to help raise both awareness and money for military and first-responder communities.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since its start, the initiative has built or broke ground on some 27 houses for wounded veterans.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition to the money raised at concerts, the groups have partnerships with General Electric (which donates appliances to the home) and American Airlines (which transports Sinise's band members to fundraising concerts).</seg>
<seg id="28">When I played Lt. Dan in 'Forrest Gump' I never thought that 20 years later I'd still be associated with the character.</seg>
<seg id="29">I knew it was an important movie and I very much wanted to play the part.</seg>
<seg id="30">I have Vietnam veterans in my family and have been associated with Vietnam veterans groups for many years prior to that.</seg>
<seg id="31">So, I really wanted to play the ['Forrest Gump'] part.</seg>
<seg id="32">But could have I predicted that 20 years later people would still call me that?</seg>
<seg id="33">And I'd walk into the hospital room of a double amputee and he would recognize me for that?</seg>
<seg id="34">And that would open the doors for a conversation?</seg>
<seg id="35">I couldn't have predicted that.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Sinise, 58, has decided to embrace it: "They [veterans] related to the fact that I played a catastrophically injured solider and that stuck with me."</seg>
<seg id="37">For Peck, things are a lot brighter today than when he first came home from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="38">His mother lives with him, and without her help, Peck says he "would be dead."</seg>
<seg id="39">Even twisting a soda cap off a bottle is a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="40">If it hasn't been open before, I can't do it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="41">Peck also has a service dog who not only provides comfort (he cuddles with Peck), but also helps him with everyday activities like getting undressed.</seg>
<seg id="42">"If I drop something on the ground, he can pick it up for me," he said.</seg>
<seg id="43">Peck, who split with his wife shortly after returning home from Afghanistan, also gets support from his new girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="44">"My girlfriend always encourages me, which always helps out," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cigna says will increase '14 profit despite pressures</seg>
<seg id="2">By Caroline Humer</seg>
<seg id="3">Thu Oct 31, 2013 10:34pm EDT</seg>
<seg id="4">(Reuters) - Insurer Cigna Corp said on Thursday it expects to increase its 2014 earnings from 2013, reflecting its smaller exposure to uncertainty around private Medicare and the rollout of individual insurance on new exchanges around the country.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cigna, which reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts' expectations on Thursday, has both a U.S. and overseas health insurance business and also sells disability and life insurance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cigna said that diversification will help it next year, which it expects to be challenging because of broad changes in the healthcare industry.</seg>
<seg id="7">Larger competitors UnitedHealth Group Inc, WellPoint Inc and Aetna Inc have recently painted 2014 as uncertain because of private Medicare cuts and changes related to President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shares of Cigna, which had fallen with other competitors after the pessimistic reports, were up 3 percent on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shares of Aetna, UnitedHealth and WellPoint were also higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">State-run "Obamacare" exchanges selling insurance to individuals launched on October 1 and have been struggling with technology problems.</seg>
<seg id="11">The federal exchange, which serves 36 states, has also been plagued by glitches, with would-be customers often unable to log on or encountering mysterious error messages; this week, the data center containing the information needed by all 50 states to enroll members has suffered outages.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cigna CEO David Cordani told investors on a conference call that the company's exposure to the exchanges is small because it is participating in only five states.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have cautioned not to look at this opportunity, for at least our company, as a watershed moment ...</seg>
<seg id="14">"It may present a long-term opportunity," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cigna said it expects full-year earnings of $6.70 to $6.90 per share.</seg>
<seg id="16">Analysts were expecting $6.65, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="17">That is an increase of 25 to 45 cents per share from its previous outlook.</seg>
<seg id="18">The company forecast 2014 growth that will probably be less than the growth in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company said net income rose to $553 million, or $1.95 per share, from $466 million or $1.61 per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="20">Excluding investment gains, the company reported a profit of $1.89 per share.</seg>
<seg id="21">On that basis, analysts on average had expected $1.63, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="22">Revenue rose to $8.1 billion from $7.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="23">The company said the results reflected continued medical cost management and a lower operating expense ratio that were partly offset by some pressure on its private Medicare plans for older people.</seg>
<seg id="24">Medical costs were held back as cash-strapped Americans continued to cut back when possible on doctor and hospital visits.</seg>
<seg id="25">Cigna has a private Medicare business, but it is comparatively small.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cigna said that as of September 30, it had 13.8 million commercial customers and 488,000 customers in Medicare and Medicaid plans.</seg>
<seg id="27">The company also has a Medicare pharmacy benefit business and manages commercial pharmacy benefits.</seg>
<seg id="28">The vast majority of commercial customers are in self-funded health plans in which Cigna administers health benefits as a third party and the company or organization is responsible for the actual cost of covering its members.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cigna shares were up 3 percent at $76.85 at midday on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as much as 5 percent earlier in the session.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gordon: Habs not helping Subban shake bad rep ahead of Winter Olympics</seg>
<seg id="2">Could the Team Canada brain-trust really be thinking about leaving a player who was chosen the NHL's top defenceman last season at home next February?</seg>
<seg id="3">According to reports from the hockey insiders at TSN and TVA, they very well may do just that.</seg>
<seg id="4">With the Sochi Games less than 100 days away, the latest speculation suggests P.K. Subban is now a long shot to make the Olympic squad.</seg>
<seg id="5">Not that the Montreal Canadiens blueliner is much concerned about it.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I think it can bother you if you're focused on it, but the reality is I'm not focused on it, I'm focused on this team here ... you look at the start of the season, I don't think it's a bad start, but I think there's room for improvement, so I'll just get better every day," the 24-year-old said before the Habs flew out on a two-game road swing with the players" dads in tow.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might seem curious that Team Canada would pass over as gifted a skater, stickhandler and shooter as Subban for a tournament on Olympic-sized ice, but doing so would surely owe to a tag that has stuck to him since he was a junior player: risky in his own end.</seg>
<seg id="8">The stats don't bear that out - by any measure, Subban is an above-average defender, and has shown elite defending ability in his career - but how can Steve Yzerman and the other Team Canada selectors trust Subban to be steady and reliable when there are recent indications the Habs have their doubts?</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this week coach Michel Therrien sent Andrei Markov, Subban's regular partner, out with Francis Bouillon in the final two minutes of a 2-0 game at Madison Square Garden.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Tuesday, with Montreal clinging to a 2-1 lead against Dallas, Therrien nailed Subban to the bench for the final 2:56, and threw the statuesque Douglas Murray on the ice alongside Markov.</seg>
<seg id="11">Though Dallas generated a couple of quick scoring chances, the Habs held on.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Therrien's decision to keep his stud defenceman off the ice raised eyebrows, and voices, on Montreal talk radio and in fan forums - all amid the usual circumspection, which is to say borderline hysteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's also odd that the Habs don't often use Subban on the penalty kill, considering his effectiveness on the first unit as recently as two seasons ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therrien was asked if that's a function of Subban's defensive ability, reliability and maturity on Thursday, and said this: "I look at his ice time, he has more ice time this year than he did last year, his progression is part of the equation here."</seg>
<seg id="15">That's true.</seg>
<seg id="16">Subban is averaging 24 minutes 33 seconds a game, a little over 1:20 more than last year, when he started the season late after a brief contract dispute (by way of comparison, the league leader in ice time, Minnesota's Ryan Suter, averages nearly 29 minutes).</seg>
<seg id="17">But this year's average is only 15 seconds more per game than in 2011-12 under Jacques Martin and Randy Cunneyworth, and just over two minutes more per game than in his first full season in the NHL in 2010-11.</seg>
<seg id="18">And Subban's average on the penalty kill is 1:01 per game, almost half a minute less than last year and the lowest of his career (he has played a grand total of 1:45 while short-handed in the past four games, 1:44 of it came in a win over Anaheim).</seg>
<seg id="19">Asked about his usage, Subban joked about not having any coaching qualifications and said "I don't make those decisions."</seg>
<seg id="20">Therrien can reasonably argue the Habs" resurgent penalty killing doesn't need Subban, who can be rested for the power-play, on which he is averaging 4:39 per game, fourth-highest in the league.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's also true that the Habs are the league's second-stingiest defensive team with the current blueline configuration - the imminent return of the injured Alexei Emelin, who signed a four-year, $16.4-million contract extension Thursday, will only make them tougher to score on.</seg>
<seg id="22">So there doesn't appear to be anything sinister at play, the simple and most obvious explanation is that Therrien truly believes in bringing Subban along slowly.</seg>
<seg id="23">But when Therrien was asked if Subban should be on Team Canada, he said, "It's not for me to say."</seg>
<seg id="24">I'm in charge of the Montreal Canadiens.</seg>
<seg id="25">On whether Subban is a world-class player he added: "Whether I see him that way or not, my opinion doesn't change anything."</seg>
<seg id="26">Therrien's caution stands in contrast to the recent boosterism from hockey people such as Larry Robinson, David Poile and Lindy Ruff, each of whom put in a public word for their players.</seg>
<seg id="27">When pressed on what he makes of the James Norris Memorial Trophy winner's recent form - he has been held off the scoresheet in four in a row after a blazing start in which he scored 11 in his first seven - Therrien said: "[Subban] is a player who brings a lot of energy, he's able to contribute goals and points offensively."</seg>
<seg id="28">We have a team concept in our organization, that we follow and that we believe in.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's our team concept that will get us to the playoffs, and it's our team concept that will allow to progress as a team.</seg>
<seg id="30">There's a tendency in the overheated market that is Montreal to make irrational inferences, but at the very least, it doesn't appear Subban's team is mounting an aggressive lobbying effort to combat the perception he is a one-dimensional player.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gold Coast young gun Jack Martin is ready to make his mark on the AFL stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: David Clark Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="4">Not that his slender frame is an issue for Jack Martin, or anyone else at the Gold Coast Suns.</seg>
<seg id="5">He's ready for senior footy and finally the wait is over - the most hyped teenager in the country yesterday became an officially listed AFL player.</seg>
<seg id="6">If anything, Martin's most pressing reason to broaden his shoulders is to carry the great weight of expectation that has been heaped upon him.</seg>
<seg id="7">Brownlow medallist Malcolm Blight reckons his draft tape is the best he ever saw while Lions great Simon Black marvelled, after playing on Martin in a NEAFL game mid-way through the season, that he was already the complete package.</seg>
<seg id="8">The softly spoken West Australian signed a five-year contract before he was even eligible to play in the AFL, joining skipper and superstar Gary Ablett as the only Sun with a deal beyond three years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even at a club with Ablett, the modern era's best player, Rising Star Jaeger O'Meara and freakish midfielder Harley Bennell, Martin's arrival on the scene is the biggest talking point of the new season.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I'm aware of the hype but I'm not stressed about it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">I doesn't bother me at all, I'll just play footy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Martin has always been linked with O'Meara and already a favourite past time at the Suns' Metricon Stadium base is predicting which player will be better.</seg>
<seg id="13">Incredibly, Martin seems to have the numbers although, despite a year in the gym, he is still just 75kg dripping wet and may not be as durable as the muscle-bound O'Meara who played every game in his debut season.</seg>
<seg id="14">"There is obviously going to be bigger bodies but they don't bother me, I'll get in there no matter what size they are," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The pair come from the same area outside of Geraldton on the north coast of Western Australia - which sits on the same parallel as the Gold Coast - and has become a gold mine for the Suns.</seg>
<seg id="16">Both arrived at the Suns via the GWS mini-draft - a special two-year lottery that allowed clubs to trade draft picks in exchange for gun 17-year-olds that were to be quarantined for 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="17">They came to the attention of Suns recruiter Scott Clayton after dominating a senior grand final a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">O'Meara was 16-years-old and won the medal as the best player on the ground in the winning side - Martin, at just 15, was the stand-out for the losing side.</seg>
<seg id="19">Clayton refuses to draw comparisons between the pair or to liken Martin to any player in the game and would only say he would have been in the top two of every draft ever held.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If he plays like Jack Martin we'll be pretty happy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">He plays inside and out, he has this burning desire to tackle and compete.</seg>
<seg id="22">On top of the incredible natural talent, that is a pretty good attribute.</seg>

<seg id="1">Allegations about Martina Hingis by her ex-husband Thibault Hutin are in keeping with tennis's tradition</seg>
<seg id="2">In fact, the five-time major winner is no Margot Fonteyn, and barely an Ann Widdecombe, as she proved by being the first celebrity eliminated from Strictly Come Dancing in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whether she is a husband-beater is another matter, and one best left to her homeland's legal system.</seg>
<seg id="4">The police have interviewed the trio and passed the file to the prosecutor to decide if charges should be laid, so let us show deference to Switzerland by remaining studiedly neutral.</seg>
<seg id="5">But this is not the first time doubts have surfaced as to whether, if you will indulge the jargon, she is playing with a full deck.</seg>
<seg id="6">After losing the 1999 French Open final to Steffi Graf from a winning position, having served underarm at match point down, a distraught Hingis fled the court and had to be coaxed back for the presentations by the mother in whose arms she sobbed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let the record state that neither mother nor child chastised Graf with any electrical implement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The following day, another notable eccentric completed his career slam in the men's final.</seg>
<seg id="9">Andre Agassi would later admit to using crystal meth, the drug embedded in popular culture by Breaking Bad, and also to hating his sport with such overpowering passion that he felt compelled to retire prematurely at only 36.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hingis, during one of several comebacks (the Barbra Streisand of tennis, she is in the midst of another), once tested positive for cocaine.</seg>
<seg id="11">How tennis has retained any part of its image as an effete leisure pursuit pays tribute to the enduring hold on the national consciousness of Edwardian light comedy, and the stock scene in which one chinless wonder sidles through the drawing room doors, insouciantly waving a racket, to invite another to make up a foursome on the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="12">The better theatrical reference point is One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.</seg>
<seg id="13">In January of this year, native favourite Bernard Tomic enlivened the Australian Open with another police incident.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yet another product of an alarming tennis parent, his father John was arrested this year for allegedly beating up Bernard's practice partner on court.</seg>
<seg id="15">The senior Tomic has also been observed giving his son a whack, though he came to the boy's defence in this instance.</seg>
<seg id="16">After Bernard's response to receiving a third speeding ticket in quick succession was fleeing the scene with the police in pursuit, and barricading himself behind the security gates of his house, Tomic père insisted the lad was being persecuted by the police.</seg>
<seg id="17">Given how devilishly hard it is to imagine a cocky 21-year-old habitually speeding in a granny-mobile like his V8 BMW M3 - 0-60 in 6.1 seconds, top speed of 154mph - perhaps he had a point.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roscoe Tanner, whose fastest recorded serve was only 1mph slower than that car, remains for now the only tennis star to have done porridge (several times and for various offences, including the passing of dud checks), and, God willing, the 1979 Wimbledon runner-up clings to that slice of uniqueness.</seg>
<seg id="19">But regardless of whether Martina Hingis stands trial, those glued to next week's ATP World Tour Finals in London should be in no doubt what they are watching is no dainty leisure pursuit for gentlefolk, but the most intense form of sporting battle (including boxing, its psychological cousin).</seg>
<seg id="20">It is attritional warfare with racquets, and will inevitably produce its share of shell shock victims.</seg>

<seg id="8">He is serving 21 years in jail for the murders in Oslo and on Utoeya island</seg>
<seg id="9">He has never once expressed remorse to the family of the 77 people he slaughtered in cold blood.</seg>
<seg id="10">But mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik apologised to his mother for ruining her life before she died of cancer this year, according to a new biography.</seg>
<seg id="11">The controversial book, entitled The Mother, is based on hours of conversations with Wenche Behring Breivik by journalist Marit Christensen.</seg>

<seg id="15">Wenche was taken by ambulance to visit her son in jail.</seg>

<seg id="17">Still in handcuffs, he put his arms over and around his mother in a hug.</seg>
<seg id="18">'Sorry that I have ruined your life,' he whispered, the book said.</seg>
<seg id="19">By contrast, Breivik showed no compassion for his victims, saying in court that he would do it all over again if he had the chance.</seg>

<seg id="22">His father, a retired Norwegian diplomat, said after the killings that he wished Anders had never been born.</seg>
<seg id="23">'I hate him,' Wenche Breivik said of her son after days spent recovering from the shock of the killings in a psychiatric hospital, the book says.</seg>
<seg id="24">Afterwards, she felt guilt and feared that she could be killed in a revenge attack.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can never stop loving your child...</seg>
<seg id="26">It's nature,' Christensen said of Wenche Breivik's conflicting emotions.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the book, Breivik's mother once described herself as the world's 'saddest mother' who both hated and loved her son.</seg>
<seg id="28">It also details how his mother had no inkling that he was planning the attacks on July 22, 2011, cooking him a dinner of spaghetti that got cold as she waited in vain for his return and watched the news of bombings and shootings by an unknown killer.</seg>
<seg id="29">Controversy: Author and journalist Marit Christensen, left, wrote Moren (Mother) after spending hours interviewing Anders Breivik's mother, but its contents have provoked anger from the Breivik family</seg>
<seg id="30">She broke down in tears when the police came to her house that night to say Anders Breivik was to blame for the massacre - a bombing in Oslo that killed eight and a shooting rampage on a nearby island that killed 69, many of them teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="31">Wenche Breivik broke off cooperation with Christensen just before her death, saying she did not want the book published.</seg>
<seg id="32">Publishers Aschehoug went ahead, arguing it was in the public interest.</seg>
<seg id="33">Jens Breivik, father of Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik, spoke out today against a book about his late ex-wife in which he is negatively portrayed.</seg>
<seg id="34">He is described in the book as a 'domestic tyrant', according to Norwegian Daily Dagbladet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Speaking to Norwegian radio station P4, Breivik said the description of him in the book was fictional, and stressed that the author did not contact him while she was writing and researching the book.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said: 'It's completely made up.</seg>
<seg id="37">Almost nothing is rooted in reality.</seg>

<seg id="40">When told that his son had massacred people in cold blood, Breivik, a former diplomat who lives in France, told reporters that Anders had ruined his plans for a peaceful retirement.</seg>
<seg id="41">The marriage ended when the couple's son was only one year old, and Norwegian social services recommended that the boy be taken into care at the age of four due to his mother's mental health problems.</seg>
<seg id="42">Wenche Behring Breivik was due to speak at her son's trial, but pulled out at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="43">She initially consented to publication of the book, granting the author several interviews, but she withdrew her consent shortly before she died in March, claiming that she had been tricked and coerced.</seg>

<seg id="46">Breivik, a right-wing anti-Islamic fanatic now aged 34, is serving Norway's maximum sentence in jail for the attacks, which were aimed at the Labour-led government and its youth wing.</seg>
<seg id="47">At the release of her book, Christensen told reporters it was unclear what caused Anders Breivik to become a killer.</seg>
<seg id="48">She said it was probably a blend of factors including genetics, family background, and social and political influences.</seg>
<seg id="49">Before the attacks, Wenche Breivik believed her son's explanation that he had become interested in hunting when she questioned why he had a rifle and a shotgun in his bedroom.</seg>
<seg id="50">A year after the killings she considered - but did not make - an appeal, to say: 'Dear fellow citizens, he who caused the tragedy also struck me.</seg>
<seg id="51">If I go out, someone will shoot me!</seg>
<seg id="52">I am the saddest mother in the world today.</seg>
<seg id="53">(I) have been terribly sad and cried a lot.</seg>
<seg id="54">In addition to the grief of losing a son the sense of guilt weighs heavily on me.</seg>
<seg id="55">It would be easier to bear if he was dead ... his punishment is also my punishment.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Middle Eastern airline started flying from Adelaide four times a week in November, announcing it would increase flights to daily services soon after.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of the carrier to South Australia gives residents access to one-stop flights to 33 destinations in Europe and more than 125 worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="7">Emirates Vice President Australasia Barry Brown said economy class had been full on most flights since the service began and between 85 and 90 per cent full in the busy months of December and January.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Interest is particularly high as we enter a new era for Emirates with the Qantas partnership proposal, pending government and regulatory approvals," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Premier Jay Weatherill said the daily flights were a boost for business and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="10">The flights will depart Adelaide at 10.35pm daily and takes 13 hours and 10 minutes, arriving in Dubai at 5.15am.</seg>

<seg id="1">Collingwood vs Essendon: 10 things we learnt</seg>
<seg id="2">Essendon claim ANZAC Day honours with massive 46-point win over Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="3">Essendon captain Jobe Watson celebrates a crucial goal in the final quarter of the Anzac Day match against Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="4">ANOTHER year, another epic Essendon and Collingwood Anzac Day clash at the MCG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here's what we found out this time around.</seg>
<seg id="6">Essendon are the real deal</seg>
<seg id="7">Two successful interstate trips against highly-fancied opponents and now a streak-snapping victory against the Pies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Punters were shying away from the Dons in the lead-up to Anzac Day, with the absence of Dustin Fletcher and Paddy Ryder tipped as the difference, with Travis Cloke running riot last week against Richmond.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the Bombers now have the 'D' word - depth - and genuine competition for spots among about a dozen players both in and outside of Thursday's 22.</seg>
<seg id="10">We said this last year (and look what happened), but if the five-from-five Bombers can get past Geelong in a fortnight, they should already be eyeing a top four finish.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mark Robinson: Bombers are here to stay</seg>
<seg id="12">Two games do not a Cloke autumn make</seg>
<seg id="13">Travis Cloke was being whispered about as a source of Buddy-like dominance after two stellar performances in two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the Collingwood forward hurtled back to earth in a big way under that weight of expectation and was well held by Jake Carlisle and his mates.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cloke received plenty of attention but dropped the kind of marks he was clunking last week and kicked just a couple of majors.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's two ordinary showings out of five for the big man.</seg>
<seg id="17">He ain't No.1 yet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Watch Nathan Buckley react to Ben Reid's free kick for pushing Essendon's Tom Bellchambers in the third quarter.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stay out of the weights room</seg>
<seg id="20">It's best not to be too strong, apparently.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two confusing umpiring decisions - both in favour of Essendon - were blights on what was otherwise an enthralling battle.</seg>
<seg id="22">First, Ben Reid turned Tom Bellchambers in a contest deep inside 50, pushed the Bomber in the side and chest and was pinged, resulting in a goal (see Nathan Buckley's reaction above).</seg>
<seg id="23">Then Quinten Lynch was later rolled for muscling Bellchambers out of a ruck contest.</seg>
<seg id="24">Whatever the rulings, they were physical duels that should have been let go.</seg>
<seg id="25">Please explain, ump.</seg>
<seg id="26">Pendles is peeved</seg>
<seg id="27">When you collect 29 possessions and kick two goals - including one from 40m out on your opposite foot - you can pretty much say what you want.</seg>
<seg id="28">But stand-in Collingwood skipper Scott Pendlebury raised more than a few eyebrows when he ripped into his teammates post-game, accusing them of "cheating" by floating downfield in search of cheap kicks.</seg>
<seg id="29">An angry Pendles is a scary Pendles.</seg>
<seg id="30">LiveHQ: Full stats, SuperCoach points and more</seg>
<seg id="31">Carlisle is all he's cracked up to be</seg>
<seg id="32">Could Essendon stop Travis Cloke?</seg>
<seg id="33">Without Fletcher to float across contests with those spindly arms, it was the question on everyone's lips before the bounce.</seg>
<seg id="34">Three hours later, Carlisle had yet another scalp, having spoiled most of Cloke's best chances or spooked him into spilling the rest.</seg>
<seg id="35">Yes, the young defender often had help, but the he could hardly be faulted on another remarkable performance.</seg>
<seg id="36">Goldsack won't be in green for long</seg>
<seg id="37">Can't see Tyson Goldsack being given the sub's vest again.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Pies utility had more influence inside 50 in his quarter-and-a-bit, after coming on for Ben Sinclair, than most of his teammates had in the entire game.</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe it's the headband, maybe it's the red beard...either way, he showed plenty in his eight-possession, two-goal cameo.</seg>
<seg id="40">More than 93,000 people turned up to watch Essendon take on Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Pies and Dons can have their day</seg>
<seg id="42">No team deserves Anzac Day more than any other team, but after Collingwood and Essendon pulled the third-biggest home and away crowd in AFL history yesterday, surely we can end the argument about those sides having the rights to it.</seg>
<seg id="43">They do it well, they fill the MCG every year and the game is almost universally watched on the box by supporters of other clubs.</seg>
<seg id="44">Ron Reed: A salute to James Hird</seg>
<seg id="45">Toovey loss will hurt...</seg>
<seg id="46">Innocuous as it was, Alan Toovey's knee injury will sting the Pies more than they'll care to admit.</seg>
<seg id="47">Already short on defenders who can lock down small forwards, Toovey was one of Collingwood's best before his leg gave way in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="48">With Ben Johnson still to return and Nick Maxwell watching from the sidelines, things are looking very thin down back.</seg>
<seg id="49">Alan Toovey is back on track after doing his knee on Anzac Day last season.</seg>
<seg id="50">9. ...but there is some good news</seg>
<seg id="51">Toovey can take plenty out of Jason Winderlich's performance.</seg>
<seg id="52">Winderlich had 19 disposals and kicked three goals in the Bombers' win, after returning from a horror run of injuries that included rupturing his ACL in 2011 and ripping his hamstring last year.</seg>
<seg id="53">Winderlich was back to his explosive best at the MCG and was among the most influential players on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="54">Alwyn Davey attemps to smother a Quinten Lynch kick on Anzac Day.</seg>
<seg id="55">Alwyn Davey is tiny</seg>
<seg id="56">No earth-shattering revelation there, but it'd be great if his Essendon teammates learned it, too.</seg>
<seg id="57">At least 10 times this season a fellow Bomber has seen Davey one-out against a (much taller) opponent inside 50 and promptly launched a mortar on top of his bonce.</seg>
<seg id="58">Fact: Davey has more chance of winning an arm wrestle against Travis Cloke than he does of outmarking someone overhead.</seg>
<seg id="59">Stop kicking it there.</seg>

<seg id="1">The dream of firecracker traders of doing good business in the firecracker market in the transport area was not realised.</seg>
<seg id="2">The firecracker traders are trapped in a dilemma after the High court's order.</seg>
<seg id="3">Neither can they do business in the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses to do business in the Transport area.</seg>
<seg id="4">After its visit to the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue the commission, appointed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, had declared it unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since no appropriate arrangements were made there, the Deputy commissioner was fined ten lakh Rupees.</seg>
<seg id="6">The High Court strongly criticised the Amritsar administration in its order and questioned the use of such an administration that could not even resolve such a small issue as that of the firecracker traders over a period of the 9 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">No proper place has been allotted to them in the city.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thereafter, they were asked to provide appropriate and safe facilities and to issue the licenses for selling firecrackers in Jahajgarh market itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">After this order the firecracker traders were happy but the police poured cold water on their joy on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The firearm license branch team arrived in the firecracker market and set up a counter selling forms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The necessary terms and conditions involved, could not possibly be met in one day.</seg>
<seg id="12">ASP East Gaurav Garg, Firearms License Branch chief, Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanvind Arun Sharma also went to the firecracker market.</seg>
<seg id="13">They expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.</seg>
<seg id="14">So the licenses were not issued to the firecracker traders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Diwali is just one day away.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this reason the firecracker vendors were worried.</seg>
<seg id="17">The loss of crores of rupees seemed inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said that if they lost a large amount of money they would sue the district administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Billionaire Feels Guilty About Being So Rich</seg>
<seg id="2">Billionaire California financier Bill Gross has apologised for the wealth he has amassed at the expense of workers.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a lengthy blog on the website of his company Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) he labelled fellow tycoons who complain about taxes "Scrooge McDucks" after a Disney character.</seg>
<seg id="4">Calling for tax reform, 69-year-old Mr Gross, ranked 641 in the Forbes list of billionaires, said the top 1% of earners should pay more tax.</seg>
<seg id="5">He writes: "Having gotten rich at the expense of labour, the guilt sets in and I begin to feel sorry for the less well-off, writing very public Investment Outlooks that "dis" the success that provided me the soapbox in the first place."</seg>
<seg id="6">""If your immediate reaction is to nod up and down, then give yourself some points in this intellectual tête-à-tête.""</seg>
<seg id="7">"But, he said, he would ask the "Scrooge McDucks of the world who so vehemently criticise what they consider to be counterproductive, even crippling taxation of the wealthy in the midst of historically high corporate profits and personal income" to think again."</seg>
<seg id="8">""Consider this: Instead of approaching the tax reform argument from the standpoint of what an enormous percentage of the overall income taxes the top 1% pay, consider how much of the national income you've been privileged to make.</seg>
<seg id="9">The headquarters of PIMCO in Newport Beach, California</seg>
<seg id="10">In the United States, the share of total pre-tax income accruing to the top 1% has more than doubled from 10% in the 1970s to 20% today.</seg>
<seg id="11">""Admit that you, and I and others in the magnificent "1%" grew up in a gilded age of credit, where those who borrowed money or charged fees on expanding financial assets had a much better chance of making it to the big tent than those who used their hands for a living.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, I know many of you money people worked hard as did I, and you survived and prospered where others did not.</seg>
<seg id="13">""A fair economic system should always allow for an opportunity to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Smoke that cigar, enjoy that Chateau Lafite 1989.</seg>
<seg id="16">But (mostly you guys) acknowledge your good fortune at having been born in the '40s, '50s or '60s ... and having had the privilege of riding a credit wave and a credit boom for the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="17">He continued: "If you're in the privileged 1%, you should be paddling right alongside (Scrooge McDuck) and willing to support higher taxes on carried interest, and certainly capital gains readjusted to existing marginal income tax rates."</seg>
<seg id="18">After referring to fellow US billionaires Stanley Druckenmiller and Warren Buffett who have recently mooted similar proposals, he said: "The era of taxing "capital" at lower rates than "labour" should now end."</seg>

<seg id="1">Killing mosquitoes to prevent diseases like dengue, malaria and filariasis is going to be expensive.</seg>
<seg id="2">The state government is proceeding to raise the tax on mosquito killing repellents, mats and liquids by up to three times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The proposal to increase tax will be presented to the cabinet soon.</seg>
<seg id="4">The government is struggling with a financial crisis these days and is searching for ways to do everything possible to increase revenue.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is noteworthy that, to improve the financial health of the government, a resource committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Urban Development Minister, Mohamed Azam Khan.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to sources, in a recently held resource committee meeting many proposals to increase the tax were rejected if the general public would be directly affected.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the committee has given the green flag to increase the taxes on mosquito repellents, coils, mats and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="8">A proposal to triple the taxes has been put forward.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently they carry 4% VAT plus an additional 1% tax.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now a 12.5% VAT plus a 1.5% additional tax on these items is proposed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government is likely to generate additional revenue of around Rs 14 crore in this way.</seg>
<seg id="12">A proposal for a tax hike on the persimmon leaf was rejected: In fact, to increase the revenue income the commercial tax department was in favour of increasing the tax on the persimmon leaf by 14%, but the Financial Resources Committee has rejected that proposal.</seg>
<seg id="13">The committee believes that persimmon leaf is used to make bidis that the lower-class people smoke.</seg>
<seg id="14">Similarly, the committee rejected the proposal to increase taxes on transmission wires, etc., and electrical goods that would have pushed up the cost of electricity and would have a direct impact on the general public.</seg>
<seg id="15">The committee also rejected the proposal for the application of a green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="4">In addition, RBS is speeding up the disposal of its US banking arm, Citizens, with a partial stock market listing planned for next year, with a full divestment expected by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chief executive Ross McEwan said: "RBS has made a lot of progress since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="6">As ever with any long and difficult job, a degree of weariness and even defensiveness has crept in.</seg>
<seg id="7">We have got to move on as a company.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bar has been set at a higher level for RBS than for other UK banks because we were rescued at the public's expense.</seg>
<seg id="9">Operating profits at the group, which is 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer, slumped to £438m for the third quarter, down from £931m a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, costs including an additional £250m provision for payment protection insurance (PPI) compensation pushed RBS to a statutory pre-tax loss of £634m, and the group warned of more red ink to come.</seg>
<seg id="11">It said: "In light of the new strategy to deal with our high-risk assets we expect a significant increase in impairments in the fourth quarter, which is likely to result in the group reporting a substantial loss for the full year."</seg>

<seg id="1">Simon Hart: Dutch courage of Arsenal kid tearing it up at Dagenham</seg>
<seg id="2">Arsenal supporters with a love of Sixties music may be aware that the No 1 hit record "Telstar" was produced in a flat on the Holloway Road, a short distance from where the Emirates Stadium stands today.</seg>
<seg id="3">That piece of pop trivia means nothing to Rhys Murphy but the name Telstar certainly does - it is where the former Arsenal reserve began rebuilding his career a long way from north London.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Telstar in question is a Second Division Dutch team based in the North Sea port of Ijmuiden and it was there that Murphy, the leading scorer in League Two with Dagenham & Redbridge, spent last season, having finally severed his ties with the club which nurtured his talent from the age of 13.</seg>
<seg id="5">Murphy, 22, went there with one simple wish - to play football.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to XPro, the former players' charity, just two per cent of footballers who sign for a club as professionals are still playing beyond the age of 21.</seg>
<seg id="7">The number still in league football from his 2009 Arsenal FA Youth Cup-winning squad is much healthier, though Murphy - who got no closer to the first team than a place on the bench for a pre-season friendly - still had to go abroad to kick-start his career.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was always aware that Arsenal is such a big club and if it doesn't work there then you will have to take a step back," he reflects.</seg>
<seg id="9">That was the main thing for me - I needed to go somewhere where I was going to be playing football regularly, and get any doubt out of any managers' minds as to whether I was injury-prone.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is referring to the broken leg and hamstring trouble which had hindered his progress at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="11">Loans at Brentford and Preston had not helped much either, providing just one league start each.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over at Telstar, though, the Irish Under-21 international made 28 appearances - with 17 starts - and hit eight goals, his first in senior football.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I started in the central role and then was playing more of a winger," he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">They play 4-3-3 over there.</seg>
<seg id="15">It helped me learn playing in different positions.</seg>
<seg id="16">The standard was mixed but the football "a bit more technical."</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet when Telstar ran into financial troubles at the season's end, Murphy was on the move again.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Eight of us had to leave to get off the wage bill," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="19">I agreed to cancel my second year, which left me as a free agent.</seg>
<seg id="20">A nervy summer followed.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The number of players out of contract with no club in pre-season is frightening," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="22">A trial with Aberdeen came to nothing, but fortunately the chance arrived with Dagenham & Redbridge.</seg>
<seg id="23">The homely Essex club is a different word from the "little bubble" of life at Arsenal - where he was a youth-team colleague of Jack Wilshere and trained with the likes of Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie - but they have given him his chance and he is repaying them.</seg>
<seg id="24">Wayne Burnett's side escaped relegation by goal difference in April but now sit one place off the play-off spots, with the help of Murphy's eight goals - the most recent in last Saturday's win over second-placed Rochdale - as well as contributions from two other Arsenal alumni, Gavin Hoyte and Abu Ogogo, and Zavon Hines, once of West Ham.</seg>
<seg id="25">The reason for his own good form is - unlike the original Telstar satellite which inspired the name of both a pop record and a football club - hardly rocket science.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It is so hard to get your form going when you're in, out, in, out," Murphy says.</seg>
<seg id="27">Playing every week helps so much - you feel fitter, you feel better.</seg>
<seg id="28">I'm scoring goals and I'm feeling good.</seg>
<seg id="29">I am happy to be playing at Dagenham and grateful for the opportunity and hope I can do well enough to start pushing up the Football League when the time is right.</seg>

<seg id="1">A stand-off between poverty and power</seg>
<seg id="2">Opposition: "NTPC Go Back" is sprayed on a village in the Karanpura Valley, where plans to mine will displace more than 8000 families.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Ben Doherty</seg>
<seg id="4">In the main street of Pakri Barwadih, the mud-brick homes are daubed with a neat graffito: "NTPC Go Back."</seg>
<seg id="5">NTPC is the government-owned company that wants to mine the rich seam of coal beneath this village in India's second poorest state.</seg>
<seg id="6">The three mines slated for this valley will consume this and 16 other villages, forcing more than 8000 families from their homes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Pakri Barwadih mine in the eastern state of Jharkhand is to be built and run by Thiess, a subsidiary of Australian company Leighton Holdings, in a controversial joint venture with a company owned by the family of India's former coal minister.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Our lives are in this land": Dev Prasad will refuse all offers of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the chai stalls and the village markets, discussion rarely strays from the ore underfoot: who has been charged for resisting the miners; the spectre of armed militants threatening those who protest; and the death of one demonstrator, shot by police, for trying to stop a site office being built in his village.</seg>
<seg id="10">People debate what will become of their land, their livelihoods, and of them.</seg>
<seg id="11">The battle over mining Karanpura Valley, for so long an unhappy undercurrent, has become a roiling rage.</seg>
<seg id="12">In July, as Dr Mithilesh Dangi addressed a community protest in the nearby village of Kushumbha, three men carrying AK47s violently broke up the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="13">They were members of an ultra-left militant gang, the JPC.</seg>
<seg id="14">Founded decades ago as communist insurgencies, the groups, known as Naxals, are politically impotent now, reduced to little more than criminal guns for hire and are common throughout India's lawless eastern "red corridor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"They forced my wife and I, and my colleague Arun into the forest," Dangi said."</seg>
<seg id="16">""They pointed their guns in my face and told me not to interfere with the work of the mining companies."</seg>
<seg id="17">They said they would harm us if we continued to halt the work of Thiess and Deco [a Thiess subcontractor] in the area.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is not known at whose, if anybody's, instruction, the gunmen were acting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But villagers, who ultimately freed Dangi, confirmed the story.</seg>
<seg id="20">The same gunmen had threatened previous protests.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thiess maintains it is uninvolved: "All land access issues are the responsibility of the mine owner."</seg>
<seg id="22">Dev Prasad has known for 10 years that the government wants his land for mining.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thiess's mine will displace 200 families from his village of Kerigada.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prasad will appear in court soon on what he claims is a trumped-up charge of damaging government property, levelled at him for leading protests against the acquisition of his land.</seg>
<seg id="25">He faces fines he can't pay, or jail, but says he can only concern himself with the rice harvest he will bring in in a month.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prasad's land, like others in the lush Karanpura Valley, is unusual in this state.</seg>
<seg id="27">Jharkhand is prone to severe, long-running droughts.</seg>
<seg id="28">About 40 per cent of the state's population lives below the poverty line, and half the children under three are malnourished.</seg>
<seg id="29">But in the Karanpura Valley rains are regular.</seg>
<seg id="30">Prasad's family has worked this land, "my entire ancestry, 15 or 20 generations."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I don't know how long," and he says he will refuse all offers of compensation for it.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact the compensation offered for his acre has been raised (by 50 per cent to $25,000) is evidence, he says, that those offering don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="33">If it was only me, I could take the money and live for the few years at the end of my life.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I have to hand this land on to my children and grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I lose this land they will have nothing.</seg>
<seg id="36">""Our lives are in this land.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without it, who are we?</seg>
<seg id="38">It is not just a house to live in, it is our way of life, our history.</seg>
<seg id="39">I am a farmer.</seg>
<seg id="40">My father passed this land to me and I must pass it to my son.</seg>
<seg id="41">I cannot fail where my ancestors succeeded.""</seg>
<seg id="42">The stand-off in Pakri Barwadih is one being played out across India.</seg>
<seg id="43">The country craves power.</seg>
<seg id="44">Already, demand often outstrips supply by 10 per cent, and more than 400 million Indians live without any electricity at all.</seg>
<seg id="45">Nuclear is slow, costly and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="46">India needs coal.</seg>
<seg id="47">But there is also a growing awareness of the rights of the rural poor and an increasing resistance to the forcible, often uncompensated, land grabs by governments and corporations that have been historically common.</seg>
<seg id="48">India's massive coal reserves are hugely underdeveloped, at enormous cost to its economy, because in a country of 1.2 billion people, the land on top of any potential mine is almost always someone's home.</seg>
<seg id="49">Government-run companies like NTPC, and the private contractors they hire, such as Thiess, are caught in the middle of the struggle between progress and protection.</seg>
<seg id="50">They face intense, often contradictory, pressures.</seg>
<seg id="51">"NTPC was awarded the contract to mine Pakri Barwadih in 2004 but not one tonne of coal has been mined, and the government has threatened to take the licence back, alleging NTPC has "repeatedly failed to keep its promises.""</seg>
<seg id="52">But Development Minister Jairam Ramesh last month warned mining companies against forcing people from their land, saying it fuelled outlaw groups.</seg>
<seg id="53">""This is a sad truth ... that more displacement has been caused by government and public sector projects, particularly in Naxal areas.</seg>
<seg id="54">And this is why Naxalism has grown.</seg>
<seg id="55">Companies must learn to be sensitive, changing aspirations," he said.</seg>
<seg id="56">NTPC will face a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="57">If there is firing in an NTPC project and people get killed in that firing, they cannot acquire the land.</seg>
<seg id="58">Indian companies still believe that they can use government to forcibly acquire land.</seg>
<seg id="59">That era is gone.</seg>
<seg id="60">He was referring to 55-year-old Tarkesh Mahato, who was shot dead in July as he protested against an NTPC mine site office being built in his village of Pagar.</seg>
<seg id="61">Six other men were injured by gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="62">Mahato's protest related to the planned Keredari mine, neighbouring Pakri Barwadih and also run by NTPC.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no evidence Thiess is contracted to work on that mine.</seg>
<seg id="64">At a village meeting in Pagar attended by Fairfax this week, Tarkesh's widow, Mano Mosuma, said her family faced destitution.</seg>
<seg id="65">"We are facing a hard time, everything is a problem now," she said, weeping.</seg>
<seg id="66">"We want justice," her eldest son, Tilak, said.""</seg>
<seg id="67">Take away the coal block.</seg>
<seg id="68">I will definitely not let them take my land.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fairfax visited Thiess Minecs offices in Barkagaon and Hazaribagh, but was directed to Thiess Australia's Brisbane headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="70">"All issues regarding land access are the responsibility of the mine owner," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="71">Thiess Minecs has not yet commenced mining work at the site and, while land negotiations continue, Thiess Minecs has been working to ensure the welfare of the community.</seg>
<seg id="72">Thiess said it had established a healthcare centre and a training centre for local youth "to help them gain employment at the mine."</seg>
<seg id="73">Once established, the Pakri Barwadih project will provide direct and or indirect employment to thousands of people in one of India's poorest regions.</seg>
<seg id="74">It will have flow-on benefits to the entire community including local schools, training institutes, hospitals and other public infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Claiming to be a trading firm the accused opened accounts for investors and in the name of selling and purchasing shares, committed fraud.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is possibly the first time in the state that this type of fraud, worth crores of rupees, has been discovered and exposed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police have not yet been able to catch the leader of the gang, but the police have detained seven people including the accused, after examining his work in the state.</seg>
<seg id="4">This gang ran a fictitious commodity market named Metatrader-5.</seg>
<seg id="5">Company executives used to take cash from investors and with the help of bogus software used to create fake IDs.</seg>
<seg id="6">With these, the accused could see the shares the investors were buying.</seg>
<seg id="7">They also used to known which shares were being purchased and at what price.</seg>
<seg id="8">In reality no shares were purchased, nor any transactions carried out, because no DEMAT account was opened for the investors and share prices were falsely displayed in the fictitious software.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police estimate that hundreds of people had been defrauded by the gang.</seg>
<seg id="10">Every investor was asked to invest from two to five lakhs to get good returns.</seg>
<seg id="11">The main suspect, Amit Soni, was detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while his six associates were arrested in Indore.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the cyber cell ADG, Ashok Dohare, every stock trading company has to join the Stock Exchange as a trading firm.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only after that can the company can get investors to do stock trading through them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the investor's DEMAT account is opened, so that the stock can be traded, but this company MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange, nor was carrying out any stock trading.</seg>
<seg id="15">This company purchased a server on 24th September 2012 under the name of Wintrade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since then this company has been defrauding people with fake investments.</seg>
<seg id="17">So far, eight traders from Indore have come forward with complaints to the cyber cell.</seg>

<seg id="21">This price was set by the accused themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Doubts emerge over troika's return to Greece amid budget hole</seg>
<seg id="2">By Martin Santa and Jan Strupczewski</seg>
<seg id="3">BRUSSELS (Reuters) - International inspectors are set to put on hold a trip to Athens because they have been unable to bridge differences with Greece over how to close a 2 billion-euro ($2.7 billion) hole in its 2014 budget, euro zone officials said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Athens however denied there had been any changes to the inspectors' scheduled return early next week, and Greece's finance minister said the officials had asked for a meeting on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">A team of officials from the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank - known as the Troika - visits Athens regularly to check progress on its bailout commitments and decide whether to release the next tranche of loans.</seg>
<seg id="6">"There are growing differences between Athens and the Troika," one euro zone official said, adding that the planned trip was, for now, on ice.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Greeks are saying: 'We are doing enough', and the Troika says they need new steps to close the budget," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Carlos Martin Ruiz de Gordejuela, the European Commission's spokesman in Athens, said: "The Troika will be in a position to resume the review mission in Athens once sufficient information has been received from the Greek authorities to permit us to hold meaningful policy discussions in person."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said if this happened, a return in early November would be feasible.</seg>
<seg id="10">The latest bailout inspection began in September before being paused and was initially expected to resume in end-October and then slated for resumption on November4.</seg>
<seg id="11">They have asked for an appointment on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="12">What else can I say?</seg>
<seg id="13">Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras told reporters in Athens after meeting Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greece has been kept afloat by a financial lifeline from the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund since 2010, with 240 billion euros ($330.5 billion) of loans pledged in exchange for spending cuts and reforms.</seg>
<seg id="15">After a six-year recession that wiped out 40 percent of household disposable incomes and sent unemployment soaring to almost 28 percent, Greeks are saying they can take no more.</seg>
<seg id="16">The coalition government argues it deserves some slack after delivering the biggest budget deficit reduction ever recorded in the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="17">Greece's president said bluntly his country would not yield to pressure from foreign lenders to impose more austerity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"No one is going because no one wants them (the Troika) there," a second euro zone official said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stournaras has rejected any new tax increases or across-the-board wage or pension cuts but said there was instead scope for "targeted" spending cuts and "structural measures" to plug any fiscal gaps.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since the decision was made in mid-2012, by EU leaders led by Germany, that Greece must remain part of the euro zone, the assumption has been that any disagreements will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Troika is talking about 2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="22">Greece is talking about closing all of that through better control of social security contributions.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They say no more measures," a senior euro zone official said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The solution is new measures.</seg>
<seg id="25">It will of course happen.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is a matter of miscommunication to their own public.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first euro zone official said there was still time to sort things out because Greece would only really need the money from the next tranche of loans in February.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to one source close to the talks, the Troika has yet to be convinced that Athens can deliver on a series of reforms it had promised to implement by end-September.</seg>
<seg id="29">It needs to complete these so-called "prior actions" to qualify for its next scheduled bailout installment of over 1 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="30">Greece and its lenders are particularly at odds over the future of LARCO, Hellenic Vehicle Industry and Hellenic Defence Systems, three loss-making state companies with 2,100 workers which cost taxpayers about 150 million euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The government has yet to prepare its two biggest water companies, EYDAP (EYDr.AT) and Thessaloniki Water (TWSr.AT), for privatization by settling all the arrears that municipalities owe them.</seg>
<seg id="32">And it must also convince lenders it will meet a target to put 12,500 civil servants in a so-called "mobility scheme" of forced transfers or dismissals and fire another 4,000 by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="33">The target for Athens is a primary surplus of 1.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for next year.</seg>
<seg id="34">The government believes it could fall short by just 500 million euros, rather than the 2 billion predicted by the Troika.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Greek parliament's budget office, whose role is largely advisory and whose opinion is not binding, said in a report on Thursday: "It remains open whether Greece next year will achieve a 'primary budget surplus', such as the one agreed in the medium-term bailout plan."</seg>
<seg id="36">Greek authorities say a growing economy is the only way to reduce the country's debt, which stands at about 320 billion euros or 175 percent of its GDP.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Troika holds almost 80 percent of that debt. ($1 = 0.7262 euros)</seg>

<seg id="1">Band-to-Sleeve Conversion Offers More than Weight Loss, It Restores Hope -- LOS ANGELES, Oct.</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Many obese patients have successfully had the lap band surgery in Los Angeles with Dr. Michael Feiz, an operation which involves implanting an adjustable silicone gastric band to restrict the capacity of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Dr. Feiz has had tremendous success with his lap band patients, some patients do not lose optimal weight with the lap band or experience negative side effects.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dr. Feiz is an excellent choice for revision weight loss surgery for patients unhappy with the lap band because of complications or insufficient weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="5">Most often, these operations convert the lap band into a gastric sleeve, also called sleeve gastrectomy.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the vast majority of bariatric surgery patients lose more than half of their excess body weight in the years following their procedure, a minority experience setbacks in their weight loss progress.</seg>
<seg id="7">Furthermore, some patients have unpleasant side effects as a result of improperly performed lap band surgery, which is of course out of the patient's control.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of these potential side effects include difficulty swallowing, pain at the site of the port (where fluid is added or removed from the lap band device), frequent vomiting, and nausea.</seg>
<seg id="9">When these problems occur, patients shouldn't simply give up on weight loss and remove the lap band, says Dr. Feiz.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, thousands of patients have had revision or corrective weight loss surgery to continue down the path of a healthier, happier life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Converting the lap band to a gastric sleeve involves removal of the lap band device and then starting the sleeve gastrectomy, all performed through laparoscope by Dr. Feiz.</seg>
<seg id="12">During this procedure, 85 percent of the stomach is removed, and the remaining portion is stapled off and fashioned into a sleeve-like shape.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patients lose weight effectively because the stomach's capacity is reduced and the portion of the stomach secreting the hunger-causing ghrelin hormone is drastically reduced.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result is that patients feel full more quickly and experience virtually no cravings.</seg>
<seg id="15">Secondary bariatric surgery is often highly complex, as scar tissue or adhesions formed from the original operation can make the surgery more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's why it's important to find a surgeon who is adept at performing revision weight loss surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researching the physician's credentials, experience and standing with the medical board is of the utmost importance to help reduce risks from surgical complications and maximize weight loss results.</seg>
<seg id="18">What's more, the approach Dr. Feiz takes with his revision weight loss isn't simply providing the surgery and never seeing the patient again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dr. Feiz and his team of medical experts combine bariatric, nutritional and psychological health components to patients through their fight against morbid obesity.</seg>

<seg id="1">New research has revealed that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning hours.</seg>
<seg id="2">Thoughts of lying to anyone and theft or cheating someone do not enter our heads.</seg>
<seg id="3">But as the evening comes, our minds change and we set aside our principles and we go against the accepted norms.</seg>
<seg id="4">In research carried out by Harvard University and the David Axle School of Business, Utah, researchers have revealed some interesting facts.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to researchers, while we don't have work pressure in the morning we attach importance to moral values, but as the evening sets in, due to fatigue or extra pressure our honesty declines.</seg>
<seg id="6">To test this researchers did two experiments.</seg>
<seg id="7">They asked some subjects to count the number of dots on a computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, subjects had to say if the dots were more on the right or left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="9">Participants were then told that if they give the wrong answer rather than the correct answer they would be given money.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experiment shows that those who took part in the experiment in the morning between 8 and 12 did not make any mistakes and they gave the correct answers.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, those who took part in the experiment between 12 noon and 6pm set aside their morals and intentionally gave wrong answers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Researchers have succeeded in proving that in the morning the greed for money does not affect our honesty, but in the evening we chose to ignore morality.</seg>
<seg id="13">The research is published in the current issue of Psychological Science.</seg>

<seg id="2">The guts of the 12-foot-long B61 nuclear bomb</seg>
<seg id="3">Weighing the utility of nuclear weapons has always been more theology than science.</seg>
<seg id="4">That was made clear again Tuesday when the House Armed Services Committee's strategic forces subcommittee poked into the need to spend $10 billion or more improving the Pentagon's existing arsenal of B61 nuclear bombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The advocates of a reliable, potent and fresh nuclear deterrent argue that investing in a retooled B61 is a good use of scarce taxpayer dollars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those less inclined to spend money on nuclear weapons no one ever wants to see used suggest newer B83s can do the job for at least the next decade.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are the only two bomber-dropped gravity bombs left in the U.S. atomic arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not surprisingly, the representatives from the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, which builds the nation's nukes, support the modernization plan.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This B61 weapon arms the B-2," Air Force General Robert Kehler, chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, said.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will arm the future long-range strike platform.</seg>
<seg id="11">It arms the current dual-capable aircraft that are forward stationed in Europe as well as those of our NATO allies that maintain dual-capable aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it's the candidate weapon to arm the F-35 in that dual-capable aircraft role.</seg>
<seg id="13">The B83 won't do, Kehler said.</seg>
<seg id="14">It doesn't work with as many kinds of aircraft, and frankly, it's just too destructive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It has a very high yield," he said, referring to the size of the explosion it would create.</seg>
<seg id="16">And we are trying to pursue weapons that actually are reducing in yield because we're concerned about maintaining weapons that would have less collateral effect if the President ever had to use them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kehler acknowledged fretting about collateral damage in a nuclear war sounds strange.</seg>
<seg id="18">"However, there is a direct relationship between yield and collateral damage," he added.</seg>
<seg id="19">Without getting too Strangelovian here...the [B83] weapon is not as flexible as the B61...in terms of our ability to use various yields that would be matched to the targets.</seg>
<seg id="20">The B83, truth be told, is a city-destroyer.</seg>
<seg id="21">First detonated in 1984, its yield (adjustable, but about a megaton) is 75 times that of the "Little Boy" that destroyed Hiroshima.</seg>
<seg id="22">The B61 also sports an adjustable yield, but it ranges from a much more modest 0.3 to 340 kilotons, no more that a third of the B83′s punch.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the nuclear realm, that makes it more of a threat - because of its smaller yield, it is more likely to be used - and consequently generates more deterrence.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kehler said the nation needs an improved B61 to bolster the chances that it will never be detonated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The ultimate objective of the nuclear deterrent is to make sure that the weapons are never used.</seg>
<seg id="26">"And yet, we use them every day to do that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's almost counterintuitive from people who aren't informed, but we use those weapons every single day.</seg>

<seg id="1">Video: Anger as driver eats bowl of cereal</seg>
<seg id="2">A DRIVER has been branded "stupid" after being caught on video in central Edinburgh eating a bowl of cereal while driving to work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The remarkable footage captured on a cyclist's headcam shows the motorist overtaking cyclists at 30mph near the Meadows while apparently trying to use a spoon to eat his breakfast cereal with milk.</seg>
<seg id="4">The rider, who goes by the name of "Raging Bike," can be heard yelling as the grey Vauxhall Corsa whizzes past.</seg>
<seg id="5">The motorist is glimpsed using one hand to hold the bowl and steer the car.</seg>
<seg id="6">Raging Bike then catches up with the driver at a set of traffic lights where the motorist can be seen tilting the bowl to get the last remaining morsels before putting the dish on the passenger seat and taking off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The minute-long video has been posted on YouTube under the title "Breakfast at 35mph . . . look no hands."</seg>
<seg id="8">Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at The Royal Society of the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: "This driver is being irresponsible and risking his own life and the lives of people around him, especially the cyclists he is overtaking."</seg>
<seg id="9">Trying to hold and eat from a bowl while driving is a particularly stupid and dangerous thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="10">Drivers who eat or drink at the wheel can be prosecuted for not being in proper control of a vehicle, or for careless or dangerous driving, and if someone dies they can be charged with causing death by careless or dangerous driving.</seg>
<seg id="11">Motorists caught eating behind the wheel in Scotland can be penalised with a hefty fine of £90 and penalised three points on their licence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Avid cyclist and Green councillor Gavin Corbett urged motorists to hop on a bike at least once to experience the risks posed by irresponsible drivers for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said: "I'd hope that drivers would pay attention to the road simply because that is what is safe, not because they are being filmed."</seg>
<seg id="14">As a pedestrian, cyclist and occasional driver I see, every single day, examples of drivers treating being behind the wheel as an extension of the office, breakfast table or bedroom - phoning, unwrapping food or checking appearance, with little heed to the fact that they're only inches from collision or tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's the sheer banality of it that's most striking.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ian Maxwell, from cycling campaign group Spokes, said cyclists who captured illegal behaviour on headcams should avoid on-road confrontations for their own safety and instead send the footage directly to Police Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said: "Whether it's texting or eating breakfast, the message should be it's just not on."</seg>
<seg id="18">You're at the wheel of a piece of machinery that can harm other people.</seg>
<seg id="19">The story comes on the heels of the Edinburgh Evening News coverage of the lethal tram tracks at Haymarket station, where cyclists have regularly been caught in the line and thrown in front of moving traffic.</seg>

<seg id="1">What the Chefs Daniel Patterson and Gabrielle Hamilton Talk About at Dinner: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">On a recent wet evening, Daniel Patterson, the chef of the two-Michelin-star San Francisco restaurant Coi, showed up at the 92nd Street Y to be interviewed by his old friend Gabrielle Hamilton, the chef of the cozy, rib-sticking East Village restaurant Prune.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patterson was there to discuss his new book, "Coi: Stories and Recipes," an ode to the restaurant, to Northern California, and to the eleven-course tasting menu.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love the way they flow, the elegance of form, the element of surprise," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Within haute cuisine, they allow for the highest level of expression.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I'm done with tasting menus," said Hamilton, a few minutes in.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That's like saying, "You can write a perfectly good short story, why would you ever write a novel?," " Patterson pounced.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We're arguing!" crowed Hamilton, then gestured to the event organizers.</seg>
<seg id="9">I told them there would be arguing.</seg>
<seg id="10">The two made an unlikely pair.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamilton, forty-seven, is known for her memoir, "Blood, Bones & Butter," a rollicking, intensely honest story that includes her early-career drug use, her lesbianism, her troubled marriage to an Italian doctor who needed a green card, and, on the plus side, the opening of her now-beloved restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="12">Patterson, forty-five, known for his perfectly executed dishes, which are often plated with tweezers, was fresh off a plane on one leg of a many-legged book tour.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trim, ascetic, and measured in both movement and judgment, he seemed both there and not there - as if he were sitting just six inches to the left of himself and observing his own being.</seg>
<seg id="14">Patterson has written a new kind of cookbook.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its three hundred and three pages follow a loose format - one page with a story and a through-written recipe with no measurements and, on the facing page, a striking photo of the dish.</seg>
<seg id="16">The writing, like his food, is precise, beautiful, and a bit meditative.</seg>
<seg id="17">Take his mini-treatise on seasoning:</seg>
<seg id="18">When you're in the kitchen tasting, think about the aftertaste.</seg>
<seg id="19">If it seems to fade, to just drop away on the finish, that usually means that there's not enough salt ....</seg>
<seg id="20">If the salt is a tiny bit high, a few drops of lemon juice can bring it down.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the acidity is high, it could need a little more sweetness.</seg>
<seg id="22">A few grains of salt here or a drop of vinegar there, those are the kinds of little adjustments that make good food great.</seg>
<seg id="23">Six months of culinary school distilled into one lovely paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="24">While Hamilton's cooking is also precise, to say that Patterson's restaurant is just as approachable as hers is like saying that his lichen-crusted beef - step one: scrape lichen off of trees in a forest - would make a perfect weeknight dinner.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Hamilton writes in her book, of the beginning days of Prune, "There would be no foam and no "conceptual" or "intellectual" food; just the salty, sweet, starchy, brothy, crispy things that one craves when one is actually hungry."</seg>
<seg id="26">Patterson calls it squab; she calls it pigeon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patterson not only runs four establishments in the Bay Area but also frequently travels the world to speak at food symposiums and meet up with an unofficial culinary boys" club that includes Ferran Adrià, David Chang, and Rene Redzepi.</seg>
<seg id="28">He told the room of about fifty attendees that, by necessity, he'd written the book in six months and edited it in three.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Once, on a ten-hour flight from San Francisco to Monaco, I wrote fifteen thousand words," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">At least two audience members scribbled down long division on the back of a flyer that had been placed on each seat.</seg>
<seg id="31">That translated to approximately six double-spaced pages an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">There was a long beat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Were you taking performance-enhancing drugs?</seg>
<seg id="34">Hamilton asked.</seg>
<seg id="35">A few attendees giggled.</seg>
<seg id="36">Patterson smiled thinly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the course of the hour-long talk, the two discussed the writing process, their trouble finding good line cooks, and the restaurateur Joe Bastianich, who claimed to have invented the everything bagel in his memoir, "Restaurant Man."</seg>
<seg id="38">"I fucking love that!" said Hamilton.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'm claiming eggs at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="40">I did that.</seg>
<seg id="41">"What are you going to "Joe Bastinaich"?"</seg>
<seg id="42">I'm making it a verb.</seg>
<seg id="43">I'm thinking brain mayo.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Brainaise," Patterson offered, quietly.</seg>
<seg id="45">He dodged the question until finally he asked, "Can I claim having a two-Michelin-star restaurant next to a strip club?"</seg>
<seg id="46">Coi is located in a seedy part of the North Beach neighborhood, just up the street from City Lights Books.</seg>
<seg id="47">Hamilton approved.</seg>
<seg id="48">A half hour later, the two chefs crammed into a tiny table at Sushi of Gari, on Seventy-eighth street.</seg>
<seg id="49">The waiter offered an omakase menu, a tasting menu of sorts.</seg>
<seg id="50">Unsurprisingly, Patterson voted yes and, surprisingly, so did Hamilton.</seg>
<seg id="51">The first plate included a few pieces of intensely cold, crunchy celery.</seg>
<seg id="52">Hamilton asked the waiter how it was made, and retrieved a pen and a pink notebook from her bag.</seg>
<seg id="53">"It's pickled celery," the waiter said, unhelpfully.</seg>
<seg id="54">Patterson stepped in: "It's rice-wine vinegar and salt."</seg>
<seg id="55">I think it's a pour-over, because I could feel just a little softening.</seg>
<seg id="56">Hamilton nodded and scribbled something in her notebook.</seg>
<seg id="57">The subject turned to the international culinary symposiums that Patterson attends, which often tackle lofty topics, like authenticity and the food system.</seg>
<seg id="58">"I don't like talking about food beyond "I'm hungry and I want something delicious to eat," " said Hamilton, popping a piece of salmon sushi into her mouth.</seg>
<seg id="59">To the delight of both chefs, the waiter, with gravitas, had described it as "salmon with sautéed tomato and a little onion saying "hello" from the side."</seg>
<seg id="60">That's such a cop out!</seg>
<seg id="61">Patterson retorted.</seg>
<seg id="62">He noted the ideas, collaboration, and deep friendships that came out of the symposiums, and out of the culinary retreats, called Cook it Raw, that the boys" club takes to remote places, like Lapland, where they cook together, bond, and share ideas.</seg>
<seg id="63">I so want to get an invite!</seg>
<seg id="64">Hamilton said.</seg>
<seg id="65">"One dish I made was out over this open fire, and I wanted to work with beets," Patterson recalled, picking up a piece of ebi sushi with his hands.</seg>
<seg id="66">He cooked the beets slowly for six hours, moving them around the fire every twenty minutes or so, giving the root a super-sweet, juicy, quality.</seg>
<seg id="67">"So I made this sauce with beet juice and thickened it with reindeer blood," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="68">"Because it's the same color, right, of course," Hamilton interjected, laughing.</seg>
<seg id="69">As the final dish came out, the topic returned to the tasting menu.</seg>
<seg id="70">"It's just that I don't want to go to an hors-d'oeuvres party for four hours," said Hamilton.</seg>
<seg id="71">But certain content only comes in certain formats!</seg>
<seg id="72">As they waited for the check, Hamilton picked up the book, which she'd brought after the talk, and started flipping through.</seg>
<seg id="73">It's just so beautiful, though.</seg>
<seg id="74">It really made me want to come to Coi.</seg>
<seg id="75">Wait, she was anti-tasting menu but had not yet tasted Patterson's raison d"être?</seg>
<seg id="76">"I know, I know," she said, taking in an overhead shot of chilled, spiced ratatouille soup that looked like a painting, three swirls of color - beige, red, and yellow - zipping around a mound of perfectly cubed vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="77">"O.K. Yours is the only tasting menu I will eat," she relented.</seg>
<seg id="78">Patterson smiled.</seg>
<seg id="79">Then they paid the check and headed out onto the wet streets, in search of Negronis.</seg>

<seg id="2">NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York-based Ziff Brothers Investments plans to gradually shut down its U.S. hedge fund, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of the fund's top people are expected to be given proceeds to start their own independent firms, the report said, citing people familiar with the firm.</seg>
<seg id="4">Other money could be shifted to Ziff Brothers Investments' internal hedge fund based in London, or to external hedge-fund managers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The closure of the U.S. fund is tied to the planned retirement of its head portfolio manager, Ian McKinnon, in 2015, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="6">McKinnon, 46 years old, had held the post since 1999.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ziff brothers, Dirk, Robert and Daniel, set up their family office in 1992, after the $1.4 billion sale by their father, William Ziff Jr., of his Ziff-Davis publishing empire.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ziff Brothers Investments reinvested the proceeds in various securities including equities, debt, real estate, commodities, private equity and hedge funds.</seg>
<seg id="9">The firm also had a 10 percent stake in Och-Ziff Capital Management, which it has been reducing, the report said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Google unveils Android KitKat operating system</seg>
<seg id="2">Google Inc on Thursday unveiled the newest version of its Android smartphone software, aiming to allow more smartphone users access to its evolving menu of online services such as driving directions voice-activated search.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new "KitKat" version of Android will be able to run on inexpensive, low-end smartphones as well as the most advanced devices, Sundar Pichai, Google Senior Vice President of Android, Chrome and Apps said at a press event in San Francisco on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Now you have one version of the operating system which will run across all versions of Android smartphones," Pichai said, noting that smartphones sold in "emerging markets" often come loaded with older versions of Android, that lack many key features and capabilities.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move could help Google ensure that more users have access to the growing selection of profitable online services.</seg>
<seg id="6">It also could make the Android software more attractive to third-party app developers, who have been frustrated by what they call the "fragmented" nature of Android devices.</seg>
<seg id="7">Google's Android software runs on 80 percent of the world's smartphones, according to industry analysts.</seg>
<seg id="8">But many of the Android devices sold use older versions of the software, which are not compatible with many new features.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many developers still build apps intended for Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad first, said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You want your users to be using your services, and KitKat will help foster that," said Gillis.</seg>
<seg id="11">Roughly 29 percent of the Android smartphones in operation as of Oct.</seg>
<seg id="12">2 feature the "Gingerbread" version of the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Introduced in December 2010, that version of Android relies on an older Web browser and does not support Google Now, a sort of personal digital assistant technology that automatically provides relevant information about a user's personal calendar, weather and travel plans.</seg>
<seg id="14">The new KitKat version of Android integrates Google search technology directly into the phone in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="15">The phone's contact list allows users to find phone numbers of their personal acquaintances as well as of local businesses, such as restaurants and dry cleaners.</seg>
<seg id="16">Google also showed off a new feature that will allow smartphone users to find information by searching pages on the Web as well as information within the apps they have loaded on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="17">A search for a particular chocolate cookie recipe, for example, could yield results from a cooking app.</seg>
<seg id="18">Google also showed off the new Nexus 5 smartphone which will be the first device to feature the KitKat software.</seg>
<seg id="19">The phone, built by LG, will be available in 10 countries starting Thursday without a contract for $349.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heart's poor away record weighing on players: Murdocca</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Heart midfielder Massimo Murdocca has only played one interstate game for the club, but that has been enough to lay bare to him the extent of the team's growing psychological burden about breaking a near-two-year streak of not winning away from Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the Heart girds itself for one of the most difficult road trips - an away fixture to Brisbane on Sunday - Murdocca reflected on last weekend's 1-0 loss in Perth and admitted that many of the squad had issues in dealing with the weight of expectation building from the club's dreadful away record.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ex-Roar midfielder believes it is incumbent on new faces like himself, Dutch defender Rob Wielaert and others to change the culture and make the team winners when it plays away from home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last time Heart picked up three points on the road was on New Year's Eve 2011, against Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="6">"A lot of the boys are really thinking about that away record, it's something we have to stamp out really quickly," Murdocca said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">It all comes down to the boys being really positive and believing in themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coach John Aloisi admits there was a mental problem last year as the streak got longer, but is adamant that will not be the case this season.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last week we didn't perform as well as we would have liked, but I was quite happy with the second half and the way we finished the game.</seg>
<seg id="10">We needed to be more intense in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="11">About six or seven of our starting XI are new players.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are not thinking too much about our away form.</seg>
<seg id="13">Harry Kewell has been training, but is unlikely to play.</seg>

<seg id="1">China plea paper 'to be overhauled'</seg>
<seg id="2">A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the New Express is to undergo "full rectification," the regulator said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "rectification" order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.</seg>
<seg id="7">A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="8">"New Express's editorial management was disordered," the regulator said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license."</seg>
<seg id="10">It had also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.</seg>
<seg id="12">After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.</seg>
<seg id="15">I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've realised my wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 13:07</seg>
<seg id="3">Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire.</seg>
<seg id="4">BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls.</seg>
<seg id="7">The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the face of it that might make sense to some.</seg>
<seg id="10">Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered?</seg>
<seg id="11">And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so?</seg>
<seg id="12">Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's a theory but not conclusive</seg>
<seg id="15">End Quote Defra spokesperson</seg>
<seg id="16">A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling.</seg>
<seg id="21">The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots.</seg>
<seg id="22">There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation).</seg>
<seg id="24">They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged.</seg>
<seg id="25">A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects</seg>
<seg id="27">End Quote Prof Rosie Woodroffe</seg>
<seg id="28">The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="29">There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area.</seg>
<seg id="30">It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="31">In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors.</seg>
<seg id="32">On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population.</seg>
<seg id="33">Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option.</seg>
<seg id="35">A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction."</seg>
<seg id="36">It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="38">But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out.</seg>
<seg id="39">Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is also an additional concern for Defra.</seg>
<seg id="43">A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lawmakers distance themselves from Calderon</seg>
<seg id="2">SACRAMENTO - California legislators scrambled Thursday to distance themselves from allegations of bribery and corruption against Democratic Sen. Ronald Calderon of Montebello, a day after details of a federal probe of his activities aired on a television network.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Capitol was roiling over comments attributed to Calderon in a report by the Al Jazeera cable network, based on what it identified as a sealed FBI affidavit, that he had enlisted other lawmakers to help him influence policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">In exchange, the affidavit alleges, the senator accepted $88,000.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Thursday, the FBI said it has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the leak of the sealed document.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, Democrats whose names surfaced in the affidavit wasted no time defending themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">Senate leader Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento and Sens. Ted Lieu of Torrance and Kevin de León of Los Angeles issued statements denying that they did anything wrong.</seg>
<seg id="8">The allegations could have an impact on next year's elections - even the Democrats' two-thirds legislative majority, said Larry Gerston, a political science professor at San Jose State.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Depending upon the extent that the investigation leads to charges against Calderon and others, the Democrats in the Legislature could find themselves with a serious PR issue," Gerston said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The closer the investigation gets to the 2014 elections, "the more Democrats may need to worry and the more Republicans may have an election issue" to run on, he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Calderon has not been charged with any crime, and his attorney has denied any wrongdoing by his client.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the affidavit, posted on Al Jazeera's website, Calderon allegedly accepted $60,000 in bribes from an undercover FBI agent posing as a movie executive and $28,000 more from a medical company owner in exchange for efforts to affect legislation on tax credits for the film industry and on workers' compensation claims.</seg>
<seg id="13">Steinberg said reading the affidavit made him "sick to my stomach."</seg>
<seg id="14">He announced that he has removed Calderon from the California Film Commission for "the appearance of impropriety" and will consider taking away other committee assignments in the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Nothing is more sacred to us as senators than the public's trust in the integrity of this institution," Steinberg said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's why it is so shocking and disturbing for us to read and hear the allegations presented in these media reports over the last 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="17">Calderon also told the undercover agent that he gave Steinberg two VIP tickets to a Giants baseball game as part of his effort to get the leader to support a change in the film tax credit program, according to the affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="18">Calderon told the agent that he believed Steinberg supported the change.</seg>
<seg id="19">Steinberg said he never supported the change, which was not included in any legislation.</seg>
<seg id="20">As for the baseball tickets, Steinberg said they were valued at $37.50 each and were properly reported to a state agency as a gift.</seg>
<seg id="21">The tax break proposal was a key focus of the affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lieu said Calderon approached him about supporting a break for small film productions, and he agreed to include that in a letter to Steinberg that he co-signed with Calderon.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I didn't know what a small production tax credit was until he came to me," Lieu said, adding that the letter contained other proposals he wanted that had nothing to do with film tax credits.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lieu told The Times that he has been interviewed by federal investigators but said he was assured that he is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="25">The affidavit mentions legislation by Lieu and De León that would have limited reimbursements for hardware and implants used in spinal surgery, which according to some estimates cost the state's workers' compensation system tens of millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="26">Michael Drobot, who owns companies that distribute such hardware, would have taken a financial hit if those reimbursements were eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="27">The legislation stalled.</seg>
<seg id="28">A broader workers' compensation bill passed in August 2012 that limited how spinal implants were reimbursed through the system.</seg>
<seg id="29">The affidavit alleges that Drobot paid Ron Calderon about $28,000 in bribes in 2011 and 2012, including $18,000 concealed as payments to Ron Calderon's son, Zachary, who had been hired for a summer job with the company.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the affidavit, Calderon told an undercover agent that, thanks to him and his brother, former Assemblyman Tom Calderon, the workers' compensation overhaul had "language that was more favorable to Drobot."</seg>
<seg id="31">Lieu disputed comments attributed to Calderon in the affidavit that he was able to convince Lieu to drop his bill.</seg>
<seg id="32">The measure "was merged and incorporated word for word into a larger and more comprehensive workers' compensation reform package that was signed into law," Lieu said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="33">De León also denied that he was influenced by Calderon.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The U.S. attorney has made clear that Sen. De León is not a target of this investigation and any suggestion that he did something inappropriate is completely false," said Dan Reeves, chief of staff for De León.</seg>
<seg id="35">Jeffrey Rutherford, an attorney for Drobot, said Wednesday evening that allegations that his client "engaged in wrongdoing with respect to Ron Calderon is baseless."</seg>
<seg id="36">Times staff writer Anthony York contributed to this report.</seg>

<seg id="1">Levein reveals he helped Pat Fenlon get Hibs job</seg>
<seg id="2">CRAIG Levein has backed Pat Fenlon to survive his latest spell of crisis management at Hibernian and revealed the details of his part in the Dubliner's appointment by the Easter Road club two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former Hearts and Scotland manager Levein was at Hampden yesterday to make the League Cup semi-final draw, with Hibs" absence from the hat having put fresh pressure on Fenlon.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wednesday night's 1-0 home Edinburgh derby defeat to Gary Locke's administration-weakened Hearts team in the quarter-finals prompted a protest by angry Hibs supporters outside Easter Road.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fenlon, whose position also came intense scrutiny at the start of the season when Hibs suffered a record 9-0 aggregate defeat to Malmo in Europa League qualifying and lost to Hearts at Tynecastle in the first league derby of the campaign, remained defiant after the match.</seg>
<seg id="6">The former Shelbourne and Bohemians boss had his credentials for the Hibs job endorsed by Levein prior to his appointment in November 2011.</seg>
<seg id="7">Levein had also backed Dundee United's move to make Fenlon his successor at Tannadice the previous year, only for that to fall through when the clubs failed to agree compensation terms.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Someone at Hibs phoned me and asked about him," said Levein.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'd met Pat a few times through a friend of mine in Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pat did a great job in Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="11">I certainly recommended him as a character, although I hadn't worked with him.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="13">Someone at Hibs asked me about Pat and I can recommend his character.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think anyone has a crystal ball and can say what is going to happen with someone as manager.</seg>
<seg id="15">What you can do is look at their past record and he was exceptionally successful wherever he had been in Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think he is a decent person.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is certainly a really hard-working guy.</seg>
<seg id="18">I feel for him right now.</seg>
<seg id="19">All of us who have managed understand what it's like to go through a tough time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pat had a tough period early on in the season and battled on and got through that.</seg>
<seg id="21">Knowing the type of character he is, he will do the same again.</seg>
<seg id="22">If that defeat on Wednesday had not been against Hearts, it wouldn't have been quite as sore.</seg>
<seg id="23">The fact that Hearts were weakened by a lot of other things probably made Hibs the strongest favourites they have been for a while.</seg>
<seg id="24">That builds the expectation levels for Hibs fans.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he is a strong character and he'll battle through it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Everyone in management knows that, when things are going well, the manager is the one who gets the praise.</seg>
<seg id="27">But, when things are going poorly, you carry the can for it.</seg>
<seg id="28">A lot of times, circumstances are such that you can look at mitigating reasons for it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But a lot of times people don't look into it as deeply as that.</seg>
<seg id="30">Results dictate how it goes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Everything is a gamble when you appoint the manager and the important thing is to look into the background and the statistics to make the best judgement that you can.</seg>
<seg id="32">I've heard some of the Hibs fans were shouting for him to go.</seg>
<seg id="33">Football has changed a bit in the sense that a lot of the clubs are not run by what I would consider to be football people.</seg>
<seg id="34">But the ones who are football people tend to be more tolerant because they recognise that things can happen that are outwith the manager's control.</seg>
<seg id="35">Levein is adamant Hibs would be best served by keeping faith with Fenlon and insists finding a successor would be problematic in a Scottish football environment he says is increasingly unattractive to high-level managers.</seg>
<seg id="36">"I think everybody needs to take a deep breath and let the guy get on with the job," added Levein.</seg>
<seg id="37">Hibs are in a reasonable position just now.</seg>
<seg id="38">I think they will be a top-six team, which I know you could argue is expected but they haven't always been in the top six.</seg>
<seg id="39">With all due respect, in Scotland we are not getting the best managers in Britain because everything has got a tier and the idea is you keep moving up.</seg>
<seg id="40">Financially, they are not the best jobs here and it's not in England, where you are the centre of attention.</seg>
<seg id="41">So I believe if you make the choice to bring a manager in, give him time to get things right.</seg>
<seg id="42">It will get to a time, and I think this is starting to happen in Scotland now, that clubs realise whenever you sack a manager you've then got all the debris that goes with it.</seg>
<seg id="43">You've got to pay off that manager, sign a new one and then get rid of the players the new guy doesn't want.</seg>
<seg id="44">All that takes a period of time to work through so I think it's better to do as much diligence as you can to make sure you've got the right guy - and then give him time.</seg>
<seg id="45">Otherwise you are ultimately costing yourself a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="46">The good thing I've seen in the Scottish Premiership this season is that the owners of the football clubs have had the balls to stand fast and not be trigger happy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Levein, meanwhile, was fulsome in his praise of Gary Locke's work at Hearts since the club's financial collapse.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Without a shadow of a doubt, Gary has the hardest job in management this season," said Levein.</seg>
<seg id="49">He has a team full of kids who, without any disrespect to them, are only in the team because there is nobody else.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a manager, one of the biggest motivational tools you have is the threat of a player being dropped if he's not playing well.</seg>
<seg id="51">But, at Hearts just now, even if someone is playing crap, they will still play the next week and the week after that.</seg>
<seg id="52">Some of the best managers in the world would struggle under those conditions, so for a young guy like Gary to deal with it is incredible and it would be a remarkable achievement if he could take them to a cup final.</seg>

<seg id="3">TWO kittens have been found with their tails cut off underneath a car in Blair Athol.</seg>
<seg id="4">The kittens, a male and a female, were found by a resident on Southport St about 6.30pm on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their tails were recently docked.</seg>
<seg id="6">The pair were taken in by the resident before being picked up by RSPCA staff yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="7">RSPCA chief executive Tim Vasudeva said the injuries had been deliberately inflicted and called for information from the public to help with the organisation's investigation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We've never seen anything like this ... it's very unusual," Mr Vasudeva said.</seg>
<seg id="9">We have no idea why anyone would do this, but it is an act of cruelty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Downton Abbey Wines</seg>
<seg id="2">Yes, there is a Downton Abbey wine - two, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="3">The collection - which went on sale earlier this week - comprises two Bordeaux blends.</seg>
<seg id="4">The "Blanc" is a white described as having an "expressive notes" with "classic notes of tangerine"; the "Claret" is said to have "gorgeous scents of wild berries."</seg>
<seg id="5">And yes, Downton Abbey is still just a TV show.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pop culture-themed wine is no longer all that surprising.</seg>
<seg id="7">Though beer is still the more popular alcoholic-beverage tie-in (with licensed brews from Monty Python to Breaking Bad), wine is also in on the trend.</seg>
<seg id="8">In September, a Fifty Shades of Grey wine collection was announced.</seg>
<seg id="9">The band Train has had their own wine since 2011 and announced earlier this week that a portion of proceeds from their holiday wine set would go to charity.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last year, the Alamo Drafthouse announced a line of wine inspired by The Princess Bride.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ron Roy remembers a time when this particular pairing - of wine and entertainment - would have seemed right out of left field, but that time has passed.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a CEO of Wines That Rock, the company behind the Downton and 50 Shades vintages; the company also makes wines licensed by bands like The Rolling Stones, The Police and Pink Floyd.</seg>
<seg id="13">MORE: How Americans Almost Missed Out on Downton Abbey</seg>
<seg id="14">"In 2008, really nobody was carving out that space," Roy says.</seg>
<seg id="15">His a-ha moment came when he realized upon walking into a wine shop that, even though he didn't know too much about wine, he could tell which labels were cool.</seg>
<seg id="16">He and his business partners had worked with a variety of big-name bands, by running a few music-adjacent companies throughout their careers, and he thought they could combine the two.</seg>
<seg id="17">"If you walked into a wine shop and saw the tongue and lips of the Rolling Stones, your eye would go to that," he thought.</seg>
<seg id="18">We may not know everything about wine but we sure as heck can learn, and we know a lot about marketing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Roy says that these days Wines That Rock bottles can be found on the menu at Hard Rock Cafés, are expanding into every state in the U.S. and are also distributed in Europe and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We don't take ourselves too seriously but we have great wine," says Roy.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you look at your typical wine-drinker, it's not a sommelier.</seg>
<seg id="22">And don't confuse a sense of humor with a lack of attention to detail.</seg>
<seg id="23">Roy is adamant that his company's trendy bottles aren't just a case of trying to capitalize on a fad by slapping a label on any old bottle.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the case of the 50 Shades and Downton wines, the company targeted those particular properties because they thought the tie-in made sense: the characters in the book and on the TV show all drink a lot of wine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The music wines have deeper meanings too; for example the Police "Synchronicity" wine is a play on the word created by blending many different grapes.</seg>
<seg id="26">For 50 Shades of Grey, the company approached author E.L. James and she flew to California to be involved in the blending of the wine, making sure it was something Anastasia and Christian would enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="27">Roy says the same effort went into their latest bottles.</seg>
<seg id="28">We looked at Downton Abbey and said every single show has Mr. Carson down there with the wine.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Wine is everywhere," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">We wanted to be authentic to the period in England so we had [the wine] made in France.</seg>
<seg id="31">They were not drinking California grapes at Downton Abbey.</seg>
<seg id="32">Hence, the choice of a Claret for the red.</seg>
<seg id="33">Roy knows that commentary about Downton wine may be a little tongue-in-cheek, as was much of the initial media response to the 50 Shades release - but, as his business expands, that doesn't matter so much.</seg>
<seg id="34">Wines That Rock ran up against this too.</seg>

<seg id="2">With around 930,000 votes registered, Spain had won 89.96 per cent, compared to 10.04 per cent for Britain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Telegraph's social media team was able to determine where in the world people voted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unsurprisingly, 98.89 per cent of people voting in Spain voted for Spain, in a bid to have the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which ceded the strategically valuable "Rock" to Britain, scrapped.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Britain, the vote was a bit more balanced, with 71.02 per cent voting for Britain to maintain control and 28.98 per cent voting for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Gibraltar itself, 99.79 per cent of the people voting said they wanted the British Overseas Territory, which stands between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, to remain British.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gareth Gingell, of the Defenders of Gibraltar group said: "[The poll] was another obvious sustained effort from departments in the Spanish government that are heading the anti-Gibraltar campaign."</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a People's Party-led initiative and also includes ties to social media groups like Gibraltar Espanol.</seg>
<seg id="9">The pre-eminent group of active individuals are from the Spanish ministry of defence, including the Guardia Civil.</seg>
<seg id="10">I was surprised initially to see such a massive slip up / waste of it resources for an online opinion poll.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's a low level example of electronic or cyber warfare to manipulate public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12">All led by a national government.</seg>
<seg id="13">It would seem that the conflict of ideas and interests worldwide will be fought predominantly over the web and Gibraltar is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="14">Spain's ministry of defence was unavailable for comment on the Telegraph poll.</seg>
<seg id="15">The poll was opened in August, at the height of the recent escalation in diplomatic tensions between Britain and Spain over "The Rock."</seg>
<seg id="16">In July, Gibraltarian boats dumped blocks of concrete in disputed waters used by Spanish fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="17">Gibraltar said it was creating an artificial reef that would boost fish populations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Spain subsequently stepped up border checks, leading to huge queues for motorists, in what Britain and Gibraltar claimed was a retaliatory measure aimed at a choking the territory's economy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Britain on Friday said it would protest to Spain "at the highest level" after a Guardia Civil patrol boat apparently manoeuvred "in a provocative and dangerous manner in the vicinity of Royal Navy vessels."</seg>
<seg id="20">Drivers wait in line to enter Spain at its border with the British Colony of Gibraltar, in Gibraltar, southern Spain</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 02:40</seg>
<seg id="3">US food aid benefits are being cut from Friday as an extension of the government programme expires, while legislators fight over further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Benefits to the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap) will be lowered by $36 (£22) a month for a family of four, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some 47 million low income Americans will be affected by the cuts.</seg>
<seg id="6">Food aid in the US has grown to $80bn a year due to higher unemployment and rising food costs.</seg>
<seg id="7">About one in seven Americans relies on Snap, also known as food stamps.</seg>
<seg id="8">The benefits were originally expanded during the recent economic recession to stimulate the economy and help the poorest Americans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Republicans in Congress are seeking further reductions to the programme and say it should be better targeted at the most needy.</seg>
<seg id="10">Retailers and grocers around the US are concerned about the possible negative impact the reduction will have on consumer spending.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the menu: Huevos rancheros; elderflower tonic; TOG santoku knives; Rene Redzepi</seg>
<seg id="2">This week I've been eating... Huevos rancheros</seg>
<seg id="3">I knew I'd like the tortilla-wrapped rancher's eggs that Anna Barnett was serving at her three-day pop-up at Jones & Sons in east London before I'd even pushed open the big glass doors.</seg>
<seg id="4">Why?</seg>
<seg id="5">Because having read the recipe for them on her blog (getinmygob.co.uk), I was fully apprised of the fact that they were composed largely of Gruyère cheese, butter and egg, which is about as happy a triumvirate of ingredients as you are likely to come across on a parky night.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were lots of other things to coo over on the "Latin-inspired" menu - almond alfajores and ceviche proved big hits, too - but it was these golden volcanoes of molten cheese and egg yolk which took the day.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rich without being cloying and served with a zingy salad, they were a fine demonstration of the beauty of simple cooking.</seg>
<seg id="8">I left warm, satisfied and wishing Barnett's pop-up would never pop down.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gin scrummy</seg>
<seg id="10">Fever-Tree continued its shake-up of the mixer market with a tasting at west London's Chelsea Physic Garden.</seg>
<seg id="11">It claimed to have amassed the largest display of gins in history - 160-odd in total - and would have scored a Guinness world record had the thirsty adjudicator not fallen asleep in the rhododendrons (not really, there was no adjudicator).</seg>
<seg id="12">I sipped Nolet's Dry Gin and a suitably floral Fever-Tree elderflower tonic barely an ice cube's throw from Britain's first cinchona, or "fever" tree, the bark of which provided the quinine that kept malaria at bay back in the days of the British Empire.</seg>
<seg id="13">That's 600 years of history in one drink.</seg>
<seg id="14">Don't mind if I do.</seg>
<seg id="15">Book this</seg>
<seg id="16">Libraries may be closing down all over the shop, but at a central London hotel one is being opened up to the public.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington will be hosting hosting book clubs throughout November in its well-stocked reading room.</seg>

<seg id="19">Blade stunner</seg>
<seg id="20">I try not to.</seg>
<seg id="21">Really I do.</seg>
<seg id="22">But every time I use a TOG santoku knife I feel a tiny bit like a samurai.</seg>
<seg id="23">Not only would the all-purpose knife probably cut Buddha, so phenomenally sharp is its blade, the range also happens to be made in Seki City, home of the Japanese samurai sword.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is an exquisite thing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well balanced - an essential when you are buying a posh knife - with a maple-wood handle and a blade made from 21 layers of steel and copper (the latter metal is added not for strength, but because of its antimicrobial properties).</seg>

<seg id="2">Veronica, Leeds</seg>
<seg id="3">The key issue is to have a clear, comprehensive and legally binding agreement in writing.</seg>
<seg id="4">No matter how well you get on with your tenant, ensure you are protected in case the relationship turns sour.</seg>
<seg id="5">Make certain your tenancy contract includes specific dates for the payment of rent.</seg>
<seg id="6">It should also set out the consequences of non-payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">You should seek specialist legal advice to guarantee your agreement is completely watertight.</seg>
<seg id="8">I moved six months ago and have just been informed by my neighbours that I'm responsible, along with them, for the upkeep of the shared road between our properties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am concerned that I did not know anything about this before buying.</seg>
<seg id="10">When should I have been told?</seg>
<seg id="11">Ruth, Carlisle</seg>
<seg id="12">Your conveyancing solicitor should have spotted this before your purchase.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have a duty to ensure buyers are aware of any issues which affect the property.</seg>
<seg id="14">If your solicitor was either told about the shared road and failed to inform you, or simply missed it completely, that could amount to professional negligence.</seg>
<seg id="15">To take legal action against the conveyancer, you would have to highlight any loss you have suffered as a result of their failure to highlight the issue.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have seen many reports about the Government launching its Help to Buy scheme.</seg>
<seg id="17">What is it and what does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="18">Hannah, Nottingham</seg>
<seg id="19">Help to Buy was announced in the last Budget, but the mortgage guarantee aspect of the scheme has only recently been launched.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is an "equity loan" where the Government will lend up to 20 per cent of the value of a new-build home.</seg>
<seg id="21">And now there is also a "mortgage guarantee" where lenders will be incentivised to make more mortgages available for people with small deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Government will indemnify the lenders.</seg>
<seg id="23">A number of banks will offer 95 per cent mortgages for homes worth up to £600,000.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Government will guarantee up to 15 per cent of the property's value in return for a fee from the bank involved.</seg>
<seg id="25">This means buyers only need a deposit of five per cent to get on to the property ladder.</seg>
<seg id="26">The £600,000 limit shows the Government is serious about helping house buyers across the board, not just first-time buyers.</seg>
<seg id="27">For more information, see gov.uk.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am purchasing a property in a nearby village and am worried about chancel repair liability.</seg>
<seg id="29">I have been told by a friend that the rules are changing.</seg>
<seg id="30">Is this correct?</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul, Bristol</seg>
<seg id="32">Chancel repair liability has its origins in historical law and means, in some cases, that home-owners are required to pay for the upkeep of parts of their local church.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a common misconception that chancel repair liability is coming to an end.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Land Registration Act of 2002 put the onus on parishes to register any legal obligation on properties within their boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="35">The cut-off date for this was October 13.</seg>
<seg id="36">So, the buyer will be free of liability if the property was sold after this date, and the chancel repair liability had not been registered.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the church can still register claims against existing properties in the parish until they are next sold.</seg>
<seg id="38">And if somebody receives such a property after the October 13 deadline, as a gift, or at a knock-down price, the church may still be able to register chancel repair liability.</seg>
<seg id="39">I am in the middle of a property chain which stretches to at least five home-owners.</seg>
<seg id="40">My concern is that there is a high potential that the chain could collapse.</seg>
<seg id="41">Is there anything I can do to protect myself?</seg>
<seg id="42">Tim, Dudley</seg>
<seg id="43">Chains are a frustrating part of the house-buying process, and they have significant consequences if they break down.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is little you can do to protect yourself, but a bit of legwork on your part can minimise risks.</seg>
<seg id="45">Make sure your finance is in place and your searches are completed.</seg>
<seg id="46">Check daily if you can with the estate agent and your conveyancer to be certain nobody is waiting for any answers from you.</seg>
<seg id="47">You might also check, through your estate agent, that other parties in the chain have the necessary paperwork in place.</seg>
<seg id="48">Often one person in the chain is unnecessarily holding everybody else up by forgetting to answer a question.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dave King says 'no consensus' in Rangers boardroom power struggle</seg>
<seg id="2">Rangers oldco investor Dave King has revealed he has been unable to reach a "consensus agreement" with shareholders locked in a boardroom dispute.</seg>
<seg id="3">The South Africa-based businessman has been in Scotland holding meetings with Rangers International Football Club plc stakeholders recently, as it gears up for a power struggle at its first annual general meeting (AGM).</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, he said that "certain influential shareholders are unwilling to compromise" in the boardroom battle at Ibrox.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr King also claimed that his convictions for breaching tax legislation in South Africe have "has no effect whatsoever on my ability to serve as a director of companies."</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this year he agreed to pay the South African Revenue Service £44.75m after pleading guilty to contravening tax legislation by failing to provide correct information about incomes earned over a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The payment agreement included a fine as an alternative to an 82-year jail term for 41 terms of breaching the tax legislation, while the revenue service also agreed to drop prosecutions over fraud charges in relation to his business dealings.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a statement released on Friday, Mr King said: "During the last week I engaged a number of stakeholders, both in Glasgow and London, to seek a compromise to the current imbroglio that is restricting the operational capability and the governance at the club.</seg>
<seg id="9">I have also had follow up telephone conversations since my return to South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="10">I thank every person that I met for maintaining confidentiality about the details of each meeting.</seg>
<seg id="11">I thank the media for their patience when being met with a repeated "no comment" from me.</seg>
<seg id="12">I appreciate the importance to the community of what is happening at Rangers but I believe that the best interests of the club will not be facilitated by playing it out in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the last two years we have all witnessed the destructive value when individuals, who should be putting the club first, advance personal agendas through the media in an attempt to influence the most important stakeholder in Rangers Football Club- the fans.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result is the polarisation of interests that we are experiencing and the loss of valuable time and money in preparing the club to be competitive with our Glasgow neighbours, and other teams, when we return to the top flight of Scottish football- as we surely will.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thankfully the manager continues to make progress through the leagues despite the distractions he has had to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="16">He continued: "Unfortunately, I have been unable to reach a consensus agreement at this time despite the constructive manner in which everyone approached the discussions with me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Certain influential shareholders are unwilling to compromise at this time and it seems inevitable, unless there is a change of heart, that an acrimonious AGM lies ahead.</seg>
<seg id="18">In my view, the AGM will not be decisive irrespective of its outcome.</seg>
<seg id="19">A continued polarisation is what I was desperately trying to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the avoidance of doubt and to avoid speculation I advise that Paul Murray and Sandy Easdale both displayed a constructive and flexible attitude during my discussions with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">I also take the opportunity to disassociate myself from the speculative and misinformed press coverage around my fit and proper status.</seg>
<seg id="22">Let me make my position clear.</seg>
<seg id="23">The settlement of my legal disputes in South Africa was concluded on a basis that has no effect whatsoever on my ability to serve as a director of companies.</seg>
<seg id="24">I presently sit on the board of many companies, including serving as executive chairman of a main board stock exchange listed company in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="25">I have confirmed with my UK attorneys that the legal position is no different in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="26">That leaves only the subjective elements that would apply to any person joining a public company board or becoming involved in a football club under the auspices of the SFA.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rangers International currently have two board members in the form of finance director Brian Stockbridge and non-executive member James Easdale.</seg>
<seg id="28">It planned to hold its first annual general meeting on October 24, but was prevented from doing so by opposition shareholders - including institutional investors and former oldco director Paul Murray - who took the company to the Court of Session to postponed the event and to force it to consider the appointment of new board members.</seg>
<seg id="29">A new date for the annual general meeting has not been set yet.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last month, Rangers International posted its first annual results which showed it had run at an operating loss of £14.3m for the 13 months until June this year.</seg>
<seg id="31">Previously, Rangers had announced that Mr King was in discussions about taking the role of chairman of the company board, however there have been no further developments regarding that appointment.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr King's appointment would need to be vetted by the Scottish FA and by Rangers International's nominated advisor (nomad) to the London Stock Exchange, Daniel Stewart and Company.</seg>
<seg id="33">Both the football authorities and the advisors would consider his convictions, as well as his involvement as a director of Rangers oldco which is currently in the hands of liquidators BDO.</seg>
<seg id="34">In his statement, the 58-year-old claimed to have assurances from the South African tax authorities that it had no problems with him sitting on the boards of companies.</seg>
<seg id="35">He is currently the executive chairman of Johannesburg investment firm Micromega, which trades on the country's stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr King said: "I am fully alert to key questions that are likely to be put to me and I am confident that my responses will be persuasive.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, at this point I have not approached the SFA other than my discussion in 2012 to establish what the elements of the fit and proper test would be.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SFA is clearly not in a position to consider an application that I have not yet made.</seg>
<seg id="39">Such an application would only happen if I am able to reach an in principle agreement to become actively involved in the club's affairs- as is my continued stated intention.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the request of the nomad, I have supplied a letter from the South African Revenue Services confirming that they see no difficulty with me continuing to sit on the board of companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">Again, however, due to my inability to make immediate progress it is not necessary to engage further with the nomad at this time.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the time arises there may be other questions I have to respond to.</seg>
<seg id="43">I will do so on request.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former St Kilda coach Ross Lyon leads the Saints off the ground after the 2011 elimination final.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Michael Dodge Source: Herald Sun</seg>
<seg id="4">A NEW book to mark the St Kilda Football Club's 140th anniversary reveals the depth of bitterness at coach Ross Lyon's controversial departure at the end of 2011.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Strength Through Loyalty, to be launched at a club function on Saturday, St Kilda chief executive Michael Nettlefold talks of Lyon's "bizarre" and "unusual" behaviour late in that season, and says the coach ultimately headed to Fremantle for "purely commercial" reasons.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nettlefold said he sensed there was a problem because Lyon's "behaviour had been quite unusual" over the final months of the 2011 season, culminating in a "bizarre night" when the Saints lost an elimination final to Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="7">Within 30 minutes of the final siren at Etihad Stadium, Lyon had announced the unexpected retirements of Steven Baker and Robert Eddy as well as ruckman Michael Gardiner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nettlefold said in the ensuing days the Saints believed they had resolved several months of contract talks with Lyon's management group, Elite Sport Properties, and had scheduled a media conference for that Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">The date was then pushed back, and during a board meeting on the Thursday evening Nettlefold had to excuse himself from the room to take a call from Lyon, who informed him he was quitting.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nettlefold said he then phoned ESP's Craig Kelly, who confirmed Lyon and his lawyer had independently negotiated a move to Fremantle.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I was stunned by the fact it was done outside the management group ... the fact it was done externally - that was the shock to me," Nettlefold said.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had an agreement with his management group.</seg>
<seg id="13">ESP dropped Lyon as a client and the coach has since said he handled negotiations in a way that would avoid "a clear conflict of interest" because Kelly was managing then Dockers coach Mark Harvey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyon has asserted St Kilda was lukewarm in its approach to contract negotiations late in the season.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nettlefold disagreed: "At the time it was convenient for that to be used as a reason, but as the situation unfolded and, by Ross's own acknowledgment, it was financially driven," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nettlefold suggested Lyon was torn on how to "trade out" his strong allegiance to the players and the club for a decision made "purely on a commercial basis."</seg>
<seg id="17">Among the book's other revelations about St Kilda's coaches:</seg>
<seg id="18">LYON'S candidature was put forward by former player and coach Ken Sheldon, not former Fitzroy coach Robert Walls, as has long been suspected.</seg>
<seg id="19">LYON developed his team-defence game plan in closed training sessions during the 2009 pre-season, dividing Moorabbin Oval into marked zones the players were designated to mind.</seg>
<seg id="20">FORMER assistant coach Matt Rendell says board member Grant Thomas was the driving force behind Malcolm Blight's appointment in 2001, inviting him to join the selection sub-committee so he could "woo him" for the senior role.</seg>
<seg id="21">RENDELL said suggestions Thomas wanted subsequently to replace Blight were "crap," and that he was the one man who voted to retain Blight until at least the end of 2011.</seg>
<seg id="22">The book also reveals Thomas was sacked at the end of the 2006 season after a board meeting that went until 3am.</seg>
<seg id="23">The suggestion was Thomas was seeking to take control of the club, not just the football department.</seg>
<seg id="24">There was also a widening rift between the club's board and the football department.</seg>
<seg id="25">Or, as then president Rod Butterss put it, the club had split into "them and us" camps.</seg>
<seg id="26">Butterss said that even during the season two directors "wanted to sack (Thomas), even if he won the premiership."</seg>
<seg id="27">One symptom of the rift came when Thomas organised an overseas training camp without telling the board or including it in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I read it in the newspaper," Butterss said.</seg>
<seg id="29">The tickets had been bought.</seg>
<seg id="30">Butterss also said he believed Thomas's strong bond with the young playing group "bordered on unhealthy."</seg>

<seg id="12">As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
<seg id="14">I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.</seg>
<seg id="15">We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="17">That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="23">The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's a mystery I have yet to solve.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.</seg>
<seg id="27">They have the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like "nice face."</seg>
<seg id="29">Finally, let's talk pumpkins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lucky for us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="33">The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Google gag order keeps Coast Guard from talking about mystery barges</seg>
<seg id="2">What in tarnation is Google building on a barge in San Francisco Bay?</seg>
<seg id="3">The U.S. Coast Guard knows, after visiting the vessel on Wednesday, but it is not at liberty to reveal any more details thanks to a corporate gag order imposed on Coast Guard employees.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We can confirm that Google is involved or associated with the barge but there is a nondisclosure agreement in effect; the Coast Guard is unable to discuss or divulge any further details at this time," Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer 1st Class Thomas McKenzie told CNBC.</seg>
<seg id="5">The confirmation that the barge is in fact a Google creation is something, at least.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company has thus far refused to admit that it's involved with the floating, four-story building that's anchored off Treasure Island, in the middle of San Francisco Bay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The San Francisco-based barge is one of four barges registered to a Delaware company called By and Large - the name of which some believe to be a dorky homage to "Buy N Large," the fictional corporation from the movie Wall-E.</seg>
<seg id="8">The names of the barges also may be part of a nerd code.</seg>
<seg id="9">The vessels are dubbed BAL0001, BAL0010, BAL0011, and BAL0100.</seg>
<seg id="10">In binary - the 1s and 0s foundation of computing - these numbers represent "1," "2," "3," and "4."</seg>
<seg id="11">Currently BAL0001 and BAL0010 are anchored in San Francisco (only BAL0010 houses the mysterious structure, however), while a second structure, built on BAL0011, was recently spotted on the other side of the country, off the coast of Portland, Maine.</seg>
<seg id="12">The San Francisco and Portland structures are similar, both constructed using empty shipping containers that have been welded together.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both have windows, meaning they are likely meant to have people inside them regularly.</seg>
<seg id="14">And both are fairly large.</seg>
<seg id="15">That, however, is where the knowns end, and the mystery begins.</seg>
<seg id="16">As CNET first reported, the barge-buildings may be floating data centers that use sea water to cool Google's servers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company obtained a patent for floating data centers in 2009, and a person linked to both Google and By and Large referred CNET to the patent when questioned about the San Francisco barge.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to CBS San Francisco, however, people familiar with the project say the S.F. barge will be used as a "floating marketing center," or retail store, for Google's much-hyped wearable tech, Google Glass.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the LA Times speculates (sarcastically) that it could be anything from a "doomsday flotilla" to a private paintball arena for Google executives.</seg>
<seg id="20">The buildings are still under construction, so it will likely be some time before we find out what the heck Google is up to.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the mean time, we can only guess.</seg>
<seg id="22">So, what do you think Google has planned?</seg>

<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- An elderly woman living in the Philadelphia mansion where Princess Grace of Monaco spent her childhood was charged Thursday with animal cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Investigators with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said 14 cats were in the house, living in inhumane conditions, WCAU-TV reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The agency also removed the carcass of a dead cat.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 81-year-old owner of the house was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="6">George Bengal, director of humane enforcement for the SPCA in Philadelphia, said the organization had received tips for years about the animals in the mansion but had been unable to get inside to check them out.</seg>
<seg id="7">But he appeared to have sympathy for the woman involved.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I think the lady is a rescue lady and has been for years," Bengal said.</seg>
<seg id="9">This just turned into a hoarder situation where she didn't have the resources to care for these animals.</seg>
<seg id="10">The woman had been living in the house since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="11">Grace Kelly's mother lived there until her death in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="12">Grace Kelly was born in Philadelphia where her father, Jack Kelly, was a bricklayer turned Olympic sculling champion and construction mogul.</seg>
<seg id="13">She became one of the top Hollywood stars of the early 1950s before marrying Prince Rainier in 1956.</seg>

<seg id="1">Some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouths, while others create a perfect life by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.</seg>
<seg id="2">One of the such personalities is the late Dhirubhai Ambani.</seg>
<seg id="3">The third son of Hirachand Govaradhandas Ambani, who worked as a teacher in a school in Coravada, a small village in Gujarat, Dhirubhai Ambani was born on December 28th, 1932.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dhirubhai was the third of five brothers and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="5">The five children were Ramanikalala, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters, Trilochana and Jasumati.</seg>
<seg id="6">Due to financial constraints Dhirubhai had to drop out after high school.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dhirubhai started helping in the house financially from childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time he set up a stall selling Bhajiyas near Girnar. The income from the stall was dependent on the number of tourists going there.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dhirubhai's first job was in 1949 at the age of 17 when he arrived on a ship called Cabota in the city of Aden, in the Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="10">His elder brother, Raniklala, had made all the arrangements for him there, so he did not have any problem getting a job abroad.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Dhirubhai had something else in mind.</seg>
<seg id="12">So he returned home in 1954.</seg>
<seg id="13">By 1955, he had landed in Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket, to try his luck.</seg>
<seg id="14">And from here he started his travel business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dhirubhai never looked back.</seg>
<seg id="16">His name became known not only in the country, but also abroad.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dhirubhai Ambani bade farewell to the world on July 6th, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="18">When he died he had Rs 62,000 crores.</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently his sons, Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani, are looking after his empire.</seg>
<seg id="20">Like their father, today these two brothers are at the international level of businessmen.</seg>

<seg id="1">If, after the general election, the new government continued the policy of not selling kerosene through ration shops then in half a dozen states kerosene would not be sold in these shops.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are among the states where the sale of kerosene sale will be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition to these, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and some states in the north-east are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry the decision to stop the sale of kerosene through PDS shops is based on two criteria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first criterion is that an electricity supply are being installed in the rural areas at a rapid pace.</seg>
<seg id="6">The second criterion is the LPG supply network.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that in those states where most households in the rural areas have gas connections the sale of PDS kerosene will be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Petroleum Ministry is fully prepared for this.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since October 2013 the sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to sources, under this policy the kerosene quota of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been reduced significantly.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Punjab quota of 2.72 lakh kilolitres was reduced to one lakh kilolitres.</seg>
<seg id="12">The kerosene quota allocation for Haryana was reduced by 70% and for Uttarakhand it was reduced by almost 40%.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite this reduction no shortage of kerosene has been reported by these states.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Ministry is assuming that it is clear that kerosene is used for adulteration.</seg>
<seg id="15">The difference in the price of diesel and PDS kerosene is currently Rs.37.</seg>
<seg id="16">This encourages those who carrying out adulteration.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the states where the sale of kerosene through PDS shops has been stopped, the oil companies can sell kerosene at full price on the open market.</seg>
<seg id="18">At present the oil companies are selling kerosene at a loss of Rs.39 per litre.</seg>
<seg id="19">The burden of the kerosene subsidy in the year 2013-14 is estimated to be 31,000 crore rupees.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 11:42 By Brian Wheeler Political reporter, BBC News</seg>
<seg id="3">The UK is to protest to the Spanish government "at a high level" after an armed stand-off in Gibraltarian territorial waters.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Ministry of Defence has accused a Guardia Civil patrol boat of "manoeuvring in a provocative and dangerous manner in the vicinity of Royal Navy vessels."</seg>
<seg id="5">No shots were fired in the incident.</seg>
<seg id="6">But there was a minor collision between the Spanish vessel and a Gibraltar Defence Police boat.</seg>
<seg id="7">The incident happened on Wednesday while the Gibraltar Squadron was providing force protection to a Royal Navy Fleet Auxiliary tanker in Gibraltarian territorial waters.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the Gibraltar Chronicle, the Spanish patrol boat Rio Tormes sailed too close to a Royal Navy vessel after breaching a security cordon off the British territory.</seg>
<seg id="9">Armed crew members on HMS Scimitar ordered the Spanish vessel to leave the area but the Guardia Civil vessel reportedly ignored the warning, resulting in a stand-off.</seg>
<seg id="10">Speaking in the House of Lords on Thursday, Conservative peer Baroness Hooper said "guns were pointed at each other" during Wednesday's incident.</seg>
<seg id="11">Asked to confirm this, a Foreign Office spokesman said the Royal Navy crew had followed "appropriate operational procedures."</seg>
<seg id="12">The spokesman confirmed that "there was an incident" and that it would be "raised at a high level with the Spanish government."</seg>
<seg id="13">Business minister Lord Ahmad told Lady Hooper he would write to her with the "full facts" about the incident.</seg>

<seg id="7">"After that injury, we thought there was no chance of his playing for the Storm again this year and no chance at the World Cup," Smith said.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he was actually able to come back and play a couple of games for us back home and it's great he's got an opportunity now to play at this World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="9">He's only a young kid.</seg>

<seg id="1">French director slams Taiwan paparazzi</seg>
<seg id="2">FRENCH film director Luc Besson has slammed paparazzi in Taiwan for interfering with the shooting of his latest film starring Scarlett Johansson, but denied reports that he considered leaving the island early in disgust over their actions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Besson spent 11 days in Taipei filming Lucy with Johansson, who plays a drug mule whose contact with a "super-serum" endows her with superhuman abilities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking the day after he finished shooting the Taiwan part of the film, Besson blasted the paparazzi for dogging production, saying it was his right as a director to keep details, such as Johansson's hairstyle and wardrobe, out of the public eye until Lucy is released.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We don't want pictures with new dresses of Scarlett," he said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sometime I lost a bit of my concentration because I'm bothered by that.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Shooting at night time was a nightmare" because of constant paparazzi intrusions, he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Besson singled out two unnamed agencies from Hong Kong for special condemnation, but labelled as incorrect press reports that he wanted to leave Taiwan early to register his disapproval of their actions.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I read in the newspaper that I was ready to leave," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="11">Besson also said it was incorrect to say that drug smuggling was the focus of the film, saying it comprised only a very small part.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The film is about pure intelligence," he said, declining to elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="13">We're basically using 10 per cent of our brain.</seg>
<seg id="14">What happens when we use more?</seg>
<seg id="15">Besson said work on the film would take another year, and that it was still too early to talk about a release date.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger over Bali bomb plotter's sentence</seg>
<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">"He should be put in front of the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and "died" three times while on life support.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.</seg>
<seg id="18">To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it's not much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He didn't give himself up," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek may yet appeal his sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Statue of former coach Jerry Tarkanian unveiled at UNLV</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- A bronze statue of retired basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian on the University of Nevada at Las Vegas campus is "beautiful," Tarkanian said at the unveiling.</seg>
<seg id="3">The statue depicts Tarkanian, 83, twice as large as life, in a familiar pose, seated on a folding chair while nervously chewing on a towel.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a posture seen by UNLV fans when he coached the team from 1973 to 1992 -- leading the Runnin' Rebels to four appearances in the NCAA men's tournament Final Fours and a national title in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tarkanian -- whose nickname was "Tark the Shark" -- resigned at UNLV coach after the 1991-92 season, following allegations some of his players had fraternized with a well known gambler.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hall of Fame's official sculptor, Brian Hanlon, made the statue, which was installed Wednesday in front of UNLV's basketball arena, the Thomas and Mack Center, the Las Vegas Sun reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This beautiful statue is a lasting tribute not only to me but all my players and coaches," Tarkanian said at the unveiling ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="9">I never dreamed something like this would happen.</seg>
<seg id="10">I'm deeply grateful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Govan Berth Cranes to come down</seg>
<seg id="2">The shipyards ARE Govan.</seg>
<seg id="3">The over-riding sentiment from those who have grown up in the shadows of the yards, raised to be ferociously proud of Govan's shipbuilding industry and the men that made it prosperous.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's an industry locals now feel may soon be gone forever.</seg>
<seg id="5">Govanites who have lived in the area are forlorn at a decision by BAE Systems to fell the Govan berth cranes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not saddened just because they will miss sight of the cranes which have been idle for so long.</seg>
<seg id="7">But because their heritage is being slowly eroded, and what it might signal for the future.</seg>
<seg id="8">One local, John Moriarty, 82, said matter of factly: "That spells the end of it, doesn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="9">I hope locals would feel the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">I don't think they should bring them down.</seg>
<seg id="11">""The decision's always made before they announce it to the people.</seg>
<seg id="12">I don't think we can do much about it.""</seg>
<seg id="13">Campaign</seg>
<seg id="14">""A local campaign wouldn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can't change things like that anymore.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the decision is made that's it.</seg>
<seg id="17">People haven't been able to voice their opinions on thing like that for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'll be very sad when they are taken down.</seg>
<seg id="19">""I worked on the shipyards for nine years in the canteen," said Morag Docherty, 54."</seg>
<seg id="20">""I heard they are taking them down but two are getting rebuilt across the water.</seg>
<seg id="21">I think some of it will go to scrap, canny build them all.</seg>
<seg id="22">The shipyards are Govan.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shipbuilding</seg>
<seg id="24">I mean years ago what was it like?</seg>
<seg id="25">You couldn't get down the Govan road for all the men coming out but now they're all made redundant or whatever.</seg>
<seg id="26">Another resident, Stewart Greig, 60, said: "I think it's the final nail in the coffin isn't it, there wont be any shipbuilding anymore."</seg>
<seg id="27">""Even if you move things about.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well that's progress for you.</seg>
<seg id="29">If they don't need them they don't need them.</seg>
<seg id="30">Its like everything else, like all these wee shops.</seg>
<seg id="31">If there's no people buying things from them, they go.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's terrible.</seg>
<seg id="33">""It's one of these things.</seg>
<seg id="34">We won't know until next year until the independence vote.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's all politics.</seg>
<seg id="36">Money - something Govan hasn't got.</seg>
<seg id="37">Agnes Faulkner, 60, said: "I've been here 22 year now."</seg>
<seg id="38">You'd miss the sight of them.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's part of the heritage, it's always been there.</seg>
<seg id="40">You open your window and you can see them.</seg>
<seg id="41">And as the sun set over the cranes again tonight, she added:</seg>
<seg id="42">We'll really miss them.</seg>
<seg id="43">Part of Govan will be missing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Travel is down the Christmas list this year as more of us holiday at home</seg>
<seg id="2">Louise Hemsley-Smith and Joch Bosworth with children Celia and Peggy at Silver Sands beach, Aldinga.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALMOST half of South Australians surveyed have dodged the travel bug this year, choosing to spend their Christmas holidays at home.</seg>
<seg id="4">An adelaidenow survey of 530-plus people found that 46.9 per cent of respondents will stay at home, while 24.5 per cent will travel elsewhere in the state, 13.5 per cent in the country and 15.1 per cent overseas.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fifty per cent reasoned that it was too expensive to leave home and 46.4 per cent said they are just too busy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Social analyst David Chalke said uncertainty with the economy means people are more likely to spend time with the family this silly season.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Because of the age of uncertainty that we live in at the moment family and home are more important to us than they have ever been before," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Chalke also said that we have turned our homes into a paradise we're loath to leave.</seg>
<seg id="9">"At the end of the day when you look at what happened over the last 10 to 15 years we have spent large amounts of money and effort making our homes into a resort," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">For those who are opting to explore our state this Christmas, 32.5 per cent will head to the Fleurieu Peninsula while the Yorke Peninsula is the place of choice for 28.9 per cent of survey respondents.</seg>
<seg id="11">While this is usually the case for Louise Hemsley-Smith, 42, and family - who in the past have spent their holidays at a beach house in Port Willunga - this year work commitments mean they will remain in the comfort of their home, opting to make regular day trips to the beach instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our cellar door is open (Battle of Bosworth Wines) every day apart from New Year's Day, Christmas Day and Boxing Day so this year we're staying at home ... every other day we will visit the beach," Ms Hemsley-Smith said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I like Aldinga Beach.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's just beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="15">You don't have to go away when you live around here.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mirroring Ms Hemsley-Smith's comments, director of marketing at the South Australian Tourism Commission David O'Loughlin said over the past 12 months it has seen a 12 per cent increase in South Australians taking day trips.</seg>
<seg id="17">" (This) shows that we have a growing appreciation for the many experiences right here in our own backyard," Mr O'Loughlin said.</seg>
<seg id="18">A great option for a hot day is a trip down to Second Valley or Victor Harbor, via the incredible wineries of McLaren Vale.</seg>

<seg id="1">Attempting a Rebound, Markets Are Mixed</seg>
<seg id="2">Stocks on Wall Street were mixed on Friday, as equities attempted a rebound following two days of losses, bolstered by strong data on manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="3">In afternoon trading the Standard & Poor's 500-share index was down 0.1 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.2 percent and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2 percent lower.</seg>
<seg id="4">European shares turned lower at the end of the week.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips ended the session down 0.5 percent, and London's FTSE 100 was closed down 0.8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reassuring signals on China's factory activity offered support to Asian markets, though Tokyo's Nikkei finished at a one-week low as the yen strengthened against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="7">Equities have been pressured since a Fed statement on Wednesday raised concerns about when the central bank would begin to scale back its stimulus program, which has contributed to the S.&P. 500"s advance of 23 percent this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The rally has taken the Dow and S.& P. repeatedly to record highs, leading some analysts to call for a pullback, especially amid some signs of slowing growth, like weak economic data and an earnings season marked by tepid revenue.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors continue to buy the dips as they believe the Fed will hold steady for a while, and that's helping to give us a bounce today," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners in New York.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would be somewhat cautious about reentering the market so quickly, since there still are headwinds out there and we haven't pulled back very much from our highs.</seg>
<seg id="11">The United States manufacturing sector last month expanded at its fastest pace in two and a half years, a rate that was stronger than expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management's survey, which followed the similarly strong Chicago Purchasing Manager's Index on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chevron was the latest company to disappoint on results, posting third-quarter revenue that was below expectations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shares of the Dow component were down 2.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recent economic data has been mixed, with this week's ADP National Employment Report coming in below expectations but the Chicago Purchasing Manager's Index sharply above forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="15">While weak data has been a concern, strong data has spurred selling on expectations it may encourage the Fed to slow its stimulus - something the central bank has said it would do once growth meets its targets.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the week thus far, both the Dow and S&P are down 0.2 percent, coming off three straight weeks of gains, while the Nasdaq has slipped 0.6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Wednesday, the Fed said it would keep buying $85 billion of bonds per month, but removed a phrase from a previous statement expressing worries about credit conditions, which some investors interpreted as a sign that the Fed could begin tapering stimulus earlier than expected.</seg>
<seg id="18">Previously, market participants were anticipating that the stimulus plan would not change until at least early next year.</seg>
<seg id="19">In company news, American International Group reported third-quarter earnings late Thursday that slightly beat expectations, though analysts had expected better results in the insurer's consumer lines business.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shares fell 6.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">United States-traded shares of Vodafone Group edged 0.3 percent lower following a Bloomberg News report that said AT&T Inc was exploring strategies for a potential takeover of the British mobile operator, citing people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="22">AT&T rose 0.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Solar companies will be in focus after First Solar posted results that beat expectations and raised its full-year profit outlook.</seg>
<seg id="24">Shares jumped 18 percent.</seg>

<seg id="1">South Koreans speed ahead in sluggish Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">©Bloomberg</seg>
<seg id="3">Hyundai Motor Company has survived the hard times</seg>
<seg id="4">Bold, shiny and blue, the newly expanded European headquarters of Hyundai Motor opened for business in early October, the latest beacon of the South Korean company's undimmed ambitions in a car market bereft of light.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Hyundai building is to be found in Offenbach, a short drive from the German city of Frankfurt, which hosts the European headquarters of Kia Motors, Hyundai's 34 per cent-owned subsidiary.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not far away are Hyundai's design centre at Rüsselsheim and its new test centre at the Nürburgring, opened in September.</seg>
<seg id="7">Inside Business</seg>
<seg id="8">Outside Germany, Hyundai operates two car plants, one in the Czech Republic and one in Turkey, with a combined annual production capacity of 500,000 units.</seg>
<seg id="9">For its part, Kia has a plant in Slovakia with a capacity of 300,000.</seg>
<seg id="10">Make no mistake, the South Koreans are in Europe to stay.</seg>
<seg id="11">Conspicuously, they hire European employees to design, manufacture, test and sell their cars, mainly to other Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="12">For governments anxious about bulging unemployment rates and current account deficits, such large-scale foreign investment is normally a cause for celebration.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the case of cars, however, European politicians and trade unionists find it hard to applaud in unison.</seg>
<seg id="14">All know that Europe's car industry suffers from chronic overcapacity.</seg>
<seg id="15">But some in one region of Europe suspect that, if an overseas manufacturer in another region is churning out cars by the hundreds of thousands, it can only do so at the expense of their own country's carmakers.</seg>
<seg id="16">The fiercest criticisms of Hyundai and Kia usually come from France, where one week ago PSA Peugeot Citroën produced a car for the last time at Aulnay-sous-Bois, a 40-year-old factory outside Paris.</seg>
<seg id="17">Arnaud Montebourg, industry minister in France's socialist government, had no sooner assumed office last year than he accused the South Korean carmakers of dumping.</seg>
<seg id="18">Later on, he suggested that any French drivers buying Hyundais or Kias would be engaging in "social cruelty" because the companies" workers in South Korea were treated almost like slave ants.</seg>
<seg id="19">Quite correctly, EU antitrust regulators view these complaints as rather missing the point.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among the reasons for the success in Europe of Hyundai and Kia are, for sure, the less expensive production costs and labour flexibility that come from setting up plants in the Czech Republic and Turkey rather than France or Italy.</seg>
<seg id="21">But there is more to it than that.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another important factor is that they provide exceptional after-sale guarantees for buyers of new cars</seg>
<seg id="23">The South Koreans offer persuasive evidence that if you make reliable, reasonably stylish cars, such as Hyundai's i30, that do not overstretch a family budget, you will not merely survive hard times, you may even expand your market share.</seg>
<seg id="24">The resources and expertise that Hyundai and Kia put into their design effort help explain why, between the onset of the 2008 financial crisis and the start of this year, the two companies doubled their combined market share in Europe to more than 6 per cent - Hyundai 3.5 per cent, Kia 2.7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Another important factor is that they provide exceptional after-sale guarantees for buyers of new cars: Hyundai gives its customers a five-year warranty with no mileage limit, Kia a seven-year warranty.</seg>
<seg id="26">These have eased whatever concerns customers once had about the quality of the vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="27">True, the South Korean acceleration has slowed this year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Hyundai once set a target of 2015 to achieve a 5 per cent market share for itself, but it now regards 2020 as more realistic.</seg>
<seg id="29">Hyundai is still a long way from challenging Volkswagen as Europe's premier mass-market carmaker.</seg>
<seg id="30">For Hyundai, the next test will be in the premium brand market segment that reaps higher margins</seg>
<seg id="31">On the other hand, Hyundai is well-positioned to keep pushing forward.</seg>
<seg id="32">By the end of 2014 Fiat, Ford, PSA Peugeot Citroën and Opel, the European subsidiary of General Motors, will all have closed at least one car plant in Europe during the financial crisis and recession of the past six years.</seg>
<seg id="33">Yet production overcapacity remains an albatross around the neck of most of Europe's mass-market car manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="34">Since their 2007 peak, new vehicle registrations have collapsed in Europe by 25 per cent, or 4.4m units.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even the modest recovery that is in sight will not quickly, or perhaps ever, return sales of new cars to their previous heights.</seg>
<seg id="36">The price discounts on mass-market cars to which consumers have become accustomed will continue to weigh on profits.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Hyundai, the next test will be in the premium brand market segment that reaps higher margins.</seg>
<seg id="38">It has high hopes for its Genesis sedan, which will make its European debut next year.</seg>
<seg id="39">Europe's traditional carmakers cannot say they have not been warned.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eike Batista to sit on both sides of debt talks</seg>
<seg id="2">©Reuters</seg>
<seg id="3">Batista, CEO of EBX Group, gestures to the audience during a ceremony in celebration of the start of oil production of OGX in Rio de Janeiro</seg>
<seg id="4">Creditors of Brazilian businessman Eike Batista's failed oil enterprise OGX will have an unlikely competitor for any proceeds paid out from the group's debt restructuring talks - the industrialist himself.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Batista's oil services company OSX is one of the biggest contractors of OGX with claims estimated at up to $2.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="6">The group has included $900m of this in its estimated liabilities of $5.1bn, but if the full amount was realised it would take the total to $6.8bn.</seg>
<seg id="7">IN Oil & Gas</seg>
<seg id="8">"The size and treatment of OSX's obligations could negatively impact recovery value for [OGX's] unsecured notes," said Moody's Investors Service in a note on Thursday downgrading OGX's credit rating to "C" from "Ca" to reflect its forecast of a low recovery rate for the bonds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moody's expects recovery to be less than 20 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Batista, who once touted his group as Brazil's largest private sector oil explorer, filed for bankruptcy protection in a Rio de Janeiro court on Wednesday, triggering Latin America's largest corporate default.</seg>
<seg id="11">The demise of his "X" empire of mostly start-up companies in oil, mining, energy and logistics is expected to lead to one of the country's most complicated debt restructuring processes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under Brazilian bankruptcy law, the controlling shareholder of a company is required to present the restructuring plan to the court, meaning that creditors of OGX will encounter Mr Batista on both sides of the table.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not only will he be helping to run the bankruptcy process with the power to veto outside competing offers to his proposals, he will also have a voice in the creditor group through OSX, in which his EBX Group holds a stake estimated earlier this year at 77.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="14">"OSX management has indicated it believes its claim is $2.6bn," said a debt restructuring plan from one of OGX's advisers, Blackstone, posted on the company's website.</seg>
<seg id="15">Under Brazilian regulations, OSX's claims are likely to be considered on par with bondholders and other unsecured creditors of the company, bankruptcy specialists say.</seg>
<seg id="16">OSX has already begun action against OGX, on Tuesday announcing it was rescinding a charter for one of its floating oil platforms with OGX and also declaring a debt standstill with creditors of the leasing company for the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="17">The platform, OSX-1, is being used on one of OGX's defunct fields, Tubarao Azul.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tubarao Azul was one of OGX's only production fields, but it repeatedly missed production forecasts until the company announced earlier this year it was likely to be closed down, sparking the collapse of Mr Batista's business empire.</seg>
<seg id="19">OSX said the decision to rescind the contract and call the standstill was in "in function of the non-payment by the client."</seg>
<seg id="20">The oil services company's close relationship with OGX has sparked speculation that it could also file for judicial protection on its debt, estimated at $2.66bn by JPMorgan earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">But a person familiar with the OSX creditors" position said there was no suggestion yet of such a filing.</seg>
<seg id="22">OSX could not be reached for comment.</seg>

<seg id="3">Suggestions that Australian intelligence services had spied on Indonesian politicians were "not cricket" and Jakarta wanted an explanation, Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Marty Natalegawa said in Perth on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, the Indonesian government demanded clarification of any suggestion Australia's embassy in Jakarta was used to tap into the phone conversations of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono or other high-ranking officials.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australia's ambassador to Jakarta, Greg Moriarty, was summoned to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry to explain.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fairfax Media this week revealed Australian embassies, including in Jakarta, and high commissions across Asia were being used to secretly intercept phone calls and data as part of a US-led global spying network.</seg>
<seg id="7">Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop, who was also in Perth hosting a regional meeting attended by her Indonesian counterpart, confirmed that Dr Natalegawa had raised his concerns with her and that she was taking them seriously.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asia factory activity picks up; Britain coasts along</seg>
<seg id="2">Demand for exports drove the fastest upturn in Asia's factories in months during October, led by China, as Friday's business surveys also showed UK manufacturers still expanding.</seg>
<seg id="3">The latest batch of purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), which survey thousands of manufacturers worldwide, showed Chinese factory growth hitting an 18-month high, and British factories sustaining a solid rate of expansion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although data from the U.S. due later on Friday are expected to show a slight slowdown in industrial growth, taken together, the PMIs point to a gradual improvement in global economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="5">They follow a month in which a political standoff in Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling and the sixth straight cut in IMF global economic forecasts had raised fresh concerns about the health of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Overall, the data is positive for global demand," said Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="7">"There are reasons to be optimistic, but cautiously optimistic," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The raft of Asian PMIs showed why.</seg>
<seg id="9">Taiwan's PMI reached its highest level since March 2012, Indonesia's index hit a four-month high and Japan's PMI rose to its strongest level in well over three years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The major Asian economies of China, Japan, South Korea and India reported new export orders expanding simultaneously for the first time since May, which economists attributed partly to the gradual improvement in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most major European PMIs, including that for the euro zone, come next week because of a holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Britain, which has been at the forefront of Europe's tentative economic recovery, saw continued growth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Data company Markit said its October UK manufacturing PMI edged slightly lower to 56.0 from a downwardly revised 56.3 in September.</seg>
<seg id="14">But anything over 50 means expansion and the latest number remains within striking distance of August's two-year peak of 57.1. <GB/PMIM> "With the domestic economy recovering strongly, all important export markets either growing or at least improving and a broadly stable exchange rate, output in this key sector looks set to contribute its share to the recovery," said Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg.</seg>
<seg id="15">China's official PMI rose to 51.4 in October from 51.1 in September, topping expectations for a reading of 51.2.</seg>
<seg id="16">A similar report from HSBC/Markit increased to 50.9, a seven-month high.</seg>
<seg id="17">It showed a tick up in the pace of new domestic and export orders, as well as the first increase in employment in seven months.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The PMI data for October shows a continued increase, indicating a preliminary stabilisation in the economy," Zhang Liqun, an economist at the cabinet think-tank Development Research Center, said in a statement released with the official PMI.</seg>
<seg id="19">China's reassuring PMI reading limited losses in Asian stocks, which were under pressure after strong U.S. data added to uncertainty over when the U.S. Federal Reserve might begin to ease back on its stimulus.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry says US spying has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedented admission</seg>
<seg id="2">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has "reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."</seg>
<seg id="6">He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="8">And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: "We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."</seg>
<seg id="12">There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said the itinerary is still being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some "tough love" will also be dispensed.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying," Murphy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

<seg id="2">By Jonathan Kaminsky</seg>
<seg id="3">OLYMPIA, Washington (Reuters) - Two female workers at a bikini-themed coffee stand near Seattle have been charged with providing customers nude, striptease-style dances in full view of passersby, authorities said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The women, aged 20 and 21, both employees at the Hillbilly Hotties coffee stand in Everett, were arrested on Wednesday and charged with violating the city's adult entertainment laws, said Everett police spokesman officer Aaron Snell.</seg>
<seg id="5">A third woman worker at the stand, age 33, was arrested and charged with lewd conduct in connection with a case from June at a separate nearby coffee stand in which police said workers were alleged to have performed sex acts on customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">The nature of the accusation against her was not immediately clear.</seg>
<seg id="7">All the charges are misdemeanors, which carry a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bail for each was set at $500.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police began investigating the coffee stand after receiving complaints that the women working there were exposing themselves for customers as they sat in their cars, Snell said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's right on the main drag and anybody walking by can pretty much see it," Snell said.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's probably why we were getting complaints.</seg>
<seg id="12">Snell said the business itself was not facing any charges.</seg>
<seg id="13">The stand's Facebook page declared it open for business shortly after the raid.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its owner, Jovanna Edge, was not immediately available for comment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same coffee stand was robbed at gunpoint last month by a 12-year-old boy who was on a bike and fled with about $15 from the tip jar.</seg>

<seg id="2">A wayward goose sparked a European goose chase when it failed to turn up in Scotland for winter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Orange CBZ, a barnacle goose, was knocked 900 miles off course on his way from the Arctic to the Dumfriesshire wetlands where he is accustomed to pass the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the furthest south that the cold-loving species has ever been recorded, and it means the hardy bird travelled a whopping 2,900 miles for his summer holiday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Around 30,000 of the distinctive monochrome birds migrate annually from Norway's Svalbard to wetlands in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, when arctic temperature become too chilly.</seg>
<seg id="6">Orange CBZ had safely made the journey for six years running but when he failed to appear this year, staff at the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust who look after the site feared the worst.</seg>
<seg id="7">But they were contacted by birdwatcher Emilio Martinez, who spotted the wayward goose enjoying the sunshine on the Rouxique marshes near Vigo, on northwest Spain's Atlantic coast.</seg>
<seg id="8">He matched the bird to the centre in Scotland using a code on his leg ring, on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="9">WWT species research officer Dr Larry Griffin said: "We're gobsmacked.</seg>
<seg id="10">Barnacle geese have a tough life facing extreme weather and food scarcity so we had started to assume this one hadn't made it.</seg>
<seg id="11">To find out he's actually made a record journey south and been sunning himself in Spain is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">By ringing the wild birds under our protection, we can find out where they go and where they might need further protection.</seg>
<seg id="13">We're hugely indebted to birdwatchers like Emilio who record the leg rings they spot and let us know where the birds have got to.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's possible that Orange CBZ was disoriented by the recent bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="15">He'll need to rest and feed himself up after such a long journey.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once he leaves Spain, we'll be keeping a special eye out to see if he returns to the Costa del Solway.</seg>

<seg id="1">In a recent media report it was said that the NSA hacked into the data centres of Yahoo and Google for surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Washington Post exposed this based on the documents collected by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report, the NSA program was called Muscular, and was run together with their British counterpart - GCHQ.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both agencies stole data passing through the vast network of fibre optic cables laid by Yahoo and Google.</seg>
<seg id="5">On January 9th, 2013 the Washington Post reported, quoting a top secret document, that more than 18 million documents were stolen within just 3 days from the beginning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="6">These included email, text, audio and video messages.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Washington Post the program was run out of the U.S. and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA to access this information.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the newspaper it was much easier for the NSA to run the program outside the U.S. because in the U.S. such campaigns must have court orders.</seg>
<seg id="9">During a press conference in Washington the NSA Chief, General Keith Alexander, denied these allegations saying, "As far as I know, this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="10">The NSA has always gathered its information only within the framework of the law".</seg>
<seg id="11">The NSA recently became a target after spying on the German Chancellor.</seg>

<seg id="4">The exact line as written on the ticket said: "Driving with Monitor visible to Driver (Google Glass)."</seg>
<seg id="5">Abadie said the actual law tells drivers not to "drive a vehicle equipped with a video monitor, if the monitor is visible to the driver and displays anything other than vehicle information global mapping displays, external media player (MP3), or satellite radio information."</seg>
<seg id="6">In her Google+ post, Abadie posed this question: "Is #GoogleGlass [illegal] while driving or is this cop wrong???"</seg>
<seg id="7">Seeking legal advice, she asked people if they knew of similar tickets doled out to Google Glass wearers anywhere in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abadie's legal predicament triggered a flurry of responses to her post.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many questioned the legality of the ticket and some have encouraged her to fight it in court.</seg>

<seg id="1">Marvin Gaye's family sues Robin Thicke over 'Blurred Lines'</seg>
<seg id="2">Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" will surely go down as one of the biggest songs of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="3">The slinky dance track was No.</seg>
<seg id="4">1 for 12 weeks, sold more than 6 million copies and served as the soundtrack for one of the most deliciously trainwrecky VMA performances ever.</seg>
<seg id="5">It also has had its share of controversy, including its NSFW video, critics blasting its sexual lyrics and the family of late soul legend Marvin Gaye calling it a blatant rip-off.</seg>
<seg id="6">In August, Thicke, Pharrell Williams and Clifford Harris Jr. (better known as T.I.) went to a California federal court to pre-emptively protect the single from allegations that it infringed upon Gaye's hit "Got to Give It Up" and the Funkadelic song "Sexy Ways."</seg>
<seg id="7">Despite that, Gaye's family has filed a countersuit.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, the family of the late singer claims that Thicke not only ripped off "Got to Give It Up" but that he also infringed on the copyright to Gaye's "After the Dance" for the title track of his 2011 album, "Love After War."</seg>
<seg id="9">The family further claims that the pop-R&B crooner's "Marvin Gaye fixation" extends to other songs in his discography, according to the Hollywood Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the suit, the family accuses Thicke of writing a similar chorus, melody and more in "Love After War" that echoes "After the Dance" and goes on to accuse Thicke of "including the similar bridge and identical lyrics from Marvin Gaye's 'I Want You' in Thicke's similarly-themed work, 'Make U Love Me' ""</seg>
<seg id="11">The attorney for Thicke's camp, Howard King, gave The Hollywood Reporter this response:</seg>
<seg id="12">""Plaintiffs anticipated a baseless counterclaim for copyright infringement when they filed their original complaint for declaratory relief, so no surprise there.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is surprising in their press-release-disguised-as-a-complaint (much of which will eventually be stricken by the court) is their acknowledgment that the Gaye family has no standing to bring a copyright claim.</seg>
<seg id="14">For this, they blame EMI, the administrator and registered copyright owner of the Marvin Gaye songs.</seg>
<seg id="15">PHOTOS: Musicians' onstage snafus</seg>
<seg id="16">Obviously, EMI, which is in the business of collecting substantial sums for actual infringements, regardless of the publishing affiliations of the infringers, consulted their own expert musicologists who gave the same opinion our 3 musicologists gave: The genres of the songs are the same, the notes are different.</seg>
<seg id="17">So whether or not plaintiffs are fans of Marvin Gaye is irrelevant; no infringement occurred here.</seg>
<seg id="18">The suit also targets Gaye's music publisher, EMI April, which now operates under the company that oversees Thicke's music.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the lawsuit, the family accuses the publisher of not protecting Gaye's songs, attempting to intimidate them from taking legal action, not being neutral and trying to turn public opinion against them.</seg>
<seg id="20">They want EMI to lose the rights to Gaye's catalog, as well as all profits accumulated from "Blurred Lines."</seg>
<seg id="21">In the suit, Gaye's family also claims that the chairman of EMI contacted its legal representatives and accused them of "ruining an incredible song," "killing the goose that laid the golden egg" and being the reason why "Blurred Lines" lost the MTV Video Music Awards it was nominated for and that the lawsuit might kill any chances that Thicke would win a Grammy for song of the year.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the suit, the family quotes music critics at the New York Times and Rolling Stone who wrote about similarities between the two hit singles and included a reported from a musicologist who claims Thicke's song far surpasses "the similarities that might result from attempts to evoke an 'era' of music or a shared genre" and point to a GQ interview where Thicke said he found inspiration in the track.</seg>

<seg id="1">The cause of the death of the tigress was not clear, even after the post-mortem.</seg>
<seg id="2">The forest department, giving an evasive answer, said that prima-facie, the tigress seemed to have died a natural death.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday night the forest employees of the Pawalgarh Conservation reserve of the Ramnagar Forest department found a tigress's body near the Khichadi drain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tigress's body was intact and no signs of wounds or injury were found on the body.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Friday an autopsy was conducted on the body of the tigress by CTR veterinarian Bharat and Kotabagh veterinarian Hema Rathore in the presence of the Conservator of Forests, Vivek Pandey, the CTR deputy director, Saket Badola, DFO Kahakasha Naseem, and SDO J.S. Karkee.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to sources, during the autopsy, the internal organs of the tigress were reported to be damaged.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because of this the actual cause of death of the tigress was not known.</seg>
<seg id="8">Department officials are giving evasive answers about the death of the tigress.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, to test for the presence of poison, the internal organs have been sent to IVRI Barelli for a toxicology test.</seg>
<seg id="10">Vivek Pandey, the Conservator of Forest Western Circle, said that the tigress's death could be considered as natural.</seg>
<seg id="11">There were no traces of poison in the body.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, a search of the surrounding areas was carried out and the viscera were sent to be tested for the presence of poison.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">But mice who had not been given the vaccine "chilled out," say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.</seg>

<seg id="1">When the exciting Indian team plays at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium after their spectacular win in the last match for the seventh and last one-day against Australia, they will be aiming to win this match and win the series.</seg>
<seg id="2">After rains washed out the last two one-day matches, they had to win the Nagpur one-day for India to remain in the series, and its batsmen played an amazing game and had a record win, levelling the series at 2-2.</seg>
<seg id="3">In this series team India has achieved the target of 350 or more runs twice and once again the responsibility to save the team lies with the batsmen.</seg>
<seg id="4">Indian batting is at its peak now and even the bigger targets seem small to them.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohile and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but the team also has high expectations of Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.</seg>
<seg id="6">As far as opening is concerned, the opening pair of Rohit and Shikhar is making the job easier for the other batsmen, with their strong partnership.</seg>
<seg id="7">They gave Virat the opportunity to bat without any pressure in Jaipur and Nagpur with their remarkable opening partnership.</seg>
<seg id="8">Given the great performance by Virat up until now at No.3, he is being seen as the future Sachin Tendulkar.</seg>
<seg id="9">Actually, a lot of cricket greats have said that he is better than Sachin.</seg>
<seg id="10">Virat, who is completing 25 years next week, has scored 17 one-day centuries out of which 16 have lead to an Indian victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">While chasing a target his average is above 80 and he has emerged as a excellent finisher.</seg>
<seg id="12">The top three batmen of India are in great form, but too much reliance on these three can also be damaging for the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">Raina and Yuvraj were very bog flops in the last match.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yuvraj could not even open his account in the two matches of the series.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because of this, a good innings at the Bengaluru one-day would be a 'lifeline' for him.</seg>
<seg id="16">As far as Australia team is concerned, their batsmen especially Captain George Bailey, has impressed everyone with his performances.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has been demand to include him in the Home Ashes test team against England.</seg>
<seg id="18">Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.</seg>
<seg id="19">Besides of Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 06:01</seg>
<seg id="3">Police investigating the murder of a Blackpool teenager say they hope people who have never come forward might now have the confidence to do so.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officers are renewing their appeal for information on the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of Charlene Downes.</seg>
<seg id="5">They believe 14-year-old Charlene was one of a number of girls who were groomed for sex by men in the town.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lancashire Police said others affected by abuse would now be adults and might be more willing to share information.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police also hope the publicity surrounding recent "high profile" grooming cases will encourage new witnesses to speak to them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Charlene's body has never been found and no-one has been convicted of killing her.</seg>
<seg id="9">At a retrial in 2008 a man was cleared of her murder, and another man was found not guilty of helping to dispose of the teenager's body.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brushed under carpet</seg>
<seg id="11">Four years after Charlene's disappearance another Blackpool girl, 15-year-old Paige Chivers, went missing.</seg>
<seg id="12">She is also presumed to have been murdered.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officers said the two cases were not directly connected, but said there were similarities.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlene's mother, Karen Downes, said: "I'm still as devastated as I was 10 years ago, and I still live in hope that one day she will be found.</seg>
<seg id="15">I will never give up until justice is done for her, and I'm very disappointed that nothing has been done by now.</seg>
<seg id="16">She added: "I want the police to do more, they have done nothing in the past five years since the case collapsed, they have just brushed it under the carpet or put it in a dusty cupboard somewhere."</seg>
<seg id="17">Assistant Chief Constable Andy Rhodes said: "Charlene was involved in a situation in Blackpool around child sexual exploitation, and her disappearance is linked to that problem in Blackpool at the time.</seg>
<seg id="18">We think there are people out there that know things and have never come forward.</seg>
<seg id="19">We also think there are people out there, who were children involved in that scene at the time, who may now have the confidence to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="20">He added: "We are not connecting the murders [of Charlene and Paige] directly, but they were obviously in the same area and the same scene in terms of child sexual exploitation, so we think there's significant amounts of consistencies in terms of how these tragic murders occurred."</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt swears in first freely elected president</seg>
<seg id="2">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre," his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.</seg>
<seg id="14">Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was greeted with chants of, "The army and the people are one hand," from the hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture room.</seg>
<seg id="16">Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="2">WILLARD, Ohio Many questions remained Thursday in a police investigation into a standoff at a small-town Family Dollar store in northern Ohio that ended in the deaths of a hostage and her alleged abductor.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police identified the hostage as Kim A. Kelley of New Washington, southwest of Willard.</seg>
<seg id="4">But they couldn't immediately confirm her age.</seg>
<seg id="5">Willard police Chief Mark Holden said earlier he didn't know what the gunman's motive was in taking hostages at the store Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Holden said the standoff ended when the man with a .22-caliber rifle killed the woman and then himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">The chief identified the man as 19-year-old Shawn Schuett, originally from Mansfield.</seg>
<seg id="8">Holden said that during negotiations, Schuett didn't ask for anything except some Chinese food.</seg>
<seg id="9">Schuett told negotiators that he had not come there to rob the store.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He made one demand, and it was for General Tso's chicken," Holden said at a news conference Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="11">Schuett forced a woman at gunpoint to drive him to the store, but he let her go when he got there, Holden said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Once inside, he barricaded the front of the store with carts and shelving units and took two employees hostage just before 5:30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="13">A number of police agencies, including hostage negotiators, responded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Several of Schuett's relatives also were at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="15">About 8 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="16">Wednesday, after one hostage managed to escape out a back door, officers broke through the front window and stormed the store to find the gunman and hostage shot.</seg>
<seg id="17">The hostage died later at a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="18">Willard, with a population of about 6,000 people, is 90 miles north of Columbus.</seg>

<seg id="10">So spare a thought for this shop manager as she guides Her Majesty into a family-run seaside fish market today.</seg>
<seg id="11">From some angles, it might appear she caught the fabric of the monarch's cerise coat as they walked side by side during the Queen's visit to Newhaven, East Sussex.</seg>
<seg id="12">Faux pas: Shop manager Kerry Bickerstaff appeared to touch the Queen as she escorted her inside West Quay Fisheries in Newhaven, East Sussex</seg>
<seg id="13">Mistake?</seg>
<seg id="14">Friends of the woman photographed here, Kerry Bickerstaff, 37, insist hers was only an instinctive and caring gesture as she shepherded the Queen, 87, along the street</seg>
<seg id="15">According to centuries-old protocol, the Queen should not be touched in any way beyond a polite handshake.</seg>
<seg id="16">Who can forget the furore when former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating touched her lower back with his arm as he attempted to guide her gently through the crowd back in 1992?</seg>
<seg id="17">That helped to earn him the unfortunate nickname of "Lizard of Oz."</seg>
<seg id="18">Then there was that incident with Louis Garneau, a former cycling champion, who casually placed his arm around the Queen's shoulders for a snapshot taken by his wife during a royal tour of Canada in 2002, leading to disapproving splutters from veteran courtiers.</seg>

<seg id="22">But in fact while aides eyebrows can sometimes be raised when such "rules" are breached, the Queen's never are - and she accepts that people do get excited when they meet her.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has shown no signs of slowing down with his royal duties despite recent health scares.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it appears that at 92, Prince Philip could finally be feeling his age.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was seen looking a little strained as he accompanied the Queen on their royal visit to East Sussex yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Philip spent the summer recovering from abdominal surgery in June but was soon back to work and carrying out engagements.</seg>
<seg id="27">In any case, friends of the woman photographed here, Kerry Bickerstaff, 37, insist hers was only an instinctive and caring gesture as she shepherded the Queen, 87, along the street.</seg>
<seg id="28">"She crooked her arm round behind her back as is natural and anyone would - and she didn't touch the Queen," said one.</seg>
<seg id="29">A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: "She did not touch the Queen, and even if she had done the Queen would have taken no offence."</seg>
<seg id="30">Indeed, the Queen accepts that people do get excited when they meet her - and it is her aides who are much more likely to raise eyebrows when such 'rules' are breached.</seg>
<seg id="31">Last year, the Queen put a friendly arm around Michelle Obama's waist at a Buckingham Palace G20 reception, prompting the U.S. President's wife to return the gesture and rub her shoulder.</seg>

<seg id="35">The sight of the Queen publicly hugging another woman astonished other guests.</seg>
<seg id="36">It was the first time that anyone could remember in her long public life that she has put her arm around another woman.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Palace called it "a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation."</seg>
<seg id="38">On the subject of protocol, the Buckingham Palace website says: "The Queen meets thousands of people each year in the UK and overseas."</seg>
<seg id="39">Big moment: Abigail Venter, aged four, looked delighted as she curtseyed to the Queen in Lewes</seg>
<seg id="40">Looking good: Both the Queen and the Duke appeared to be in good spirits as they made their appearance</seg>
<seg id="41">Before meeting Her Majesty, many people ask how they should behave.</seg>
<seg id="42">The simple answer is that there are no obligatory codes of behaviour - just courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="43">Today the Queen was one her way into West Quay Fisheries, which has been open for almost 40 years, when the near miss happened.</seg>
<seg id="44">Inside, she and the Duke of Edinburgh were shown more than 40 varieties of fish caught by a local fleet including crab, lobsters, monk fish, conger eel and squid.</seg>
<seg id="45">Mrs Bickerstaff said: 'It's an honour.</seg>
<seg id="46">We had the Duke of Kent about 10 years ago but I have never met the Queen before.</seg>
<seg id="47">It's great news for the community to have her here.'</seg>
<seg id="48">Not quite Bucky P but it'll do!</seg>
<seg id="49">The Queen and Prince Philip are intrigued by the glamping pods</seg>
<seg id="50">Grand opening: The Queen unveiled the plaque at the YSA before moving on to tour other parts of East Sussex</seg>
<seg id="51">They also got a taste of Glastonbury-style "glamping" when they viewed the upmarket wooden camping pods at a new £5 million 68-bed youth hostel in the South Downs National Park.</seg>
<seg id="52">When Allison Green, YHA's operations director, asked Philip, 92, if he was having a good visit, he replied: "Well, it depends what's a good visit but I'm unlikely to tell you I'm having a bad one."</seg>
<seg id="53">Their engagements today also included a visit to Harvey's Brewery in Lewes - where the Duke's expression was equally stoic as they got out of their car on arrival.</seg>
<seg id="54">Meanwhile, the Queen's thrifty instinct was seen today as she made a third public appearance in a favourite cerise and black ensemble she wore twice during last year's Jubilee celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="55">Inspection: The Queen meets children whipping up a selection of Halloween cakes at the YMA in Lewes</seg>
<seg id="56">Stiff: The Duke of Edinburgh appears a little stiff as he emerges from the car outside the West Quay Fisheries</seg>
<seg id="57">The monarch wore the Angela Kelly designed pink cashmere coat and dress during today's visit to Lewes, where she and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the YHA before continuing to Newhaven.</seg>
<seg id="58">The outfit first appeared in March 2012 when she wore the ensemble on a visit to Leicester with the Duchess of Cambridge.</seg>
<seg id="59">Two months later, the ensemble reappeared during a Diamond Jubilee visit to a Mad Hatter's tea party in Sherbourne.</seg>
<seg id="60">The local community has been mourning the loss this week of 14-year-old Dylan Alkins who was swept out to sea while playing in the surf at Newhaven on Sunday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="61">Applause: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were greeted by cheering crowds as they arrived in Newhaven</seg>

<seg id="1">The special Task Force (STF) exposed the fraud in the 2012 PMT just a day ago.</seg>
<seg id="2">The STF found discrepancies in the enrolment numbers of 700 students.</seg>
<seg id="3">Amongst them almost 125 students had been admitted into medical college.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now these students admissions will be declared void.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the STF's revelation the medical examination department has started considering cancelling these students' admissions.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the information provided the department is waiting for a complete list of all suspect students from the STF.</seg>
<seg id="7">The list will be sent to the PEB to revoke the eligibility of the students involved.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although, in this case, the department is also thinking of taking legal advice.</seg>
<seg id="9">The departmental officials said that the students enrolled in 2012 have completed one year, so taking legal advice is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the case is now under an STF enquiry, Department of Medical Education officials are not in a position to make a statement.</seg>
<seg id="11">The PEB director, Tarun Pithore, said, "If the STF provides us the list of suspected students with proof, then their admission would be cancelled immediately".</seg>
<seg id="12">The Director of Medical Education, Dr.Nirbhay Srivastava, also said, "If the students' admissions were found to be forged, we would cancel their admissions".</seg>
<seg id="13">According to STF officials the forged student admissions included in the PMT for the year 2012 are under investigation.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the investigation a list of the suspected students will be given to the PEB.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is noteworthy that in the PMT exams for the year 2013 the eligibility of 345 suspect students was rescinded.</seg>
<seg id="16">Out of these 345, the Department of Medical Education has already rescinded 84 student admissions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Graham Stark - Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="2">Off screen, Stark and Sellers not only became good friends, but - as single men in the 1950s - shared many amorous adventures together, often taking girlfriends back to Sellers's flat in Finchley Road where the machinery of seduction included one of the first automatic record-players in London.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stark would later stand as best man at all of Sellers's four weddings.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although best known as a comedy actor, Stark turned in a touching performance in the film Alfie (1966) as Humphrey, the bus conductor who marries the pregnant girlfriend of Michael Caine's title character.</seg>
<seg id="5">The son of a purser on transatlantic liners, Graham William Stark was born at Wallasey, Merseyside, on January 20 1922, and educated at Wallasey Grammar School, where he acted in school plays.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was only 12 when he appeared with the Liverpool Repertory Company as Macduff's son in a production of Macbeth.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dancing lessons led to his professional debut the following year in a West End pantomime, Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves (Lyceum, 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">Moving to London in 1937, he took elocution lessons to lose his Merseyside accent and made his first, fleeting, film appearance as a bellboy in the thriller A Spy in Black (1939).</seg>
<seg id="9">At 17 Stark enrolled at Rada, but volunteered for the RAF when war intervened, joining Ralph Reader's gang shows and entertaining troops in North Africa, the Far East and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the war Stark joined the bohemian coterie frequenting the ornate Grafton Arms pub in Victoria where up-and-coming entertainers like Terry-Thomas, Jimmy Edwards, Tony Hancock, Dick Emery and Alfred Marks held court.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was in the Grafton's back bar that Stark renewed an RAF friendship with Peter Sellers while Sellers and Spike Milligan experimented with material that, in 1951, would metamorphose into The Goon Show.</seg>
<seg id="12">Graham Stark in ITV's 'Tiger Bastable' (ITV/REX)</seg>
<seg id="13">As well as providing madcap voices for The Goons, Stark also appeared in other popular radio shows of the day, notably Educating Archie, with the ventriloquist Peter Brough, and Ray's A Laugh, starring the Liverpool comedian Ted Ray.</seg>
<seg id="14">Stark had a complex relationship with Spike Milligan, who suffered from manic depression .</seg>
<seg id="15">Whenever Milligan failed to turn up for a Goon Show recording, Stark would stand in for him; and when Milligan and Sellers moved into television with A Show Called Fred in 1956, Stark joined the cast.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1963 he appeared as a psychiatrist in Milligan's bleak satirical comedy The Bed Sitting Room, set in the aftermath of World War III.</seg>
<seg id="17">But when Stark's stage performance attracted critical acclaim, Milligan flew into a jealous rage and threatened to shoot him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Since Milligan was known to keep a revolver, Stark took the threat seriously - but the two were later reconciled.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1964 Stark starred in his television comedy sketch series, The Graham Stark Show, which - although written by Johnny Speight, later to create Till Death Us Do Part - proved a flop.</seg>
<seg id="20">Stark was also an accomplished photographer, and often took pictures of stars, including Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor , whom he encountered on film sets.</seg>
<seg id="21">He published Remembering Peter Sellers in 1999 and an autobiography, Stark Naked, in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="22">Graham Stark married, in 1959, the actress Audrey Nicholson, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Newspaper review: Brooks and Coulson in news</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 05:38</seg>
<seg id="3">Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson are pictured on several front pages, after the phone-hacking trial at the Old Bailey was told they had an affair which lasted for six years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Daily Telegraph says that, sitting side by side in the dock, "neither showed any emotion" as "intimate details" of their relationship were "laid bare."</seg>
<seg id="5">In the Guardian, a cartoon by Steve Bell suggests how such a development might have been covered in the now defunct News of the World, the paper edited by both Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson.</seg>
<seg id="6">His mocked-up front page features the headline: "Ex-eds secret six-year sex romp."</seg>
<seg id="7">The main headline in the Independent describes it as "the affair they didn't expose."</seg>
<seg id="8">Mrs Brooks, Mr Coulson and six other defendants deny all the charges against them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wishy-washy</seg>
<seg id="10">The Daily Mirror is less than impressed with the Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, who told MPs on Thursday how the government intended to get tough with the big energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The paper says he could have "read the riot act to the big six" - but instead offered a few "platitudes" about increasing competition.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Daily Star accuses him of being "wishy-washy."</seg>
<seg id="13">The release from prison of the mother of Baby P is the main news in the Sun.</seg>
<seg id="14">It reports that Tracey Connelly will be given a "fresh name and different hairdo" - but not a complete new identity.</seg>
<seg id="15">The paper says she was freed on Tuesday - the day it was confirmed that the former head of children's services at Haringey Council, Sharon Shoesmith, would receive compensation for unfair dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="16">NHS pay-offs</seg>
<seg id="17">The Times reveals details of some of the pay-offs given to senior managers when 161 NHS bodies were abolished as part of a shake-up of the health service earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">It says a married couple received redundancy payments of nearly £1m between them - before they were both re-hired by the health service a few months later.</seg>
<seg id="19">The paper says its analysis suggests more than 50 staff were given payments in excess of £100,000 each, and more than a dozen of those recipients have since found work in the public sector.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Did she or didn't she?" asks the Daily Mail, which says a shop manager from East Sussex "risked the wrath of courtiers" when she appeared to touch the Queen's back.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the paper, Kerry Bickerstaff seemed to "graze the fabric" of the Queen's coat during a visit to Newhaven.</seg>
<seg id="22">Buckingham Palace insisted it was merely a near miss - and said the Queen would have taken no offence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better an ending than a prequel</seg>
<seg id="2">Reprised role: Bob Odenkirk as Breaking Bad's Saul Goodman, who is set to return in a prequel.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the life of a TV lover, there are bits of news that cause great excitement.</seg>
<seg id="4">A new season of Freaks and Geeks?</seg>
<seg id="5">Great!</seg>
<seg id="6">Then there is news that can't help but cause deep depression.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Two and a Half Men movie?</seg>
<seg id="8">Oh.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then there's the news that you just don't know what to think about.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, impending Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul, following the adventures of his fast-talking, ambulance-chasing, TV-spruiking attorney, Saul Goodman.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the one hand, Bob Odenkirk is a superb performer and Saul was a magnificent character who enriched the BB-verse in a way that went far beyond comic relief.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reason to rejoice then, that we get to see more of him.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, spin-offs are a crapshoot.</seg>
<seg id="14">Better Call Saul could be the Frasier to Breaking Bad's Cheers, but it could also be the Joey to its Friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">Not to mention the fact that just by making a spin-off, the producers are sadly reminding us that BB was just a TV show.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the doubts are complicated and intensified in this case by the fact that Better Call Saul will be a prequel.</seg>
<seg id="17">Prequels are problematic.</seg>
<seg id="18">Does it take the lustre off a show when you know what happens afterwards?</seg>
<seg id="19">How heavily do you invest in a character's story when you know where they end up before you start?</seg>
<seg id="20">Currently screening on Foxtel is The Carrie Diaries, a show about Carrie Bradshaw before Sex and the City.</seg>
<seg id="21">The show has the advantage of Carrie being played by AnnaSophia Robb, who some time in the last few years morphed from Violet Beauregarde into the most beautiful living creature ever to walk the earth.</seg>
<seg id="22">But how exciting is it to watch, when we already know that Carrie is eventually going to grow up, marry the guy from Law and Order, and make a terrible sequel in Saudi Arabia?</seg>
<seg id="23">And this season the character of Samantha shows up, which hints at the prequel's greatest menace: original character overuse, or Smallville syndrome, in which a prequel exploring the early days of a particular character becomes addicted to introducing more and more familiar characters in a frantic attempt to keep viewers hooked, until the entire past universe is populated in exactly the same way as the future universe and a show about Clark Kent's teenage years turns into Superman's answer to Muppet Babies.</seg>
<seg id="24">We can only hope that Saul Goodman doesn't get afflicted with Smallville syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's only natural to want to make a spin-off.</seg>
<seg id="26">You don't stop milking the cash cow just because it wants to pursue a movie career.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sometimes it works, but history is littered with the corpses of spin-offs that didn't have the strength to survive.</seg>
<seg id="28">For every Daria, there's an After MASH; for every The Jeffersons, there's a Baywatch Nights.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even if it does work, is it worth it?</seg>
<seg id="30">The Carrie Diaries will only ever suffer by comparison with the iconic status of its progenitor.</seg>
<seg id="31">Better Call Saul is at long odds to break ground like Breaking Bad.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes it's best to let a great TV world come to a natural end, especially when the only way you can think of postponing the end is going back to the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manchester City v Norwich: Joe Hart dropped by manager Manuel Pellegrini in favour of Costel Pantilimon</seg>
<seg id="2">Joe Hart has reportedly been dropped for Manchester City's Premier League clash with Norwich tomorrow after his blunder against Chelsea cost them a share of the points last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Telegraph is reporting that Hart is set to remain on the bench, having seen Costel Pantilimon start the Capital One Cup victory over Newcastle United on Wednesday night - the Romanian keeping a clean sheet to do his chances a world of good.</seg>
<seg id="4">Manager Manuel Pellegrini refused to confirm whether or not Hart would be dropped for the weekend's clash, but it is believed that he has already been informed that his rival for the starting berth has been favoured instead of him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pellegrini said: "Tomorrow you will know.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a decision I have to take every week with the 22 players.</seg>
<seg id="7">The England number one's absence comes after a string of errors has cost City in recent weeks, culminating in the mix-up between defender Matija Nastasic and Hart last Sunday which allowed Fernando Torres to score the winner for Chelsea after the ball looped over Hart's head.</seg>
<seg id="8">England boss Roy Hodgson will be concerned with Hart's form, although he has so far failed to slip up while wearing the Three Lions shirt, and he stuck with the 26-year-old for the crucial World Cup qualifiers against Montenegro and Poland last month which ensured their progression to next month's tournament in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pellegrini admitted that should he decide to drop Hart from his side, he would have to be "careful" not to dent his confidence, which already appears to be at a huge low.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I am very careful with all the players, not only Joe," the Chilean expressed.</seg>
<seg id="11">When asked whether Hart was disappointed about missing the midweek win, Pellegrini replied: "You must ask Joe.</seg>
<seg id="12">I can't answer for him how disappointed [he was].</seg>
<seg id="13">All of you and the players and me saw what happened but he is a football player and every week he is in the same pressure.</seg>
<seg id="14">Following last week's defeat, City sit seventh in the Premier League table, just two points and one position above rivals Manchester United who have showed signs of a return to form having battled back to victories over Sunderland and Stoke in recent weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to advertise the anniversary of the birth of Sardar Patel over the last four years.</seg>
<seg id="2">But, contrary to the claims by Modi during the NDA government (between 1994 and 2004), while Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the PM there was a time for 2 consecutive years (2001-2002) when not a single advertisement for Sardar Patel was published by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday in Kevadia,Gujarat laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meter high statue, 'the Statue of Unity', Modi said, "Earlier, there was no advertising for the anniversary of Sardar Patel.</seg>
<seg id="4">While the DAVP's records show that in 2009-10 up to 3 million, in 2010-11 to Rs 4.10 crore, in 2011-12 and Rs 2.7 crore and in 2012-13 to Rs 1.4 crore UPA had been spent on advertising for Sardar Patel.</seg>
<seg id="5">When the Union Information and Broadcasting Minister, Manish Tewari, was asked about Modi's claims he said that what the BJP's PM candidate said was not based on the facts.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2008 the UPA did not publish any ads in the name of Patel.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tiwari said that it was because of the economic downturn in that year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The amounts spent on promoting Sardar Patel are far less than the amount spent on the birth and death anniversaries of the Nehru - Gandhi family members.</seg>
<seg id="9">DAVP has spent 33 crores on the birth and death anniversaries, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and Rs.9.38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru, on print advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Manish Tiwari was asked about the difference, he said, "it should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertising.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the price of advertising depends on several things, such as the size or frequency of the advertisement for that year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The fact is that it shows our dedication without understanding that the people opposed to this are busy taking care of the legacy of a great leader.</seg>

<seg id="1">Further signs inflation has bottomed</seg>
<seg id="2">Consumers could be faced with higher prices in coming months due to an acceleration in business energy costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">New data on Friday shows prices at all levels of production jumped in the September quarter as the lower Australian dollar lifted import prices, particularly petrol.</seg>
<seg id="4">Utility prices, including electricity, also rose.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The higher business inflation reading coupled with the larger CPI reading last week does seem to suggest that inflation has bottomed out," Commonwealth Securities economist Savanth Sebastian said in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last week's consumer price index rose 1.2 per cent in the September quarter, the largest increase in a year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Friday's producer prices index (PPI) report, alongside other new figures showing a further strengthening in house prices and improved manufacturing activity both in Australia and China, cemented expectations for a stable cash rate when the central bank board meets on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Sebastian expects the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to keep interest rates on hold over the next couple of months.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It looks very likely that the low point in the rate cycle has been reached," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Friday's PPI at the final stage of production rose 1.3 per cent in the September quarter, the biggest increase in three years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Import prices surged 5.9 per cent in the quarter, reflecting the lower dollar, while domestic prices showed a more modest 0.8 per cent increase.</seg>
<seg id="12">Producer prices overall come off a low base, which left the annual rate of 1.9 per cent below the RBA's two to three per cent inflation target band.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the RBA will be keeping an eye on house prices, which rose a further 1.3 per cent in October, according to the RP Data-Rismark Home Value Index.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prices are 7.9 per cent higher over the year, rising by 6.9 per cent in the past five months.</seg>
<seg id="15">Manufacturing grew for a second month in a row as production expanded for the first time in two and a half years and new orders continued to recover.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Australian Industry Group performance of manufacturing index rose 1.5 points October to 53.2, holding above the key 50 mark that indicates activity is expanding.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said, while the result was encouraging, fundamentals facing the sector remain "very tough" with the domestic currency still a major barrier to export growth.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Manufacturers' margins remain under pressure as wage and non-wage costs continue to rise ahead of selling prices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In China, Australia's number one trading partner, the manufacturing index rose to 51.4 in October from 51.1.</seg>
<seg id="20">TD Securities head of Asia-Pacific research Annette Beacher said that would be consistent with annual Chinese growth of 8.3 per cent as of the December quarter, up from 7.8 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, she expects the Chinese government still wants to contain growth toward seven per cent in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in "airplane" mode.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said " The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members."</seg>
<seg id="8">Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
<seg id="14">For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
<seg id="15">Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes," the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="17">In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fewerer students learning to write in cursive; debate over longhand in world of texts and computers</seg>
<seg id="2">In a world of rapid technological change, more and more educators are questioning the point of teaching students cursive.</seg>
<seg id="3">FEWER students are being taught to write in cursive, with some teachers saying today's world of computers and mobile phones have made the skill obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="4">For third-grade pupils at Triadelphia Ridge Elementary School in suburban Ellicott City, an hour's drive from Washington DC, learning to write joined-up letters is a no-brainer.</seg>
<seg id="5">I like writing it sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It's kind of fun," said Oren Dubensky after he and his fellow eight-year-olds mastered their first cursive letter - "I" - after six weeks of perfecting basic pencil strokes.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's like, you don't need to do normal letters anymore," agreed classmate Sophia Spence."</seg>
<seg id="8">""You can do fancy letters, instead of just normal letters."</seg>
<seg id="9">But outside the classroom, grown-ups are debating whether the children should be studying cursive at all, in an era of swift and profound technological change.</seg>
<seg id="10">Common Core, the kindergarten-to-high school standard curriculum shared by 45 of America's 50 states (the outliers include Texas and Alaska), is silent on the subject of cursive, also known as longhand or joined-up writing.</seg>
<seg id="11">It merely calls for the teaching of block-letter handwriting, as well as "keyboarding" - the skill formerly known as typing that many contend is far more relevant today than scrawling across a sheet of paper."</seg>
<seg id="12">Almost all modern communication takes place using keyboards, making typing a far more valuable skill than writing longhand, some say.</seg>
<seg id="13">""In the United States, relatively few people use cursive," said Morgan Polikoff, an assistant professor of education policy at the University of Southern California, who sees "no compelling reason" for cursive instruction to remain on the curriculum."</seg>
<seg id="14">""In other countries, if everyone writes in cursive, it would make less sense to stop teaching it," Polikoff told AFP by email.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Here, cursive is already on the way out just via momentum, it seems to me.""</seg>
<seg id="16">""Everyone is typing, everyone is texting, so cursive is kind of thought of as a lost art," added Bernadette Lucas, principal of Melrose Avenue Elementary School in Los Angeles, where the school board is spending $US30 million ($31.6 million) to provide Apple iPads for its students.</seg>
<seg id="17">Others worry that America could be, for the first time in its history, raising a generation that is unable to sign a check or read the Constitution in its original 18th-century handwritten form.</seg>
<seg id="18">This shouldn't be happening here and now.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We're still using it in everyday things," said North Carolina legislator Pat Hurley, main sponsor of a "back to basics" education law that mandates cursive instruction in the southern state.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ms Hurley felt prompted to act - "Democrats, Republicans, they all agreed," she said - after she led a fourth-grade class from her district on a tour through the state house in Raleigh."</seg>
<seg id="21">A US lawmaker is pushing to keep cursive on the curriculum after receiving a group of thank you notes from students - and only the teacher's was in cursive.</seg>
<seg id="22">""Their teacher had them each write a thank-you letter on lined paper," she told AFP.</seg>
<seg id="23">Well, the teacher's thank-you note was in cursive; the children's notes were all printed.</seg>
<seg id="24">"That's when I first realised I didn't think they were being taught.""</seg>
<seg id="25">Research by Laura Dinehart of Florida International University's college of education in Miami indicates that four-year-olds with strong handwriting skills of any kind are more likely to excel in math and reading when they get to elementary school.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Canada, a survey of 718 students and teachers in second-grade classrooms in the mainly French-speaking province of Quebec suggested that pupils who learn cursive do better in spelling and syntax thanks to better graphic-motor skills.</seg>
<seg id="27">""A lot of people feel an emotional connection to cursive," Ms Dinehart said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"There is thinking that, as your pen flows on paper, so does your thinking.""</seg>
<seg id="29">""Until the 1930s, we taught only cursive.</seg>
<seg id="30">That's the way the country went," added Kathleen Wright of educational publisher Zaner-Bloser, which specialises in language and writing study materials.</seg>
<seg id="31">Back then, she said, learning to write in block letters was a way to help youngsters comprehend the printed word.</seg>
<seg id="32">Typewriting was a specialised skill for adults; computers were beyond imagination.</seg>
<seg id="33">Today, despite the intensity of the debate over cursive, Ms Dinehart lamented a lack of thorough research into the long-term value of teaching young Americans to write and read in longhand.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We really don't know enough about cursive to know whether it really is of value or not," said Ms Dinehart, whose own three young children learn the technique in their bilingual Portuguese-English school in Miami."</seg>
<seg id="35">""I think what's unfortunate is that we're dropping cursive - and we don't know what the effects of that will be until it's not there anymore."</seg>
<seg id="36">In Maryland, the Howard County Public School System, which includes Triadelphia Ridge Elementary School, folds 30 minutes of cursive a week into its Common Core curriculum in the third grade.</seg>
<seg id="37">"That's about as much the kids can absorb at a time," said teacher Kathleen Russell, who noted how crowded the school schedule has become."</seg>
<seg id="38">"From next year, cursive instruction will begin in grade two in Howard County, with the goal of pupils being able to write "neatly and legibly when handwriting is preferable or technology is unavailable" by the fifth grade, in the words of the school system's handwriting resource guide.</seg>
<seg id="39">"As far as the students are concerned, they are excited about cursive," said teacher Christian Buzzerd before returning to his open-plan classroom where his pupils happily put yellow pencil to lined paper and ignore the bulbous Apple eMac computer in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="40">""It's one of the things they consider as another threshold they cross going towards middle school."</seg>

<seg id="1">Direct link established between stimulus-response learning, substance abuse</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 - Véronique Bohbot, PhD, neuroscientist at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, found that the region of the brain involved in stimulus-response learning is directly linked to the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="3">More specifically, she discovered that people who resorted to stimulus-response learning smoked more, had double the consumption of alcohol and were more likely to use cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="4">The results are published in the November edition of Hippocampus.</seg>
<seg id="5">We rely on one of two strategies to navigate through our surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="6">One is called the spatial strategy, where we use visual cues and landmarks to develop cognitive maps that enable us to know where we are and how to get where we want to go.</seg>
<seg id="7">This process occurs in the hippocampus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The other is the stimulus-response strategy, which is a kind of auto-pilot: after travelling along the same route on a regular basis, we end up taking it out of habit.</seg>
<seg id="9">This process occurs in the striatum.</seg>
<seg id="10">People who resort to stimulus-response learning have a more developed striatum and would consume more alcohol, tobacco or drugs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Factors such as routine, stress and reward-seeking behaviour also contribute to stimulating the striatum, at the expense of the hippocampus.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The literature indicates that children engage in stimulus-response strategies from a very young age," Véronique Bohbot explains.</seg>
<seg id="13">Reward-seeking behavior in childhood, especially for immediate rewards like candy or playing action video games, stimulates the striatum and encourages stimulus-response strategies during navigation.</seg>
<seg id="14">This would predispose the child to drug seeking behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="15">Previous studies have shown that an atrophied hippocampus increases the risk of developing a mental illness such as schizophrenia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or Alzheimer's disease.</seg>
<seg id="16">Véronique Bohbot will present her research results on November 13 at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego, where she will talk about the importance of improving spatial navigation skills to maintain a balance and increase chances of a healthy cognition.</seg>

<seg id="2">Charter Hall hopes to raise $86 million from a Sydney city tower sale.</seg>
<seg id="3">CHARTER Hall Group is expected to put a Goulburn Street tower in the Sydney CBD back on the market if the building's key NSW government department tenant, which is looking for office space, moves out.</seg>
<seg id="4">Industry sources are anticipating yet another office-to-residential conversion in inner-city Sydney if the tower is sold.</seg>
<seg id="5">Charter Hall tried to sell the building, valued at about $86 million, last year, but most potential buyers were residential developers and it was hamstrung by the remaining leases of its office tenants.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, it is understood the Department of Environment and Heritage, which at 10,996sq m occupies more than half the tower, is casting around for new accommodation before its lease expires at the end of next year.</seg>
<seg id="7">A department spokesperson told The Weekend Australian the OEH was considering its options.</seg>
<seg id="8">If the major tenant at 59 Goulburn Street leaves, Charter Hall is expected to test the interest of residential developers, with sources noting the building's age and the residential-heavy location make it less than suitable for attracting office tenants.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would follow other Sydney CBD building conversions in recent years, including 209 Castlereagh Street and the former Coca-Cola Amatil Building at 71-79 Macquarie Street.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court blocks ruling against NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy</seg>
<seg id="2">A three-judge appeal panel finds a lower court judge "ran afoul of the Code of Conduct"</seg>
<seg id="3">A new lower court judge is to be assigned to the case</seg>
<seg id="4">NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy continues during appeals</seg>
<seg id="5">New York (CNN) -- A federal appeals court Thursday blocked a previous ruling that deemed the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy unconstitutional, and removed the judge from the case, while other appeals in the case are heard.</seg>
<seg id="6">The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the lower court judge "ran afoul of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges" that requires judges to avoid impropriety and the appearance of it.</seg>
<seg id="7">About the judge, Shira A. Scheindlin, the appeals court said "that the appearance of partiality surrounding this litigation was compromised by the District Judge's improper application of the Court's 'related case rule,' ... and by a series of media interviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the District Court."</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the ruling, Scheindlin, in a related 2007 proceeding, said, "[I]f you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good constitutional case, why don't you bring a lawsuit?"</seg>
<seg id="9">"You can certainly mark it as related," adding, "I am sure I am going to get in trouble for saying it, for $65 you can bring that lawsuit."</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling also points to interviews with the New York Law Journal, The Associated Press and the New Yorker in which the judge spoke about her personal beliefs on the issue, and defended her decision against criticisms by the city.</seg>
<seg id="11">The appeals panel ordered the case to be assigned to a different judge, who will implement the appeals court's "mandate staying all proceedings and otherwise await further action by the Court of Appeals on the merits of the ongoing appeals," the ruling said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-frisk policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they deem suspicious, even if they've committed no crime -- has been one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent time, fueled by clashes between civil rights and civil liberties groups challenging the practice as racist and illegal, and law enforcement and other proponents saying the practice works to reduce crime.</seg>
<seg id="13">In August, Scheindlin ordered that the stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it is unconstitutional in part by unlawfully targeting blacks and Latinos.</seg>
<seg id="14">City officials had bristled at the contention that police racially profile suspects, and appealed the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="15">Scheindlin, ruled that the policy violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="16">She also found evidence of racial profiling, violating plaintiffs' 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection.</seg>
<seg id="17">The panel did not rule on whether Scheindlin's decision reached the correct conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In taking these actions, we intimate no view on the substance or merits of the pending appeals," the ruling said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael A. Cardozo, counsel for the New York City Law Office, applauded the appeals court's ruling.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We could not be more pleased with the Court's findings," he said, because the ruling puts off a decision on the constitutionality of the policy until another judge can weigh in on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">The non-profit legal advocacy organization litigating against the city on behalf of the plaintiffs in the case against the policy, criticized the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We are dismayed that the Court of Appeals saw fit to delay the long-overdue process to remedy the NYPD's unconstitutional stop-and-frisk practices, and we are shocked that they cast aspersions on the professional conduct of one of the most respected members of the federal judiciary and reassigned the case," said the Center for Constitutional Rights in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are shocked that they cast aspersions on the professional conduct of one of the most respected members of the federal judiciary and reassigned the case.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thursday's ruling effectively stalls changes mandated by Scheindlin, who said stops should be based on reasonable suspicion and in a racially neutral manner.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her ruling called for the appointment of a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan to develop and oversee reforms of the NYPD's policies and training and a pilot project in which NYPD patrol officers in five precincts -- one in each borough with the most stops in 2012 -- must wear video cameras.</seg>
<seg id="26">Outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg is an outspoken proponent of the policy, saying it saves lives and lowers crime.</seg>
<seg id="27">NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, was forced to cancel a speech at Brown University on Tuesday after protesters shouted at him on stage about stop-and-frisk policies and racism claims.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thursday, Kelly said he has been "concerned about the partiality of Judge Scheindlin and we look forward to the examination of this case."</seg>
<seg id="29">The controversy about the policy extended into the mayoral race.</seg>
<seg id="30">Democratic nominee Bill de Blasio, who is heavily favored to win the election on November 5, has made his opposition to stop-and-frisk a major issue of his campaign.</seg>
<seg id="31">I'm extremely disappointed in today's decision.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We shouldn't have to wait for reforms that both keep our communities safe and obey the Constitution," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="33">Republican nominee Joe Lhota said, "Bravo!"</seg>
<seg id="34">As I have said all along, Judge Scheindlin's biased conduct corrupted the case and her decision was not based on the facts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Horsemeat was found in a canned beef product sold at discount chains</seg>
<seg id="3">Food watchdog says the sliced beef in rich gravy was made in Romania</seg>
<seg id="4">It was found to contain between one and five per cent horsemeat</seg>
<seg id="5">Horsemeat has been found in tinned beef that has been on sale in the UK, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said horse DNA has been detected in the canned beef product which was manufactured in Romania.</seg>
<seg id="7">Officials said the Food Hall Sliced Beef in Rich Gravy, sold in Home Bargains and Quality Save stores, has been withdrawn from sale.</seg>
<seg id="8">The FSA said the presence of horse DNA was found during routine testing carried out by Lincolnshire County Council trading standards officers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Contaminated: Officials said the Food Hall Sliced Beef in Rich Gravy, sold in Home Bargains and Quality Save stores, has been withdrawn from sale</seg>
<seg id="10">The product, which was made in January this year, was found to contain between 1 per cent and 5 per cent of horsemeat.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the tinned product did not contain any of the veterinary painkiller bute.</seg>
<seg id="12">An FSA spokesman said: 'The FSA has been informed that a batch of canned sliced beef that was found to contain horse DNA has been withdrawn from sale.</seg>
<seg id="13">The affected batch has been withdrawn from sale.</seg>
<seg id="14">If you have this product stored you are advised to return it to where you bought it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The affected batch has a best before date of January 2016 and a batch code of 13.04.C.</seg>
<seg id="16">A spokeswoman for TJ Morris Ltd, which owns Home Bargains, said: 'As soon as we were made aware that the Food Standards Agency had found traces of horsemeat DNA in the Food Hall Sliced Beef in Gravy, it was removed from sale immediately.</seg>
<seg id="17">Several products were found to contain horsemeat after the scandal broke in January</seg>
<seg id="18">The affected batch was tested and the results indicated that a diminutive amount of horse DNA was present in the product - between one and 5% was found to be included.</seg>
<seg id="19">'The FSA's findings relate to just one batch of the product, which was produced in January 2013 - before horsemeat was found in a number of UK products.</seg>

<seg id="2">Taskforce Takeback commander Superintendent Jim Keogh with drugs and cash linked to an alleged Finks associate.</seg>
<seg id="3">BIKIES will not surrender anytime soon and are continuing to push the envelope and commit crimes despite the State Government's massive crackdown, a top cop says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Superintendent Jim Keogh, who is heading the Gold Coast's bikie blitz dubbed Taskforce Takeback, made the comment after the arrest of an alleged Finks bikie associate accused of running a mobile drug-dealing racket.</seg>
<seg id="5">Campbell Newman: Enough is enough</seg>
<seg id="6">Mongols will kill cops before surrender</seg>
<seg id="7">Top cop gets his Glock back</seg>
<seg id="8">The 26-year-old was nabbed at Tallai in the Gold Coast hinterland last night with a "substantial amount" of drugs, including 16g of amphetamine, and more than $14,500 in cash allegedly in his car.</seg>
<seg id="9">Supt Keogh said police also found books of "account" allegedly recording drug transactions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Queensland police have been warned they could be murdered by Mongol bikie gang members.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We will be alleging this person has connections to the Finks," he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">""They're (bikies) still trying to push the envelope, there's no two ways about it.</seg>
<seg id="13">To a degree, they're trying to keep the business going, albeit through associates or links.</seg>
<seg id="14">You will see an attempt by them to continue to have a foothold in criminal activity here on the Gold Coast and throughout Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="15">""Equally, and if not more determined, are the police to squash them.</seg>
<seg id="16">We'll keep going.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Supt Keogh said the tough new bikie laws were working to curb the activities of criminal motorcycle gangs and police would be "somewhat lost" without them.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The anarchy you saw there in Broadbeach (where bikies brawled openly outside a restaurant) about a month ago would have continued, spread throughout the Gold Coast and permeated right through the state," he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Supt Keogh said he was "not fazed" by reported threats by the feared Mongols bikie gang - which recently joined forces with the Finks - to kill police rather than be arrested."</seg>
<seg id="20">""I think it's indicative of the group we're dealing with," he said, adding that police were taking the threat seriously and officers were on heightened safety alert.</seg>

<seg id="1">Winter Olympics 2014: Russian President Vladimir Putin takes on the "black widows" in Sochi security crackdown</seg>
<seg id="2">An attack by a female suicide bomber in southern Russia last month highlighted the security risks in Sochi, which is located near to violence-ridden North Caucasus republics, during the games three months from now.</seg>
<seg id="3">This latest cloud over the Sochi Olympics follows reports of widespread workers" rights violations during construction there, illegal rubbish dumping and allegations that up to half the of the £31.7bn budget of the games has been lost to corruption and inefficiency.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eight women in Russia's Dagestan republic, which has become an epicentre of insurgent violence, said the authorities had asked them to provide saliva swabs after a suicide bombing in the regional capital of Makhachkala in May, Reuters reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police declined to comment, it reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">DNA from such swabs can be used to identify the women if they later blow themselves up.</seg>
<seg id="7">President Vladimir Putin has been directing security forces to crack down on radical Islamists, announcing in July that "the situation in the North Caucasus should be kept under particular control."</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, Doku Umarov, the leader of the North Caucasus insurgency who has claimed responsibility for bloody bombings in a Moscow airport and in its metro, called on followers to employ "maximum force" to stop the Sochi games.</seg>
<seg id="9">The campaign has targeted the Salafist movement in Islam that insurgents also follow and has resulted in Salafist religious schools and charities being closed down.</seg>
<seg id="10">In response, many Salafis have fled abroad, while others have joined the insurgency.</seg>
<seg id="11">Female suicide bombers known as "black widows" are especially feared.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 21 October, a radicalised woman from Dagestan boarded a bus in the southern city of Volgograd and blew up a bus of students, killing six.</seg>
<seg id="13">Russian intelligence services reportedly suspect that the attack was meant to undermine Mr Putin's promises that the Sochi Olympics will be secure.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the website, Caucasian Knot, which monitors insurgent violence, 49 black widows have executed attacks in Russia over the past 13 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the week after the Volgograd attack, a car bomb killed a policeman and two other bombings were foiled in Dagestan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's FSB security service said last month it is also worried about an estimated 400 Russian nationals, mainly from the North Caucasus, fighting in Syria, some of whom may return home for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="17">Russian officials have been in contact with 80 nations about identifying this and other threats from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the huge influx of workers and volunteers to Sochi could pose another security threat.</seg>
<seg id="19">Already, much of the construction in Sochi has reportedly been done by foreign nationals, many of them in Russia illegally.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Realistically it is hard to see how the FSB will be able, meaningfully, to screen not just the 70,000 or so staff (including 25,000 volunteers) but also the expected 3.85 million visitors," New York University professor Mark Galeotti, an expert in Russia's security services, wrote in OpenDemocracy.</seg>
<seg id="21">As part of the security measures in Sochi, the FSB will monitor virtually all phone and internet communications in the city during the games, Russian security experts revealed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The city will also be divided up into security zones, and traffic will be highly regulated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Meanwhile, allegations of corruption and human rights violations continue to plague the games.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Associated Press reported this week that Russia's state-owned railroad, which is building the hugely expensive road between the coastal and mountain clusters of Olympic venues, is dumping tons of waste into an illegal landfill to the north of the city, risking contamination of the water.</seg>
<seg id="25">Human Rights Watch reported that Sochi police have detained hundreds of migrant workers, many of whom worked on Olympic building sites, holding them in often inhumane conditions and deporting some of them.</seg>
<seg id="26">Controversy over construction continues.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Wednesday, a blogger placed joke indicators on a digital clock in Sochi counting down to the Winter Olympics, replacing "days" with "billions," "hours" with "millions," "minutes" with "thousands," and "seconds" with "dollars."</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, the clock seemed to show that there was $100 million left to spend before the start of the games.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rebel attacks: Terrorism in Russia</seg>
<seg id="30">Over the course of 10 days in September, bomb attacks on Russian military housing in Dagestan and other apartment blocks killed 300 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Islamist Chechen rebels were blamed, and the attacks led to the Second Chechen War.</seg>
<seg id="32">Vladimir Putin, then Prime Minister, said the campaign was needed to combat terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="33">On 23 October, 40 Chechen militants led by warlord Movsar Barayev took 912 people hostage at the Dubrovka Theatre in Moscow, where the popular musical Nord-Ost had been playing.</seg>
<seg id="34">The siege lasted for three days, until Russian security services pumped sleeping gas into the hall, stormed it and killed the attackers.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, 130 hostages also died, apparently due to the effects of the gas.</seg>
<seg id="36">The world watched in horror as armed Islamic separatist militants, some Chechen, occupied a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, and killed more than 380 people.</seg>
<seg id="37">Six people were killed last week when a suicide bomb exploded on a bus in Volgograd.</seg>
<seg id="38">The attack was blamed on a 30-year-old woman from Dagestan, the North Caucasus province at the centre of an insurgency.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the deadliest such blast outside the volatile North Caucasus region in nearly three years, according to Reuters, and raised fears of further Islamist attacks ahead of the Winter Olympics in February in Sochi, close to the mainly Muslim North Caucasus.</seg>

<seg id="1">Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly acknowledged that in the US spying has gone too far, in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2">He also claimed that innocent people have been tortured under secret surveillance programs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kerry's confession came while addressing the Open Government Partnership's annual summit in London via a video link.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kerry said, "I assure you that innocent people were not being harassed in this process".</seg>
<seg id="5">But, in an effort to gain information, in some cases inappropriate methods had been used.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, a key committee of the U.S. Congress has approved a bill to limit the monitoring activities of the National Security Agency [NSA].</seg>
<seg id="7">The aim of this is to make monitoring more transparent and to get back the trust of the people which has been lost following the disclosure of large scale phone tapping.</seg>
<seg id="8">This move by the Senate was welcomed by six U.S. companies including Google and Yahoo.</seg>
<seg id="9">The data centres in these companies have also been hacked by the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday the select committee of the Senate passed a bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act(FISA)by 11 votes to 4.</seg>

<seg id="12">Deliberate, unauthorized collection and use of data under FISA will be treated as a criminal offence and will be punishable by up to ten years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="13">Once both Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate pass the bill, it will become law.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Committee Chairman and Senator, Diane Festin, said that the NSA's program of recording phone calls is within the law, and believed it had contributed significantly to the country's security.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, there should be more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="16">Not only that, the protection of personal privacy should also be kept in mind.</seg>
<seg id="17">Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook, disturbed by the revelation of the NSA's Internet surveillance program, have supported this bill.</seg>

<seg id="1">Downing Street outlines new crackdown on water bills</seg>
<seg id="2">Asked if the Prime Minister was happy with the role of Ofwat, the industry regulator, he replied: "The Prime Minister wants regulators to look at industries they regulate and make sure they are as robust delivering what they need to deliver for consumers."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Prime Minister wants to see household expenditure being brought down - he realises that families are hard-pressed.</seg>
<seg id="4">He wants to see costs across the board being reduced where possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ofwat is determining whether price rises suggested by the companies are appropriate - that is the teeth that regulators have and should be exercising.</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this month, Ofwat rejected an attempt by Thames Water - which has 14million customers - to add an extra £29 to customers" water bills next year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The regulator said Thames Water, which provides water for one in four of people living in the UK, could only justify a bill hike of £7 but that this would not be imposed on customers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thames Water had applied in August for a one-off price increase next year that would raise average bills by 8pc from £354, blaming customers struggling to pay their bills and the cost of a super sewer under London.</seg>
<seg id="9">A final ruling is due next month.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thames Water is subject to a five-year price control period that runs out in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="11">The spokesman added: "Ofwat is determining whether price rises suggested by the companies are appropriate - that is the teeth that regulators have and should be exercising."</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier this month Ofwat signalled that it would scrutinise all the proposals for increases covering the period 2015 to 2020.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sonia Brown, Ofwat's chief regulation officer, said: "If you take an average bill, we think there can be big savings because the cost of debt and equity is much lower."</seg>
<seg id="14">There is a big opportunity for those bills to go down.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are legitimate cost pressures for some companies, but our message is that bills should go down unless companies can explain to customers why they should not.</seg>
<seg id="16">She said water companies were at a "critical point" in setting out plans for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="17">She added: "Have no doubt, we will step in if plans are put forward to us which we do not consider to be realistic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Analysis prepared by Charlie Elphicke MP, disclosed by The Telegraph earlier this month, found that how four of the biggest water companies have pushed up bills by up to a third in some cases since 2007/08.</seg>

<seg id="1">Congolese Army Takes Rebel Stronghold</seg>
<seg id="2">James Akena/Reuters</seg>
<seg id="3">People displaced by fighting between the Congolese Army and M23 rebels in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo made their way home on Thursday, a day after troops seized the rebel stronghold of Bunagana on the Ugandan border.</seg>
<seg id="4">BUNAGANA, Congo - The Congolese army retook one of the last remaining strongholds of the M23 rebels Wednesday, with fighters running for the hills as the military sought to extinguish the 18-month-old insurrection, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the army retook the town of Bunagana, leaving the M23 with a small sliver of territory, the civilian leader of the rebel movement fled Congo, crossing the border into Uganda and prompting calls for his extradition.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recapture of Bunagana comes just days after the U.N. special representative said: "We are witnessing the military end of the M23."</seg>
<seg id="7">In an address to the nation late Wednesday, Congolese President Joseph Kabila warned the remaining members of the M23 to turn themselves in, saying: "I reiterate my call to the members of this armed group who have just been flushed out of our territory ... to demobilize themselves voluntarily," Kabila said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Failure to do so will leave us with no option but to force them to do by force.</seg>
<seg id="9">An Associated Press reporter who accompanied the Congolese troops as they took Bunagana saw the soldiers fan out as they entered the town in order to do house-to-house searches.</seg>
<seg id="10">M23 fighters could be seen running away up a hill.</seg>
<seg id="11">Small skirmishes, however, continued and the government finally secured control of the town by midday, army spokesman Lt. Col. Olivier Hamuli said by telephone to The Associated Press.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We are now securing the city after the rebels fled," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have found a lot of weapons that they abandoned here.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their political leaders have crossed the border and about 40 fighters are headed toward Runyonyi and we are tracking them down.</seg>
<seg id="15">M23 political head Bertrand Bisimwa was among those who crossed into Uganda and headed toward the capital of Kampala, officials in both countries said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Congo called for him to be returned home amid reports he left the country in vehicles that stolen during M23's siege of Goma one year ago, the provincial capital of eastern Congo whose fall to the rebels marked one of the most humiliating defeats for the Congolese military, whose soldiers were seen running away from the front line.</seg>
<seg id="17">The events of the last few days mark a stunning turnaround for the Congolese troops, who have long been plagued by indiscipline and corruption among their ranks, making them no match for groups like M23, which until recently was allegedly backed by neighboring Rwanda.</seg>
<seg id="18">M23 launched its movement in April 2012, becoming the latest reincarnation of an ethnic Tutsi rebel group dissatisfied with the Congolese government.</seg>
<seg id="19">Neighboring Rwanda, whose president is also an ethnic Tutsi, provided weapons, recruits and training to the M23, according to a report by U.N experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rwanda's government denies the allegations, saying Congo's government has failed to police its territory.</seg>
<seg id="21">The group has been substantially weakened in the past year by internal divisions and waning Rwandan support, according to the U.N. Defections from the M23 are up this month, totaling 80 in October.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thirty-three surrendered alone on Tuesday, according to chief U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Congolese military has capitalized on these rebel setbacks by pushing ahead with new offensives beginning in August that have been supported by a specially created United Nations Intervention Brigade.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the last week, Congo has scored a series of successes and taken back half a dozen towns from rebel control to the cheers of local residents waving palm leaves and running alongside their vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="25">The unrest, though, also has prompted a mass exodus of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is only the latest unrest to prompt displacement in eastern Congo, which has now been mired in conflict for nearly two decades.</seg>
<seg id="27">Ethnic Hutu militias blamed for taking part in Rwanda's 1994 genocide fled across the border to eastern Congo, prompting Rwanda to invade twice in an attempt to crush them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The fighting has exposed civilians to unspeakable atrocities as groups have carried out massacres and burned down villages in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rebels including the M23 are accused of carrying out mass rapes and conscripting children as armed fighters.</seg>

<seg id="1">IRS eases rules on healthcare flexible spending accounts</seg>
<seg id="2">Workers faced with forfeiting unused money in their flexible spending accounts for healthcare expenses may be getting some relief under a new federal rule.</seg>
<seg id="3">The U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service changed the use-it-or-lose-it rule for flexible spending arrangements, or FSAs, to allow account holders to carry over as much as $500 from one year to the next without penalty.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many workers have been reluctant to put money into the plans for fear of losing whatever they don't use, resulting in long-standing complaints about how the pretax FSAs work.</seg>
<seg id="5">Typically, they must estimate before the year starts how much they might spend on healthcare, and employers regularly deduct money from their paychecks before taxes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Any amount left over at the end of the year would go back to the employers.</seg>
<seg id="7">With less risk of such forfeitures now, experts predicted that more workers, particularly lower- and moderate-income employees, would take advantage of the deductions for everyday medical expenses, such as co-pays, over-the-counter drugs and other items not normally covered by health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are always looking for ways to provide added flexibility and common-sense solutions to how people pay for their healthcare," Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Treasury officials began taking public comments on the change last year, and they said the response was overwhelmingly in favor of giving workers more leeway.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new rules go into effect immediately, but they aren't mandatory for employers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Firms can decide whether to make the change and when to make it.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a recent survey of large employers, 86% offered FSAs for healthcare expenses, but only 23% of workers participated, according to Mercer, a benefits consulting firm.</seg>
<seg id="13">In all, federal officials estimated that 14 million American families use the spending accounts.</seg>
<seg id="14">Federal officials said employers could take advantage of this new rule as soon as this year.</seg>
<seg id="15">But benefits consultants said it will be difficult for most employers to make the switch that fast with open enrollment season already underway at most companies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Starting Jan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"1, 2015, I think there will be greater uptake simply because of the timing," said Laura Baker, a principal at Mercer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because the funds are deducted from paychecks on a pretax basis, less of a worker's earnings are subject to tax.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average worker contribution was $1,484 last year, according to Mercer's survey of large employers.</seg>
<seg id="20">The percentage of overall dollars forfeited was 4%.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treasury officials said they didn't have figures on how much is lost annually, but they said the new rule could eliminate most forfeitures, which are often below $500 in value.</seg>
<seg id="22">One benefits administrator, Alegeus Technologies in Waltham, Mass., estimated that 1 in 4 flex-spending participants suffers a forfeiture each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Treasury Department has eliminated the most significant barrier to FSA participation, namely consumers' fear of losing their money," said Bob Natt, executive chairman of Alegeus.</seg>
<seg id="24">This will certainly lead to growth in FSA adoption.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employers are not allowed to return the money to individual employees.</seg>
<seg id="26">Health experts said most use it to offset the cost of administering employee benefit programs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The rule change also could reduce the incentive by workers for unnecessary spending at year-end to avoid losing the money set aside.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some employers offer a grace period to workers, allowing them to use prior-year balances until March 15 of the following year.</seg>
<seg id="29">Treasury officials said employers would have to pick between a grace period or the rollover option because they won't be allowed to do both.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) praised the new flexibility from the Obama administration.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Allowing Americans who have one of these accounts to roll $500 over to the following year just makes sense," Hatch said.</seg>

<seg id="1">As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough.</seg>
<seg id="2">But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="5">Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great double act."</seg>
<seg id="10">They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.</seg>
<seg id="12">Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="13">The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mrs Howells said: "The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping."</seg>
<seg id="15">He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after.</seg>
<seg id="17">The way he has started he'll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I'm sure he'll do well.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony."</seg>
<seg id="19">They are a great team together.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring.</seg>
<seg id="21">They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm sure Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaza Border Incidents Kill 4 Hamas Militants</seg>
<seg id="2">Israeli aircraft bombed what the military described as a "terror tunnel" used by Hamas in Gaza and the militant Palestinian group said three of its fighters were killed in the strike early Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The military said it carried out the strike after five of its soldiers were wounded as they tried to demolish another tunnel used by Gaza's Hamas rulers.</seg>
<seg id="4">That incident drew Israeli fire that killed one Hamas militant.</seg>
<seg id="5">The soldiers were blowing up the infrastructure of a recently discovered tunnel dug in Gaza that stretched into Israel when an explosive device was detonated late Thursday, wounding the troops and drawing Israeli fire, the military said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Kidra said one Palestinian was killed by the Israeli tank fire and Hamas confirmed the man belonged to the militant group.</seg>
<seg id="7">"During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device at the forces, wounding five Israeli soldiers," said a military statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The soldiers were evacuated to an Israeli hospital.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an immediate response the soldiers opened fire and directly hit a terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="10">The military announced last month that it had discovered the concrete-lined, mile-long tunnel dug from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip into Israel.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The defensive operation was aimed at preventing future terror attacks, utilizing the existing infrastructure leading to Israel," the military said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The opening of the tunnel was discovered near Israeli civilian communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hamas has dug tunnels into Israel in the past.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri "blessed" the latest attacks saying his group "gave a painful lesson" to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Gaza will be the land of hell" for Israel, he said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel and Hamas are bitter enemies.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hamas does not recognize Israel's right to exist, and since it took power in the Gaza Strip, thousands of rockets have been fired at Israeli communities.</seg>
<seg id="18">Israel carried out major military operations in 2009 and last year in Gaza in response to the rocket fire.</seg>
<seg id="19">While various militant groups operate in Gaza, Israel says it holds Hamas responsible.</seg>
<seg id="20">The sides largely have observed a cease-fire since last November.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hamas has ruled Gaza since 2007 after ousting the rival secular Palestinian Fatah group in bloody street fighting.</seg>
<seg id="22">Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, now govern part of the West Bank only.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the Hamas takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the coastal territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">Israel has eased the blockade in recent years, but still restricts the imports of some goods into Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer, Egypt's military has tried to destroy or seal off most of the smuggling tunnels under its side of the border with Gaza, and accused Hamas of fomenting unrest in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The move followed the popularly-backed coup that ousted Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi, from the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group, a parent organization of Hamas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rising risk of desert migrant deaths as more Africans try to reach Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">This transit of people escaping poverty and insecurity is not a new phenomenon, but as that poverty rises and insecurity rises, the number of people wanting to leave is also increasing.</seg>
<seg id="3">We do not have data to give a reason why on this occasion there were so many women and children, but the reality is the situation in their countries is worsening.</seg>
<seg id="4">The group of 113 people, all from Niger, set out late in September in two lorries that were believed to be heading for the town of Tamanrasset in southern Algeria, a staging post on the way to Morocco and eventually Europe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both vehicles broke down, leaving the migrants stranded in the desert with no water and no food.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only 21 survived.</seg>
<seg id="7">One, a 14-year-old girl, told yesterday how she watched her mother and sisters die, then buried them and eventually managed to walk to safety.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We waited for two days in the desert - no food, no water - before we decided to start walking," the teenager, named as Shafa, told the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some vehicles passed by, we tried to stop them but no-one would stop.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the passing cars even knocked down three of our group and killed them.</seg>
<seg id="11">There were eight of us by now, including my mum and my younger sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">When we got tired, we sat under a tree, and that was where one of my sisters died.</seg>
<seg id="13">We buried her there.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then we continued walking and after a day, my second sister died.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then on the third day my mother died.</seg>
<seg id="16">I buried all of them myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">A woman who originally came from south Niger and allegedly organised the fateful journey was detained by security forces in Tamanrasset, where she lived, and sent back to Niger, where she was detained, a security source said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says</seg>
<seg id="2">Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country's north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.</seg>
<seg id="21">A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."</seg>
<seg id="22">It added that, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."</seg>
<seg id="23">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I salute the fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," the watchdog's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="31">The cause of the blast was not known, he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another independence scare story.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, a non-story, then.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the "independence means passport controls" canard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.</seg>
<seg id="31">Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where does this leave Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="2">(CBS News) SEATTLE - Seventeen states and the District of Columbia are running their own health insurance exchanges, and many of those appear to be working well, including the one in Washington state.</seg>

<seg id="6">In the month since his state opened its health care exchange, 49,000 people have enrolled.</seg>

<seg id="8">The bar for success is fairly low, but Washington state is getting kudos.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's easier to do this on a state basis than it is having the whole federal system in one technical system," Inslee said.</seg>
<seg id="10">We make sure that we get into schools and gymnasiums and beauty parlors, where people are, and let them know what the options are.</seg>

<seg id="1">Plans for radio studios in two Scottish jails criticised</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 11:30</seg>
<seg id="3">A Conservative MSP has criticised plans to install radio studios at two of Scotland's largest prisons.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has tendered contracts for the studios at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow and the soon-to-open Grampian Prison.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is part of a scheme to educate prisoners and aid rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Alex Johnstone MSP, who represents North East Scotland, said the £70,000 cost would be better spent preparing prisoners for work on their release.</seg>
<seg id="7">The invitation to tender issued by the SPS, which closed on 14 October, said the studios would "facilitate communication and education within the institutions."</seg>
<seg id="8">Weekly programmes</seg>
<seg id="9">It said: "The system will be in use at least five days a week to produce a regular weekly programme of events, all pre-recorded, there will be no live broadcasts."</seg>
<seg id="10">""The system will also be utilised by the education department to train prisoners in media presentations, possibly to SVQ Level.""</seg>
<seg id="11">"I may be accused of being a killjoy but what I want to see is people trained and into constructive jobs once they emerge from prison""</seg>
<seg id="12">End Quote Alex Johnstone Conservative MSP for North East Scotland</seg>
<seg id="13">The studios will be installed at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow and HMP Grampian, which is set to open next year in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, and replace the existing Aberdeen and Peterhead jails.</seg>
<seg id="14">Radio studios are already in use at Polmont Young Offenders Institution and Edinburgh Prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A spokesman for the SPS said: "We have successfully implemented radio stations at other prisons which have previously received positive comment from the former chief inspector of prisons.</seg>
<seg id="16">Radio stations have been shown to be a positive means to engage those in our custody.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Johnstone said he believed the cash earmarked for the studios could, perhaps, be better spent preparing prisoners for release.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: "When you consider the economy of the north east is extremely short of labour at the moment, there are potential jobs for prisoners on release."</seg>
<seg id="19">""I would suggest that the £70,000 might have been better spent on preparing prisoners for the workforce once they're released.</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not entirely sure that there are all that many jobs for DJs out there.</seg>
<seg id="21">I would prefer to see them trained for something that can take them straight into a job when they emerge from prison.</seg>
<seg id="22">Important role</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Johnstone added: "I may be accused of being a killjoy but what I want to see is people trained and into constructive jobs once they emerge from prison and I think £70,000...could effectively provide training for a number of prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="24">Former prisoner, Pete White, who is a trustee of the penal reform charity, Howard League Scotland, said radio studios could have an important role to play in jails.</seg>
<seg id="25">He told Good Morning Scotland: "I think it's important to recognise that in addition to the idea of custody and order within prisons, there is also care and opportunity as part of the SPS programme."</seg>
<seg id="26">""It's to give individuals in prison an opportunity to recognise that they can move on in their lives by being human contributing citizens and doing things that people outside might do.</seg>
<seg id="27">It gives them a far better chance of managing their way back into society on release.</seg>
<seg id="28">He added: "When you bear in mind that the SPS budget for a year is about £486m, £70,000 is about the same cost or just over the cost of looking after one prisoner for a year."</seg>

<seg id="1">Quade Cooper's year in quotes: from "toxic environment" to "speechless" for new Wallaby vice-captain</seg>
<seg id="2">Newly appointed Wallabies vice captain Quade Cooper says he's changed his ways after a couple of turbulent years and is reaping the rewards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Quade Cooper has been named Wallabies vice-captain for the clash with England at Twickenham.</seg>
<seg id="4">CONTROVERSIAL playmaker Quade Cooper has capped a remarkable turnaround by going from Wallabies outcast to leader.</seg>
<seg id="5">It all kicked off with his now infamous "toxic environment" comments in September last year, after which he was routinely overlooked for Test duties by then coach Robbie Deans."</seg>
<seg id="6">But with Ewen McKenzie taking over from Deans mid-way through 2013, and an increasingly contrite Cooper mending his outspoken ways, the one-time bad boy has gone from Wallaby sinner to saint - named vice-captain for Australia's Test clash with England at Twickenham.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We chart Cooper's year in quotes, and measure how he has transformed from "toxic" to top pick."</seg>
<seg id="8">The comments that kicked it all off came as Cooper addressed some wayward tweets that criticised the Wallabies' style of play under Deans.</seg>
<seg id="9">""There's a lot of people who are afraid to say what they feel so they just go along with it and nothing is going to change," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="10">That's why I feel so strongly as a player.</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't want to be involved in the toxic environment, and that's how it is at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="12">""It's an environment where things aren't going according to plan and everyone is looking to point the finger.""</seg>
<seg id="13">"Speaking on Fox Sports' The Rugby Club, Cooper revealed that he wouldn't have played against the Springboks in South Africa had he been fit and had he been instructed to run a "defensive" game plan."</seg>
<seg id="14">""Well no because, like I said, the environment there is one I don't feel comfortable with," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="15">""And if I don't feel comfortable and I don't feel I can give 100 per cent for my country and for that yellow jersey then that's a very big problem.""</seg>
<seg id="16">"After copping a $40,000 fine from the ARU over his "toxic environment" comments, Cooper was in an apologetic mood.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I understand that I fell well below par in what it means to be a Wallaby," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="18">""For all the supporters that are out there, my apologies.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I'm just looking forward to the future, hopefully having a big year, with not only my state but the Wallabies.""</seg>
<seg id="20">Quade Cooper in action against the All Blacks earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">Cooper copped his fine but that didn't stop him from fighting - literally.</seg>
<seg id="22">He put his rugby career on hold to focus on boxing.</seg>
<seg id="23">""As it stands now, I'm still contracted (with the ARU) until the end of December," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="24">I don't really have an option to continue with rugby at the moment, so for now I'm just focusing on getting my body right.</seg>
<seg id="25">""I'm still training with the Reds, I'm still contracted with them.</seg>
<seg id="26">I'm just putting my full focus on getting my body right for the upcoming boxing fight.</seg>
<seg id="27">Cooper rejected overseas offers to re-sign with the ARU and said he was "very happy" to remain in rugby union."</seg>
<seg id="28">He also declared that he had no issue with Deans.</seg>
<seg id="29">""He's the coach.</seg>
<seg id="30">It (their relationship) is not something I have to improve," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="31">""His job is to coach and get the best out of the team.</seg>
<seg id="32">My first goal is to get back out there for Queensland and then if I play well the opportunity will arise to play for my country.</seg>
<seg id="33">""It is a big year coming up.""</seg>
<seg id="34">Ahead of the British and Irish Lions series, Cooper was overlooked by Deans for a Wallabies planning camp.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Cooper said plenty of ``water had gone under the bridge" since his ``toxic environment" comments."</seg>
<seg id="36">""Whether that's being held against me, I don't buy into that too much," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">I've spoken to Robbie since then a few times.</seg>
<seg id="38">We've sorted things out.</seg>
<seg id="39">""It's not something that I feel is going to impact on anything, and if it has, then so be it."</seg>
<seg id="40">Following McKenzie's appointment as Wallabies coach, in place of Deans, Cooper said:</seg>
<seg id="41">I don't know if I will talk to Robbie again.</seg>
<seg id="42">But me and him haven't talked much in the past year anyway.</seg>
<seg id="43">``I have no negative feelings at all.</seg>
<seg id="44">I don't regret anything.</seg>
<seg id="45">""Now is just about congratulating Ewen.</seg>
<seg id="46">I'm just really proud he got the job.</seg>
<seg id="47">I know how hard he has worked, he's a great coach and a great person.</seg>
<seg id="48">""Everyone who knows him is so happy for him just from a respect point of view."</seg>
<seg id="49">Quade Cooper and his Wallaby teammates warm up during a training session in London this week.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cooper said he had no regrets about his previous comments and backed his ``honest" approach.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Not at all," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's a trait that is sometimes hard to come by, honest people, and sometimes you can be too honest, but so be it.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you feel a certain way, I encourage people to speak out rather than bottle those feelings, for good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="54">""You see cases in the NRL where guys have bottled things up and they have gone completely off the rails ... it might have been the wrong way that I spoke about things, but it is what it is and I've moved on.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am enjoying rugby and life in general.</seg>
<seg id="56">Cooper admits spending time away from Wallabies teammates helped him to grow as a player and person.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Growing up is an accumulation of things," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="58">""If you are too ignorant not to learn from your mistakes, you are never going to improve as a player or a person.</seg>
<seg id="59">I learned a lot from having my time out, from being injured and not being part of the team.</seg>
<seg id="60">I am 25 now, I'm not getting any younger.</seg>
<seg id="61">You have to make the most of it.</seg>
<seg id="62">Cooper is named Wallabies vice-captain for the clash against England, rendering him "a bit speechless.""</seg>
<seg id="63">""I didn't know what to say," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="64">There was a great deal of happiness.</seg>
<seg id="65">""To get that vice-captaincy next to my name is something I see as being pretty special but I'm just going to concentrate on doing the best job I can for the team within my role at No.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brazil may finally escape from the samba clichés</seg>
<seg id="2">Black is a shade of brown.</seg>
<seg id="3">So is white, if you look," John Updike once observed of the sun-burnished skin tones on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sadly, however, not even in variegated Brazil is black a shade of red - and red is what investors saw this week after Eike Batista, Rio's brashest businessman, declared bankruptcy by pulling the trigger on a $6bn default.</seg>
<seg id="5">After Latin America's biggest-ever corporate bust, some may wonder at Mr Batista's exotic tale and conclude: so what?</seg>
<seg id="6">But his story is, in many ways, synonymous with Brazil's rise and fall.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, as Brazil is an emerging market archetype, it tells a global fable as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">IN Comment</seg>
<seg id="9">Only last year Mr Batista was the world's seventh-richest man, boasting a self-made fortune that had grown to more than $30bn during the wonder years of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lula, as the charismatic former president is widely known, governed between 2002 and 2010 when Brazil, like Mr Batista, could seemingly do no wrong.</seg>
<seg id="11">Indeed, the two men were different sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lula was by almost any criterion the most successful politician of his time.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even nature seemed to smile on his rule, with the discovery in 2007 of huge deposits of deep sea oil.</seg>
<seg id="14">Helped by a commodity price boom, the trade union leader turned president lifted millions of Brazilians out of poverty, projected South American diplomacy internationally by putting the B into the Brics, and became symbolic of emerging countries" success, a rise that promised to reconfigure the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Batista, like so many of the emerging world's new billionaires, was the feted entrepreneurial agent of that reconfiguration.</seg>
<seg id="16">While Lula certainly helped the poor, capital prospered even more: during his two presidencies, the Brazilian stock market quadrupled.</seg>
<seg id="17">Indeed, Mr Batista's stated aim was to become the world's wealthiest man, thanks to the commodity boom that also burnished Lula's political halo.</seg>
<seg id="18">Today Mr Batista is in disgrace after it turned out that a prospective oil well, the main source of funding for his leveraged empire, was dry.</seg>
<seg id="19">Similarly, Brazil has seemingly lost its way, just as many emerging markets are also losing their appeal against a shale gas revolution that promises to transform the US and a eurozone that may be over the worst.</seg>
<seg id="20">Certainly, Brazil's go-go years of the mid 2000s are over; last year the economy expanded at half of Japan's rate.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fiscal buffers that allowed Brazil to treat the 2009 global financial crisis as though it was only uma marolinha, a "ripple" in Lula's phrase, are exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="22">The role of continental locomotive has been taken up instead, to Brasilia's chagrin, by the more reform-minded Pacific Alliance economies of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.</seg>
<seg id="23">Investment potential is also being left unfulfilled, as seen in Petrobras, the state oil company that raised $70bn in 2010 in the world's largest-ever share offering but has since registered a slide in its shares of 37 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Brazil is now even a locus of general investor fright, as happened after the market's "taper tantrum" in May, when millions of dollars fled the country believing the US Federal Reserve was about to raise rates.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is not only the capitalists who are fed up.</seg>
<seg id="26">In June, 1m people took to the streets to protest at government corruption and the millions being spent on new football stadiums for next year's world cup (the circuses of Lula's winning "bread and circuses" political formula) instead of better public services.</seg>
<seg id="27">Much of the "new middle class" remains, in reality, only a month's wages away from poverty.</seg>
<seg id="28">After 11 years in power, and the likelihood of another four after next year's election, Lula's Workers party has also grown stale and complacent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Reforms are being left undone.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is a depressing trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="31">Yet is it all bad?</seg>
<seg id="32">Disappointment may at least release Brazil from the prison of its many clichés (samba, beaches, money, fun!) that Lula and Mr Batista often played upon and into which the world so eagerly bought.</seg>
<seg id="33">Exhibit one of a more realistic vision of Brazil: Mr Batista is atypical of a business class which, by dint of long experience, is conservative and underleveraged.</seg>
<seg id="34">So fallout from his bankruptcy is expected to be limited.</seg>
<seg id="35">Exhibit two: the $2tn economy, comparable to the UK's, remains an important market for multinationals, especially telecoms and consumer goods companies, and has developed pockets of true excellence, especially in commodities and agro-industry.</seg>
<seg id="36">Exhibit three: even if Brazil's rainbow diplomacy has not lived up to its promise, the country has maintained stability in a difficult neighbourhood that includes socialist Venezuela, prickly Bolivia and capricious Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="37">If the US is castigated for not paying attention to the region, that is perhaps because it does not need to.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a regional hegemon Brazil does a fair job, and without exercising the neighbourly brutality of China, Russia or India.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr Batista - garish and overleveraged - went from boom to bust in less than a year.</seg>
<seg id="40">By contrast, giant countries such as Brazil need a longer view.</seg>
<seg id="41">Modern Brazil was born in the late 1980s following its transition to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="42">That was also when the emerging markets asset class was created.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since then, crises have come and gone, but emerging market returns - and progress - have plodded on, not always in a straight line but alongside a not-coincidental secular fall in US interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="44">The big question now for Brazil - and indeed all emerging markets - is whether that progress will continue as US rates start to rise.</seg>
<seg id="45">No, if you believe the past 30 years have only been about financial liquidity.</seg>
<seg id="46">Yes, if you believe that enough good habits have embedded themselves in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="47">Despite Mr Batista's example, I wager the latter - although it may be a rough ride.</seg>

<seg id="1">The pictorial "RBS Capital Resolution Group"</seg>
<seg id="2">Meet the new £38bn RBS internal bad bank same as the old Non-Core bank:</seg>
<seg id="3">More than half of the above is supposed to be gone in two years, with "no more than" 15 per cent left clogging the UK bank's balance sheet after three years.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's mildly interesting to note RBS using the opportunity to shift stuff around: "Approximately £10 billion to £12 billion of assets currently managed in Non-Core will be returned to relevant Core divisions..."</seg>
<seg id="6">But firstly, why was the Treasury so wary in the end of setting up an external bad bank?</seg>
<seg id="7">Apart from the Chancellor never having liked the idea</seg>
<seg id="8">You can turn to the mere 150 pages or so of its review for an idea of that - in which Rothschild, BlackRock Solutions, and Slaughter and May have no doubt expensively told the government the enormous bank it owns is one of "sheer complexity" (really?) and set out options for funding any bad bank.</seg>
<seg id="9">The advice (see Chapter 9) dismisses a few "synthetic structures" - halfway houses where RBS would still technically hold assets but the government would enter into a total return swap with the bank, or protect a subsidiary holding the assets against losses - before getting to a directly owned and funded bad bank.</seg>
<seg id="10">But ultimately that collapses too, in part because of "value-destructive" EU State Aid rules.</seg>
<seg id="11">Weirdly enough, there's no mention of the waiver that the Treasury was supposed to have requested from any application of the latest rules, which could have required shareholder and junior bondholder losses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Surely a waiver would have made it easier.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead, just a note that "the Government has not engaged in detailed negotiations with the European Commission as to the likely parameters of a package of remedies..."</seg>
<seg id="14">So you could call the review pointless, and the internal bad bank window-dressing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then again... RBS is already practically operating as a government agency anyway.</seg>
<seg id="16">Exhibit A on Friday: the bloodless "business review" also in the IMS...</seg>
<seg id="17">To capture the full potential of its customer businesses RBS is undertaking a comprehensive business review of its:</seg>
<seg id="18">○ Customer-facing businesses</seg>
<seg id="19">○ IT and operations</seg>
<seg id="20">○ Organisational and decision-making structures</seg>
<seg id="21">The review will aim to improve the bank's performance and effectiveness in serving its customers, shareholders and wider stakeholders...</seg>

<seg id="1">Castiglione, Queen's Gallery, review - Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="2">In the not-so-humbly titled Genius of Castiglione, meanwhile, the artist reclines insouciantly, embracing a trumpet of Fame and awaiting the Crown of Immortality.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clearly this isn't someone lacking a sense of his own worth.</seg>
<seg id="4">The curators argue Castiglione had the talent to justify the arrogance, but his violent temper prevented him from making it to the very top.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moving, aged 20, to Rome - then under the Counter-Reformation resurgence of Pope Urban VIII - Castiglione realised the pastoral landscapes of Genoese tradition were too provincial.</seg>
<seg id="6">His prospects weren't helped either by a lack of proper academic training - he often extensively covered his figures in drapery to disguise his difficulties depicting the human body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Within 15 years, though, he'd developed one of the 17th century's most distinctive graphic styles.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his finest etching, Circe with the Companions of Odysseus Transformed into Animals, he uses all manner of mark-making techniques (stippling, flicking, dashes, scribbles, cross-hatches) to create a scene of such varied texture you can't believe one same needle produced the fur, foliage, armour and architectural stonework.</seg>
<seg id="9">A relish for dramatic chiaroscuro is observable in many prints too.</seg>
<seg id="10">We see it in The Finding of the Bodies of Peter and Paul, where an anxious few men - lit by a single torch - venture into a cavernous vault and find the hidden corpses of the two martyred saints: Paul headless, Peter still clutching his keys.</seg>
<seg id="11">To play further with the contrast of light and dark, Castiglione even pioneered a new printing process, the monotype.</seg>
<seg id="12">His career took him across Italy - to Naples, Mantua, Bologna and beyond - though this was less out of wanderlust than his hotheaded habit of picking fights and needing to leave town sharpish or face retribution.</seg>
<seg id="13">As well as facing 12 lawsuits and shooting at an artist who'd ridiculed him, he's said to have beaten up several men and even attempted to throw his own sister off a roof.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most infamously of all, after a dispute with the doge of Genoa over a withdrawn commission, Castiglione hastened to the palace, drew his knife and slashed the painting in question to pieces, insisting his Highness would never have a work by him again.</seg>
<seg id="15">Much is rightly made of Castiglione's innovation in drawing on paper in oils - inspired by (one-time Genoa residents) Rubens and van Dyck, though in his case the works were finished pieces rather than studies for paintings.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nativity is a deft example, loose initial strokes of dilute pigment brought into focus by short, later strokes of near-dry pigment, attracting our attention to the Christ child at the centre.</seg>
<seg id="17">A detail from Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione's 'Two Fransciscan Saints in devotion' (The Royal Collection/ Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II)</seg>
<seg id="18">For me, however, these images, in their unrelenting reddish-brown, do start to blur into one when exhibited in such numbers as they are here (drawn from the Royal Collection's ample supply).</seg>
<seg id="19">For variety's sake, one wishes just a couple of Castiglione's paintings were on show rather than solely graphic works.</seg>
<seg id="20">A bigger problem, though, is the spectre of Caravaggio, which haunts this exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="21">That titan's story is so similar to Castiglione's: the impetuosity, the violence, clashing with patrons, fleeing from cities, freewheeling approach to pictures, fondness for darkness both in art and in life...</seg>
<seg id="22">You might even say Caravaggio created the template for Castiglione's entire career, and the latter - like the worthy sequel to a blockbuster original - inevitably suffers from the comparison.</seg>

<seg id="8">The force helicopter, police dogs and the Dartmoor Rescue Team were all involved in the search of the village near Newton Abbot.</seg>
<seg id="9">An appeal on Facebook led to hundreds of villagers joining the search.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 01:23</seg>
<seg id="3">A dog rescued by the RSPCA because of fears he was being beaten by his owners has been given a new life helping to catch criminals.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German shepherd was found living outside a Bradford house in a small, dark kennel with no food or water.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because of his mistreatment, the dog, renamed Chance, had behavioural issues and could not be rehomed.</seg>
<seg id="6">A West Yorkshire Police dog handler spotted him at the kennels and he was taken on and trained as a police dog.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chance's handler PC Mick Kilburn said: "He immediately demonstrated some of the raw ability needed to become a general purpose police dog and was allocated to me, to replace my current police dog who is due to retire."</seg>
<seg id="8">Friend and protector</seg>
<seg id="9">He added: "As a police dog handler these dogs become your life - it's not a 9-5 job - you take them home with you, care and look after them 24/7.</seg>
<seg id="10">They aren't just a tool that is used by the police, they become your work partner, friend and protector.</seg>
<seg id="11">I couldn't be more proud of how well Chance has done.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Kilburn said in his eight years with the dog section, it was the first time a dog had been recruited in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chance will now start his police role in earnest after a special "passing out" ceremony on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">An RSPCA spokesperson said: "Everyone at the local RSPCA branch is thrilled that Chance is getting this second shot at life with the West Yorkshire Police in such a useful and heroic role.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are so many rescue animals just waiting for a new home and Chance is a great ambassador for rescue dogs everywhere.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bart Cummings: Spry glasses</seg>
<seg id="2">ONE of Bart Cummings' favourite proverbs - and there are several - is that training horses is like being a detective.</seg>
<seg id="3">"He's always double and triple checking," says James Cummings, his 25-year-old grandson and co-trainer.</seg>
<seg id="4">He's still checking up on us all.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the years go by, the more Clouseau-like skills are required if you are to track the whereabouts and well-being of the man owning the most identifiable eyebrows in the country.</seg>

<seg id="8">Will he be at Flemington on Derby day?</seg>
<seg id="9">Don't know.</seg>
<seg id="10">Will it take the appearance of his eight-year-old warrior, Precedence, fighting to qualify for the Cup, to ensure his appearance on Tuesday?</seg>
<seg id="11">And what of Bart's health?</seg>
<seg id="12">A frail and brittle tuxedoed man was helped to the stage at last month's Australian Horse of the Year awards in Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="13">The rare public appearance snapped everyone back to reality.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cummings celebrates after a win with Rogan Josh in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="15">Gone were the iconic aviator sunglasses and healthy silver mane.</seg>
<seg id="16">They have been replaced with large, black frames on account of his failing eyesight.</seg>
<seg id="17">So when you track down Cummings on Friday morning, as he boards a plane in Sydney on his way to Melbourne, the first question is simple and respectful.</seg>
<seg id="18">Will horse racing's equivalent of Bradman be healthy enough to be trackside, as he prepares to possibly go into bat for the final time?</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Cummings, are you OK?</seg>
<seg id="20">Cummings after Saintly won in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Mate," he says, pausing for effect, "I'm 86."</seg>
<seg id="22">You can almost hear him laughing on the inside.</seg>
<seg id="23">For the record, he turns 86 on November 14.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I'm OK," he continues.</seg>
<seg id="25">I've just got sore eyes, that's my problem.</seg>
<seg id="26">For an 86-year-old, I'm not too bad.</seg>
<seg id="27">I'm great.</seg>
<seg id="28">No problem ... Now what else can I help you with?</seg>

<seg id="31">If his body is failing him it's evident that his mind and legendary wit are not, and that's something worth holding on to as the time approaches when the Melbourne Cup will come and go without Bart.</seg>
<seg id="32">That sounds weird.</seg>
<seg id="33">A Cup without Bart. It's like scotch without ice.</seg>
<seg id="34">A pie without sauce.</seg>
<seg id="35">A stable without flies.</seg>
<seg id="36">How many flies am I allowed to have?</seg>
<seg id="37">Bart deadpanned decades ago to a health inspector, who observed there were so many of them in his stables.</seg>
<seg id="38">The line never tires, no matter how many times you hear it.</seg>
<seg id="39">Long shot: Bart Cummings.</seg>
<seg id="40">The flies will have far less salubrious surroundings after the Spring Carnival, when Cummings closes his Saintly Place stables in Ascot Vale, in one of the streets that run behind Flemington's main grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="41">The boxes that have housed giants of racing such as Think Big, Leilani, So You Think and, of course, Saintly, will be demolished to make way for 62 units.</seg>
<seg id="42">Right now, it is the home of Precedence - the "gentleman of the stable" - and he represents Cummings' diminishing prospects of having a Cup runner.</seg>
<seg id="43">"He's getting old," says long-time stable foreman Reg Fleming.</seg>
<seg id="44">Nothing lasts forever.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's the sad reality of life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He's talking about the boss here, not Precedence.</seg>
<seg id="47">After Viewed scored a major upset in the 2008 Melbourne Cup, Fleming was asked in the mounting yard to sum up the trainer's ability.</seg>
<seg id="48">"There's Bradman and there's Bart," Fleming says.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the twilight of Cummings' career, it is a comparison made with greater frequency, but it's a comparison that makes the man himself squirm.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Well, I hope he [Fleming] is a good judge," Cummings says.</seg>
<seg id="51">I don't like commenting on that.</seg>
<seg id="52">He's not the only one who has said it, but I don't like talking about that one.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then this: "I wasn't bad at cricket, but I wasn't as good as Bradman."</seg>
<seg id="54">It is eight years ago, and somehow you have fluked your way into the Crystal Club lounge, on Level 33 of Crown Towers.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is the day before the Melbourne Cup, and high society and captains of industry natter away as they quaff expensive champagne.</seg>
<seg id="56">James and then wife Erica Packer are there.</seg>
<seg id="57">Lady Sonia McMahon, too.</seg>
<seg id="58">Then Bart enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="59">He's dressed in immaculate blue pinstripe suit, pink shirt and a light blue tie knotted in a double Windsor so thick it looks like a football.</seg>
<seg id="60">The room falls silent.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Look, there's Bart," coos someone from the back of the room.</seg>
<seg id="62">Cummings might be able to stop a room of the country's richest people dead in its well-heeled tracks, but his influence does not extend so far that the Victorian Racing Club will bend its rules to allow him a Cup runner on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="63">The VRC committee has the discretion to exclude runners, not include them.</seg>
<seg id="64">At 29th in the order of entry, Team Cummings needs five horses to drop out.</seg>
<seg id="65">Much depends on the outcome of Saturday's Mackinnon and Lexus stakes.</seg>
<seg id="66">It's touch and go.</seg>
<seg id="67">"I don't know if it's my place to have a discussion with the VRC about it," says James Cummings.</seg>
<seg id="68">I tell you one thing: Bart wouldn't be scared to if it came to it.</seg>
<seg id="69">I'm sure he would be happy to show a bit of cheek and ask if they could not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="70">[Precedence] is a Moonee Valley Cup winner.</seg>
<seg id="71">He's not without a hope.</seg>
<seg id="72">Having announced a training partnership in August, following four years of James working as Bart's Sydney foreman, the spring represents a clear changing of the guard in the Cummings dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is plenty of talk in the industry that Bart hasn't been in charge for years.</seg>
<seg id="74">It's typical of the uncertainty and mystery surrounding him.</seg>
<seg id="75">"We talk very frequently," says James, who called Bart before and after Precedence's win in the Moonee Valley Cup on Cox Plate day.</seg>
<seg id="76">His mind is still very sharp.</seg>
<seg id="77">Asked if his grandfather remains hands-on, James says: "I don't think Bart's saddled up a horse for 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="78">His saying is, 'Why have a dog and bark, too?"'</seg>
<seg id="79">Fleming laughs when you suggest Bart merely lends his name to the operation.</seg>
<seg id="80">"Well, he phoned me eight times yesterday and six times today," he says.</seg>
<seg id="81">I thought, 'It must be Melbourne Cup time.'</seg>
<seg id="82">He's still having his input.</seg>
<seg id="83">The younger Cummings bristles when you ask him what his grandfather has taught him in the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="84">Have you got a few weeks?</seg>
<seg id="85">I can take you through it.</seg>
<seg id="86">He pays a lot of attention to detail.</seg>
<seg id="87">He prefers to do today what he can do tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="88">He's as strict on knowing your powers of observation are at their best.</seg>
<seg id="89">He equally prickles when you ask if he will have the same obsession with the Cup as his grandfather.</seg>
<seg id="90">"The Melbourne Cup is his legacy, but you ask any trainer: there's another 51 weeks of the year," James says.</seg>
<seg id="91">You've got to live and prove you are still relevant.</seg>
<seg id="92">It's a game that's got pressures that are more than one week of the year.</seg>
<seg id="93">I must admit, having said that, it is the best week in Australian racing.</seg>
<seg id="94">But you can't ignore the necessities of the business.</seg>
<seg id="95">We're always on the look-out for the next Cup winner, but also horses that are stallions, two-year olds and milers.</seg>
<seg id="96">Any top horse.</seg>
<seg id="97">On the morning of the 1965 Melbourne Cup, Bart Cummings didn't know if he would race Light Fingers.</seg>
<seg id="98">She had been favourite for the Caulfield Cup that spring, but scratched because of a shoulder muscle tear.</seg>
<seg id="99">She raced in the Mackinnon, but the run was terrible.</seg>
<seg id="100">Cummings sat with her rider, Roy Higgins, in the jockeys' room for half an hour and discussed whether she should run.</seg>
<seg id="101">Legendary vet Percy Sykes was adamant she should be turned out to the paddock.</seg>
<seg id="102">In the following days, the lightly built mare gradually improved.</seg>
<seg id="103">On Cup morning, Bart looked at Sykes, then looked at Higgins.</seg>
<seg id="104">"Your call," he told the jockey.</seg>
<seg id="105">"Let's run her," he said.</seg>
<seg id="106">Light Fingers won the first of Cummings' 12 Melbourne Cups that afternoon, beating stablemate Ziema.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Bart had backed Ziema," Higgins recalls.</seg>
<seg id="108">But Bart worked on that girl [Light Fingers], on a daily basis, on an hourly basis, to get her right.</seg>
<seg id="109">The confidence we had in one another ... That to me proved his genius.</seg>
<seg id="110">He overruled the vet.</seg>
<seg id="111">Higgins had only known Cummings for a year at that stage.</seg>
<seg id="112">On reflection, he could see then what makes him special still.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I started to realise, at that early stage, what a perfectionist he was," Higgins says.</seg>
<seg id="114">He was a man of very few words.</seg>
<seg id="115">A very astute listener.</seg>
<seg id="116">He would want to hear your opinion ahead of his.</seg>
<seg id="117">He'd be listening intently, taking it all in.</seg>
<seg id="118">I often had the feeling he had no idea what I was talking about.</seg>
<seg id="119">One of his great sayings, 'The cheapest thing in racing is patience, and nobody uses it.'</seg>
<seg id="120">He nearly drove you mad with patience.</seg>
<seg id="121">Fleming came into Cummings' inner sanctum decades later, and when you ask him about the boss's defining attribute, he echoes Higgins, almost to the word.</seg>
<seg id="122">"Patience," he says.</seg>
<seg id="123">He's always told me that patience costs nothing.</seg>
<seg id="124">And commonsense.</seg>
<seg id="125">Use commonsense in everything in life, and you'll get through OK.</seg>
<seg id="126">Horse training is no different.</seg>
<seg id="127">He doesn't say much, but when he does he listens.</seg>
<seg id="128">Fleming joined Cummings' Flemington operation 18 years ago, just as Saintly arrived.</seg>
<seg id="129">Bart had lost almost everything after his Cups King Syndication scheme had failed in the late 1980s, and he needed wealthy Malaysian property tycoon Dato Tan Chin Nam to rescue him.</seg>
<seg id="130">Then, in 1996, Saintly won the Cox Plate and Melbourne Cup and that changed everything.</seg>
<seg id="131">"He was down and out," Fleming says.</seg>
<seg id="132">Since then, we've won three Melbourne Cups, four Cox Plates, four Mackinnons, three Australian Cups ...</seg>
<seg id="133">As it stands, with the final Cup field to be released after the Derby Day meeting, Cummings is looking not so much for a winner as a starter.</seg>
<seg id="134">Fleming insists Precedence is "a better horse than Rogan Josh," which won the Cup for the stable in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="135">If the horse does sneak into the 24-horse field, you can bet Bart will be there at Flemington on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="136">"I won't if I don't have a runner," Bart says.</seg>
<seg id="137">Precedence is better now than he's been in the past.</seg>
<seg id="138">His current form is very good.</seg>
<seg id="139">I'm hoping for the best.</seg>
<seg id="140">We all are.</seg>
<seg id="141">Despite the mythical image that conjures, of a wearied Bart Cummings holding aloft the Cup for the 13th and possibly final time, it isn't necessary for him to assure his place in Australian sporting history.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I've read his book, I've read books on him by other people," James says.</seg>
<seg id="143">They're times for reflection and times to have great admiration.</seg>
<seg id="144">But when I work for him and with him, it's about what's around the corner.</seg>
<seg id="145">I've been honoured and privileged to learn from him for the last four years, but there's not much time for reflection.</seg>
<seg id="146">There's too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="147">There isn't a lot of time for thinking about Bradman.</seg>
<seg id="148">We're busy thinking about the next winner.</seg>
<seg id="149">His grandfather isn't looking back, either.</seg>
<seg id="150">On this day last year, he was approached in the Flemington enclosure and asked if could ever envisage the day when he might retire.</seg>
<seg id="151">He was genuinely stunned at the question.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I won't be seeing anything when I'm six-foot under, will I?" the master trainer said.</seg>
<seg id="153">Would I ever think about retiring?</seg>
<seg id="154">I wouldn't think so, no.</seg>

<seg id="6">Some of Sri Lanka's disappeared are Tamil rebels who fought in the 26-year civil war; others are innocents who were caught up in the turmoil.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)</seg>
<seg id="2">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win," Glading said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.</seg>
<seg id="26">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
<seg id="38">But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.</seg>
<seg id="41">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>
