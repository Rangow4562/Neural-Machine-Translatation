<seg id="1">Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.</seg>
<seg id="6">How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.</seg>
<seg id="15">The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.</seg>
<seg id="28">The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="33">Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.</seg>
<seg id="34">While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.</seg>

<seg id="1">Review: 'Not Yet Begun to Fight' chronicles struggle of wounded vets</seg>
<seg id="2">The documentary "Not Yet Begun to Fight" follows war veterans on the mend from different physical and psychological traumas as they take up fly fishing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Retired Marine Col. Eric Hastings, a Vietnam vet, co-founded the Warriors & Quiet Waters Foundation, a Bozeman, Mont., retreat that provides a six-day recreational program that supplements the rehabilitation regimens for wounded service personnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Along for the ride are Marine Capt. Blake Smith, who survived a helicopter collision that left him paraplegic; retired Navy SEAL Elliott Miller, who was shot and lost his ability to speak; Marine Staff Sgt. Mark Hupp, wrestling with post-traumatic stress disorder; Marine Cpl. Erik Goodge, who lost his right eye in a blast; and Army Sgt. Erin Schaefer, also paraplegic.</seg>
<seg id="5">This turns out to be the perfect companion piece/illegitimate sequel/rebuttal to "Act of Valor," the Navy SEAL recruitment commercial turned feature-length patriotic claptrap.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Not Yet Begun to Fight" is barely an hour long, but it justifies a theatrical release with a lyrical meditation on nature and war reminiscent of "The Thin Red Line" and "Beau Travail."</seg>
<seg id="7">The juxtaposition of untouched wilderness with broken bodies in "Not Yet Begun to Fight" adds urgency to its lofty existential conundrum (and mercifully helps the film avoid turning into a glorified infomercial for Hastings' organization).</seg>
<seg id="8">Ultimately, though, it's slightly disappointing that directors Shasta Grenier and Sabrina Lee confine the movie to just the weeklong fly-fishing expedition, sidestepping a few worthwhile tangents - such as the veterans having to re-learn everything through physical therapy - that could have been expanded on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not Yet Begun to Fight</seg>
<seg id="10">Running time: 1 hour</seg>

<seg id="3">PC Aaron Walker arrived and him and Gibson 'grappled for 11 minutes'</seg>
<seg id="4">Gibson, the son of Baron Ashbourne, denies any wrongdoing</seg>
<seg id="5">By Inderdeep Bains</seg>
<seg id="6">Claims: Charles Gibson, the son of a peer, is alleged to have fought with PC Aaron Walker who tried to arrest him</seg>
<seg id="7">A baron's son who allegedly attacked his BBC presenter wife during a row was pepper-sprayed as he fought with a policeman who was trying to arrest him, a court heard.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Hon Edward Charles d'Olier Gibson is accused of punching an officer despite being sprayed twice in the face and struck repeatedly in the shins with a baton after resisting arrest for assaulting his wife.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police were called to the former city financier's £1million home after he allegedly dragged his wife of 12 years, BBC World News presenter Tanya Beckett, by the hair as they rowed about whether they should get a divorce.</seg>
<seg id="10">Gibson, 45, appeared at Oxford magistrates" court yesterday charged with assaulting 47-year-old Mrs Beckett and PC Aaron Walker.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Oxford-educated son of Edward Barry Greynville Gibson, 80, fourth Baron Ashbourne, denies both charges.</seg>
<seg id="12">PC Walker told the court that Gibson had made him fear for his well-being after the father managed to throw him to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer said he was called to the five-bedroom detached home the couple shared near Watlington, Oxfordshire, in the early hours of June 8.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mrs Beckett had reported that Gibson had threatened her and grabbed her hair during a discussion about getting a divorce.</seg>
<seg id="15">The officer said that the couple, who have three children, had been drinking heavily and that when he arrived, he discovered one of Gibson's shotguns was unaccounted for.</seg>
<seg id="16">The policeman told District Judge Tim Pattinson that this led to a search of the grounds of the home.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then, at around 2.30am, the defendant's car pulled into the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="18">PC Walker said Gibson ignored his instruction to stay put.</seg>
<seg id="19">After he tried to restrain Gibson, the pair grappled for 11 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Strength: Gibson, pictured with his wife at a Mayfair party in 2006, carried on fighting while handcuffed and simply wiped pepper spray out of his eyes</seg>
<seg id="21">PC Walker, who said he weighs 13-and-a-half stone, told the court that even though he handcuffed one of his hands, Gibson managed to throw him off as if he weighed "nothing."</seg>
<seg id="22">He added: "At some point, he has taken a swing at me, which I moved to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"He said to me, "you're not arresting me, I'm going home."</seg>
<seg id="24">I then reached for my capacitor (pepper spray) and sprayed it directly into Mr Gibson's eyes.</seg>
<seg id="25">He stood there, wiped it from his eyes and called me a coward.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is the first time I have ever had a capacitor fail on me.</seg>
<seg id="27">'Dragged by the hair': Police attended after Mrs Beckett reported that Gibson had threatened her and grabbed her hair during a discussion about getting a divorce</seg>
<seg id="28">The officer said he then drew his baton and hit Gibson as hard as he could, three times on his shins, which also had no effect.</seg>
<seg id="29">He said: "This was an "Oh no" moment on my part, because I have never come across a person I have not been able to physically overpower."</seg>
<seg id="30">PC Walker then described being punched in the side by Gibson as he tried to grab him again.</seg>
<seg id="31">The policeman claims Gibson then told him that he was "nobody and did not have the power to arrest somebody like him."</seg>
<seg id="32">Wife: Gibson is accused of assaulting BBC World News presenter Tanya Beckett, whom he married in 2001</seg>
<seg id="33">Presenter: Gibson, pictured top left with colleagues at the launch of LBC radio in 2003, is a broadcaster</seg>
<seg id="34">The armed response unit had to be called as back up before Gibson was eventually taken into custody, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="35">Edmund Gritt, defending, suggested to PC Walker that his client had never said such words and the officer had failed to identify who he was.</seg>
<seg id="36">The officer denied this.</seg>
<seg id="37">The trial was adjourned until later this month.</seg>

<seg id="1">In 'The Great War,' Joe Sacco unfolds the art of war</seg>
<seg id="2">For Joe Sacco, the decision to do "The Great War" (W.W. Norton: boxed, unpaged, $35) grew out of a kind of dare.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea - to create a panoramic drawing of the Western Front, and more specifically, the first day of the Battle of the Somme - had been a source of late-night conversation in the 1990s, when he'd shared a New York apartment with a young editor named Matt Weiland, who, like Sacco, was fascinated by the First World War.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fifteen years later, after Weiland took a job at W.W. Norton, one of the first calls he made was to Sacco, to ask if he "was ready to revisit this presumably alcohol-induced idea."</seg>
<seg id="5">"My first reaction was no," Sacco recalls with a little laugh of memory, over the phone from Portland, Ore., where he lives.</seg>
<seg id="6">At 53, the journalist and artist - who over the last 20 years has produced a series of reported comics from war zones in Bosnia and the Middle East, including "Palestine," which won a 1996 American Book Award, "Safe Area Gorazde," supported in part by a 2001 Guggenheim Fellowship, and "Footnotes in Gaza," a 2009 Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist, which looks into the mass killing of Palestinians by Israeli army units in 1956 - had grown tired of conflict, although, he says, "I can never get away."</seg>
<seg id="7">To Sacco, journalism is more than a job, it is a calling, a way of telling stories that must be told.</seg>
<seg id="8">And yet, he has come to realize, "it doesn't answer all the questions."</seg>
<seg id="9">At some point, you start to wonder: What's in the mind of a killer?</seg>
<seg id="10">Such a question is especially fraught for a journalist who tells stories in the form of comics, since no matter how scrupulous the reporting, we are inevitably aware of his framing eye.</seg>
<seg id="11">"When I did 'Footnotes,'" Sacco recalls, "I was asked why I didn't draw the faces of the soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="12">It was because I didn't know what they were thinking so I couldn't draw them.</seg>
<seg id="13">I didn't know who they were.</seg>
<seg id="14">This suggests one of the challenges of "The Great War," which looks back to 1916 and is, therefore, less a work of journalism than of history.</seg>
<seg id="15">And yet, paradoxically, this gave Sacco his first inkling of how to approach the project, as the expression of a mass event.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It made me think, how do I do this?" he explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">There were many different directions it could go.</seg>
<seg id="18">Normally, I would try to personalize; here I wanted to take a step back.</seg>
<seg id="19">What I wanted to portray was a very large army with one objective - moving forward and dying together.</seg>
<seg id="20">To highlight this intention, "The Great War" breaks out of the comics format altogether, offering one extended image, a 24-foot black and white drawing, accordion-folded and bound into a hardcover slipcase that can be read, left to right, like a tapestry or a scroll.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among its inspirations was Matteo Pericoli's "Manhattan Unfurled," a continuous representation of the New York City skyline, published in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sacco, however, "didn't want to draw a static picture," so he began to look for other models, eventually turning to the Bayeux Tapestry, a medieval work that records the Norman Conquest; he describes it in an author's note as "my touchstone" for its ability to evoke narrative in a single frame.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I've always loved medieval art," he observes, "and how medieval artists approach space and time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Space is metaphoric.</seg>
<seg id="25">An inch can be a mile or 100 yards.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once I realized that, I didn't have to worry about perspective.</seg>
<seg id="27">I could make it claustrophobic in a medieval way.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, "The Great War" opens with Gen. Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, walking in the garden of his headquarters, before moving on to an overlapping image of Haig on horseback, riding past troops as they mass for the front.</seg>
<seg id="29">Were this a traditional (or even strictly realistic) effort, Haig could not be in two places at once, but that's the beauty and the challenge of the form.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It's different than a comic," Sacco says, "because there are no panels, so the image has to hold together as you walk across it."</seg>
<seg id="31">The idea was to take soldiers from the rear to the battle and out, ending with them walking back to the casualty station, men in bandages and graves.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, at one point, he refers to the narrative as "the general and the grave, and what happened in between" - as succinct a metaphor for war, any war, as we are likely to come across.</seg>
<seg id="33">What happened in between, of course, is the essence of the story: a massacre in which Haig so miscalculated the effects of his artillery on the German trenches that 20,000 British troops were slaughtered the first day.</seg>
<seg id="34">"That's more than all the Americans killed in Iraq and Afghanistan combined," Sacco says by way of perspective - although as we move through his drawing, perspective shatters, the lines of British soldiers collapsing into chaos, the battlefield devastated by explosions and violent death.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Plans for the orderly march forward in line abreast were quickly abandoned as men separated into small groups and sought the shelter of hillocks and shell holes," historian Adam Hochschild writes in an essay that accompanies "The Great War"; the power of Sacco's image, though, is that it encapsulates all that without words.</seg>
<seg id="36">"I didn't want this to be about bravery," he insists, "but about carnage and its aftereffects."</seg>
<seg id="37">There was such enthusiasm on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="38">This was where you had to be if you were a young man of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="39">But where does it lead?</seg>
<seg id="40">Even when I was drawing, I wanted to think about these things.</seg>
<seg id="41">I always knew that the battle would be at the center, but I also wanted to illustrate the trenches, and how they kept feeding, always feeding, the beast.</seg>
<seg id="42">This is the difference between history and journalism, which we might define as the difference between the big picture and the small.</seg>
<seg id="43">When it comes to journalism, in other words, it is important to see the faces of the soldiers, whereas history involves too many faces to see them all.</seg>
<seg id="44">"As someone who has done a lot of work with conflict," Sacco says, "I begin to wonder about the species."</seg>
<seg id="45">Not just the British and the Germans; I'm thinking about humanity and our enthusiasm for war.</seg>
<seg id="46">A journalist goes to the next conflict, but in the end, to me, you see the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="47">It's cooperative, but what is it that we cooperate on?</seg>
<seg id="48">What do we put our shoulder to?</seg>
<seg id="49">It never goes away, this great human endeavor that is war.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nagold: Hugo Wermter - a choir member for 60 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Having been a singer for 60 years, Hubert Wermter's story with the Männergesangverein Cäcilia (Cï¿½cilia Male Choral Society) is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, during which he was ceremonially honoured.</seg>
<seg id="3">As per usual, Hubert Wermter stood on the stage in the colours of his male voice choir.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even after 60 years he still finds great pleasure from singing with the choir, which has achieved much more than popularity during this period.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wermter has also been active within the association, serving as a member of the committee for 28 years, among other roles.</seg>
<seg id="6">For his commitment and loyalty to the organisation, he has also received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Lay Pastor acting on behalf of the Cäcilian Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with an Association Certificate and a letter of commendation signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst - the choir also serves as a church choir.</seg>
<seg id="7">His choir colleagues presented him with a German Choral Association certificate and an engraved pewter plate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Aside from honouring Hugo, the 31st Autumn Festival progressed as usual: Alongside the Betra Male Voice Choir, the Salzstetten Choral Club, the Baisingen Choral Division and the Local Music Society, the Vollmaringen singers delivered a colourful blend of different choral and song styles, which entertained the 400 or so visitors.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Vollmaringen Male Voice Choir got things running with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".</seg>
<seg id="10">They had also prepared a short serenade as a tribute to their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".</seg>
<seg id="11">The Betra Male Voice Choir also sang classic choral pieces such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".</seg>
<seg id="12">With its mixed choir and its ladies' ensemble - the "Impulschor" (Impulse Choir), the Salzstetten Choral Club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival.</seg>
<seg id="13">The mixed choir carried listeners away to foreign lands with the Neapolitan folksongs "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, while the "Impulschor" also drew on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were included on their programme.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Choral Division of the Baisingen Sports Club returned to its home ground with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", while the Vollmaringen Music Society provided the crowning musical conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="15">For children, there was a small auxiliary programme - "Oma Hanne" (Grandma Hanne), a.k.a Hannelore Stollsteimer, performed a 'Kasperl' theater (similar to Punch and Judy) and read some stories, which kept the children entertained throughout the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hansjakob back in Freihof once again</seg>
<seg id="2">100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his final years in the "Freihof" were brought to life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The large audience was inspired by the extremely amusing role play.</seg>
<seg id="4">From his arrival, to his being conferred with honorary citizenship and his death, Alois Kraftzcyk, the scriptwriter and actor portraying Hansjakob, has written an entertaining play, which received great acclaim under the directorship of Cornelia Volk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Marcus Zagermann, serving as narrator, guided the audience through the ten different scenes, explained circumstances and provided links explaining leaps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retirement.</seg>
<seg id="6">On 22 October 1913, Hansjakob returned home to his childhood paradise, to his Freihof.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was there that the role-play began, with Alois Krafczyk shining once again in his famous role as the town's great son.</seg>
<seg id="8">True to style, he travelled with a two-horse carriage drawn by "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" (Black Forest Chestnut Horses) owned by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not only was he received with great applause from the audience, but was also welcomed by his sister Philippine.</seg>
<seg id="10">Billy Sum-Hermann managed unbelievably well to place herself in the role of the sister and brought the character to life amazingly well, in terms of both her expressions and gestures.</seg>
<seg id="11">Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle (Mï¿½hlenbach Farmer's Band) played appropriately selected musical pieces, thus rounding off the performance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The honour of presenting the title of honorary citizen went to Haslach's Mayor, Heinz Winkler, who, together with a section of the Town Council, made an appearance representing the Mayor of Hüttich from back in Hansjakob's day.</seg>
<seg id="13">The "Dreikönig" (Three Kings) singers then made their own appearance, leading Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh how beautiful, this brings childhood memories of my own time in a Dreikï¿½nig group back to life".</seg>
<seg id="14">With their song, "O Jesulein", they delighted the audience in the Freihof, as did the "Storchentagskinder" (Stork Day Children) with their loud cries of "Heraus, Heraus" (Out, Out).</seg>
<seg id="15">In his day, Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the institutional church, as well as his concerns regarding the excesses in the rural economy, the consequences of industrialisation and the effects of the war.</seg>
<seg id="16">He found his place of rest on his native soil, behind his mausoleum on the Brand  near Hofstetten.</seg>
<seg id="17">The role-play ended with the words "A restless spirit finally found rest and returned home forever".</seg>
<seg id="18">The performance received great applause and many words of praise from the audience.</seg>

<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Raytheon's Small Diameter bomb II scored direct hits on targets moving at operationally representative speeds in testing by the company and the Air Force.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tests followed a series of evaluations in different environments and scenarios that validated the weapon's seeker algorithms and aerodynamics.</seg>
<seg id="4">"These successes are the latest in a series of test flights demonstrating Raytheon's readiness to progress the SDB II program to the System Verification Review and Milestone C," said John O'Brien, SDB II program director for Raytheon Missile Systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">These tests showcase the game-changing capability of Raytheon's tri-mode seeker to detect, track and engage moving targets in adverse weather.</seg>
<seg id="6">The bomb is a precision-guided glide weapon that can hit targets from a range of more than 40 nautical miles.</seg>
<seg id="7">Key to it is the tri-mode -- millimeter-wave radar, uncooled imaging infrared and semi-active laser - target seeker for accuracy in any adverse weather condition.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also is equipped with a data link that passes inflight updates for target changes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Uighurs in China are fearful after Tiananmen Square attack</seg>
<seg id="2">BEIJING - At a restaurant with an arbor of green plastic grape leaves out front and a grill inside for skewers of roast lamb, police have been popping in regularly the last two days to check residency documents of ethnic Uighurs.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the same neighborhood, a Uighur family who had moved into their apartment a few days ago were told to leave immediately, although they paid their rent a month in advance.</seg>
<seg id="4">The midday attack this week at Tiananmen Square has made the Uighurs the least favored ethnic minority in Beijing for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Monday, a family of three Uighurs drove their sports utility vehicle onto a crowded sidewalk, killing two tourists and injuring 40, before setting the car on fire and killing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Authorities have called it a "terrorist act" and described the perpetrators as Islamic militants.</seg>
<seg id="7">Customers are looking at us suspiciously.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Police are looking at us suspiciously," a 38-year-old Uighur restaurant manager in Beijing said Thursday as he served lunch.</seg>
<seg id="9">The man, who gave only his first name, Ali, said police had been coming in regularly to check the identity cards of his staff, as well as any customers who appeared to be Uighurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said the situation was worse back in Xinjiang, the northwestern region of China that is home to most Uighurs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I called friends today in Urumqi [the Xinjiang capital], and they said police are coming by at 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock at night checking ID cards," Ali said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ilham Tohti, a prominent Uighur economist who works with human rights advocates, said he was getting calls from Uighurs who feared losing jobs and apartments in Beijing because of Monday's attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">They included the family who were evicted.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tohti disputed China's characterization of the attackers as Islamic militants.</seg>
<seg id="15">He noted that there had been many similar outbursts by members of the ethnic Han majority, such as a man who tried to blow himself up in the Beijing airport over the summer and a string of knife attacks against schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Many Han Chinese resort to extreme action and harm innocent people as well to express their frustration to society," Tohti said.</seg>
<seg id="17">From the evidence that has been released about this family in the car, they were more like self-immolators who felt they had been wronged and wanted to release their anger.</seg>
<seg id="18">The driver has been identified as Usmen Hasan, who was accompanied by his 70-year-old mother and 30-year-old wife.</seg>
<seg id="19">They had with them knives, steel rods and canisters of gasoline, which they ignited after driving up to the enormous portrait of Mao Tse-tung that hangs over Tiananmen Square.</seg>
<seg id="20">State news media said they were identified as Islamic militants by a flag in the car.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ming Pao, a Hong Kong-based newspaper that obtained photographs and identity cards of the three, reported that they were from Akto county, south of China's westernmost city, Kashgar.</seg>
<seg id="22">The newspaper said there had been many arrests in the city for underground religious study.</seg>
<seg id="23">State media on Wednesday condemned the attack at Tiananmen Square and demanded stiff punishment for alleged accomplices of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="24">Five suspected accomplices were arrested early this week.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Violent terrorist crime is the shared enemy of all humanity, the shared enemy of all ethnic groups in the country, and it must be severely punished under the law," said a commentary in the Communist Party's People's Daily.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 9 million Uighurs live in northwestern China, coexisting uneasily at times with Han Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="27">They frequently complain about institutionalized job discrimination and restrictions imposed by the Communist Party on practice of religion.</seg>
<seg id="28">About 3,000 Uighurs live permanently in Beijing, many of them running restaurants, dealing in jade or doing trade, a holdover of their reputation as merchants on the Silk Road.</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking more European than Asian and speaking a Turkic language, the Uighurs tend to congregate around Ritan Park, an area also frequented by businesspeople from the former Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a large floating population of Uighurs who peddle snacks or come to file petitions with the government, a distinctly Chinese tradition for addressing grievances.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Beijing, Uighurs are often banned from renting hotel rooms.</seg>
<seg id="32">And Tohti said bus stations in Xinjiang have been forbidden in recent months from selling Uighurs bus tickets to Beijing if they are petitioners.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is always difficult for Uighurs in Beijing, but if there is something unusual that happens, then the police step up their vigilance," said Ali, the restaurant manager.</seg>

<seg id="1">Appeal judge SPARES disqualified driver jail to allow him to get married after learning wedding day had already been paid for</seg>
<seg id="2">James Horan, 28, was disqualified and uninsured at the time of the crash</seg>
<seg id="3">Told court he suffers post traumatic stress and was late for work</seg>
<seg id="4">Crown court judge overturned decision just 24 hours later</seg>
<seg id="5">Offender criticised original sentence and claimed it was too 'tough'</seg>
<seg id="6">A disqualified driver who had already been banned FIVE times when he crashed on the motorway was spared jail - so he could tie the knot.</seg>
<seg id="7">James Horan, 28, was sent to prison for four months by district judge Jonathan Taff after the crash in September.</seg>
<seg id="8">However his lawyer appealed and just 24 hours after a sobbing Horan pleaded to be let out, a crown court judge went against the original sentence and his immediate jail term was postponed for two weeks so he could marry Tina McGrail, 28.</seg>
<seg id="9">Offender James Horan wept in court as he described his wish to get married</seg>
<seg id="10">Road safety campaigners have slammed the decision.</seg>
<seg id="11">MP Rehman Chishti, who has campaigned for tougher penalties for repeat offenders, said "This case is another example of why we need tougher sentences for persistent offenders and for those who drive whilst disqualified."</seg>
<seg id="12">'It is astonishing that the culprit has been spared jail to be allowed to get married, when people's lives and safety should be paramount.</seg>
<seg id="13">Neil Greig of the Institute of Advanced Motorists said judges were not in tune with public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">"These sorts of stories undermine the justice system and judges aren't reflecting the seriousness of what has happened," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">But speaking after his wedding last Saturday, father-of-three Horan, of East Dene, who owns a tattoo parlour, tried to blame Judge Taff for being too "tough."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was as if he got some pleasure in beating me down and in that moment my life was torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="17">I owe my lawyer a lot and I'm so happy that we were able to get married.</seg>
<seg id="18">We'd gone to court expecting a community sentence.</seg>
<seg id="19">When the judge said it was four months my legs went.</seg>
<seg id="20">I could only think about Tina, my kids and our wedding day.</seg>
<seg id="21">I knew I had done wrong and I didn't want to get away with it but I never expected him to give me that sentence.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was the toughest he could have been.</seg>
<seg id="23">'It didn't feel right, I've worked hard to put my life back on track and I hadn't driven for six years until that day in September.</seg>
<seg id="24">Everyone at the wedding knew what had happened and I know I have let a lot of people down,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">His wife Tina added "I couldn't believe it when I realised the wedding wasn't going to take place.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the Crown Court judge was really kind and it meant we could get married.</seg>
<seg id="27">Everything went really well and we had a lovely day with our children, our family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">Horan pleaded guilty to driving whilst disqualified and without insurance following the crash on the slip road of the M18, near Rotherham on September 15.</seg>
<seg id="29">He is expected back in court next Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">Defending him, Ms Hester Russell said Horan had missed a period of work due to post traumatic stress disorder since he was the victim of a serious assault last December.</seg>
<seg id="31">She said: "On that particular day he awoke after an extremely unpleasant night's sleep and realised he had missed his train.</seg>

<seg id="1">Should we boycott Botswana?</seg>
<seg id="2">Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="3">Having spent the past three months in Botswana, writing the Bush Telegraph column for this paper, I was saddened to hear a fragile truce between Survival International (SI) and the Botswana government has broken out once more into open warfare.</seg>
<seg id="4">SI, a global campaigner on behalf of tribal people, is demanding a boycott of tourism to Botswana due to the "ongoing persecution of the country's first inhabitants, the Bushmen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The roots of the dispute go back to the mid-Eighties when most of the 5,000 or so Bushmen living in the Kalahari were "voluntarily" relocated to settlements outside the reserve, where they were provided with better access to modern health and education facilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">SI accused the government of forcing the Bushmen to leave, using beatings and the capping of a waterhole as a means of coercion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many say the relocations resulted in the alcohol abuse and cultural disintegration that frequently occurs when indigenous peoples are brought into contact with the modern world.</seg>
<seg id="8">While most agree the government's actions have been heavy-handed in the past, I have seen for myself how well its conservation policies have protected Botswana's unique and fragile ecosystems, including the Kalahari Desert and the Okavango Delta.</seg>
<seg id="9">It has also gone to great lengths to ensure local Botswanans and indigenous groups, including the Bushmen, are employed in tourism and benefit from it, along with their communities.</seg>
<seg id="10">This progress is now under threat following SI's call for a tourist boycott.</seg>
<seg id="11">The current stand-off focuses on the rights of the Bushmen to hunt in the CKGR.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, what is not widely understood outside Botswana is that the lifestyle of the vast majority of the disparate ethnic groups known as Bushmen has already changed beyond recognition.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the stereotypical media image of an unchanged hunter-gatherer lifestyle, many are now farmers and use vehicles and rifles for hunting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indeed, in response to SI's claim that the Bushmen "simply cannot survive if they are not allowed to hunt," the government claims "there is no longer any community in our country which survives solely on the basis of subsistence hunting and gathering."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neeltjie Bower, who has worked with the San (Bushmen) all her life, has created a visitor experience at Grassland Bushman Lodge in the Central Kalahari focused around Bushman culture.</seg>
<seg id="16">Her comments sum up the attitude of many in the Botswana tourism industry:</seg>
<seg id="17">The San won the court case to live in the CKGR and I am happy for them.</seg>
<seg id="18">But they have already lost their hunting skills with bow and arrow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now they have vehicles, dogs, rifles, horses and donkeys.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you allow them to hunt as they please, it can only be a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="21">The worry the government has is the conservation of the wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="22">People from abroad don't realise that most of the San are farmers with cattle and their main idea to go to CKGR was not to live in their traditional way but to get more and bigger grazing for their animals.</seg>
<seg id="23">All San in Botswana get free schooling, free medical help and if they register they can also receive free food.</seg>
<seg id="24">But to hunt as you please?</seg>
<seg id="25">As in many bitter disputes, finding a compromise has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="26">A possible answer would be to grant the Bushmen the right to hunt in the CKGR, but strictly on the condition that they use only traditional hunting and tracking techniques.</seg>
<seg id="27">This would help preserve their millennia-old culture and the fragile wildlife populations of the Kalahari.</seg>

<seg id="1">Persons seriously injured following collision</seg>
<seg id="2">Early on Friday afternoon, two car drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on Landesstraße 44 (a rural road).</seg>
<seg id="3">The police completely blocked off the road immediately, but initially could not make much comment on the cause of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, they did mention that there were various witness statements that first had to be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="5">What is certain is that the 19-year-old female driver of a VW Golf was driving in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came towards her in his Hyundai.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two vehicles collided, whereby the woman was so severely stuck that it took the fire service almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreckage.</seg>
<seg id="7">Initially the actual cause of the accident remained unclear.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both unfortunate parties were taken to nearby hospitals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Time Warner Cable is the Loser in its Battle Against CBS</seg>
<seg id="2">It turns out that CBS was right when it warned Time Warner Cable (TWC) that not carrying its programming - which include Showtime and the Smithsonian Channel - would hurt the cable giant more than the network.</seg>
<seg id="3">During tense month-long standoff last summer - in which TWC balked at paying the rates CBS was asking for its content - about three million cable customers lost all access to CBS programming, including in high-density markets such as Los Angeles, New York and Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the third quarter of 2013, TWC reported that it lost some 300,000 cable subscribers, perhaps as much as half of those losses attributable to the blackout.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the end, TWC blinked first, scared that customers missing out on the premiers of CBS" fall slate and plenty of NFL and SEC football would prove more crippling than the toll the standoff had already created.</seg>
<seg id="6">But even before viewers lost out on their favorite shows, TWC took a hit, according to Business Week.</seg>
<seg id="7">TWC's profit dropped 34% in the most recent quarter, but the stock still has a reported earnings per share of $1.69.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shares are up, even if revenues came in just shy of projections, largely due of the video customer drop.</seg>
<seg id="9">A gain, though, in business services revenue helped offset the video losses.</seg>
<seg id="10">TWC eventually caved to CBS - reportedly paying a heftier fee than it had previously, but still not quite as high as CBS originally demanded - and restored all things CBS, including Price is Right!, to its customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Craig Moffett, analyst for MoffetNathanson, wrote that this scuffle between TWC and CBS may have plenty of further ramifications for other cable companies and networks squabbling over carriage fees, the rights paid to networks to host their feeds.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Every cable operator now goes to the table knowing that CBS not only won the war, but left TWC badly damaged for having fought the fight," he says.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite dropping customers, TWC says putting up a stink at least gave them a better deal in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="14">This little skirmish may be the first we see in a long line of disputes that will not only test cable companies and their resolve to stand against network television, but also in seeing just how much Americans love the networks.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road crash</seg>
<seg id="3">She was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry</seg>
<seg id="4">Firefighters abseil down cliff face to pluck the dog from certain death</seg>
<seg id="5">A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="11">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom.</seg>
<seg id="13">She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid.</seg>
<seg id="14">But she is fine now.</seg>
<seg id="15">She was eating biscuits afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was a very unusual call-out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a very lucky escape."</seg>
<seg id="19">The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="21">Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was terrifying."</seg>
<seg id="22">I could not believe that she was up there in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was amazing to get her back in our arms.</seg>
<seg id="24">The vet said that if she became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.</seg>
<seg id="16">While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Double Down" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Possibly," Martin replied.</seg>

<seg id="2">At their Milan atelier, one of the last truly Old World interiors firms, Studio Peregalli, is making history - mining everything from the high Renaissance to the Victorian era - to create deeply poetic spaces that transcend the bounds of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Italian phrase "buttato lì" translates, roughly, as "something that seems casual whereas it is completely thought out," the interior designer Roberto Peregalli explains.</seg>
<seg id="4">The term comes up often as he and his collaborator, the architect Laura Sartori Rimini, describe the atmosphere of their office as well as the projects that are born there.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are partners in Studio Peregalli, one of the most highly regarded decorating and architecture firms in the world, known for extraordinary attention to detail and an uncanny ability to conjure the rarefied spirit of historical eras long forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="6">We are sitting in their design studio, surrounded by stone samples, fabric swatches, fragments of boiserie and classical cornices, antique light fixtures, architectural models and stacks and stacks of hand-painted tiles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The walls appear to be covered in embossed antique leather, but a brush of the fingers reveals it to be paper.</seg>
<seg id="8">The sun, streaming in from a balcony, illuminates the dark and high-ceilinged room like a 19th-century watercolor in a book by Mario Praz.</seg>
<seg id="9">For a good primer on the literary critic and design historian, I recommend the incredible 1974 Visconti film "Conversation Piece" - the Burt Lancaster character is based on Praz.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is clear that the work under way here is on the highest level of artistic achievement, so much so, in fact, that the principals" relative youth and lack of pretense is almost disconcerting.</seg>
<seg id="11">As congenial and unassuming as Roberto and Laura are, what they are doing is happening nowhere else in the world of design.</seg>
<seg id="12">From this lovely studio on a quiet residential street in Milan - the capital of fashion, and Italy's most hard-charging commercial environment - they are quietly going about the business of creating interiors that are steeped in historical context yet somehow highly personal.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I discovered Roberto Peregalli's house in Tangier, and when I saw it I was very, very moved," says Pierre Bergé, the former fashion executive and partner of Yves Saint Laurent.</seg>
<seg id="14">I fell in love immediately - I never saw in my life such beauty, such romance, such expression of the culture of the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Studio Peregalli is nearly finished with an apartment for him on the Rue Bonaparte in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hamish Bowles agrees.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There's no one doing work like that now - no one with that precise sensibility," notes the international editor at large for American Vogue, also a client.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I have never ceded my taste to anybody else, even as a child," he says, but Studio Peregalli has just finished an apartment for Bowles off University Place in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was the studio's first New York project, and it is at work on another, for the painter John Currin and his wife, Rachel Feinstein.</seg>
<seg id="20">The garden designer Madison Cox is another friend, client and admirer unafraid to employ superlatives when describing their work.</seg>
<seg id="21">"They are the most unique designers that I have come across," Cox says.</seg>
<seg id="22">What they do is about capturing the past, but it's also about magic - and a great sense of poetry.</seg>
<seg id="23">They proposed something to me I would never even have thought of - in fact it kind of terrified me.</seg>
<seg id="24">We can tell you it involved the unlikely marriage of a dome and a garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although the studio has been in business for over 20 years, has shown many of its European interiors in various magazines and in 2011 published a book of its work - the evocatively titled "The Invention of the Past" (Rizzoli) - the work of Roberto and Laura is not especially well known in America.</seg>
<seg id="26">Perhaps one reason for this is that their design process is somewhat cerebral, and may require a measure of patience on the part of their clients that's more rarely encountered in the New World than in the Old.</seg>
<seg id="27">Their process is elaborate, their studio more densely packed with models than Leo's hot tub.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Designing for us is a process, step by step," Laura says.</seg>
<seg id="29">It begins with an idea; then a sketch, then a model.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another reason might be that without the backdrop of European architecture, with its history and scale, as a starting point, the powers of imagination required to decide to live this way are simply too difficult for clients to summon.</seg>
<seg id="31">It would be hard to attempt to get Studio Peregalli-like results in an apartment at Olympic Tower.</seg>
<seg id="32">Finally, there is the modesty of the principals.</seg>
<seg id="33">Roberto and Laura are not self-promoters.</seg>
<seg id="34">They are content to wait to be discovered by clients who truly believe in what they are doing, and appreciate how much care goes into their work.</seg>
<seg id="35">Consider this: I'm standing in the studio, holding a sample of emerald green stamped velvet that is a little reminiscent of old Fortuny and appears to have significant age.</seg>
<seg id="36">They explain that it came to them as white; they dyed it green and then stamped it with the design.</seg>
<seg id="37">"If you have ideas and you have some time, you can use your brain to find ways to make fabric unique," Roberto explains.</seg>
<seg id="38">Every component of an interior by Studio Peregalli, whether fabric, stone or wood, undergoes a similar process.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is impossible to hear about Studio Peregalli without also hearing the name Renzo Mongiardino.</seg>
<seg id="40">Both Roberto and Laura worked with the eminent decorator, who died in 1998, and their styles are closely related.</seg>
<seg id="41">Roberto was particularly close to Mongiardino, who was a family friend, and visited the master in his studio almost every day from an early age until finally going to work for him in 1986, after attaining a degree in philosophy from the University of Milan.</seg>
<seg id="42">Their style is a continuation of the illusionistic, Zeffirelli-set sensibility that earned Mongiardino the reputation of a wizard in interior design circles.</seg>
<seg id="43">Studio Peregalli's admirers agree, however, that interiors by Roberto and Laura have a somewhat gentler touch than those of their mentor.</seg>
<seg id="44">A bit less tea-washed and autumnal, a bit more optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="45">Pierre Bergé, unafraid as ever to speak bluntly, gets right to it.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Their work is much more interesting than Mongiardino," he says.</seg>
<seg id="47">What they do is lighter.</seg>
<seg id="48">For me, Peregalli's work is exactly like opening a book by Mario Praz.</seg>
<seg id="49">(Him again.</seg>
<seg id="50">Did you watch the movie yet?)</seg>
<seg id="51">When speaking in English, Roberto has a way of expressing himself that, intentionally or not, can be impressively precise.</seg>
<seg id="52">Example: Of the act of shopping for an ordinary chair, he points out, "In the 19th century, it was a little bit more difficult to find horrible things."</seg>
<seg id="53">While I am completely copacetic with this statement, Laura is not, and the two partners begin to spar like an old married couple, talking over each other and bickering continually, if affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="54">On this point they concur: they are not interested in historic interiors and architecture for tradition's sake alone.</seg>
<seg id="55">Their passion is engaging in the rigorous intellectual work and creative reveries required to evoke the past.</seg>
<seg id="56">What Studio Peregalli is after is something more than the staging of objects; it is the creation of a narrative.</seg>
<seg id="57">When you hear the partners explain their work, and consider the range of options available to them as designers (both have an appreciation for modernism, and Roberto in particular respects the work of John Pawson), you realize that in their hands, the invention of the past is neither a retrograde nor conservative endeavor, but a bold and fearless one, something akin to the athletic interpretation of classical ballet by Rudolf Nureyev - a Mongiardino client, by the way - or Stanley Kubrick's take on the 18th century in "Barry Lyndon."</seg>
<seg id="58">Those artists were operating in a radical creative mode, achieving something out of their own time by employing a vocabulary forged in years gone by.</seg>
<seg id="59">Roberto takes care to explain the difference in sensibility between his own work and that of his mentor.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Mongiardino grew up in a palace in Genoa," he tells me.</seg>
<seg id="61">He met the past.</seg>
<seg id="62">We did not meet the past - what we are doing is protecting the past, like a wild panda.</seg>
<seg id="63">The impact of their work is felt most profoundly in Milan, the city that demands style - and judges it - more fiercely than any other.</seg>
<seg id="64">While the studio is better known for residential projects, one of its more recent (and most public) triumphs is the restaurant it designed for Giacomo Bulleri, Milan's foremost restaurateur.</seg>
<seg id="65">Da Giacomo, Bulleri's first restaurant, was designed by Mongiardino (with Roberto's assistance) and has been famous for nearly 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="66">In 2009, it was joined by the Giacomo Bistrot, just around the corner and with a little more nighttime glamour.</seg>
<seg id="67">While the palette of Da Giacomo is light and creamy, finished in Eau de Nil green wainscoting and tile, Studio Peregalli's Giacomo Bistrot is full of antique parquet floors, black lacquer and gilded millwork, and a 19th-century buffet bought at the Paris flea market and reconfigured into a bar for this space.</seg>
<seg id="68">The paneling (also acquired at a flea market, this time in Parma) used to adorn a jewelry store.</seg>
<seg id="69">The finished result appears to be a landmark interior from 1875, achingly romantic and utterly convincing, but everything in the space is new construction.</seg>
<seg id="70">"Everyone said, "Are you crazy to do a restaurant like the Bistrot?" " Laura recalls.</seg>
<seg id="71">"But now people of the fashion world come" - to Da Giacomo and its younger sibling - "for their parties."</seg>
<seg id="72">There's no need to elaborate as we sit having dinner in what is clearly the hottest joint in town.</seg>
<seg id="73">A four-top of what might be the most stylish 20-somethings I have ever seen, one of whom is sporting a mohawk, is seated near us on a red velvet banquette under a wall of leather-bound books.</seg>
<seg id="74">Laura grins.</seg>
<seg id="75">"We think that real elegance is to be out of trends," she says.</seg>
<seg id="76">Hamish Bowles tells a story about working with Laura and Roberto that offers a window onto their process, and the commitment they bring to every step.</seg>
<seg id="77">"I was in the Paris flea market with them and found two lamps, which I shipped to Milan to have the lampshades made," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="78">"When they arrived back in New York and I unpacked the crate, it happened to contain two drawings" - working sketches with measurements from Studio Peregalli - "that looked as though Piranesi had done them, rendered with watercolor."</seg>
<seg id="79">For my very humble apartment, and my very humble flea market lamps!</seg>
<seg id="80">You could have framed them.</seg>
<seg id="81">It's hard to say what the future holds for Studio Peregalli, because unlike most decorators who become important and experience success, the usual way forward - more books, a furniture line, a signature linens collection and so on - holds no appeal for them.</seg>
<seg id="82">What they are doing is not really "scalable," and in any case, they do not measure the value of their output in economic terms.</seg>
<seg id="83">They might in fact be the least materialistic successful decorators I have ever met.</seg>
<seg id="84">As with the painter Agnes Martin, having the world beating a path to their door has not changed their motivations or outlook one bit.</seg>
<seg id="85">"We are not businessmen, and we are not managers," Laura explains, despite the fact that they preside over what is clearly a successful and complex operation that employs nearly 100 craftspeople.</seg>
<seg id="86">They are designers, foremost.</seg>
<seg id="87">"Somehow," she says, "we are also dreamers."</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."</seg>
<seg id="6">But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders are sceptical about this.</seg>
<seg id="17">Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.</seg>
<seg id="24">A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction."</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has always taken place.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.</seg>
<seg id="33">For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.</seg>
<seg id="35">Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="42">A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."</seg>
<seg id="43">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grace Dent on TV: Bedlam, Channel 4 // OCD Ward, ITV // OCD Cleaners, Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">As Britain has grown, in recent years, slightly more comfortable with the idea of mental illness and with discussing the turmoils and glitches inside our heads, it's only natural that our TV screens should be flooded with "mad" television.</seg>
<seg id="3">I counted three shows this week that "examined" illness around the anxiety/obsessive-compulsive disorder spectrum alone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Seriously mentally ill people, it seems, are perfect for television.</seg>
<seg id="5">No one wants to watch commonplace, highly functioning mentally ill people - of which there are millions - because 55 minutes on a hairdresser who feels uncontrollably bleak, finds the correct medication and therapy and is back at work within a few months won't win any ratings.</seg>
<seg id="6">The seriously ill, however, are heavily watchable.</seg>
<seg id="7">They represent our darkest fears - irretrievable brainfog manifesting itself in humiliating ways.</seg>
<seg id="8">They look just like us because they are just like us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Plus they're at a safe distance through a TV screen and not remotely our responsibility - double win - which makes them much more affable than the delusional person in your local park.</seg>
<seg id="10">They aren't represented by one of the top five London agents who'll ask for £15k-a-day booking fee and cars.</seg>
<seg id="11">They don't require plots sketched out by a team of assistant producers and daft-haired researchers in a writing room, because their brains are already producing surplus plots.</seg>
<seg id="12">Helen, in Channel 4's Bedlam this week, is, or rather was, a library assistant at the British Museum.</seg>
<seg id="13">She is absolutely certain - during every one of her waking hours - that she had hidden a stranger inside a rubbish bin.</seg>
<seg id="14">See?</seg>
<seg id="15">You couldn't make it up.</seg>
<seg id="16">James is obsessed with sitting on the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="17">He can spend almost all day in the smallest room of the house, terrified that if he stands up he'll have an accident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bedlam - which has full access to The Maudsley Hospital in South London, which traces its roots in treating the mentally ill back to 1247 - is sensitively produced and totally compelling.</seg>
<seg id="19">I watched the first episode about anxiety (also featuring the man who counts everything in "magic numbers" and the man who uses a hundred pairs of surgical gloves a day) and then immediately began the second episode, focusing on the crisis unit which admits suicides and those who are at risk of harming others.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet - and this is important to me - I'm unsure what I really, honestly learned.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's widely documented that in the 17th century, Bedlam raised extra income by allowing spectators inside to view the insanity.</seg>
<seg id="22">The "spectators at Bedlam" fact is one cited endlessly in connection with modern television, especially as Big Brother plays host to those with ongoing addictions and disorders, or the first weeks of X Factor mocks the delusional conceit of people whom it could be argued are unwell.</seg>
<seg id="23">And as a civilised, educated person, I've always set myself snootily aside from the sort of looky-loo who'd have swarmed to Bedlam back then.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, if one looks closely at yesteryear century reasoning behind the spectators, it's documented that there was in actual fact a sincere drive to attract "visitors of quality" in the bid to grow their compassion and understanding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This sounds very familiar; in fact, it's the sort of thing written into the 21st-century mental-illness TV pitch.</seg>
<seg id="26">Clearly, 17th-century Bedlam's plan didn't work, because in fact hundreds of thousands of people learned nothing while having a great time being spooked, and that's ironic as after this week's show I am no closer to telling you the exact name of Helen's or James's diagnosis, the type of medication or genre of talking therapy proscribed to them, the possible side effects of drugs, ballpark long-term prognosis or anything helpful at all I could do to help someone similar.</seg>
<seg id="27">I just know that it's awful and that I don't want to be them.</seg>
<seg id="28">OCD Ward on ITV was, naturally, a slightly more downmarket version of Bedlam, featuring equally compelling, likeable characters, with similarly obsessive issues - just with added toilet-licking.</seg>
<seg id="29">One way to help cure OCD, the show seemed to say, is by being really blasé about touching the toilet bowl in front of your OCD buddy before shoving your hands in your mouth trilling, "Look nothing to worry about, I'm not scared of germs!"</seg>
<seg id="30">That's irrational!</seg>
<seg id="31">Except that publicly shared toilets are actually covered in germs and it's not irrational to want to protect yourself from that - so while a trained therapist with a sterilised toilet could possibly do this therapy, I'd say don't try it at home.</seg>
<seg id="32">None of this was explained in OCD Ward, or the illness tackled in any depth, as it's more interesting to film doctors wiping fragments of other people's poo on their foreheads.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gechingen: Absolute protection not possible</seg>
<seg id="2">"We want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible," said Mayor Jens Häußler, opening the citizen's information event regarding the flood protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Around 80 participants came to the Gemeindehalle (community hall) to have the planned measures explained to them, to express their concerns and submit ideas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Häußler made clear: "The final decisions will be made by the members of the Town Council".</seg>
<seg id="5">Häußler commented that the flood that found Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the future.</seg>
<seg id="6">A river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The goal is the protection of as many developed plots of land as possible," said Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected floods, which statistically occurs every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="9">Climate change is taken into account in the form of an allowance of 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">In expert circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".</seg>
<seg id="11">The masses of water that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,000-year flood.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There is no such thing as absolute protection, but we can attempt to make a relative improvement," said Häußler.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million €must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the town can count on a State subsidy of around 70 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Häußler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to develop such a concept, the town is reliant on the cooperation of its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="18">Among other measures, the protection concept, which (we reported) has already been presented to the Town Council during the past week, plans local measures in the tributary to the River Irm, running from the Stammheim Valley.</seg>
<seg id="19">In conjunction with the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among others, the question was raised as to why embankments and detention reservoirs are no longer planned to protect the location.</seg>
<seg id="21">Gregor Kühn, technical planner at the commissioned engineering company, Hügelsheim-based 'Wald und Corbe', who presented the concept, emphasised that it required the interplay of all proposed measures, in order that their sum might achieve the desired goal.</seg>
<seg id="22">Furthermore, the most economic solution must be found, said Joachim Wald of Wald und Corbe.</seg>
<seg id="23">There was resentment among local residents of the old town, who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the overflowing of the canal network, even during normal thunderstorms.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Häußler indicated that the guidelines for canal systems are different to those for flood protection, and these must not be confused.</seg>
<seg id="26">The town is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that it can withstand rainfall events every two to three years.</seg>
<seg id="27">To make the sewerage channels wider would gobble up millions.</seg>

<seg id="1">$325m rescue package for Tassie health</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state," Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.</seg>
<seg id="7">An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.</seg>
<seg id="8">There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little "unless it's followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing."</seg>
<seg id="14">He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list," Mr Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kerry to Make First Trip to Egypt Since Morsi Ouster</seg>
<seg id="2">CAIRO - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Egypt on Sunday for the first time since the army toppled the country's first freely elected president on July 3, state news agency MENA said.</seg>
<seg id="3">It said the visit to Egypt, whose alliance with the United States has come under strain, would only last several hours.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ties between Washington and Cairo have deteriorated since the overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi, an Islamist who was elected last year.</seg>
<seg id="5">A popular uprising toppled authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak, a longtime U.S. ally, in February 2011.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a sign of the tension, the United States said on October 9 it would withhold deliveries of tanks, fighter aircraft, helicopters and missiles as well as $260 million in cash aid to Egypt pending progress on democracy and human rights.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kerry arrives a day before Mursi and 14 other Brotherhood leaders go on trial on charges of inciting violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mursi's removal has posed a dilemma for U.S. President Barack Obama in dealing with a longstanding strategic ally.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the one hand, he wants to maintain ties with the most populous country, which has a peace treaty with Israel and controls the Suez Canal waterway linking Europe and Asia.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the other, Obama does not want to be seen as acquiescing in the ouster of an elected leader, even if he is an Islamist from the Muslim Brotherhood who had come to be viewed by Washington as ineffective during his turbulent year in office.</seg>
<seg id="11">The U.S. government has repeatedly urged the army-backed interim authorities to govern in a more inclusive manner - code for finding a modus vivendi with the Brotherhood and making progress toward a restoration of democratic rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Brotherhood refuses to work with the military, which it says staged a coup and sabotaged Egypt's democratic gains after the revolt that toppled Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="13">The military denies it carried out a coup, saying it responded to the will of the people.</seg>
<seg id="14">Relations between the United States and Egypt are now in turmoil and the entire Middle East could suffer, Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy said last month.</seg>
<seg id="15">He told state-run Al-Ahram newspaper that Egypt had depended on U.S. aid for too long and that Washington was wrong to assume Cairo would always follow its line.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash</seg>
<seg id="2">With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
<seg id="7">After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">2014 is to be a year of celebration in Geisingen</seg>
<seg id="2">The anniversary celebrations in the town of Geisingen, to mark the 1,250th</seg>
<seg id="3">anniversary of the first documented mention of the town, are drawing closer.</seg>
<seg id="4">When the year comes to an end in just eight weeks, the anniversary year will be upon us.</seg>
<seg id="5">Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first documented together in the year 794.</seg>
<seg id="6">A deed was drafted in Kirchen, in which both towns are mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="7">On 15 March, the anniversary year will be officially launched, and because Geisingen currently has no suitable venues, this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.</seg>
<seg id="8">As part of the anniversary celebrations, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kirchen-Hausen will celebrate the 1,250th anniversary with a celebratory weekend from 18 to 20</seg>
<seg id="10">July.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the Friday there will be a ceremony, and on the Saturday and Sunday a party will be held at the Kirchtalhalle.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kirchen-Hausen Kirchenfest festival will also be held on this celebratory weekend.</seg>
<seg id="13">Town Musical Director, Rudolf Barth, has composed a commissioned piece for the town on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.</seg>
<seg id="14">On 21 June, in conjunction with the Schwarzwaldverein [Black Forest Association] Mid-Summer Festival, on 12 July in the Arena, accompanied by fireworks, and on 13 December as the first concert put on by the Stadtmusik (Town Musical Society) in the new Festival Hall.</seg>
<seg id="15">This venue will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, with the official date set for the last weekend in September, on 27 and 28 September.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the occasion of the Geisingen town anniversary, a new chronicle will also be published.</seg>
<seg id="17">"However, it will not merely be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but rather a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which now consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the Geisingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014, as it was in 1974 that the incorporations to form the current region were completed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The new chronicle is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival Hall in Geisingen.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, 2014 is also a year of many anniversaries in other respects.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Narrenzunft Strohglonki (Strohglonki Fool's Guild celebration) begins on 8 February with an evening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 60-year anniversary/ The Harmonie Gutmadingen music association will turn 90 years old and on 29 March will hold a celebratory banquet and then from 1 to 4 May will be celebrating the Bezirksfest [District Music Festival].</seg>
<seg id="22">The Leipferdingen Nursing Home will turn 40 years old, the Geisingen School has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebrating this on 10 May, and the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celebrating this as part of the Brunnenfest [Fountain Festival] from 4 to 7 July.</seg>
<seg id="23">The town of Geisingen was first officially documented in the year 764, in a deed of donation, which is now in the possession of the St. Gallen Monastery.</seg>
<seg id="24">The deed was drawn up in Kirchen (Hausen), which at the time was the location of the courthouse.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both communities are thus mentioned in the same deed.</seg>
<seg id="26">One reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,250-year anniversary in this way, is that it also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the Community Reform (Gemeindereform).</seg>

<seg id="11">"Previously the estimate for uncertainty in the weather was based on a less physical method but now ECMWF has switched to a new method which provides a more precise method for uncertainty," says Barstad.</seg>
<seg id="12">Offshore wind</seg>
<seg id="13">At present the method has been developed for the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea, first and foremost with the idea of deploying and maintaining offshore wind installations.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Barstad believes industry, tourism, agriculture and several other businesses will benefit from the improved method of forecasting the weather.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will be beneficial in a cost-benefit perspective.</seg>
<seg id="16">"For example, Statoil will know there is a 95 per cent probability that the weather will be good enough to go out with equipment and crew and won't have to remain quayside due to poor weather forecasts," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">He thinks the uncertainty prevalent in the forecasts is an untapped possibility.</seg>
<seg id="18">We won't have an exact prediction but will show which area the probability for temperature, wind and rain lies within.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The new forecast will be more accurate because a greater degree of precision can be associated with the correct level of uncertainty in the forecasts," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Easier to make decisions</seg>
<seg id="21">A similar method for forecasting the weather is used today but it has a less precise estimate of the uncertainty and a poorer physical basis, according to Barstad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Therefore there is a greater chance that the realities lie outside the sample space forecast, something which again means that you make important decision on an incorrect basis.</seg>
<seg id="23">The project commenced before the summer and the two hope that even in a year they will have more information to share.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lorenz and Barstad believe that in the long-term the method could be used everywhere, regardless of geographic area.</seg>
<seg id="25">The new forecast will give a more precise estimate of the uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="26">This will make it easier for people who have to make decisions based on weather forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="27">"They know the actual chance of the wind exceeding a certain value," says Torge Lorenz.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mystic's slice of history - Americas - Travel - The Independent</seg>
<seg id="2">Driving south down the leafy, stone-walled roads of Connecticut in the direction of Long Island Sound, I come eventually to an old New England seaport whose name is now forever linked with Julia Roberts.</seg>
<seg id="3">This year Mystic Pizza, a small pizzeria on Bank Square which gave its name to that bouffant film, celebrates its 40th year in business.</seg>
<seg id="4">The people opposite, at Bank Square Books will tell you that Amy Holden Jones's screenplay for Mystic Pizza is really about second-generation Portuguese waitresses in nearby Stonington, not Mystic at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the inspiration for such an engaging title was a little red-and-yellow pizza sign she passed, sandwiched between the Bank of America and the Baptist Church, on driving into Mystic: Mystic Pizza.</seg>
<seg id="6">Had they called the film "Stonington Pizza" I doubt Ms Roberts's breakthrough movie would have achieved quite the same impact.</seg>
<seg id="7">Coming downhill in my car, I see that same small piece of movie history sticking out on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="8">It certainly seems like a good reason to pull over, stretch my legs and find out what the real Mystic, rather than the movie version, is like.</seg>
<seg id="9">I park behind the bank itself, a big white building in Greek Revival style, and Kimberley, the manager, tells me no one will mind.</seg>
<seg id="10">We get a lot of people parking here because they see the Mystic Pizza sign and can't believe it really exists.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think we're more interesting.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the headquarters of the Mystic River Bank back in 1851.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, I take a look inside the world-famous pizza parlour.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's bright and functional just like the film.</seg>
<seg id="15">No big-haired waitresses these days, but lots of Mystic Pizza merchandise on sale alongside real slices of pizza and the film running on a loop on large TV-screens.</seg>
<seg id="16">I buy a boxed pizza for later and head down to the old iron drawbridge that lets pleasure boats and yachts into the seaport.</seg>
<seg id="17">Beyond it are plenty of shops making the most of the town's curious name: Mystic River Yarns, Mystic Drawbridge Ice Creams, John's Mystic Tavern.</seg>
<seg id="18">But I turn left and head down Gravel Street, a winding road that hugs the shore.</seg>
<seg id="19">White 19th-century clapboard buildings run along one side of the street gazing out across to the port.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are odd-numbered from 3 to 31, but No 25 is missing.</seg>
<seg id="21">A couple walking their dog stop to explain that because 25 is on the intersection with Clift Street, and because Colonel Amos Clift built this little side-street in the 1830s, No 25 was numbered as 2 Clift Street in memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mystic Pizza in Mystic, Connecticut The houses come in a variety of classic American styles: Cape Cod Colonial, Greek Revival and Italianate.</seg>
<seg id="23">One of the first was built by Captain Avery Brown, or so the plaque tells me.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's a Cape Cod-style cottage constructed in 1812, the year that America renewed its war on Britain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later, at the Seaport Museum, I find out that Captain Brown served alongside Nathaniel Palmer, the Stonington sealer who was the first American to set foot on Antarctica back in 1820.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unfortunately this charming little cottage has its view of the port obscured by what is known locally as the Spite House, a Greek Revival structure built in 1836 with the deliberate intention, so local rumour goes, of sticking out far enough to spoil Captain Brown's view.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was John Fellowes who built this grandiose mansion.</seg>
<seg id="28">Shame on him.</seg>
<seg id="29">Gravel Street is testimony to the importance of seafaring to this prosperous New England town.</seg>
<seg id="30">Number 15, was built in 1835 by a coffin-maker who sold it in 1847 to Captain Gurdon Gates, who added an Italianate veranda of the kind that was fashionable in the mid-19th century.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 1866, Captain Gates did Mystic proud by making the run around Cape Horn in record time.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Seaport Museum there's a spyglass presented to him in gratitude for "rescue at sea" by a Mr A T Wade of Liverpool.</seg>
<seg id="33">Tales like these run all the way along Gravel Street.</seg>
<seg id="34">That splendid Italianate villa at No 19 was constructed in 1861 by Captain John Williams, who made the journey from New York to San Francisco in a record 89 days and four hours.</seg>
<seg id="35">His clipper, Andrew Jackson, had been built in Mystic.</seg>
<seg id="36">No 21 was built in 1840 by Elisha Denison, whose family pretty much fill up the whole cemetery on the other side of the drawbridge.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Denisons arrived in Mystic in 1680.</seg>
<seg id="38">At No 27 (built by a wealthy net-maker) there's an outbuilding which served as a station on the "Underground Railway" for escaped slaves.</seg>
<seg id="39">And No 29 was built in 1837 for a Captain John Appleman but owned a century later by Captain Ned Beach who commanded the US nuclear submarine Triton.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1960, Triton completed the first submerged circumnavigation of the globe.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given how quiet and Connecticut-cute Mystic is today, you really need a street like this to remind you that all this heritage once belonged to the heroes of a phenomenally adventurous age, when to go to sea was to court fame, fortune and danger in equal measure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bad-Dï¿½rrheim: A dream comes true for the FC</seg>
<seg id="2">The official inaugural ceremony for the astro-turf sports field did not wane in significance for the town and the football club, in spite of the cold weather and rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everyone had hoped for more pleasant conditions for the ceremony last Saturday, however the weather gods chose not to cooperate.</seg>
<seg id="4">So anyone who came without an umbrella, or for whatever reason could not hold onto one, drew the short straw.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the case for the musicians who accompanied the ceremony, as well as for a number of speakers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thus, FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream, also got fairly wet.</seg>
<seg id="7">His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was heavily involved in the realisation of the project, the Town Council, the companies involved and club members who played a part.</seg>
<seg id="8">Particular mention went out to Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.</seg>
<seg id="9">The spry pensioners laid 400 square metres of flagging for the new paths.</seg>
<seg id="10">This remarkable voluntary commitment was also honoured by Member of the State Parliament, Karl Rombach.</seg>
<seg id="11">Further words of greeting were issued to the town Sports Commissioner, Hubert Baier, the District Chairperson of the Southern Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the club's youth division.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mayor Klumpp recalled that weather-related influences in the Spring and Autumn had repeatedly afflicted the original sports field, to such an extent that it could not be played on.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered, when the construction of a third pitch on the football club site or at the secondary school on Salinensee Lake were considered.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both ideas were rejected.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six years ago, thoughts turned to laying an astro-turf pitch, which was generally viewed as the perfect solution.</seg>
<seg id="16">Specific plans were drawn up two years ago, when the FC inherited the Schabelstube in leasehold, promised a contribution of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the pitch and the state approved a subsidy of EUR 104,000.</seg>
<seg id="17">In October 2012, the Town Council decided to cover the remaining EUR 356,000 of the total cost of EUR 560,000, summarised Klumpp.</seg>
<seg id="18">Work began on the 68 x 108 metre astro-turf pitch on 4 June.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the construction phase, which lasted over three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, of which half was used for the laying of a dirt bike track.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zygier's cell was 'intended to kill its resident'</seg>
<seg id="2">Prisoner X: Ben Zygier.</seg>
<seg id="3">An Israeli man jailed over the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has provided a rare glimpse into the cell where Melbourne man Ben Zygier, known as Prisoner X, ended his life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hagay Amir was convicted and served more than 16 years in jail for being an accomplice to his fellow right-wing extremist brother Yigal, who remains in prison for life for Rabin's murder.</seg>
<seg id="5">In his first interview since his release, Hagay Amir said that he was permitted to visit his brother in the purpose-built isolation cell in the maximum security Ayalon Prison in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is the same cell where the Australian-born, alleged Mossad agent Ben Zygier was found dead in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hagay visited his brother on 11 occasions, each time for three hours.</seg>
<seg id="8">Israel has drawn a veil of secrecy over everything regarding Ben Zygier so tight that not only was there a gag order on the existence of "prisoner X," but there was also a gag order that barred journalists from even mentioning the gag order.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the time even his jailers didn't know who he was or what he had done.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was not until Zygier's suicide was exposed by the ABC's Foreign Correspondent program, that his existence came to light.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Yes, they murdered him, it's clear, or drove him to suicide," Amir claims, of Zygier.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hagay takes out a pen and carefully draws a bird's eye view plan of the cell where Zygier was kept: a five by three metres cell with a shower and a toilet hidden by a low partition and an adjoining courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are closed circuit cameras in the ceiling corners and a complex series of doors and corridors.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is a cell that was intended to kill its resident," Amir says.</seg>
<seg id="15">They wanted him to die and he died.</seg>
<seg id="16">They say that he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's all rubbish, all lies.</seg>
<seg id="18">To get to you in an emergency would take over 15 minutes just to unlock the gates.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There are, let's see," he consults his sketch, "one, two, three, four locked gates until you get to your cell."</seg>
<seg id="20">By that time you can be mummified.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you're not infused with faith or an ideal to sustain you, a place like that would be very difficult to live in," he said."</seg>
<seg id="22">""Most people would not stand such isolation."</seg>
<seg id="23">It is cruelty beyond the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="24">A spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service refused to comment on Amir's allegations, on account of their general nature and the fact that they refer to incidents that "supposedly happened in the distant past."</seg>

<seg id="1">Belgium considering world's first child euthanasia law</seg>
<seg id="2">Should children have the right to ask for their own deaths?</seg>
<seg id="3">In Belgium, where euthanasia is now legal for people over the age of 18, the government is considering extending it to children -- something that no other country has done.</seg>
<seg id="4">The same bill would offer the right to die to adults with early dementia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Advocates argue that euthanasia for children, with the consent of their parents, is necessary to give families an option in a desperately painful situation.</seg>
<seg id="6">But opponents have questioned whether children can reasonably decide to end their own lives.</seg>
<seg id="7">Belgium is already a euthanasia pioneer; it legalized the practice for adults in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last decade, the number of reported cases per year has risen from 235 deaths in 2003 to 1,432 in 2012, the last year for which statistics are available.</seg>
<seg id="9">Doctors typically give patients a powerful sedative before injecting another drug to stop their heart.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only a few countries have legalized euthanasia or anything approaching it.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the Netherlands, euthanasia is legal under specific circumstances and for children over the age of 12 with parental consent (there is an understanding that infants, too, can be euthanized, and that doctors will not be prosecuted if they act appropriately).</seg>
<seg id="12">Elsewhere in Europe, euthanasia is only legal in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="13">Assisted suicide, where doctors help a patient to die but do not actively kill them, is allowed in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the state of Oregon also grants assisted suicide requests for residents aged 18 or over with a terminal illness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Belgium, the ruling Socialist party has proposed the bill expanding the right of euthanasia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Christian Democratic Flemish party vowed to oppose the legislation and to challenge it in the European Court of Human Rights if it passes.</seg>
<seg id="17">A final decision must be approved by Parliament and could take months.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the meantime, the Senate has heard testimony on both sides of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is strange that minors are considered legally incompetent in key areas, such as getting married, but might (be able) to decide to die," Catholic Archbishop Andre-Joseph Leonard testified.</seg>
<seg id="20">Leonard said alternatives like palliative sedation make euthanasia unnecessary -- and relieves doctors of the burden of having to kill patients.</seg>
<seg id="21">In palliative sedation, patients are sedated and life-sustaining support is withdrawn so they starve to death; the process can take days.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the debate has extended to medical ethicists and professionals far from Belgium.</seg>
<seg id="23">Charles Foster, who teaches medical law and ethics at Oxford University, believes children couldn't possibly have the capacity to make an informed decision about euthanasia since even adults struggle with the concept.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It often happens that when people get into the circumstances they had so feared earlier, they manage to cling on all the more," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Children, like everyone else, may not be able to anticipate how much they will value their lives if they were not killed.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are others, though, who argue that because Belgium has already approved euthanasia for adults, it is unjust to deny it to children.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The principle of euthanasia for children sounds shocking at first, but it's motivated by compassion and protection," said John Harris, a professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's unfair to provide euthanasia differentially to some citizens and not to others (children) if the need is equal.</seg>
<seg id="29">And Dr. Gerlant van Berlaer, a pediatric oncologist at the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussels hospital, says the changes would legalize what is already happening informally.</seg>
<seg id="30">He said cases of euthanasia in children are rare and estimates about 10 to 100 cases in Belgium every year might qualify.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Children have different ways of asking for things but they face the same questions as adults when they're terminally sick," van Berlaer said.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Sometimes it's a sister who tells us her brother doesn't want to go back to the hospital and is asking for a solution," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Today if these families find themselves (in that situation), we're not able to help them, except in dark and questionable ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The change in the law regarding people with dementia is also controversial.</seg>
<seg id="35">People now can make a written declaration they wish to be euthanized if their health deteriorates, but the request is only valid for five years and they must be in an irreversible coma.</seg>
<seg id="36">The new proposal would abolish the time limit and the requirement the patient be in a coma, making it possible for someone who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's to be put to death years later in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1">In what will surely make for years of awkward dinner table conversation, the government of a suburban area of Fuzhou, the capital of coastal Fujian province, tried to force local schoolteacher Lin Xin to assist authorities in demolishing her parents' home, according to an Oct.</seg>
<seg id="2">28 report in the popular local paper Beijing News.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lin refused, but the consequences were disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="4">Authorities cancelled her classes for 50 days, Lin (briefly) lost her job, and her marriage ended in divorce.</seg>
<seg id="5">The news first went national on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Oct.</seg>
<seg id="7">27, Weibo user and social commentator named Ding Laifeng posted a notice dated Aug.</seg>
<seg id="8">13 that Lin claimed she had received from the local government.</seg>
<seg id="9">It required that Lin and her husband, also a teacher, report to a nearby town to "assist in the demolition."</seg>
<seg id="10">It's unclear exactly why authorities were so eager to have Lin's parents out of their home.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to China News Service, a Chinese state-owned news agency, the home was 4,000 square feet and illegally built, but no information about the development plans, revenues, or compensation for the residents was available.</seg>
<seg id="12">A person who answered the phone at the local government office hung up after being told a reporter was on the line.</seg>
<seg id="13">Perhaps unbelievably, the coercive tactic does not appear unique.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some Weibo users reported in online debates about this story that authorities had approached them or their families in similar ways.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mainstream Chinese media also reported that a teacher in the inland city of Changsha received a notice on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="16">25 from local authorities telling her to convince her grandmother to move.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like Lin's notice, this one described the order as a professional "transfer" to a division of the government in charge of evictions and demolition, making compliance a job requirement.</seg>
<seg id="18">Local governments, which oversee both local education bureaus and divisions in charge of evictions and demolition, have the authority to approve such transfers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The story resonated on Weibo because the forced demolition of homes to make way for private developments is a sensitive issue in China.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to official figures, local governments in China depend on land sales for the majority of their income; income from such sales totaled $438 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="21">Local authorities often profit from private development by appropriating residents' land and selling it to real estate developers.</seg>
<seg id="22">The authorities then assist developers in evicting uncooperative residents from old buildings.</seg>
<seg id="23">Residents who hold out against developers are known as "nail households" for their tenacity.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lin tried to fight the good fight.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Beijing News says that she refused to help with the demolition, claiming she lacked authority to tell her parents what to do with their home.</seg>
<seg id="26">But pressure mounted as she continued to resist.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Sept.</seg>
<seg id="28">9, the principal at Lin's school told her that she should no longer come to work.</seg>
<seg id="29">By Sept.</seg>
<seg id="30">18, Lin's marriage was over: In order to ensure that Lin's husband, a schoolteacher named Zhang Xingfa, would not also lose his job, the two divorced.</seg>
<seg id="31">In an interview with the Beijing News, Lin said that she and her husband were doing their best not to let the situation affect their two-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="32">The news that a forced demolition had split up a married couple with a young child went viral on Weibo, as users shared Ding's Oct.</seg>
<seg id="33">27 post over 5,000 times.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many remarked that the government's tactic resembled a throwback to a darker period in China's history.</seg>
<seg id="35">One user wrote that "it is a little reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution," the period from 1966 to 1976 when Chinese authorities encouraged people to report their family members for ideological crimes.</seg>
<seg id="36">Others called the move "inhumane."</seg>
<seg id="37">While some raged, others expressed resignation.</seg>
<seg id="38">This happens all over China.</seg>
<seg id="39">"It's very common," wrote one Weibo user.</seg>
<seg id="40">At least it's not hordes of scorpions, which one Chinese developer allegedly used to scare uncooperative tenants out of their homes in Jul.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's also not a kidnapping: On Sept.</seg>
<seg id="42">24 in Shanghai, a group of men abducted an elderly couple and held them in a courtyard while developers demolished their home, with all of their belongings still inside.</seg>
<seg id="43">"This is the smallest of losses," another Weibo user wrote of Lin's experience.</seg>
<seg id="44">The alternative is that people might be hurt or killed.</seg>
<seg id="45">The China Youth Daily, a major Communist Party paper, reported that after her story went viral online, Lin's school informed her that she could return to work on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="46">That's good news -- but the paper also noted that on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="47">15, Lin's parents' home was torn down.</seg>

<seg id="2">An ethnic Uighur man sits outside his house near a busy market in Turpan, Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="3">Beijing: At a restaurant with an arbor of green plastic grape leaves out front and a grill inside for skewers of roast lamb, police have been popping in regularly the last two days to check residency documents of ethnic Uighurs.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the same neighbourhood, a Uighur family who had moved into their apartment a few days ago were told to leave immediately, although they paid their rent a month in advance.</seg>
<seg id="5">The midday attack this week at Tiananmen Square has made the Uighurs the least favoured ethnic minority in Beijing for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday, a family of three Uighurs drove their sports utility vehicle onto a crowded sidewalk, killing two tourists and injuring 40, before setting the car on fire and killing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities have called it a "terrorist act" and described the perpetrators as Islamic militants.</seg>
<seg id="8">Customers are looking at us suspiciously.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Police are looking at us suspiciously," a 38-year-old Uighur restaurant manager in Beijing said on Thursday as he served lunch.</seg>
<seg id="10">The man, who gave only his first name, Ali, said police had been coming in regularly to check the identity cards of his staff, as well as any customers who appeared to be Uighurs.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said the situation was worse back in Xinjiang, the northwestern region of China that is home to most Uighurs.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I called friends today in Urumqi (the Xinjiang capital), and they said police are coming by at 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock at night checking ID cards," Ali said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ilham Tohti, a prominent Uighur economist who works with human rights advocates, said he was getting calls from Uighurs who feared losing jobs and apartments in Beijing because of Monday's attack.</seg>
<seg id="14">They included the family who were evicted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Tohti disputed China's characterisation of the attackers as Islamic militants.</seg>
<seg id="16">He noted that there had been many similar outbursts by members of the ethnic Han majority, such as a man who tried to blow himself up in the Beijing airport over the summer and a string of knife attacks against schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Many Han Chinese resort to extreme action and harm innocent people as well to express their frustration to society," Mr Tohti said.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the evidence that has been released about this family in the car, they were more like self-immolators who felt they had been wronged and wanted to release their anger.</seg>
<seg id="19">The driver has been identified as Usmen Hasan, who was accompanied by his 70-year-old mother and 30-year-old wife.</seg>
<seg id="20">They had with them knives, steel rods and canisters of gasoline, which they ignited after driving up to the enormous portrait of Mao Zedong that hangs over Tiananmen Square.</seg>
<seg id="21">State news media said they were identified as Islamic militants by a flag in the car.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ming Pao, a Hong Kong-based newspaper that obtained photographs and identity cards of the three, reported that they were from Akto county, south of China's westernmost city, Kashgar.</seg>
<seg id="23">The newspaper said there had been many arrests in the city for underground religious study.</seg>
<seg id="24">State media on Wednesday condemned the attack at Tiananmen Square and demanded stiff punishment for alleged accomplices of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="25">Five suspected accomplices were arrested early this week.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Violent terrorist crime is the shared enemy of all humanity, the shared enemy of all ethnic groups in the country, and it must be severely punished under the law," said a commentary in the Communist Party's People's Daily.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 9 million Uighurs live in northwestern China, coexisting uneasily at times with Han Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="28">They frequently complain about institutionalised job discrimination and restrictions imposed by the Communist Party on practice of religion.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 3000 Uighurs live permanently in Beijing, many of them running restaurants, dealing in jade or doing trade, a holdover of their reputation as merchants on the Silk Road.</seg>
<seg id="30">Looking more European than Asian and speaking a Turkic language, the Uighurs tend to congregate around Ritan Park, an area also frequented by businesspeople from the former Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is also a large floating population of Uighurs who peddle snacks or come to file petitions with the government, a distinctly Chinese tradition for addressing grievances.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Beijing, Uighurs are often banned from renting hotel rooms.</seg>
<seg id="33">And Mr Tohti said bus stations in Xinjiang have been forbidden in recent months from selling Uighurs bus tickets to Beijing if they are petitioners.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It is always difficult for Uighurs in Beijing, but if there is something unusual that happens, then the police step up their vigilance," said Ali, the restaurant manager.</seg>

<seg id="1">The government in Jerusalem fails to confirm an attack on the Syrian airforce base</seg>
<seg id="2">On Thursday, an American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, made a statement to American news broadcaster CNN, stating that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an airforce base in the Syrian town of Latakia the day before.</seg>
<seg id="3">The target was "missiles and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arabic broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was fired upon during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis were identified as the responsible party.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli television broadcaster Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, in which Russian S-125 Newa-type defence missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles could be seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads weighing up to 70 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unsure, the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, press agency Reuters has also quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack, but was not sure.</seg>
<seg id="8">In any case, a spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said: "We are not commenting on these reports".</seg>
<seg id="9">Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, writing for daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, emphasised that the Syrian regime had already previously attempted, in some cases successfully, to deliver ground to air missiles to Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Israeli government had previously repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be crossing a "red line", which would result in a military response.</seg>

<seg id="1">After six match days, TSV Morsum are yet to score a single point in the Handball Association League.</seg>
<seg id="2">And of all possible times, Ingo Ehler's team has a derby match against TSV Daverden tomorrow, which celebrated their first victory last week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The season begins afresh for us with this match.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I hope that we finally have our heads clear," commented Ehlers, remaining cautiously optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="5">For this match he finally has his complete squad available, with the exception of Hendrick Blohme who is out with long-term injury.</seg>
<seg id="6">Like us, Daverden place emphasis on high tempo play.</seg>
<seg id="7">For this reason, we must keep our errors to a minimum.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the top priority is to improve our cover play, which has recently left much to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz comes across as much more relaxed following his team's first victory of the season against Nordhorn.</seg>
<seg id="10">The match was of course a indication of what we are capable of.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it by no means makes us favourites, as anything can happen in the derby.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nonetheless, Panitz is now looking to come up with the goods in Morsum and thus start a winning streak.</seg>
<seg id="13">Jan-Malte Jodat will not be playing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mother buried in shallow forest grave and pension stolen</seg>
<seg id="2">When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg devised a plan.</seg>
<seg id="3">He buried the deceased in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to police investigations, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg resident buried his dead mother in the woods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allowance.</seg>
<seg id="5">He first covered up the death of the 89-year-old and then pocketed the money for more than a year and a half.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 67-year-old must now face charges of fraud, said a spokesperson on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the statement, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.</seg>
<seg id="8">The man was already under suspicion back in May: At that time the fact that medications for his care-reliant mother were no longer required drew suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="9">The pensioner told investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.</seg>
<seg id="10">The officials found this strange and so continued to investigate.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had cared for her in her final days.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 67-year-old finally acknowledged the death of his mother.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to police, an autopsy showed no evidence of any capital offence.</seg>

<seg id="6">This is the terrifying moment that a scrap yard worker was turned into a human fireball as he drained fuel from underneath a van.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lee Roberts, 33, from Wigan, was working in a pit underneath the van when an electric spark from a drill caused the fuel to burst into flames and set fire to his overalls.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dramatic CCTV footage captured Mr Roberts running for his life and desperately trying to put out the inferno as it engulfed his legs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lee Roberts was turned into a human fireball when fuel ignited as he worked in a salvage yard pit</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Roberts, pictured in hospital after the accident, received 22 per cent burns to his hands, legs and nose</seg>
<seg id="11">He suffered 22 per cent burns to his hands, legs and nose and was put in a medically induced coma after the accident in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Roberts has not been able to work since and lost his job at Douglas Valley Breakers in Coppull, Lancashire.</seg>
<seg id="13">This week his former bosses Jason Miller and Stephen Strange were told to pay £40,000 for health and safety failings and £25,000 in costs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Roberts said: 'I still remember the noise of the petrol fumes igniting and a wave of blue flames engulfing the pit.</seg>
<seg id="15">The pain was instant and intense.</seg>
<seg id="16">They put me into an induced coma to stop the pain, and it was at least a couple of days later when I came around.</seg>
<seg id="17">When I woke up I could feel the pain immediately.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even now, more than three years later I still suffer flashbacks that cause me to wake in the middle of the night in a cold sweat.</seg>

<seg id="20">The CCTV footage shows Mr Roberts draining fuel from the van before he was engulfed in flames</seg>
<seg id="21">The pit below the van suddenly explodes with Mr Roberts suffering injuries that have left him unable to work</seg>
<seg id="22">As the flames started to spread Mr Roberts ran for his life.</seg>
<seg id="23">His bosses have been fined £40,000</seg>
<seg id="24">The blaze burns on as Mr Roberts (off screen) tries to put out the fire which has taken hold of his clothing</seg>
<seg id="25">Preston Crown Court heard that it was common practice for the company to remove engine and gear box oil from vehicles so they could be used for scrap.</seg>
<seg id="26">To do this employees would puncture a hole in the fuel tank and allow the flammable liquid to drain into an open container.</seg>
<seg id="27">The court heard that the fire grew rapidly because there was petrol in the pit.</seg>
<seg id="28">Car body parts and upholstery also added to the fire which spread to the whole workshop area.</seg>
<seg id="29">The company's bosses were brought to court in a prosecution by the Health and Safety Executive, which inspected the site following the accident.</seg>
<seg id="30">They pleaded guilty to two breaches of the Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002, one breach of the Work at Height Regulations 2005 and two breaches of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.</seg>
<seg id="31">Speaking after the hearing HSE Inspector David Myrtle said: 'Lee suffered severe burns as a result of this incident but he was very lucky not to have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Douglas Valley Breakers was guilty of several serious safety breaches.</seg>
<seg id="33">It failed to properly consider the risks its employees faced while removing fuel from vehicles, or to do anything about them.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was therefore almost inevitable that a worker would be badly burned in a fire.</seg>
<seg id="35">The company had the right equipment to do the job properly but instead it allowed workers to stand in a pit surrounded by fuel vapours where just one spark from electric equipment could start a fire.</seg>
<seg id="36">If the fuel had been removed in a well-ventilated area, or even outside, without any ignition sources nearby then the severe burns Lee suffered could have been avoided.</seg>
<seg id="37">'Sadly, our investigation found the company's overall attitude to health and safety was poor to say the least.'</seg>

<seg id="2">AUSTRALIA'S aviation safety watchdog is considering whether young children should use car-like seat capsules when travelling on aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has released for public comment a draft document suggesting parents do more than carry infants on their laps using a supplementary seatbelt.</seg>
<seg id="4">"A child up to age four would be more effectively protected if seated in a child restraint system," the draft, released on Friday, says.</seg>
<seg id="5">An adult and child using the common supplementary seatbelt method face increased risk of injury during an aircraft accident, CASA found.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The supplemental loop belt is even less effective for the infant as their skeletal structure is unable to cope with any significant load ... and the crushing forces applied by the adult torso," it said.</seg>
<seg id="7">While the seatbelt method was found to provide "adequate restraint" for an infant during turbulence or a minor incident, an individual restraint in a separate passenger seat offered more protection.</seg>
<seg id="8">CASA said both forward and rear-facing child seats, along with booster seats commonly used in vehicles, could be suitable for use in aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The draft document also found infants were safer if they didn't travel in aisle seats.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They could easily be injured by a passing person or galley cart," the draft document said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A standard seat is recommended for a child once they reach age four, 18kgs and 100cm.</seg>
<seg id="12">The draft document can be found at www.casa.gov.au and submissions close on November 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">West Coast Eagles overrun in second half by inspired Power</seg>
<seg id="2">Port Adelaide unleashed a stunning late charge to overwhelm West Coast by five points in the AFL.</seg>
<seg id="3">WEST Coast coach John Worsfold has refused to rule out a flag tilt should the Eagles finish the season outside the top four.</seg>
<seg id="4">Another woeful outing in front of goal last night cost West Coast a win, as it let a 41-point, third-quarter lead slip to Port Adelaide and take its season to just one win and four losses.</seg>
<seg id="5">A top-four finish has been the Eagles mantra since their semi-final exit last year off the back of a fifth placing at the end of the home and away season and history rules against teams winning the premiership after finishing outside the four.</seg>
<seg id="6">No team has achieved the feat under the current system, but Worsfold last night refused to accept that as a fait accompli.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We've still got a lot of footy ahead, that doesn't change," Worsfold said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The premiership teams have come from the top four the majority of times and, if we don't make it, then this is going to be one of the rare years where maybe it doesn't.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our aim is to play better footy and we can do that, keep pushing up and anything is possible; we'll see where it takes us.</seg>
<seg id="10">But our focus is on playing better footy, not; how far we've got to go in the season, how many wins it's going to take to finish in certain spots.</seg>
<seg id="11">West Coast Eagles player slook dejected after the game.</seg>
<seg id="12">Picture: Sarah Reed</seg>
<seg id="13">West Coast faces more personnel issues this week, after losing reliable workhorse Matt Priddis, but Worsfold said the injury concerns ended there.</seg>
<seg id="14">Darren Glass, who was reported for rough conduct, could consider himself unlucky in receiving a suspension as he did not leave the ground and did not appear to make head-high contact.</seg>
<seg id="15">Worsfold said he was unsure whether Priddis would be available to face the Western Bulldogs on Sunday, but that reinforcements could be welcomed back after Sharrod Wellingham and Matt Rosa made it through a second week in the WAFL.</seg>
<seg id="16">" (I spoke to Priddis) briefly and he's feeling good, so that's good," Worsfold said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Wellingham and Rosa got through again, so they're up and going.</seg>
<seg id="18">They're available now, we're really pleased with how they went, so they're available for selection.</seg>
<seg id="19">To fast track them would have been to play them tonight, but we felt they needed the hitout to be now available for senior selection.</seg>
<seg id="20">But our focus at the moment is going to be to improve the football we're playing with the personnel we're playing and we can still do that, regardless of waiting for players to come back.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ashton Hams is collected high by Tom Jonas.</seg>
<seg id="22">Last night was the second consecutive week that kicking errors hounded West Coast, after the side last week posted 7.23 to lose to Carlton at home.</seg>
<seg id="23">A frank Worsfold said it was an area that offered little excuse and the side had to work through its mental demons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Our boys have been bad for a couple of weeks, but they haven't been bad for the weeks prior to that, or last year," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">So there's something going on; (maybe) they're feeling the pressure, they're coughing it up, I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="26">They've got to kick the goals, that's their job, we expect them to kick them, not all the time, but certainly kick some of the ones they've missed the last couple of weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Forget London... visit Birmingham: New York magazine tells readers that England's second city outdoes the capital</seg>
<seg id="2">The citizens of Birmingham are keenly aware of the snobbery and accent-mocking humour about their beloved home, emanating mostly from London's chattering classes.</seg>
<seg id="3">But, for the second time in two years, England's second city has received glowing praise from an international destination that outdoes London in many respects: New York.</seg>
<seg id="4">New York Magazine has advised its readers to go to "Birmingham instead of London" in an article this week that trumpeted the city's attractions from the culinary delights of the Balti Triangle to "the world renowned" Birmingham Royal Ballet, its thriving jewellery trade and music scene.</seg>
<seg id="5">A lack of tourist hordes was another reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">That came after The New York Times last year declared it was "no longer simply flyover country" but a "big-shouldered, friendly and fun" place that its readers should definitely visit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the last five years, visitor numbers have seen double-digit percentage growth to some 34 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Singer-songwriter Jamelia is a feisty defender of the city where she was born and bred.</seg>
<seg id="9">But even she confessed when she first began traveling to work in London at 15 she was "embarrassed to say I was from Birmingham."</seg>
<seg id="10">"It wasn't a place I was so proud of," she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, it's a different story.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a fantastic city.</seg>
<seg id="13">I'm such a proud Brummie.</seg>
<seg id="14">There's no place better on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="15">She said she was such a regular in its designer fashion stores and gourmet restaurants in the extensively redeveloped city centre that she feared they might be "sick of me."</seg>
<seg id="16">She admitted she had once lived in London for about a year, but when her two children, now aged 12 and 8, started talking like southerners it was too much.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We do have a distinctive accent, but at the same time I love the accent - that's one of the reasons I moved away from London," she said.</seg>
<seg id="18">My children were speaking in this RP accent.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I thought "Actually no, we're from Birmingham, we're very proud of it and want people to know."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Let's get back to Brum.""</seg>
<seg id="21">Ian Taylor, a director of Marketing Birmingham, the body charged with selling the city to the world, said the city had "changed beyond all recognition" over the last two decades, but was aware there was a lingering perception problem in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There are people who probably haven't been here for a long while... who come and say "wow" this place is fantastic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Taylor, a Newcastle native who chose to move to Birmingham eight years ago, said the city had always attracted large numbers of people for business conferences, mainly from the UK.</seg>
<seg id="24">But there had been a recent surge in tourists, particularly from the US, China and India.</seg>
<seg id="25">"There's much greater recognition of what Birmingham has to offer internationally," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Second city stats: The best of Brum</seg>
<seg id="27">History</seg>
<seg id="28">Birmingham dates back to Anglo-Saxon times with the name derived from the "ham" or home of the followers of Beorma, thought to have been a Saxon warrior or noble.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Domesday Book lists just nine houses in 1086.</seg>
<seg id="30">Peter de Bermingham was granted a charter to set up a market in 1166.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009, a vast haul of 7th century Anglo-Saxon gold and silver valued at £3.28m was found in the area: the Staffordshire Hoard is on display at Birmingham Museum.</seg>
<seg id="32">Population</seg>
<seg id="33">Birmingham is bucking the UK trend and has one of the most youthful populations in Europe with nearly 40 per cent of inhabitants aged under 25.</seg>
<seg id="34">This "New Beat Generation" is helping to create something of a cultural renaissance in art, literature, dance and music.</seg>
<seg id="35">Music</seg>
<seg id="36">Soul singer-songwriters Laura Mvula, shortlisted for this year's Mercury Prize, and Jacob Banks are the leading lights of the new music scene, but Black Sabbath, Duran Duran, ELO, UB40, Ocean Colour Scene and Jamelia all hail from Birmingham.</seg>
<seg id="37">The 19th-century Czech composer Antonin Dvorak once wrote of the city: "It's terrifying how much the people here manage to achieve."</seg>
<seg id="38">Film</seg>
<seg id="39">The Electric Cinema near Birmingham New Street station is the oldest working cinema in the UK, having been established in 1909, when it showed silent films with piano accompaniment.</seg>
<seg id="40">University</seg>
<seg id="41">The University of Birmingham, or Mason Science College as it was previously known, has proved to be something of a hothouse of prime ministerial talent.</seg>
<seg id="42">Stanley Baldwin, who occupied 10 Downing Street three times in the 1920s and 1930s, was a graduate as was his successor and fellow Conservative Neville Chamberlain.</seg>
<seg id="43">The current prime ministers of Saint Lucia, Kenny Anthony, and the Bahamas, Perry Christie, also studied there.</seg>
<seg id="44">Library</seg>
<seg id="45">The futuristic new Library of Birmingham is Europe's largest public library.</seg>
<seg id="46">The £189m building, designed by architect Francine Houben, has ten floors and will house the city's archives.</seg>
<seg id="47">Engineering</seg>
<seg id="48">James Watt and the leading lights of the renowned Lunar Society radically changed the world in the 18th century.</seg>
<seg id="49">Lunar Society member and clergyman Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen, while other innovations made in the city include the spinning jenny and the pneumatic tire.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is also the home of Cadbury's chocolate and the Mini.</seg>
<seg id="51">Parks</seg>
<seg id="52">It may have been built on the back of heavy industry but it is also one of the greenest cities in the country with 6 million trees and more parks than any other European city.</seg>
<seg id="53">Transport</seg>
<seg id="54">With 32 miles of canals, Birmingham has more than Venice and attracts millions of people a year - more, it was once claimed, than the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.</seg>
<seg id="55">And for motoring enthusiasts, there's the spectacle of Spaghetti Junction, one of the biggest motorway interchanges in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="8">Groundbreaking: Consultation opened today for Londoners to give their say on 370-ft aerial oasis actress Joanna Lumley thought up in 1997</seg>
<seg id="9">To mark the occasion, a new image of the 370-ft landmark has been released for Londoners to have a look at.</seg>
<seg id="10">The consultation will ask for verdicts on every little detail including the colour, the shape, the location, and whether dogs can be allowed on.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would be the first new crossing over the Thames since the 'wobbly' Millennium Bridge opened in 2002 and London's answer to New York's High Line, where a disused train line has been transformed into a lush aerial park.</seg>
<seg id="12">It would also give stunning views along the river of St Paul's Cathedral and the City of London to the east.</seg>
<seg id="13">With lauded architect Thomas Heatherwick CBE at the helm, famed for his Olympic cauldron for London 2012, everyone from George Osborne to New York mayor Michael Bloomberg have weighed in to show their support.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Boris Johnson, it could be the iconic piece of green infrastructure that he has been looking for to give London a high-quality image.</seg>
<seg id="15">Designer and Horticulturalist Dan Pearson, appointed to oversee the gardening side of things, has also attracted interest from politicians and donors.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the Garden Bridge Trust, the crossing will have trees, plants and even 'intimate walkways', as well as a direct link between the Southbank and Soho</seg>
<seg id="17">Delighted: Artist Thomas Heatherwick (left), awarded a CBE after the Olympics, has given weight to the proposal suggested 15 years ago by Joanna Lumley (right)</seg>
<seg id="18">The project, which is being developed with engineering firm Arup, will go ahead only if Heatherwick can raise money from private backers and will not receive public funds.</seg>
<seg id="19">A trust, set up to oversee the construction, is currently in the process of seeking charitable status, but private donors are said to have offered to foot almost half the bill already.</seg>
<seg id="20">Desperate to make sure the structure does become a reality, Heatherwick has drawn up a specific time scale - seeing construction start in 2015 and end, at the latest, in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="21">Plan: Desperate to make sure the structure becomes a reality, architect Thomas Hetherwick has a detailed time-scale that ends in 2017 at the latest</seg>
<seg id="22">He told the Evening Standard: 'If people want the bridge to happen, then it has to happen now.</seg>
<seg id="23">'Otherwise, it will just be one of those nice things that didn't happen.'</seg>
<seg id="24">He adds that the flower meadow Danny Boyle created for the opening ceremony last year has further inspired the project.</seg>
<seg id="25">He told the Standard: 'What I thought was that of course the venues were impressive, and the Games amazing, but what I won't forget is the wild planting.</seg>
<seg id="26">We are used to quite a harsh experience in the architectural landscape around us.</seg>
<seg id="27">Often environments don't have a human scale, but plants give you that.</seg>
<seg id="28">There is something unpretentious about them - this project will have slugs and worms and autumn smells, rather than grand, Versailles-like power-planting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Darren Glass and Nat Fyfe to appeal suspensions at tribunal</seg>
<seg id="2">All the latest news from the AFL's Match Review Panel.</seg>
<seg id="3">West Coast will contest the two-match ban handed to skipper Darren Glass for rough conduct.</seg>
<seg id="4">DARREN Glass and Nat Fyfe will front the AFL tribunal tonight to contest their respective bans from the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="5">Glass was hit with the suspension following his report for rough conduct towards Port Adelaide's Paul Stewart on Saturday night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 31-year-old's poor recent record with the match review panel meant his initial sanction was increased from two matches to three, but Glass can accept two with an early plea.</seg>
<seg id="7">Glass will face three weeks on the sidelines if his appeal is unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="8">Have your say below.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eagles coach John Worsfold last night conceded there was risk in challenging the ban.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's certainly not a cut and dry one, I don't think.</seg>
<seg id="11">There's a lot of doubt there around what the charge was over," Worsfold told 6PR's Sports Today.</seg>
<seg id="12">There's always that risk if you challenge it now...you may end up with three weeks or it could go your way and you end up with none or one.</seg>
<seg id="13">Fyfe was offered a one-match ban but is facing a two-match suspension if he is unsuccessful at the tribunal tonight.</seg>
<seg id="14">The star Fremantle midfielder was cited for kicking Richmond's Daniel Jackson while the pair was tangled during last Friday night's nailbiter at Patersons Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fyfe will also be ineligible for the Brownlow Medal if he cannot overturn the suspension.</seg>
<seg id="16">If Glass fails to overturn the ban, Will Schofield is poised to earn a recall for Sunday's clash against the Western Bulldogs at Patersons Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schofield was dropped from the team which lost to Port Adelaide, but Worsfold denied the running defender has been omitted because of poor form.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We're pretty pleased with how Will's going, but we thought Mitch Brown would be a better match-up for (Justin) Westhoff," Worsfold said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was a selection issue, not so much us being unhappy with Will.</seg>
<seg id="20">He probably had his best game for the year last week (against Carlton), but still missed out.</seg>
<seg id="21">He's certainly not out of our thinking or consideration.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Eagles have a host of players listed as "test" on their weekly injury list, including key recruit Sharrod Wellingham and ruckman Nic Naitanui.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wellingham (ankle) and wingman Matt Rosa (thigh) are almost certain to play against the Bulldogs, but Naitanui (groin) is unlikely to be rushed back.</seg>
<seg id="24">Naitanui's WAFL team Swan Districts have the bye this week and Worsfold does not envisage him playing in the WAFL reserves.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I think Nic's the sort of player that it's not going to take him too long to impact games of footy," Worsfold said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I don't think he's the sort of player that would be worried about getting 'touch' in the WAFL first.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the conditioning staff update us on where he's at and they believe he's ready to play some footy without getting injured, I expect we'll be looking at him to come straight back into the side.</seg>
<seg id="28">But if they say he can only play 50 or 60 minutes, we then have to weigh up whether we can go along with a player playing only that many minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hoarding on the Bechtle plot painted</seg>
<seg id="2">A group belonging to the "Schweizer Wiese" citizen's initiative has given the hoarding on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb a face-lift.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, they have cleaned and widened the footpath, a press release announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">The planned covering of the dilapidated house to the rear of the plot was not permitted for safety reasons, as the premises were at risk of collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Alfred Abel, who currently manages the site, arranged the 'face-lift' in cooperation with his colleague, Reinhard Domke, from the citizen's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the citizen's initiative project, a banner with the message "We are in favour" was put up.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, this did little to distract the 20 or so members of the citizen's initiative from their project.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their motto, on the large billboard stated "We are against unfinished buildings".</seg>
<seg id="9">In so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wiese - should the huge project one day fail.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chatting with many people passing by the "construction site", it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town, although many have the same questions as the citizen's initiative regarding the scale of the planned project.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, they are beginning to resign themselves as the town continues to stall in providing answers, said a statement from the citizen's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have now been told that the public statements made by the Mayor are also having an impact.</seg>
<seg id="13">In May, in the meeting of the Town Council, he said that he feared for the outcome of the spa should the population vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wiese in the local referendum.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some appear utterly frightened by it, others perceive it as a "blatant attempt to blackmail" the population, continued the press release from the citizen's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="15">The citizen's initiative thanked those who donated paint and all those who lent a hand.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greek government hit by fresh resignation</seg>
<seg id="2">A SECOND Greek Cabinet member has resigned in two days, the latest casualty for the financially struggling country's new conservative-led government.</seg>
<seg id="3">Giorgos Vernicos, deputy minister for Greece's merchant marine ministry, announced his resignation overnight and it was accepted by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">He did not immediately give a reason for his departure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the main opposition Syriza party had accused him of maintaining an offshore company in what appeared to be a conflict of interest for a member of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yesterday, the designated finance minister resigned due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="7">And new Prime Minister Antonis Samaras himself is recovering from a weekend eye operation and will be unable to attend a European Union leaders' summit later this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">Greece is surviving on rescue loans from other EU countries and the International Monetary Fund.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new government wants to ease harsh austerity imposed by the emergency lenders as the country struggles through a fifth year of recession.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also overnight, prominent economist Yannis Stournaras was named as the new finance minister.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Stournaras, 55, was involved in the country's negotiations to join the euro.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is currently the head of the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research, a think tank and research body that advises the government.</seg>
<seg id="13">A professor of economics at the University of Athens, Mr Stournaras spent several years heading the Finance Ministry's Council of Economic Advisors.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do think we have the ability to get past this problem.</seg>
<seg id="15">"But we must be realistic," Mr Stournaras said about Greece's financial crisis during a book presentation shortly before his appointment was announced.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We have a difficult road ahead of us, an uphill road," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Greece is a country with great potential.</seg>

<seg id="2">Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels manage to reach</seg>
<seg id="3">It was with this piece of Bedouin wisdom that the first ever chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination behind the "Helping Hands" society.</seg>
<seg id="4">Saturday evening saw the celebration of the tenth birthday of the organisation, which can already look back on impressive results.</seg>
<seg id="5">Founding Chairman Henne reported in depth on the work of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2004, he visited the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott in Mauritania for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result, an important collaboration was developed and the gynaecologist, Hanne, has performed countless operations on several journeys to the location.</seg>
<seg id="8">During the speech, images from the trips were shown on a large screen, in order to give the guests at the anniversary event an insight into the initiatives mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="9">The organisation's desert vehicle was also shown.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a former federal border protection vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rainer Prewo, the former Lord Mayor of Nagold, made the suggestion of equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and, according to Henne, he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry company from Baiersbronn built the hospital station in Socogim, a poor district on the edge of the Capital, in the record time of less than one week - free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Henne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in Nouakchott</seg>
<seg id="14">This is particularly interesting at a time when Nagold is set to do away with its maternity clinic.</seg>
<seg id="15">You learn a great deal working as a doctor in Africa, said Henne, for example that you should slow down to avoid burn-out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Due to the political unrest in the country, it has not been possible to make as many journeys as planned, but for this reason, many local doctors have come to Germany, to sit in on lectures on a variety of topics.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, for example in March of this year when medical devices, medicines, bandaging material, hospital beds and spectacles were sent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour, telling of Mercedes vehicles in Mauritania converted into mobile goat stalls and sharing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the organisation on their trips to Mauritania.</seg>
<seg id="19">He identified his personal motivation as being his work in the area of auditing as a young member of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="20">When it became clear to him how much money is wasted, he decided to help the Africans with controlling of their budget by the people.</seg>
<seg id="21">Fuchtel also emphasised that a global economy requires global human kindness.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact that Africa lies closer than many think should by no means be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="23">Africa is not at all that far from Gran Canaria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we attempted to look at it in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="7">To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other</seg>
<seg id="10">Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.</seg>

<seg id="2">The voluntary fire service bravely came through the main autumn test run in spite of a lack of personnel.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only eleven men took part in the exercise.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the training exercise, department commander, Hans Kammerer, chose the Feder premises on Burgberger Strasse.</seg>
<seg id="5">A short-circuit was reported to have occurred there during sawing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the spread of smoke, however, one was able to make an emergency call.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two fire fighters equipped with respiratory gear prepared to enter the building following the initial inspection of the situation by Hans Kammerer.</seg>
<seg id="8">After a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building.</seg>
<seg id="9">The second person had to be carried.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow stairwell.</seg>
<seg id="11">The building, a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses, was not easy to secure.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were large quantities of wood and bales of straw stored inside.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to this, there were also electrical machines for wood processing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people</seg>
<seg id="5">Cast your vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="8">That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not easy," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people can die because they are waiting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.</seg>
<seg id="26">Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="29">And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their luck doesn't always hold out.</seg>
<seg id="33">They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We are receiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="38">They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This will change my future with my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I'm not sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.</seg>
<seg id="54">He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="57">That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.</seg>
<seg id="58">The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="59">But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He's a hero, without a doubt," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="61">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.</seg>
<seg id="62">For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.</seg>
<seg id="63">Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think about my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees what I am doing.</seg>
<seg id="67">To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seizures of the potentially deadly tranquilliser ketamine more than tripled last year as its popularity as a party drug continued to grow, new figures have shown.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police and border officials seized 537lbs (244 kilograms) of the drug in England and Wales in 2012-13, compared with 176lbs (80kg) the year before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ketamine, a veterinary anaesthetic used on horses and other large animals, is a Class C drug carrying lower penalties than harder drugs such as heroin or crack.</seg>
<seg id="5">But experts have warned it is being used as a recreational drug in the club scene despite serious health threats.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dubbed "Special K" by its users, ketamine can lead to irreversible bladder damage and even death.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last year Vicky Unwin, whose daughter Louise, 21, was found dead in her east London flat after taking ketamine, said there must be better education so young people know the risks associated with the drug.</seg>
<seg id="8">Home Office figures on drug seizures also showed three tonnes of cocaine were seized last year, down half a tonne on the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was also a 43 per cent decrease in the amount of cannabis seized year-on-year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe moves nearer Japan-syle deflation trap with shock price falls</seg>
<seg id="2">The euro tumbled a cent to below $1.36 against the dollar as investors began to price in a quarter-point rate cut by the European Central Bank as soon as December.</seg>
<seg id="3">A former ECB governor said the bank's passive stance over the past few months was a "disaster" for Italy and Spain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The time-lag effects mean that serious damage has already been done.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is incredible that they have missed their 2pc target by so much.</seg>
<seg id="6">This risks driving the periphery into protracted depression and could destroy the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="7">Credit conditions are far too tight.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The ECB should cut rates to zero, extend thee-year financing for banks and relax collateral rules," he told The Telegraph.</seg>
<seg id="9">What scares me is that the ECB seems to be formulating policy for Germany without any regard for everybody else.</seg>
<seg id="10">It has been captured by Germany.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What is so bizarre is that the old Bundesbank would not have let this happen," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even German inflation is at a three-year low of 1.4pc.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prices fell 0.4pc in Bavaria and 0.3pc in Saxony in October.</seg>
<seg id="14">While the Bundesbank has been fretting about a local house price boom, the average rise in property has been less than 3pc over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Julian Callow from Barclays said the fall in the eurozone's core inflation rate (without energy and food) to 0.8pc is evidence of powerful forces at work in the world economy.</seg>
<seg id="16">China's fixed capital investment reached $4 trillion last year.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The sheer scale of this is leading to huge over-capacity in manufacturing and is transmitting a deflationary impulse through the global system," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ECB has to be very alive to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="19">Its treaty mandate is to support the 'general economic interests of the Union'.</seg>
<seg id="20">This means giving equal weight to jobs as the US Federal Reserve is doing.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr Callow said the failure to act is allowing the euro to punch too high against the dollar, yuan and yen, exacerbating the deflationary effects and tightening the screw for struggling exporters in Southern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Bank of Japan has succeeded in driving down the yen with a blitz of monetary stimulus.</seg>
<seg id="23">A report by the Bruegel think-tank in Brussels said the slide towards deflation may push Italy and Spain into a "runaway debt trajectory."</seg>
<seg id="24">It lowers nominal GDP growth, causing debt costs to rise faster than the economic base, the "denominator effect."</seg>
<seg id="25">Bruegel said each one percentage point fall in inflation forces Italy to increase its primary budget surplus by an extra 1.3pc of GDP to stabilise debt.</seg>
<seg id="26">Italy is already targeting a sustained surplus of 5pc, a feat that no country except oil-rich Norway has pulled off in half a century.</seg>
<seg id="27">The latest inflation data show Italy's CPI rate fell by 0.3pc in both September and October, despite a rise in VAT taxes that should have pushed it higher.</seg>
<seg id="28">Over the past three months, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia and Latvia have all seen price falls once extra taxes are stripped out.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is a similar pattern in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic, with Poland and Denmark close behind.</seg>
<seg id="30">The entire region risks sliding into a deflation trap if recovery falters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hans Redeker from Morgan Stanley said the "Japanisation effect" in Europe is having perverse effects.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fall in inflation is automatically raising real interest rates, tightening the vice further in a vicious circle.</seg>
<seg id="33">Deflation accidents usually happen when things seem cosy for while and central banks do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Europe is now in a deflationary equilibrium but this could turn bad if there is any outside shock.</seg>
<seg id="35">"We think this could come from Asia, probably a credit squeeze by China's central bank," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Japan was able to cope with deflation in the 1990s because it had a positive global income flows of 3pc of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="37">Europe does not have that advantage.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The flows are negative," he said.</seg>
<seg id="39">Morgan Stanley said the ECB must take immediate and pre-emptive action to head off he risk of full-blown deflation by next year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Japan's travails over the past 20 years show that is very hard to shake off the virus once it becomes lodged in the system.</seg>

<seg id="1">GOP on insurance cancellations: 'We told you so'</seg>
<seg id="2">GOP leaders noted possible insurance cancellations in 2010 as Obama said otherwise</seg>
<seg id="3">Democrats now working to calm constituents whose insurance is being canceled</seg>
<seg id="4">House Democratic leader admits administration should have been "more precise"</seg>
<seg id="5">Washington (CNN) -- The White House isn't in damage-control mode solely over a bad health care website.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the Obama administration is trying to calm concerns across the country from Americans being dropped from their current plans, Republicans on Capitol Hill are saying, "We told you so."</seg>
<seg id="7">In March 2010, then-Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, came to the House floor as Democrats were poised to pass Obamacare and issued a warning.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Look at this bill," Boehner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ask yourself: Do you really believe that if you like the health plan that you have, that you can keep it?</seg>
<seg id="10">No, you can't.</seg>
<seg id="11">Boehner's remarks are just one example of a Republican effort before the health care bill became the law of the land to push back on President Barack Obama's relentless sales pitch, like the one he made to the American Medical Association in June 2009.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period," Obama said.</seg>
<seg id="13">No one will take it away from you, no matter what.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the President made that statement during the heat of the health care legislative battle, Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, dismissed the commander in chief's promise in a weekly Republican address.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If you read the bill, that just isn't so," Price said.</seg>
<seg id="16">For starters, within five years, every health care plan will have to meet a new federal definition for coverage, one that your current plan might not match, even if you like it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fast forward three years, and that's exactly what's happening.</seg>
<seg id="18">Insurance companies continue to drop Americans from their health plans, many because the policies they had don't meet the coverage requirements under Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="19">The development has Democrats trying to calm concerned constituents by calling the ramped-up requirements a good thing.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If we don't enforce this policy, insurance companies can continue offering flimsy coverage that disappears when people actually need it, and no one should want that," Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, told peers during a congressional hearing on the law's rollout Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="21">Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius struggled to explain that some current plans are no longer available because they're bad for consumers and no longer legal.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many women are charged 50 percent more than men.</seg>
<seg id="23">"That will be illegal," Sebelius said.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, all this creates a problem for the administration because it's not what people expected when they heard Obama promise over and over that, "if you like your plan, you can keep your plan."</seg>
<seg id="25">While Republicans remain eager to say, "I told you so," many Democrats are private regretful -- and frustrated -- that they left Americans with so many expectations that did not pan out.</seg>
<seg id="26">The No.</seg>
<seg id="27">2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, admitted earlier this week that his caucus and the administration should have been "more precise" in explaining not everyone will be able to keep plans they like, especially plans without mandatory coverage.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Iraq, a bushel of problems threaten stability</seg>
<seg id="2">Sectarian divisions, terror, regional conflict and economic issues all threaten Iraqi stability</seg>
<seg id="3">Continued violence could also threaten the country's oil exports and economy</seg>
<seg id="4">All these issues form backdrop for Iraqi prime minister's visit with President Obama</seg>
<seg id="5">(CNN) -- Two years after the United States pulled its forces out of Iraq, the country is, in the words of one analyst, "a house of cards."</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is a contraption held together solely by the reluctance of its many components to let things again come to blows, and which survives on constant infusions of cash thanks to high international oil prices," wrote International Crisis Group analyst Joost Hilterman.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yet the blows keep coming.</seg>
<seg id="8">In some parts of the country, violence has reached urgent proportions, with nearly 1,000 people killed in October alone, according to the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Washington to plead for help from the United States in battling a resurgent al Qaeda, here's a look at some of the main issues facing the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sectarian divisions</seg>
<seg id="11">At the heart of so many of Iraq's many problems is the deep-seated division between the country's Shiite majority and its Sunni minority.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those divisions have deep roots, including decades of repressive and often violent policies against Sunnis -- particularly Kurdish Sunnis -- under the decades-long rule of dictator Saddam Hussein, deposed in the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Kurdish Sunni, Jalal Talabani, is Iraq's president.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, many members of the faith feel marginalized by the more powerful al-Maliki and what the International Crisis Group described in August as his "divide-and-conquer strategy that has neutered any credible Sunni Arab leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite a power-sharing agreement reached in 2010, Sunnis -- who enjoyed political dominance under Hussein -- have complained that al-Maliki has used "de-baathification" as a pretext to exclude them any significant role in national government.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2010, many Sunnis boycotted parliamentary elections after a government commission banned nearly 500 candidates for alleged links to the Sunni-dominated Baath Party once led by Hussein.</seg>
<seg id="17">The violence playing out today has immediate roots in a 2012 Sunni protest movement that analysts say began peacefully but escalated into violence after the government responded with force first.</seg>
<seg id="18">Only later did the government offer what the International Crisis Group described as "half-hearted, belated concessions" that did more to disillusion Sunnis than placate them.</seg>
<seg id="19">Circumstances are likely to continue to worsen, warned the International Crisis Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Under intensifying pressure from government forces and with dwindling faith in a political solution, many Sunni Arabs have concluded their only realistic option is a violent conflict increasingly framed in confessional terms," according to the group.</seg>
<seg id="21">A resurgent al Qaeda</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2008, after an increase in U.S. forces in Iraq and with the aid of Sunni tribes who joined the battle against insurgents, al Qaeda in Iraq appeared to be badly beaten.</seg>
<seg id="23">But since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops, the Sunni-led group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has staged a comeback amid Iraq's growing sectarian tensions -- as well as the conflict in neighboring Syria.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some, including Republican U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, have criticized al-Maliki's governing approach for antagonizing Sunnis.</seg>
<seg id="25">In a letter to Obama ahead of his visit with al-Maliki, the two complained that the prime minister is part of the problem standing between Iraq and greater stability.</seg>
<seg id="26">"By too often pursuing a sectarian and authoritarian agenda, Prime Minister Maliki and his allies are disenfranchising Sunni Iraqis, marginalizing Kurdish Iraqis, and alienating the many Shia Iraqis who have a democratic, inclusive, and pluralistic vision for their country," they wrote.</seg>
<seg id="27">They aren't alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Many analysts say heavy-handed actions taken by the Maliki government to consolidate power in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal have alienated much of the Sunni minority and provided AQI with potent propaganda," Jonathan Masters and Zachary Lamb of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote this week.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the International Crisis Group argued in August that "under intensifying pressure from government forces and with dwindling faith in a political solution, many Sunni Arabs have concluded their only realistic option is a violent conflict increasingly framed in confessional terms."</seg>
<seg id="30">That the conflict is increasingly violent is without question.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 6,400 civilians have died in violence in Iraq this year, the United Nations reports, 979 in October alone.</seg>
<seg id="32">And al Qaeda linked attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated and brazen.</seg>
<seg id="33">For instance, this week, attackers hit a military checkpoint west of Mosul with a suicide car bombing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Gunmen then targeted ambulances carrying victims, police said.</seg>
<seg id="35">In another example, fighters from the group carried out sophisticated, multipronged attacks on two prisons near Baghdad in July, setting hundreds of prisoners free, including high-ranking al Qaeda members, according to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="36">The situation has grown dire enough to raise the specter of a renewed civil war there, according to many analysts and even the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general in Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Today, Iraq is riven by constant and worsening violence, and the prospect of deepening sectarianism casts a dark shadow over the country.</seg>
<seg id="38">"These challenges -- both developmental and security -- threaten the very fabric of Iraqi society and test the extent of the nation's social cohesion," he said in a speech last week in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id="39">Syria</seg>
<seg id="40">The situation next door in Syria, where civil war is raging, isn't helping Iraq's stability.</seg>
<seg id="41">Not only are Kurdish officials having to find ways to deal with nearly 200,000 refugees who have sought shelter in relatively peaceful northern Iraq, the conflict is increasing militancy in the region.</seg>
<seg id="42">"The war in Syria has become a magnet that attracts sectarian extremists and terrorists from various parts of the world and gathers them in our neighborhood, with many slipping across our all-too-porous borders," al-Maliki wrote in a New York Times opinion piece this week.</seg>
<seg id="43">Although Iraq is technically neutral on Syria's civil war, al-Maliki is widely seen as supportive of the county's president, Bashar al-Assad, for fear of what could happen should Sunni extremists linked to al Qaeda take control there.</seg>
<seg id="44">"The civil war in neighboring Syria has exacerbated domestic tensions," the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, a human rights group, recently wrote.</seg>
<seg id="45">Many Sunni and Shia radicals have joined armed groups fighting in Syria, while Prime Minister Maliki is seen by some Iraqis as being overly sympathetic to President Bashar al-Assad's government and its Iranian allies.</seg>
<seg id="46">Security Issues</seg>
<seg id="47">Given such issues to deal with, it's no wonder al-Maliki is calling on Obama to seek more assistance to help combat terrorism and other security concerns.</seg>
<seg id="48">Among other things, he's seeking military equipment and other aid to help bolster border security, combat terrorism and tackle other threats.</seg>
<seg id="49">The U.S. plans to go ahead with delivery of F-16 fighter jets to Iraq next year, and a senior U.S. official who spoke to reporters on background said this week that in addition to weapons sales, greater intelligence-sharing is also likely in the cards.</seg>
<seg id="50">"What we don't want the Iraqis to do is just take a security-centric approach to this," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="51">"What that means is making sure they have information in terms of where people are located, where it's coming from, where the funding is coming from, and that's something we can do pretty effectively," the official continued.</seg>
<seg id="52">So we're trying to help them now as best we can, and that's going to be a key topic of discussion over the course of the visit.</seg>
<seg id="53">Economic issues</seg>
<seg id="54">Although gains have been made to restore Iraq's economy after years of war, occupation and violence, crushing poverty remains pervasive, and the economy remains fragile.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nearly 2 million Iraqis sometimes lack enough to eat, Mladenov said.</seg>
<seg id="56">Infant mortality remains high, as does illiteracy and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="57">And the violence threatens to derail the country's oil production, which drives much of its economy.</seg>
<seg id="58">According to Iraq's Oil Ministry, exports fell to 62.1 million barrels in September, from a peak of 79 million barrels in April, when the worst of the violence began.</seg>
<seg id="59">A continued slide could threaten the government's ability to pay for increased security and economic development efforts.</seg>
<seg id="60">The oil sector provides more than 90% of government revenue and four-fifths of its foreign exchange earnings, according to the CIA.</seg>

<seg id="1">5 Dates to Watch During the Baseball Offseason</seg>
<seg id="2">Just hours after Koji Uehara struck out Matt Carpenter to give the Boston Red Sox their third World Series title in 10 years, baseball's business season got underway when 147 players became free agents.</seg>
<seg id="3">This year's class includes second baseman Robinson Cano; outfielders Jacoby Ellsbury, Carlos Beltran, Shin-Soo Choo and Curtis Granderson; catcher Brian McCann; and pitchers Roy Halladay, Tim Hudson, Ervin Santana, Matt Garza and Fernando Rodney.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 30 more are potentially eligible to go free in the next few days, depending on the outcome of club, player and mutual options.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most prominent player in this group is Yankees captain Derek Jeter.</seg>
<seg id="6">After missing most of this season due to an ankle injury, Jeter must decide whether to exercise a $9.5 million player option.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under the labor contract agreed to after the 2011 season, there's a new, slightly accelerated schedule to the business season.</seg>
<seg id="8">Here are five dates to watch:</seg>
<seg id="9">MONDAY: Teams must decide by 5 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="10">EST whether to make $14.1 million qualifying offers to their former players who became free agents.</seg>
<seg id="11">The figure, calculated as the average salary of the 125 highest-paid players, is up from $13.3 million last year, and replaced the old system of offering salary arbitration.</seg>
<seg id="12">Just nine players were given the offers last year - including David Ortiz and Josh Hamilton - and none accepted.</seg>
<seg id="13">If a team makes a qualifying offer and the player signs with a different club, his old team gets an extra selection in next June's amateur draft and his new club forfeits a pick.</seg>
<seg id="14">A team can make a qualifying offer only to a player who has been with that organization continuously since opening day.</seg>
<seg id="15">11: The deadline to accept qualifying offers is 5 p.m., and it coincides with the annual meeting of general managers, held this year in Orlando, Fla.</seg>
<seg id="16">A few trades sometimes get made, but this is generally a feeling-out session where GMs gauge what's available on the trade market and start to get a sense of free-agent prices from the agents in attendance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Owners meet on the final day, Nov.</seg>
<seg id="18">14, and could approve rules for expanded video review of umpires' calls - pretty much everything but balls and strikes.</seg>
<seg id="19">2: The last day for teams to offer 2014 contracts to unsigned players, known in the industry as the tender date.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams can avoid going to salary arbitration with a player by declining to offer a contract, which makes that player a free agent.</seg>

<seg id="2">MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The ancient Aztecs would be up in arms: in the land that gave chocolate to the world, Mexican lawmakers have declared the popular food to be "junk," subject to an extra tax.</seg>
<seg id="3">The chocolate charge was part of a raft of fiscal changes passed by Mexico's Congress on Thursday that seek to boost tax revenues and to tackle the country's unhealthy eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the amendments added to the tax bill was a levy on "junk food" - defined as products containing more than 275 calories per 100 grams.</seg>
<seg id="5">Many types of chocolate have around twice that amount.</seg>
<seg id="6">McDonalds hamburgers, for example, fall below the benchmark, according to data on the company's website.</seg>
<seg id="7">Originally proposed as a 5 percent levy this month, Congress approved an 8 percent charge on the foods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chocolate was grouped alongside a host of high-calorie products including gelatine, sweets and some puddings.</seg>
<seg id="9">Etymologists trace the origin of the word "chocolate" to the Aztec word "xocolatl."</seg>
<seg id="10">It refers to the foamy bitter drink brewed from cacao - or cocoa - beans, according to the website of Washington's Smithsonian Institution.</seg>
<seg id="11">In Aztec times, the drink was reserved for the nobility.</seg>
<seg id="12">Historians say cocoa beans were also used like currency in many parts of pre-modern Latin America, and the Maya and Aztecs believed the bean had magical properties.</seg>
<seg id="13">Legend has it that Aztec king Moctezuma feted Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes with drinking chocolate when he arrived to conquer Mexico in the early 16th Century.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gillard praised, talks down Rio outcome</seg>
<seg id="2">PRIME Minister Julia Gillard has talked down the prospects of a global environment summit delivering immediate results, after receiving high-level praise for Australia's effort to tackle climate change and poverty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ms Gillard will address the United Nations sustainable development conference - nicknamed Rio+20 as it comes 20 years after the landmark Earth Summit - today, a day after she did the rounds of leaders and business chiefs in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prime Minister said at the three-day event she welcomed a draft document that sets out a commitment to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which expire in 2015, with a new set of goals known as the "sustainable development goals."</seg>
<seg id="5">But she admitted the final agreement - which covers issues from deforestation to clean energy - was a compromise.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Officials have been working long and hard to get a text that can be agreed amongst all of the nations of the world," she said.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm not going to stand here and pretend what is in that text is going to make some indelible mark on the world's history from tomorrow on.</seg>
<seg id="8">But I do think it is putting the spotlight on sustainable development ... and oceans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms Gillard, the first Australian PM to visit Brazil, was praised by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as he appointed her to co-chair, with Rwanda, of a body that will make the final push towards meeting the MDGs.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I really count on the Prime Minister's strong visionary leadership and commitment," Mr Ban said after meeting with Ms Gillard.</seg>
<seg id="11">A week ahead of the carbon tax starting, he said Australia was "leading by example" in addressing climate change.</seg>
<seg id="12">The MDG group, which also includes UK rock star Bob Geldof, will rally nations to do more to end poverty, provide clean water, food and education and boost foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">Australia has delayed meeting its target for a year to deliver a budget surplus in 2012/13.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms Gillard's climate efforts were also praised by South Korean president Lee Myung-bak, who welcomed Australia joining the Global Green Growth Institute and contributing $15 million towards fostering ties between the private sector, academia and government to pursue model projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">South Korea is also introducing an emissions trading scheme.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Prime Minister earlier launched a global network - initially involving Australia, Brazil, Norway and New Zealand - to bring together Australian Aboriginal people with other indigenous peoples of the world to share knowledge on managing land and sea.</seg>
<seg id="17">About 56 heads of state and 31 heads of government are set to sign a 50-page non-binding document tackling poverty, sustainable development and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="18">Australian Greens senator Larissa Waters, who is attending the summit, told AAP she was disappointed the Prime Minister was taking a "defeatist" approach and not making further changes to the document put together by diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Frankly these are the people we have elected to speak for us - it should be their call," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Summit participants were given a reality check with a presentation by Brittany Trilford, a 17-year-old student from New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="21">I stand here with fire in my heart.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm confused and angry at the state of the world.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are here to solve the problems that we have caused as a collective, to ensure that we have a future," said Ms Trilford, winner of a youth video speech contest.</seg>

<seg id="1">Duhatschek: Leafs" captain Phaneuf playing quieter brand of hockey</seg>
<seg id="2">The evolution of Toronto Maple Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf into a more complete player is a fascinating case study for anyone who watched him in his younger days with the Calgary Flames.</seg>
<seg id="3">Once upon a time, Phaneuf was a rookie sensation for Flames, scoring 20 goals in his first NHL season, and pulverizing opponents with punishing, Scott Stevens-like hits.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was the original Pierre McGuire "monster" - someone who played big minutes right from the get-go, an eye-catching, high-risk high-reward brand of hockey.</seg>
<seg id="5">Apart from McGuire, no one appreciated Phaneuf's contributions more than Mike Keenan did in the 2007-08 season, a year in which Phaneuf scored 60 points, piled up 182 penalty minutes and was a massive presence on a Flames" team that went out in seven hard games to the San Jose Sharks in the opening playoff round.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phaneuf won them some games and lost them others and eventually, after Keenan's departure, he and his $6.5-million annual contract were deemed expendable - controversially traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in one of the more one-sided deals that general manager Brian Burke pulled off when he was running that organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">Burke runs Calgary now, but he was nowhere in sight Wednesday night, when Toronto took on the Flames.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Phaneuf was front and centre on another roller coaster night for a Leaf team that is rarely predictable but always fun to watch.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whatever their shortcomings may be, the Leafs are winning and putting on a show while they're doing it, which are the prime directives in the entertainment business.</seg>
<seg id="10">And Phaneuf is a big part of what's going right, by playing a far quieter brand of hockey than he once did.</seg>
<seg id="11">This, by the way, is meant as a compliment.</seg>
<seg id="12">It sometimes takes years for players and especially for defencemen to absorb the lesson - that less can sometimes be more.</seg>
<seg id="13">When asked, Phaneuf will tell you, in his own mind, the biggest improvements in his game have come in his own end.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I'm a lot more responsible there," he said, "and that's a learning curve that a lot of young D-men have when they come in."</seg>
<seg id="15">When you first start as a young age, you're usually protected by different match-ups.</seg>
<seg id="16">The coaching staff usually puts you out there against the guys that they want to match you up against.</seg>
<seg id="17">As you get older and as you gain more experience, you're playing against better players.</seg>
<seg id="18">I feel as I've grown in my role and in the way I play the game defensively.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a rookie, Phaneuf played a lot with the veteran Roman Hamrlik and they were a good pair together.</seg>
<seg id="20">Over time, the Flames invested a lot of dollars into their defence corps - signing Phaneuf and Robyn Regehr and then adding Jay Bouwmeester as a free agent.</seg>
<seg id="21">Eventually something had to give ... and all three have now moved on.</seg>
<seg id="22">Soon, Phaneuf will be in the negotiating stages again - with an expiring contract, he will be an unrestricted free agent once the season ends.</seg>
<seg id="23">It will likely cost the Leafs in the $7-million range on a term of seven years to get him signed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Phaneuf earned top dollar from Calgary because he scored 54 goals in his first three years in the league, but if he gets the sort of long-term extension the Leafs almost certainly have to give him, it will because he's become a more responsible penalty killer, with better stick positioning, and a greater sense of how to front opposing forwards in an era where the open-ice body check is on the endangered species list.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most important, it looks as though Leafs coach Randy Carlyle trusts Phaneuf more.</seg>
<seg id="26">Phaneuf is averaging about 24 minutes a night, a little less than usual, which seems to be a good number for him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Different nights you're going to play different amount of minutes," Phaneuf said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Whenever you're asked to go, you go and do your job.</seg>
<seg id="29">Some nights, it's more.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some nights, it's less.</seg>
<seg id="31">The biggest thing is, as a group, we've done a good job of working together.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's all about getting wins - whether you're playing 25 or 27.</seg>
<seg id="33">Everyone has their opinion and different take on every issue of the game - whether it's the offensive side of your game or the defensive side of your game.</seg>
<seg id="34">I feel good about where my game is at personally and where our team game is at, more importantly.</seg>
<seg id="35">Phaneuf played for years in Calgary with Jarome Iginla, who was signed to five-year extensions for $7-million a year because this is where he wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="36">Phaneuf looks happy playing in Toronto and being captain of the Leafs.</seg>
<seg id="37">For their part, the Leafs would be hard-pressed to replace Phaneuf's minutes if he were to hit the market as an unrestricted free agent, given how few high-end defencemen ever get there.</seg>
<seg id="38">He likes them and they need him and that's usually a formula for a successful contract conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe investing $15-million in two players - Phaneuf and the recently extended Phil Kessel - doesn't make sense when the NHL salary cap is at $64.5-million, but since most GMs believe it will go north of $75-million within the next two to three years, the Leafs can probably make the dollars work.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the meantime, it probably heartens general manager Dave Nonis to know that Phaneuf likes his day job a lot.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It's a real fun team to be a part of," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">It's a young exciting team.</seg>
<seg id="43">We've played well here early.</seg>
<seg id="44">We've done a lot of real good things here the last year and a half.</seg>
<seg id="45">Obviously, with the additions we've made over the summer, the guys that have come in have really helped our team.</seg>
<seg id="46">Depth is a big thing in the NHL.</seg>
<seg id="47">I think you see that year in and year out.</seg>
<seg id="48">The teams that have success have depth.</seg>
<seg id="49">I feel our team is going in the right direction.</seg>

<seg id="1">Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents</seg>
<seg id="2">The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
<seg id="5">Google is accused of infringing seven patents.</seg>
<seg id="6">The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</seg>
<seg id="7">Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</seg>
<seg id="8">Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="11">After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe," the lawsuit said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.</seg>

<seg id="1">Treatment 'could have saved prisoner'</seg>
<seg id="2">THE treatment of an Aboriginal man who died while in police custody in Alice Springs was inadequate, an inquest has heard.</seg>
<seg id="3">The inquest into the death of Terence Briscoe, 27, who died on January 5 while in police custody, today heard from Dr Morris O'Dell, a forensic physician based in Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dr O'Dell, an expert on the medical care of prisoners, said in a report that Mr Briscoe's situation was an evolving medical emergency that went unrecognised.</seg>
<seg id="5">"A timely response may have have prevented his death," part of the report read out at the inquest said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He told the court the care of Mr Briscoe was inadequate and police should have called an ambulance to look after the prisoner, who was very drunk, had a cut above his eye and was not fully conscious.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I don't think it was care that would be expected of police that work in that environment," Dr O'Dell said.</seg>
<seg id="8">I think police who work in that environment should have enough knowledge to know when a person is in danger.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Briscoe's death caused an outcry earlier this year after two men arrested with him said they saw police roughing him up while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yesterday the inquest in Alice Springs heard from prisoners near where Mr Briscoe was being held who said they attempted unsuccessfully to have police check on him, because Mr Briscoe was making a choking sound.</seg>
<seg id="11">One prisoner said he told a female police officer Mr Briscoe needed to go to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">She turned around to me and said, 'That is what you get when you don't listen to us, when you don't listen to the officer.</seg>
<seg id="13">"He deserved it,'" the prisoner said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another prisoner described how a buzzer in the cell was used to tell police to check on Mr Briscoe, but was ignored.</seg>
<seg id="15">Coroner Greg Cavanagh told the court today that it seemed that acute alcohol toxicity combined with respiratory problems caused by Mr Briscoe's position along with other factors may have played a role in the death.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the time of his death, Mr Briscoe had a blood alcohol reading of 0.35 per cent, which the court heard was at the lower limit of what could be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of the 10 police officers who had dealings with Mr Briscoe were cautioned, but none were demoted or dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police are expected to give evidence to the inquest on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Malky Mackay remaining focused ahead of Swansea City derby despite turmoil at Cardiff City</seg>
<seg id="2">He added: "We have waited 51 years to get to this position and be in the Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="3">I won't let anything else get in the way of that.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is a lot of stuff going on around about it, but my job is to manage the team, be proud of my players and prepare them in the best way possible, so myself and the staff and players are focused on the routine of the week.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you don't have that and take your eye off it and start thinking about other matters, that's when you get punished and I won't let anything else get in the way of my determination to do the best for the club on the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mackay refused to comment on a report that striker Etien Velikonja, who joined from Maribor last summer, was signed by owner Vincent Tan without the approval of the Scottish manager.</seg>
<seg id="7">Velikonja is not part of the Bluebirds' 25-man squad.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mackay said: "I am not going to talk about individual players and the recruitment of individual players.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am here and will answer anything you want concerning Sunday, it's too big a day for me and our football club and players in terms of everything that goes with it for me to start the background noise.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is enough of that already with everyone else and I have a steely determination concerning my group of players and it is absolutely wrong of me to go in and start talking about individuals and their own circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Mackay has reiterated he has the final say on transfers, something the club confirmed in a statement after a board meeting held in the wake of Moody's departure.</seg>
<seg id="12">He told talkSPORT: "That was something that was cleared up by the chairman, Mehmet Dalman, who is a really good guy.</seg>
<seg id="13">He came in a couple of weeks ago and held a board meeting and was really impressive.</seg>
<seg id="14">The statement coming out from that was that I have the final say in terms of who comes in and goes out of the football club.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is something I made sure happened.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mackay also risked the wrath of the Football Association by commenting on the appointment of Mike Dean as referee for the clash with Swansea.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dean took charge of a 2-2 draw between the sides in 2009 and was struck by a coin thrown from the Cardiff section of the crowd before half-time, and awarded Cardiff a controversial stoppage-time penalty from which Ross McCormack equalised.</seg>
<seg id="18">FA rules forbid managers from talking about an official ahead of a game, but when asked if he was surprised that Dean would officiate at Cardiff City Stadium, Mackay said: "No.</seg>
<seg id="19">He is a top-level referee.</seg>
<seg id="20">There have been plenty of occasions where a referee has been involved in something and then a couple of years later has gone back into the same environment.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is probably good that that happens.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is a very good referee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Roberto Martinez, then the Swansea manager, said after the game in 2009: "Mike said the penalty was given because (Swansea defender) Ashley (Williams) had his arms around the striker (McCormack) but there were nine or 10 instances like that in the game.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was an emotional decision.</seg>

<seg id="2">4, 2010: A California family waiting to apply for food stamps at the Sacramento County Economic Development Department in Sacramento, Calif.</seg>
<seg id="3">WASHINGTON - Forty-eight million Americans will have their food stamps benefits slashed starting Friday, when a recession-era boost in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program expires.</seg>
<seg id="4">The move to cut back benefits will be the first wide-scale change to the program affecting nearly every single participant.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 13.6 percent cut comes out to about $36 a month less for a family of four getting government assistance or $420 a year, according to the Department of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since 2000, the costs for the plan have increased more than 358 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, cites lax eligibility requirements as one of the reasons behind the increase.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Growing older sooner</seg>
<seg id="2">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent</seg>
<seg id="4">There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys</seg>
<seg id="7">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are important, too.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, "suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are varying explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niger says 92 migrants found dead in Sahara after failed crossing</seg>
<seg id="2">By Abdoulaye Massalatchi</seg>
<seg id="3">NIAMEY (Reuters) - Rescuers have found the bodies of 92 migrants, most of them women and children, strewn across the Sahara desert in northern Niger after their vehicles broke down and they died of thirst, authorities said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rescue worker Almoustapha Alhacen said the bodies of 52 children, 33 women and seven men were found close to the Algerian border, some 160 km (100 miles) north of the mining town of Arlit in northern Niger.</seg>
<seg id="5">Many of the victims, all believed to be from Niger, were in an advanced state of decomposition and had been partly devoured by animals, probably jackals, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Niger's government declared three days of national mourning starting on Friday and said it would launch a crackdown on the networks ferrying migrants across the Sahara.</seg>
<seg id="7">Northern Niger lies on a major corridor for illegal migration and people-trafficking from sub-Saharan African into north Africa and across the Mediterranean into Europe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most of those who make the perilous journey on ancient open-topped trucks are young African men in search of work.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rescuers said the doomed convoy was puzzling.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's the first time I've seen anything like it," Alhacen told Reuters by telephone from Arlit.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is hard to understand what these women and children were doing there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rescuers found many small writing slates among the luggage, suggesting the children may have been students in a Qu'ranic school being taken to Algeria, perhaps to beg, Alhacen said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Alhacen said 19 of the group had reached Algeria by foot and were repatriated to Niger by authorities there.</seg>
<seg id="14">Two survived after walking dozens of kilometers (miles) across the burning desert back to Arlit.</seg>
<seg id="15">The bodies of 87 of the victims were buried on Wednesday in accordance with Islamic custom, he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The migrants had set off in two trucks from Arlit towards Tamanrasset in Algeria sometime between late September or early October, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="17">After one truck broke down, the second turned back to look for help but was stranded and the passengers tried to return by foot.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was weeks before authorities were alerted and able to reach the site.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sometimes in the vast desert, there are tragedies like this which are never even discovered," government spokesman Marou Amadou told state television.</seg>
<seg id="20">So the government has instructed administrative authorities and defense forces to put an end to this transport which kills.</seg>
<seg id="21">Authorities said all the passengers came from the region of Kantche in southern Niger, 700 km east of the capital Niamey.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many people emigrate to flee poverty in Niger, ranked by the United Nations as the least developed country on earth.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some work in neighboring Libya and Algeria to save money before returning home.</seg>
<seg id="24">The networks which send trucks across the desert also attract migrants from other countries in West Africa who dream of a more prosperous life in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of the people-smugglers are from nomadic groups who have seen their traditional pastoral lifestyle destroyed by droughts since the 1970s, according to a U.N. report published in February.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 32,000 people have arrived in southern Europe from Africa so far this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">A crackdown by Spanish authorities has largely closed a route from the West African coast to the Canary Islands which drew tens of thousands of migrants in the mid-2000s.</seg>
<seg id="28">Instead, most now try to make the Mediterranean crossing from north Africa to southern Europe, many losing their lives when their rickety boats are wrecked.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than 500 people are believed to have died in two shipwrecks off southern Italy this month.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tim Lane will lead the new commentary team.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Craig Sillitoe</seg>
<seg id="4">Three former Australian captains are set to feature on Fairfax Radio's commentary team as international cricket makes a return to the commercial airwaves this summer after a long hiatus.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cricket Australia on Friday confirmed it had agreed a five-year deal with Fairfax, which runs 2UE in Sydney, 3AW in Melbourne, 4BC in Brisbane and 6PR in Perth, to broadcast Tests, one-day and Twenty20 internationals and the T20 Big Bash League on its stations.</seg>
<seg id="6">The game's traditional broadcaster, the ABC, will continue to air Test cricket as well but has lost its exclusivity and is also set to be without any calling rights to domestic cricket from this season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Approached: Veteran BBC commentator Henry Blofeld.</seg>
<seg id="8">The alliance with commercial radio has been in the works for months.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fairfax Radio is understood to have put together the majority of its commentary team already.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will be led by Tim Lane, a former voice of cricket on the ABC who calls AFL on 3AW, and the Melbourne-based commentator and journalist Bruce Eva, with former Australian players Damien Fleming and Dean Jones other prominent members of the team assembled.</seg>
<seg id="11">Allan Border and Ian Chappell are also likely to be part of the commentary set-up this summer, while it is understood the company is also speaking with Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and former England captain Michael Vaughan.</seg>
<seg id="12">Veteran BBC commentator Henry Blofeld could also end up behind a Fairfax microphone after being approached.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was involved in calling cricket on 2UE in commercial radio's most recent foray into the sport more than a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fairfax will broadcast the Melbourne and Sydney Ashes Tests this summer as well as Australia's limited-overs internationals.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those matches will air on 2UE, 3AW, 4BC and 6PR as well as a national digital sports network to be established.</seg>
<seg id="16">A statement from CA on Friday said Fairfax was also engaging regional stations and working to provide coverage in Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The radio rights agreement between Cricket Australia and Fairfax Radio Network marks an exciting new chapter for cricket in Australia and offers followers of the game even more ways to enjoy the cricket action this summer," CA executive general manager of media, communications and marketing Ben Amarfio said.</seg>
<seg id="18">We hope it is the first of a number of radio rights agreements to be announced in the lead-up to a huge summer of cricket.</seg>
<seg id="19">Our work with all of our broadcast partners is designed to take the game to the widest audience possible.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fairfax Radio managing director Adam Lang said: "We are excited to be broadcasting a sport that plays such an integral role in the Australian way of life."</seg>
<seg id="21">Cricket has a rich history of sporting success for our nation and we are delighted to be a part of its future.</seg>
<seg id="22">CA's new deal with the ABC is yet to be announced but the national broadcaster will only call Test, one-day and T20 internationals and women's cricket, with no ball-by-ball Sheffield Shield, Big Bash or Ryobi Cup in its agreement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I relish competition," Craig Norenbergs, the manager of ABC Grandstand, said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Like a good sportsperson, competition makes you better.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've been doing it for 80 years and we will be doing it for another 80 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">CA is also yet to publicly confirm an association with Southern Cross Austereo, which is expected to also provide coverage of the Big Bash League on Triple M.</seg>

<seg id="2">A high-profile phone-hacking trial in Britain turned considerably seamier Thursday when the prosecution revealed in court that the two most senior editors of News of the World had an affair lasting more than six years - during the period at issue in the trial, and also while both of them married other people.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two editors, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, are defendants in the case surrounding the British newspapers controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. empire, including News of the World, a weekly tabloid that the company shut down in 2011 after the hacking scandal broke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brooks was the editor of News of the World from 2000 to 2003 and then moved to its sister daily tabloid, The Sun; Coulson was her deputy at the weekly and succeeded her as its editor, running the paper until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="5">Andrew Edis, a prosecutor in the case, said in open court that the two began their six-year affair in 1998; Coulson married in 2000 and Brooks married in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="6">Coulson remains married; Brooks was divorced in 2009, and then married her current husband, Charlie Brooks, who is also a defendant in the case.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prosecutor said the Brooks-Coulson affair ended long before Coulson went to work for Prime Minister David Cameron after his election in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="8">The prosecutor's revelation made it legally permissible to publish reports of the affair, which had been widely discussed in private by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="9">Edis justified the revelation by saying that it demonstrated the closeness of the two, who are charged with overseeing a pattern of phone hacking and other illegal efforts to obtain details of the lives of prominent people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Throughout the relevant period, what Mr. Coulson knew, Mrs. Brooks knew, too," Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="11">What Mrs. Brooks knew, Mr. Coulson knew, too.</seg>
<seg id="12">That's the point.</seg>
<seg id="13">The trial, involving a total of eight defendants, is expected to last many months.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brooks and Coulson are accused of conspiring with others to hack phones and of conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office, a reference to payoffs made to the police and other officials.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rebekah Brooks also faces charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.</seg>

<seg id="6">24 workers fell unconscious as the owners of the Landhi garments factory tried to get rid of a 'genie' they believed was haunting the building.</seg>

<seg id="9">Karachi: The workers collapsed at the Landhi garment factory, Karachi.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is thought they were overcome by mass hysteria</seg>
<seg id="11">A spiritualist was called to this morning by the factory owners to get rid of the suspected "jinns" but as soon as he began reciting different verses, the workers began falling unconscious while others ran out shouting and screaming for help.</seg>

<seg id="1">Notorious jewel thief Doris Payne, 83, makes news in Palm Desert</seg>
<seg id="2">PALM DESERT - Doris Payne - demure, elegant and 83 - is a thief, as prolific and subtly conniving as they come.</seg>
<seg id="3">She doesn't use muscle and she doesn't rely on guns.</seg>
<seg id="4">Instead, between numerous stints behind bars, for 50 years she has leaned on charming misdirection to steal pricey jewelry from unsuspecting merchants all over the globe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her most recent alleged theft found her on El Paseo, the luxurious row of shops in Palm Desert.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jeweler Raju Mehta thought she fit right in with his customers.</seg>
<seg id="7">All Mehta saw was an articulate, charming older woman who complained about her aching hip and asked if he would show her more and more of his expensive wares.</seg>
<seg id="8">She was wearing fashionable clothes, gold earrings and carrying a nice purse.</seg>
<seg id="9">He watched as she tried on a necklace.</seg>
<seg id="10">She left for a while, then came back to try on more jewelry, including and a ring for her pinkie finger.</seg>
<seg id="11">She left again, saying she would return the next day to finalize a purchase with proceeds from a $42,000 insurance check.</seg>
<seg id="12">She never came back.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead, when Mehta arrived the next day at El Paseo Jewelers, his co-workers showed him a computer screen with a security alert: Payne had been seen at a local Saks Fifth Avenue store and may be on the prowl.</seg>
<seg id="14">The $22,500 diamond-encrusted ring he had shown the elderly woman the day before was missing.</seg>
<seg id="15">"She knows what she's doing," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've been doing retail for a very long time and it's never happened that someone stole right in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Payne was arrested Tuesday and faced a judge Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of her sophisticated wardrobe, she was wearing a blue jail jumpsuit.</seg>
<seg id="19">Police say that Mehta was the latest in a long line of unsuspecting victims duped by Payne, who once described her profession in a court document as "jewel thief."</seg>
<seg id="20">"What she did in that store is exactly how she has operated for decades," said retired FBI Agent Paul Graupmann, who first arrested Payne in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="21">She comes in well-dressed and often says she is looking to buy something because she has come into some money.</seg>
<seg id="22">A byproduct of her unwavering devotion to thievery is a notoriety that now borders on fame.</seg>
<seg id="23">She has long been known to law enforcement, has been featured on TV, in newspapers and had her story told in a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="24">There has been talk of Halle Berry starring in a movie about her life.</seg>
<seg id="25">Payne is from West Virginia, the youngest of six children born to a coal miner father and a mother who was a seamstress.</seg>
<seg id="26">Growing up African American in the South of that era appears to have left her with painful memories that may have motivated her illicit life.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wanted to be a ballerina, but was told black girls couldn't become ballerinas.</seg>
<seg id="28">She said she realized she could become a jewelry thief as a teenager in Cleveland when she was trying on a watch and a store owner became distracted.</seg>
<seg id="29">"She dreamed of this large life for herself ... She said she developed a revenge mentality and she sought this life she was told she couldn't have," said Matthew Pond, co-director and co-producer of a new documentary titled "The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne."</seg>
<seg id="30">It is sort of this twisted take on the American Dream.</seg>
<seg id="31">I think love her or hate her, you have to respect someone who goes after their dream with such chutzpah.</seg>
<seg id="32">By the early 1970s, she wasn't just plying her trade in cities throughout the U.S., she was jet-setting across the globe, stealing expensive diamonds in Paris, Milan, London and Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="33">She even escaped from custody in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="34">John Kennedy, president of the New York-based Jewelers' Security Alliance, said that over the decades, his organization has sent "innumerable bulletins" about Payne to its members and law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="35">What makes the now 83-year-old unique, he said, is the length of her criminal career.</seg>
<seg id="36">"I've actually seen an old rap sheet of hers," Kennedy said, starting to laugh.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was so long.</seg>
<seg id="38">You can't believe how long it was - it was like 50 pages.</seg>
<seg id="39">"She's been arrested and convicted so many times, and then she gets short time or sometimes she'll get a walk because of her health and she's old," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="40">They think she's not a real risk to the community.</seg>

<seg id="4">Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
<seg id="5">A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.</seg>
<seg id="7">The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="14">Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.</seg>
<seg id="18">Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.</seg>
<seg id="20">The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.</seg>
<seg id="32">He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will find you and put you before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.</seg>
<seg id="43">On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.</seg>

<seg id="1">FKP bounces back from separation with distribution pledge</seg>
<seg id="2">BRISBANE-BASED FKP Property has shrugged off the departure of residential development giant Stockland from its share register with a new company name and a pledge to reintroduce distribution payments next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company is in the process of transforming itself into a pure-play retirement village business through divesting its non-retirement assets.</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking at the company's annual general meeting in Sydney yesterday, FKP chairman and Malaysian tycoon Seng Huang Lee said ties were cut between Stockland and FKP because of a change of strategy on Stockland's part.</seg>
<seg id="5">We tried to see how to work together, we couldn't find any common ground and as a result it became a non-core asset for them and they decided to move on.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I don't think it has anything to do with a vote of confidence, it just didn't fit their plans anymore," Mr Lee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stockland sold its 11.6 per cent stake in FKP and relinquished the right it held over FKP's retirement portfolio last week in a $100m-plus deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Lee said the group had made progress since its last AGM, but there was still a lot of work ahead.</seg>
<seg id="9">The past 12 months has seen a clear new strategic direction announced and begin to be implemented for the group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"FKP will become a purely retirement village-focused business and will be Australia's leader in the retirement village sector," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">FKP shareholders yesterday voted in favour of the company's name change to Aveo Group.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company also announced it would reinstate distributions next year.</seg>
<seg id="13">The amount will be determined at the year end.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last year, FKP paid 19.6c per share distribution and just 1c this year.</seg>
<seg id="15">Chief executive Geoff Grady said FKP's nearly 50 per cent drop in statutory profit to $166.5 million for the past fiscal year was driven solely by impairments to FKP's non-retirement assets, but that there would be no further write-downs.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We've got almost $800m worth of assets left to sell, in my view able to be realised dollar for dollar of book value, and we've got less than $400m worth of debt so the simple equation would be mean we would have $400m left to invest in our retirement activities," said Mr Grady.</seg>
<seg id="17">FKP's $232m equity raising, which it launched on Monday, enabled the company to meet three short-term debt maturities totalling $174m and to assist in its plans to sell $767m in non-retirement assets.</seg>
<seg id="18">FKP closed down 0.5c at $1.85.</seg>

<seg id="1">US-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found</seg>
<seg id="2">One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.</seg>
<seg id="3">US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.</seg>
<seg id="5">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="9">They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cape Lodge on the Margaret River.</seg>

<seg id="4">Paddling the Margaret River.</seg>
<seg id="5">IT'S early December in Margaret River, WA's prime wine-producing region, just days after bushfires destroyed several houses, including the area's most historic home.</seg>
<seg id="6">The central township is bustling, my accommodation at Cape Lodge, set beside lakes and vineyards behind the coast, looks magnificent and the tours I am booked to take are unaffected.</seg>
<seg id="7">Well, not quite unaffected.</seg>
<seg id="8">On my first morning I join Sean Blocksidge's Margaret River Discovery Tour and he begins with an apology.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm afraid I lost my canoes in the fires," he says, as our small group paddles at the mouth of the Margaret River, "so I've borrowed these."</seg>
<seg id="10">We're around the corner from Prevelly, one of the villages worst affected by the fires.</seg>
<seg id="11">A week before, Blocksidge, working alongside other volunteers from the local bushfire brigade, battled to save this section of coast from the blaze.</seg>
<seg id="12">His dramatic photographs made newspaper front pages and were published around the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">Beside the river is now a bleakly beautiful scene.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the distance, I can see the charred ruins of Wallcliffe House, the heritage-listed home built by the region's earliest settlers, the Bussells.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nearby, blackened tree stumps stand out against coastal dunes, once covered in vegetation but now burnt back to sand.</seg>
<seg id="16">Small green shoots are already appearing.</seg>
<seg id="17">In April is the 21st annual Margaret River Festival (April 13-16).</seg>
<seg id="18">The program includes a Vintage Festival, with 300 wines to sample, free street fiestas in the Margaret River and Dunsborough town centres and a Twenty20 cricket match featuring WA's top players, past and present.</seg>
<seg id="19">The festival starts with the Long Table Feast at Leeuwin Estate, which is orchestrated by five of the region's chefs, including Cape Lodge's Tony Howell.</seg>
<seg id="20">During my visit, I have an exquisite dinner prepared by Howell, including tender seared scallops with Asian omelet, sushi rice and ginger jelly and sweet-fleshed local marron.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Vintage Festival is on Saturday at Palmer wines, at Dunsborough in Margaret River's north, showcasing new-release and vintage wines and providing an opportunity to meet Australian winemakers.</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be live music and a Live Art Arena, where visitors can see art being created by a dozen local artists.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Welcome to Australia's most consistent wine-growing region," says Blocksidge, as we continue our tour driving along the main coastal artery, Caves Rd.</seg>
<seg id="24">While Margaret River only accounts for 3 per cent of the country's grape production, it makes nearly 30 per cent of its premium wine.</seg>
<seg id="25">""With a Mediterranean maritime climate, low summer rainfall and low-nutrient soils, Margaret River has all the ingredients for making top-quality wines.</seg>
<seg id="26">Remarkably, though, it wasn't until the mid 1960s that its potential was recognised and surgeon Tom Cullity planted its first vineyard.</seg>
<seg id="27">The region now has more than 5000ha under vine and 150 wine producers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Instead of rushing between wineries, Blocksidge's tour visits just one, the small Fraser Gallop Estate, which has won international awards for its cabernet sauvignon.</seg>
<seg id="29">Lunching here, we taste the "summer-in-a-glass" semillon-sauvignon and the latest cab sav and discuss their creation with Australian winemaker of the year, Clive Otto.</seg>
<seg id="30">We end the tour strolling along the Wilyabrup cliffs on the coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's scenery like this that makes Margaret River the complete package.</seg>
<seg id="32">Offshore, the Indian Ocean, whipped up by the Roaring Forties winds, forms some of the planet's biggest waves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rolling and smashing against this granite coastline, the sea has sculpted a succession of bluffs, bays and rock formations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We don't want to charge that," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.</seg>
<seg id="30">It will still give away water.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazing time-lapse video shows the first 100 days of the first giant panda twins to survive in America</seg>
<seg id="2">The first twin giant panda cubs to survive in the U.S. have had their lives commemorated in a time-lapse video</seg>
<seg id="3">The baby boys were filmed by Zoo Atlanta's PandaCam which documented their development</seg>
<seg id="4">The video shows the cubs growing from tiny pink creatures to fuzzy black and white balls of energy</seg>
<seg id="5">On their 100th day, October 23, the cubs were given their official names: Mei Lun and Mei Huan</seg>
<seg id="6">By Alex Greig</seg>
<seg id="7">To commemorate the first twin giant panda cubs to be born in the United States and survive, a time-lapse video has been released showing their first 100 days in three minutes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The adorable video featuring Mei Lun and Mei Huan, baby giant pandas born at Zoo Atlanta in July, has already been viewed almost 200,000 times.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the course of 100 days, the baby boys develop from blind, pink, toothless creatures measuring about six to seven inches long and to robust, curious cubs with thick black and white fur.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tiny twins: The baby giant pandas must be kept warm when they are newborns as they cannot regulate their own body temperature</seg>
<seg id="11">Helpless: At eight days old, the cubs are deaf and haven't yet opened their eyes</seg>
<seg id="12">Developing: At 11 days old, the cubs have developed gray-ish markings where they will eventually have black fur</seg>
<seg id="13">Mother's love: The cubs alternated time with their mother, spending three hours each with Lun Lun</seg>
<seg id="14">Born July 15, the cubs' names were revealed, following Chinese tradition, on the 100th day of their lives in a 100 Day Naming Celebration on October 23.</seg>
<seg id="15">The names, Mei Lun and Mei Huan, come from ancient Chinese idioms meaning 'something indescribably beautiful and magnificent.'</seg>
<seg id="16">Zoo Atlanta documented their development by filming them with their 'PandaCam' 24 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="17">Giant panda cubs are about 900 times smaller than their mothers when they are born looking after them is extremely time-consuming for the mother.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cubs appear to spend much of their time sleeping, but as they develop their eyes are open more and they begin moving around their enclosure.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cubs generally begin crawling at about 75 to 80 days old.</seg>
<seg id="20">Almost one month: The pandas have very soft, sparse fur when they are babies but will eventually grow thick, coarse fur</seg>
<seg id="21">Miniature giants: By day 36 the pandas are beginning to look like tiny versions of the adults they will be</seg>
<seg id="22">First sight: Both cubs opened their eyes and began using their back legs to scoot themselves around their enclosure at about this time</seg>
<seg id="23">According to zookeeper Jennifer A, the cubs are now trying to stand.</seg>
<seg id="24">Both cubs are getting really good at standing...</seg>
<seg id="25">Their movements are still pretty clumsy, and sometimes when they try to walk they appear to be making frog-like or inchworm-like movements all around the nest box,' she wrote on the Zoo Atlanta panda blog.</seg>
<seg id="26">Zoo Atlanta staff told YouTube viewers that, typically, the twins would not have survived in the wild.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the comments section of the video, Zoo Atlanta said that in the wild, giant panda mothers only care for one cub when twins are born.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's believed the mother panda cannot store enough milk to feed more than one cub as she does not store fat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Growing fast: At this stage, the cubs weighed almost 7lb each</seg>
<seg id="30">Teething: At about this age, the cubs' teeth began to come through and they became much more active</seg>
<seg id="31">Milestone: The twins at their 100 Day Naming Celebration on October 23</seg>
<seg id="32">To get around this problem, Zoo Atlanta staff alternated the cubs with their mother for the first few months.</seg>
<seg id="33">This means their mother, Lun Lun, can give equal care to both cubs.</seg>
<seg id="34">This technique was first developed by our colleagues at the Chengdu Zoo.</seg>
<seg id="35">They used it for the first time in 1990 and as a result had the first pair of twins born in captivity to survive,' writes Jennifer A.</seg>
<seg id="36">Zoo staff will give both cubs to Lun Lun when they are able to walk, at which point she will not need much help from the staff to look after her twin sons.</seg>

<seg id="1">US borders: "Super tunnel" for drug smuggling discovered</seg>
<seg id="2">On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" intended for drug smuggling.</seg>
<seg id="3">As announced by the US Customs Authorities, the pipe between Tijuana and San Diego, measuring more than 500 metres in length, was equipped with electricity, a railway track and a ventilation system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three suspects were detained in relation to the discovery, with eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the details provided, the tunnel had not yet been put into use.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These cartels are stupid if they think that they can dig through under the radar," said the US Attorney for the District of Southern California, Laura Diffy, at a press conference held in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered.</seg>
<seg id="7">Referring to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build and attempt to use these tunnels, we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money".</seg>
<seg id="8">Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="10">Built by experts</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel, investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The railway system was equipped in such a way that electrically powered carts could be used on it.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the authorities, a ladder runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tunnel has a cross-section measuring 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres across.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the USA.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two of the suspects were detained in conjunction with the cocaine find.</seg>
<seg id="18">The third, a Mexican, was detained due to the seizure of the marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="19">All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since 2006, eight tunnels of this type have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego continued.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, this was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.</seg>
<seg id="22">Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="23">This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Squad in San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="24">They will do anything to make it to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="25">No specific details were given regarding those detained, but it is reported that at least one is Mexican</seg>
<seg id="26">They can expect prison terms of up to ten years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Robert Porter banned from keeping animals for leaving dogs in car</seg>
<seg id="2">A man who left his two dogs "slowly cooking" inside a hot car in the height of summer has been banned from keeping animals for ten years, the Scottish SPCA has said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The charity said that Robert Porter, 54, of Glencoe Street, Glasgow, was sentenced at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Thursday following an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Porter left his two Jack Russell terriers in a hot car in the car park of Clydebank Shopping Centre on June 4, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was one of the hottest days of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">The dogs survived their ordeal, but could have died, the charity said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to a ban on keeping animals, Porter was given a deprivation order, meaning the dogs will not be returned to his care.</seg>
<seg id="8">Porter was also ordered to pay the charity £250 in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="9">SSPCA Senior Inspector Nicki Scott said that the dogs were showing signs of distress, were panting and had no water.</seg>
<seg id="10">They had to be taken to the vet and treated for heat stress.</seg>
<seg id="11">She said: "It's important to understand that the heat inside a vehicle can build up to a dangerous level when it's warm outside."</seg>
<seg id="12">""The temperature that day was showing as 24 degrees and there was no wind or shade in the car park, therefore the temperature inside the van would have been much higher.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dogs can't sweat the way humans do and they need to pant to cool down.</seg>
<seg id="14">""With the extremely hot air in the vehicle and the lack of water or shade available, the dogs were slowly cooking and they could have died had we not intervened.</seg>
<seg id="15">What makes this case all the more worrying is that one of our inspectors had advised Porter of the dangers of leaving his dogs in his vehicle just weeks before, yet he chose to ignore their welfare needs to go shopping on one of the hottest days of the year.</seg>
<seg id="16">""Porter also changed his story saying that his dogs had been left for only 20 minutes to actually having been left for over an hour and a half.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are pleased Porter has received a ban on keeping animals as, in our opinion, he is unfit to provide proper care.</seg>
<seg id="18">Both dogs will now be found a loving new home.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rose plays through the pain, gives Bulls last-gasp win over Knicks</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget about the neck stiffness that almost postponed Derrick Rose's homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget about all those missed shots, too.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rose made the only play that mattered Thursday night, and it was just like old times for the Chicago Bulls.</seg>
<seg id="5">Rose connected on a baseline floater with 5.7 seconds left to lift Chicago to an 82-81 victory over the New York Knicks in his first home game since he injured his left knee 18 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">"That's what builds your resume," Rose said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leaves a mark on your legacy.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 2011 NBA MVP had 18 points on 7-of-23 shooting and committed four turnovers.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there was no doubt who was getting the ball after Tyson Chandler went 1 for 2 at the line to give New York an 81-80 lead with 10.8 seconds remaining.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rose, who was a game-time decision for Chicago's home opener due to an achy neck, got the ball on the wing, drove to the baseline and lofted a well-placed floater over the 7-foot Chandler and Raymond Felton for the go-ahead basket, drawing a standing ovation from the delirious crowd of 22,022.</seg>
<seg id="11">I was right there.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He just made a big-time play," Chandler said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I don't know if he saw the basket to be honest with you.</seg>
<seg id="14">New York had one last chance but Carmelo Anthony missed a long jumper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Anthony then stood with his hands on his hips as the Bulls celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I got the look I wanted," Anthony said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Chicago had just two field goals in the final period - both by Rose - and committed six turnovers in the last 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it still managed to equal a franchise record with its sixth consecutive win in home openers.</seg>
<seg id="19">Luol Deng had 17 points and Carlos Boozer finished with 14 as the Bulls beat the Knicks for the sixth straight time.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It's tough when you go into a game and you don't know who you have," coach Tom Thibodeau said.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's all part of it.</seg>
<seg id="22">It's the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="23">As long as we are putting everything into each and every day and strive for improvement, it will work out.</seg>
<seg id="24">New York coach Mike Woodson opted for a bigger look against Chicago, inserting 7-foot Andrea Bargnani into the starting lineup and using guard Pablo Prigioni as a reserve.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the Bulls still enjoyed a 46-24 advantage in points in the paint and a 48-42 rebounding edge, led by Joakim Noah's 15 boards.</seg>
<seg id="26">We competed tonight.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It says a lot for our club," Woodson said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now I just need to do a better job getting us through down the stretch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Amar'e Stoudemire made his season debut for the Knicks and had five points in 11 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="30">The power forward, who turns 31 on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="31">16, is coming off minor knee surgery over the summer and looked as if the years of health problems had robbed him of much of his athleticism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Very pleased with how I felt tonight, as far as my body," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Just going to continue to keep building and keep getting better.</seg>
<seg id="34">New York trailed 76-66 with 7:53 remaining, but rookie Tim Hardaway Jr. made a 3-pointer to spark a 12-0 run for the Knicks.</seg>
<seg id="35">Felton connected from long range, Iman Shumpert had a dunk and Anthony closed out the spurt with a turnaround jumper that put New York in front with 4:10 remaining.</seg>
<seg id="36">The last part of the game mostly consisted of turnovers and missed shots, but Chicago managed to survive behind Rose.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He showed a lot of toughness," Thibodeau said.</seg>
<seg id="38">It was a struggle early on in the game.</seg>
<seg id="39">He found his way at the start of the third, that got him a little lift.</seg>
<seg id="40">Jimmy Butler finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds for Chicago, which lost 107-95 at NBA champion Miami in its season opener on Tuesday night.</seg>
<seg id="41">Anthony led New York with 22 points on 8-of-24 shooting.</seg>
<seg id="42">Chandler had 19 rebounds, but the Knicks were unable to open the season with consecutive victories on consecutive nights.</seg>
<seg id="43">They were coming off a 90-83 victory against Milwaukee on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="44">Wearing strips of black tape on either side of his achy neck, Rose received a thunderous ovation from the sellout crowd when he was the last player introduced during the pregame festivities.</seg>
<seg id="45">He showed no outward emotion as he ran out of the tunnel with fans waving glowing red sticks in celebration of the return of the Chicago native.</seg>
<seg id="46">After Rose got on the court, chants of "M-V-P!"</seg>
<seg id="47">"M-V-P!" rang out from the seats at the United Center.</seg>
<seg id="48">It was Rose's first real game at the Bulls" longtime home since he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in the first game of the 2012 playoffs against Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="49">What followed was a long and arduous rehabilitation process that raised questions about Rose's toughness when he was unable to return last season.</seg>
<seg id="50">That whole "Will he or won't he play" episode was long forgotten when he took the court against the Knicks, taking a quick moment to blow a kiss toward the luxury boxes before tipoff.</seg>
<seg id="51">The speedy point guard was just 2 for 11 from the field in the first half, but Deng had 12 points to help Chicago to a 43-38 lead at the break.</seg>
<seg id="52">"I'm not going to continue missing shots that I'm missing," Rose said, pointing to what he thinks will be even better days ahead.</seg>
<seg id="53">I work too hard.</seg>
<seg id="54">Notes: Chicago improved to 27-21 in home openers, including a 12-8 record at the United Center. ...</seg>
<seg id="55">Hardaway provided a spark as a reserve, finishing with 10 points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.</seg>
<seg id="6">We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."</seg>
<seg id="12">Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.</seg>
<seg id="14">Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.</seg>

<seg id="1">Norwegian Vikings purchased silk from Persia</seg>
<seg id="2">1, 2013 - The Norwegian Vikings were more oriented towards the East than we have previously assumed, says Marianne Vedeler, Associate Professor at the Museum of Cultural History, University of Oslo in Norway.</seg>
<seg id="3">After four years of in-depth investigation of the silk trade of the Viking Age, she may change our perceptions of the history of the Norwegian Vikings.</seg>
<seg id="4">The silk trade was far more comprehensive than we have hitherto assumed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Norwegian Vikings maintained trade connections with Persia and the Byzantine Empire.</seg>
<seg id="6">A network of traders from a variety of places and cultures brought the silk to the Nordic countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her details are presented in the book "Silk for the Vikings," to be published by Oxbow publishers this winter, but in this article you can glimpse some of her key findings.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the Oseberg ship, which was excavated nearly a hundred years ago, more than one hundred small silk fragments were found.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the oldest find of Viking Age silk in Norway.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the time when the Oseberg silk was discovered, nobody conceived that it could have been imported from Persia.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was generally believed that most of it had been looted from churches and monasteries in England and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lots of Viking silk</seg>
<seg id="13">Since the Oseberg excavation, silk from the Viking Age has been found in several locations in the Nordic countries.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last finding was made two years ago at Ness in Hamarøy municipality, Nordland county.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other Norwegian findings of silk from the Viking Age include Gokstad in Vestfold county, Sandanger in the Sunnmøre district and Nedre Haugen in Østfold county.</seg>
<seg id="16">The highest number of burial sites containing silk from the Viking Age have been found at Birka in the Uppland region, a few miles west of Stockholm.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Even though Birka has the highest number of burial sites containing silk, there are no other places where so much and such varied silk has been found in a single burial site as in Oseberg," says Marianne Vedeler to the research magazine Apollon.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Oseberg alone, silk from fifteen different textiles, as well as embroideries and tablet-woven silk and wool bands were discovered.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many of the silk pieces had been cut into thin strips and used for articles of clothing.</seg>
<seg id="20">The textiles had been imported, while the tablet-woven bands most likely were made locally from imported silk thread.</seg>
<seg id="21">Marianne Vedeler has collected information on silk and its trade in the Nordic countries.</seg>
<seg id="22">She has also studied manuscripts on silk production and trade along the Russian rivers as well as in Byzantium and Persia.</seg>
<seg id="23">When seeing it all in its totality, it's more logical to assume that most of the silk was purchased in the East, rather than being looted from the British Isles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Waterways</seg>
<seg id="25">Vedeler believes that in the Viking Age, silk was imported from two main areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">One was Byzantium, meaning in and around Constantinople, or Miklagard, which was the Vikings' name for present-day Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="27">The other large core area was Persia.</seg>
<seg id="28">The silk may have been brought northwards along different routes.</seg>
<seg id="29">One possibility is from the South through Central Europe and onwards to Norway, but I believe that most of the silk came by way of the Russian rivers Dnepr and Volga.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Dnepr was the main route to Constantinople, while the Volga leads to the Caspian Sea.</seg>
<seg id="31">The river trade routes were extremely dangerous and difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of the sources describes the laborious journey along the Dnepr to Constantinople:</seg>
<seg id="33">A band of traders joined up in Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="34">Along the river they were attacked by dangerous tribesmen.</seg>
<seg id="35">They needed to pass through rapids and cataracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then, slaves had to carry their boat.</seg>
<seg id="37">Persian patterns</seg>
<seg id="38">On the basis of the silk that has been found, there are indications that more silk came to Norway from Persia than from Constantinople.</seg>
<seg id="39">Large amounts of the Oseberg silk have patterns from the Persian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="40">This silk is woven using a technique called samitum, a sophisticated Oriental weaving method.</seg>
<seg id="41">Many of the silk motifs can be linked to religious motifs from Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="42">Another pattern depicts a shahrokh, a bird that has a very specific meaning in Persian mythology; it represents a royal blessing.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the Persian myth, the shahrokh bird is the messenger that brings the blessing to a selected prince.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a dream, the bird visits the prince holding a tiara, a tall head adornment, in its beak.</seg>
<seg id="45">The prince then wakes up and knows that he is the chosen one.</seg>
<seg id="46">The image of the imperial bird was popular not only in silk weaving, but also in other art forms in Persia.</seg>
<seg id="47">The motif gained widespread popularity in Persian art.</seg>
<seg id="48">It's an amusing paradox that silk textiles with such religious and mythological images were highly prized and used in heathen burial sites in the Nordic countries as well as in European churches.</seg>
<seg id="49">Exclusive</seg>
<seg id="50">In the Orient, silk was essential for symbolizing power and strength.</seg>
<seg id="51">There was an entire hierarchy of different silk qualities and patterns reserved for civil servants and royalty.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even though silk was a prominent status symbol for the Vikings, they failed to get their hands on the best silk.</seg>
<seg id="53">Most likely, the bulk of the silk imported to Scandinavia was of medium or below-medium quality.</seg>
<seg id="54">In Byzantium, major restrictions were imposed on the sale of silk to foreign lands.</seg>
<seg id="55">The punishment for illegal sale of silk was draconian.</seg>
<seg id="56">The Persian lands also imposed strict restrictions on the sale and production of silk.</seg>
<seg id="57">In Byzantium, it was illegal to buy more silk than what could be bought for the price of a horse.</seg>
<seg id="58">A foreign trader was allowed to buy silk for ten numismata, while the price of a horse was twelve numismata.</seg>
<seg id="59">However, several trade agreements that have been preserved show that traders from the North nevertheless had special trade privileges in Byzantium.</seg>
<seg id="60">Silk was not only a trade commodity.</seg>
<seg id="61">Certain types of silk were reserved for diplomatic gifts to foreign countries, as described in Byzantine as well as Persian sources.</seg>
<seg id="62">In Europe, silk became especially popular for wrapping sacred relics in churches.</seg>
<seg id="63">Some of the silk found in Norway may be gifts or spoils of war, but archaeological as well as written sources indicate that silk was traded in the Nordic countries.</seg>
<seg id="64">We may safely assume that the Vikings engaged in trade, plunder, exchange of gifts and diplomatic relations in equal measure.</seg>
<seg id="65">A possible example of loot found in the Oseberg ship is a piece of silk with an image of a cross.</seg>
<seg id="66">This was long before the introduction of Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="67">The silk piece may have been sewn locally, but it is also highly likely that it was purloined from an Irish church.</seg>
<seg id="68">Possibly China</seg>
<seg id="69">At Gokstad, thin strips of hammered gold wrapped around silk threads were among the findings.</seg>
<seg id="70">These threads are highly exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="71">"We do not know their origin, but we suspect that they may have come from even further east, in the direction of China," says Vedeler, who will now travel to China to find out more.</seg>
<seg id="72">As yet, Vedeler must draw conclusions regarding the origin of the silk by investigating weaving technologies and patterns.</seg>
<seg id="73">With time, she wishes to make use of a new method which is being developed at the University of Copenhagen and which will be able to reveal the geographic origin of artefacts.</seg>

<seg id="9">San Diego (CNN) -- Introducing a new word: "cultuphobia."</seg>
<seg id="10">It means the fear that another person's culture is taking over your own.</seg>
<seg id="11">The word may be new, but the concept is ancient.</seg>
<seg id="12">America is a land of immigrants that has, in truth, never liked immigrants -- no matter where they came from and whether they came with the proper documents or a letter of reference from the Queen of England.</seg>
<seg id="13">Part of the reason that we don't like immigrants is because they frighten us.</seg>
<seg id="14">And one way in which they frighten us is because we worry that -- with the changes they bring -- they'll wind up marginalizing us and making us less important and less relevant.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ruben Navarrette Jr.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a name for that fear: cultuphobia.</seg>
<seg id="17">For an example, look at what happened this week to mark the launch of the new English-language, Latino-targeted television network Fusion, founded by ABC and Univision.</seg>
<seg id="18">The parent companies came up with what they thought was the cute idea of swapping anchors on their top-rated morning shows.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Spanish-language show, "Despierta America," which is based in Miami, sent hosts Raul Gonzalez and Karla Martinez to New York for some early morning chitchat with George Stephanopoulos and Robin Roberts, the hosts of "Good Morning America."</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, GMA sent Lara Spencer and Sam Champion to Miami to visit with the "Despierta America" crew.</seg>
<seg id="21">Come to think of it, this was a pretty good idea.</seg>
<seg id="22">And no one seemed to enjoy it more than the hosts who switched places.</seg>
<seg id="23">In New York, Gonzalez and Martinez were on the "Good Morning America" set on the same day as Enrique Iglesias, who sang a new song.</seg>
<seg id="24">Everyone seemed comfortable with one another, and there was a lot of laughing and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Miami, Spencer told The Huffington Post that she "had no idea how much fun it was" to be on Spanish-language television and implored producers to "please have me back."</seg>
<seg id="26">Champion proclaimed that he loved the experience and didn't want to go back to New York.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I'm staying," he told the website.</seg>
<seg id="28">More laughing and dancing, this time to mariachi music.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is no wonder that it all went so well, proclaimed Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez, who was also a guest on "Despierta America" that day.</seg>
<seg id="30">His hit movie "Instructions Not Included" is in limited release in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="31">After all, these days, the language barrier is just a puddle jump and, he said, among Latinos in the U.S., "everyone speaks both English and Spanish."</seg>
<seg id="32">Here is where the story gets interesting.</seg>
<seg id="33">Judging from the reaction on the "Good Morning America" page on Facebook and the comment section following news stories about the switch, many regular viewers of "Good Morning America" did not appreciate the gimmick.</seg>
<seg id="34">In fact, many of them were furious.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some said they changed the channel.</seg>
<seg id="36">Others vowed to never watch the show again if there is a repeat performance.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This had better be a one-time thing," wrote one disgruntled viewer.</seg>
<seg id="38">One woman complained that, when she tunes in to her favorite morning news show, she expects to get what she always gets -- the news of the day "in ENGLISH."</seg>
<seg id="39">There's the giveaway.</seg>
<seg id="40">For many of those angry "Good Morning America" viewers, it might just have been a case of them preferring to stick with what they like.</seg>
<seg id="41">But for others, it was a case of cultuphobia.</seg>
<seg id="42">These viewers aren't just protecting their favorite show, but -- as they probably see it -- their language, culture and civilization.</seg>
<seg id="43">This is the other side to cultural marketing, and it's ugly.</seg>
<seg id="44">A corporation -- or in this case, a media company such as ABC -- might vie for a larger market share by going after a new set of viewers and alienate its core audience members, who feel slighted, ignored or insulted.</seg>
<seg id="45">When that happens, the core isn't quiet.</seg>
<seg id="46">The core speaks up.</seg>
<seg id="47">Maybe next time, the company decides it isn't worth it.</seg>
<seg id="48">I hope that doesn't happen here.</seg>
<seg id="49">I hope ABC will stand its ground and continue down this road of trying to reach Latino viewers.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still, I'm not sure how Fusion will perform in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="51">I have concerns, and I'm not alone.</seg>
<seg id="52">While the new network is marketed to younger viewers who speak English, it doesn't seem that they've thought deeply about how to reach their viewers.</seg>
<seg id="53">That's not an easy demographic group to tap into, for either marketers or media.</seg>
<seg id="54">Plus, Fusion would be better off not becoming simply an English-language, hipper version of Univision, where -- as I would put it -- the anchors are white and the politics are blue.</seg>
<seg id="55">The liberal Spanish-language network is all about advocacy journalism and protecting what it sees as the interests of Latino immigrants -- especially the undocumented.</seg>
<seg id="56">Yet, on most of its telenovelas, which are produced in Mexico, the lead actress is European-looking with light skin.</seg>
<seg id="57">So, at Univision, they seem to believe that dark-skinned immigrants should have the full pallet of rights -- except, apparently, the right to appear in a starring role on Spanish-language television.</seg>
<seg id="58">That's evidence of a different kind of phobia, and a depressing reminder that -- in either language, and either of side of the border -- people are the same, and prejudice is alive and well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australian woman appeals Thai jail time</seg>
<seg id="2">A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image, leading to an acquittal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Market steadies after surge by big banks</seg>
<seg id="2">These are the percentage moves in the 10 sectors that make up the S&P/ASX 200 Index.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Australian sharemarket has closed slightly higher for the week, after shedding some of its gains following stellar earnings performances by two of the big four banks.</seg>
<seg id="4">The S&P/ASX200 Index rose 0.5 per cent for the week to close at 5411.1 points.</seg>
<seg id="5">The broader All Ordinaries Index closed up 0.39 per cent for the week to 5406.5.</seg>
<seg id="6">The local sharemarket had been recording five-year highs in October, as the Fed confirmed market expectations this week that it would continue its $US85 billion-a-month ($89.5 billion) bond-buying program at the same pace as it waited for a sustained recovery in the US economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Source: Bloomberg.</seg>
<seg id="8">It lost some ground as investors took profits after shares in three of the four banks - Commonwealth, ANZ and Westpac - pushed to all-time highs.</seg>
<seg id="9">The National Australia Bank reported a $5.94 billion profit on Thursday, while ANZ delivered a record cash profit of $6.49 billion in the year to September.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You have to look at it in the context of where the market has come from over the last month," said JBWere executive director Mike Kendall of the market's modest increase for the week.</seg>
<seg id="11">The market's moved incredibly fast and an incredibly long way.</seg>
<seg id="12">So it's going to need more fuel in the tank to keep pushing further along without it having a bit of a rest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Apart from the banks' results, the market mulled over a report suggesting that Zurich Insurance was in talks to buy Wesfarmers' insurance business.</seg>
<seg id="14">A request by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for banks to limit their dividend payouts to investors to meet new rules on capital buffers also fed into market sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="15">Patersons Securities strategist Tony Farnham said Australian banks were well capitalised and there should not be too much concern about the APRA request.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Our banks are well-progressed towards satisfying the Basel III requirements that have to be in place by the start of 2016," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if APRA amped it up again and add another amount of extra capital required, I believe the banks are going to be generating enough capital internally to satisfy those requirements, particularly in an environment of low credit growth.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Friday, the big miners continued to lose ground, despite a bigger than expected rise in Chinese manufacturing activity.</seg>
<seg id="19">BHP Billiton dropped 13¢ to $37.53, Rio Tinto lost 45¢ to $63.54 and Fortescue was 5¢ weaker at $5.16.</seg>
<seg id="20">David Jones was one of the best performers among the top 200 companies, adding 18¢, or 6.6 per cent, to $2.90 after quarterly sales rose 2.1 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="21">Macquarie Group added $2.15, or 4.2 per cent, to $53.10 after its half-year profit rose by nearly 40 per cent to $501 million and its dividend was increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">Next week Westpac will report its full-year results for 2013, with the bank forecast to record earnings of more than $7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall</seg>
<seg id="2">Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.</seg>
<seg id="5">Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
<seg id="12">But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.</seg>
<seg id="15">Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.</seg>
<seg id="19">That will happen all through the flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15," said Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="25">Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.</seg>
<seg id="30">The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="35">The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law</seg>
<seg id="2">"It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government "a stranglehold over the media," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "dealt a major blow" and lambasted the bill as "draconian."</seg>
<seg id="7">The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.</seg>
<seg id="10">Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."</seg>
<seg id="13">It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."</seg>
<seg id="14">By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.</seg>
<seg id="18">In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Canada panel says revised Taseko mine plan may harm environment</seg>
<seg id="2">By Nicole Mordant</seg>
<seg id="3">Fri Nov 1, 2013 2:31am EDT</seg>
<seg id="4">(Reuters) - A revised mine plan for Taseko Mines' New Prosperity copper-gold project in British Columbia still poses significant threats to the environment and nearby communities, a Canadian federal review panel said late on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Water quality in a trout-bearing lake beside the proposed mine, fish in the lake, land and resources used for traditional purposes by certain Aboriginal groups, and their cultural heritage would be most at risk from the project, the panel said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The grizzly bear population in south-central British Columbia will also suffer unless mitigation steps are taken, the three members of the panel said in their 323-page report.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Fish in Fish Lake and wetland and riparian ecosystems near Fish Lake and Wasp Lake might not meet the needs of future generations," said the panel, set up by Canada's environment minister in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="8">The panel is not a decision-making body but its report will play a key role in the final decision by Canada's environment minister on whether the project should go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Canadian government is expected to decide whether the open pit mine can go ahead within 120 days, meaning a decision is likely by the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="10">Taseko could not immediately be reached for comment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ottawa in 2010 overruled British Columbia's provincial government and blocked the development of the Taseko project because of worries over its environmental impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">Taseko has said the revised plan addresses regulators' concerns.</seg>
<seg id="13">But aboriginal groups and other opponents of the project say the revised proposal, if approved, would still harm Fish Lake and the rights of indigenous groups in the area.</seg>
<seg id="14">Taseko, a mid-sized copper producer, expects the project to create close to 2,000 jobs and generate more than $1 billion in government revenue, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Taseko submitted its environmental impact statement to the panel in 2012, and public hearings on the project were held this year.</seg>
<seg id="16">The panel made several recommendations if the project does get approved, among them urging Taseko to re-route a transmission line to avoid areas of cultural significance to an Aboriginal group.</seg>
<seg id="17">CIBC analyst Tom Meyer estimates the development of New Prosperity could cost C$1.8 billion ($1.72 billion) and a mine could produce 44,000 tonnes of copper as well as 206,100 ounces of gold a year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax on foreign property owners to burst London's bubble</seg>
<seg id="2">The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Cook said: "Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system."</seg>
<seg id="5">"But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning "domestic market" with the city's south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills.</seg>

<seg id="1">Automakers Post Double-Digit U.S. Sales Gains</seg>
<seg id="2">DETROIT - The 16-day U.S. government shutdown in early October appeared to dampen consumers' appetite for new cars, as five of six automakers reporting monthly sales early on Friday missed analysts' expectations.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. October auto sales for the three Detroit-based automakers rose by double digits from a year earlier, but only General Motors Co beat expectations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Analysts had forecast stronger performances from Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Group LLC, as well as from Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Volkswagen AG.</seg>
<seg id="5">GM said October sales climbed nearly 16 percent to 226,402 vehicles from 195,764 a year ago, with all four GM brands reporting year-to-year increases, led by Buick, up 31 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, expected GM sales of 211,563.</seg>
<seg id="7">October sales dipped to an annual rate of 15.3 million units, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, compared with expectations of 15.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The continued weakness ... was primarily driven by the government shutdown impacting consumer sentiment through the first half of the month," he said in a briefing note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="9">Results at Ford and Chrysler narrowly missed analysts' expectations, as did those at Toyota and Nissan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ford said October U.S. sales increased 14 percent to 191,985 vehicles, from 168,456 a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ford and Lincoln brand sales both rose during the month.</seg>
<seg id="12">Analysts expected 194,301.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chrysler reported October sales of 140,083, up 11 percent from 126,185 a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Analysts expected 143,536.</seg>
<seg id="15">Toyota sales rose 8.8 percent to 168,976 vehicles, while Nissan was up 14.2 percent to 91,018.</seg>
<seg id="16">Analysts expected 176,815 at Toyota and 93,632 at Nissan.</seg>
<seg id="17">GM shares were up 1.5 percent at $37.50 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Ford shares were down 1.1 percent at $16.93.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sales of full-size pickups, buoyed by a steady housing market and lower gasoline prices, continued to show strength in October, although their torrid year-long pace slowed a bit.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ford's F-series was up 13 percent for the month and up 20 percent for the year to date, while Chrysler's Ram was up 18 percent for the month and 23 percent for the year to date.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Chevrolet Silverado was up 10 percent for the month and 20 percent for the year.</seg>
<seg id="21">Average transaction prices for all full-size trucks in October jumped more than 5 percentage points from a year ago, to $39,189, according to Kelley Blue Book.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The truck segment will remain hotly contested through the rest of this year," said analyst Alec Gutierrez of Kelley Blue Book, with GM spending less than Ford and Chrysler to promote its Silverado and Sierra.</seg>
<seg id="23">Volkswagen AG's U.S. subsidiary said VW brand sales fell 18 percent to 28,129 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The German automaker's upscale Audi brand reported record sales of 13,001, up 11 percent, with Porsche boosting sales 11 percent to 3,562.</seg>
<seg id="25">Group sales of 44,692 were down 9 percent from a year ago, missing analysts' expectations of 48,654.</seg>
<seg id="26">VW's U.S. chief, Jonathan Browning, said, "The first half of the month (was) very slow in terms of overall traffic and consumer activity."</seg>
<seg id="27">He said the government shutdown had a broader impact on "consumer confidence in general."</seg>
<seg id="28">Hyundai Motor Co said its U.S. sales climbed 7 percent to 53,555 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Fuji Heavy Industries' Subaru said sales jumped 32 percent to 34,483.</seg>
<seg id="30">Consumer demand for electrified vehicles remain mixed.</seg>
<seg id="31">October sales of GM's Chevrolet Volt dropped 32 percent to 2,022, while Nissan Leaf climbed 27 percent to 2,002.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former Sydney Roosters players Martin Kennedy and Tom Symonds quizzed by ASADA</seg>
<seg id="2">The Sydney Roosters were crowned the 2013 Premiers after they set the standard for the competition with a miserly defence, dominant halves pairing and a brilliant season from star Kiwi Sonny Bill Williams.</seg>
<seg id="3">MARTIN Kennedy and Tom Symonds have become the latest NRL players to be interviewed by ASADA, with the pair meeting investigators last week to discuss their relationship with a central figure in the probe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Six weeks after interviews with the initial 31 players wrapped-up, the former Roosters teammates held separate meetings with ASADA officials after the NRL grand final.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both Kennedy and Symonds are well known to Ben Darcy, who emerged as a key person of interest during the investigation of Sandor Earl, who admitted to the use and trafficking of peptide CJC-1295.</seg>
<seg id="6">Symonds shared a Bondi unit with Darcy for most of the year, while Kennedy lived in the same apartment complex before recently moving elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kennedy, Darcy and Earl are long-time friends.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ben Darcy, left, with former Roosters player Tom Symonds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Symonds is a Roosters junior, but made a switch to Manly earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kennedy is moving to Brisbane next season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It emerged this month that blood tests showing elevated hormone levels for three players had been intercepted from a phone belonging to a man with links to organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="12">The man is also a close friend of Darcy's.</seg>
<seg id="13">Photographs of the blood tests were taken from the files of personal trainer Sean Carolan, who was hired by the Roosters to provide nutritional advice late last year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Martin Kennedy on the charge for the Roosters.</seg>
<seg id="15">Darcy was working for Carolan at the time.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kennedy and Earl convinced Carolan to employ their friend, who was experiencing personal difficulties 12 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kennedy also introduced Carolan to the Roosters after he, Symonds and Earl had spent time training with the former boxer at a CBD Fitness First.</seg>
<seg id="18">Carolan maintains he took the blood tests with the knowledge of Roosters coaching staff, but club doctor John Orchard complained because he was not consulted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deaths from prostate cancer fall by 20% in 20 years thanks to better treatment</seg>
<seg id="2">By Sophie Borland</seg>
<seg id="3">The percentage of men dying from prostate cancer has fallen by a fifth in 20 years thanks to better treatment, figures show.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are now just 24 deaths per 100,000 down from 30 per 100,000 in the early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts credit the reduction on the availability of more effective drugs as well as advances in surgery and radiotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prostate cancer is by far the most common form of the disease in men and there are 41,000 new cases in Britain every year</seg>
<seg id="7">But campaigners say the death rates remain far too high and claim there are still too few treatment options for men.</seg>
<seg id="8">Prostate cancer is by far the most common form of the disease in men and there are 41,000 new cases in Britain every year and there are 10,700 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="9">But figures from Cancer Research UK also show the survival rates have substantially improved and 7 in 10 will live for at least ten years compared to just 2 in 10 in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="10">Researchers credit the reduction on improved drugs ¿ particularly those which use hormones to attack tumours</seg>
<seg id="11">Professor Malcolm Mason, Cancer Research UK's prostate cancer expert based at Cardiff University, said: "We've come a long way in improving the treatment of prostate cancer in the last couple of decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">And improvements in how we treat prostate cancer have been key to reducing deaths from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">But a lot more work still needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="14">Researchers credit the reduction on improved drugs - particularly those which use hormones to attack tumours such as abiraterone.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also say it is down to more radical surgery techniques which have enabled previously inoperable tumours to be removed as well as radiation therapy.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, more doctors now make use of the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test which measures levels of a protein which is normally higher when cancer is present.</seg>
<seg id="17">It can be misleading however and has led to thousands of men having unnecessary treatment for tumours which would never have caused them any harm - often resulting in long term side effects such as incontinence and impotence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scientists are currently trying to develop a more accurate blood test which can pinpoint exactly which tumours are harmful.</seg>
<seg id="19">Charities pointed out that although men's chances of beating prostate cancer had improved, the overall number of deaths had increased because there are now many more cases.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rates of the disease have tripled in the last 40 years although this is largely due to better testing which is picking up tumours which previously would have gone undetected.</seg>
<seg id="21">Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK said: "While on the surface death rates from prostate cancer are falling this data shows that in real terms more men died of prostate cancer last year than they did twenty years ago."</seg>
<seg id="22">Although on average more men are surviving cancer for longer, 10,000 men still die each year of the disease - that's a shocking one man every hour.</seg>
<seg id="23">Men deserve much better.</seg>
<seg id="24">The raw truth is that there are simply too few options for men with advanced prostate cancer and even lifesaving treatments for less aggressive cancers can have life-changing side effects.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings powers back to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels" regulatory approach.</seg>

<seg id="1">EGYPT'S ex-president Hosni Mubarak is clinically dead, state news agency MENA said today.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier, the ousted leader was moved from prison to a military hospital after reports he suffered a stroke and his condition rapidly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Hosni Mubarak is clinically dead," the official MENA news agency reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said the 84-year-old Mubarak was moved by ambulance from the hospital in Torah Prison to nearby Maadi Hospital in southern Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state news agency said Mubarak's health rapidly deteriorated, with his heart stopping briefly, then suffering a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mubarak was sentenced to life in prison on June 2 for failing to stop the killing of protesters in last year's uprising that led to his ouster.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was transferred to prison after spending months in a military facility in detention.</seg>

<seg id="1">Premature birth rates hit 15-year low, but U.S. still lags behind</seg>
<seg id="2">Premature birth rates continue to fall in the United States, according to a new report from the March of Dimes, but the country still has more babies born too early than any other industrialized nation in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The nonprofit pregnancy organization's annual report card on premature, or preterm, births found the national rate dropped to 11.5 percent in 2012, a 15-year low, and the sixth consecutive year rates have fallen.</seg>
<seg id="4">But premature birth remains the leading cause of newborn death in the U.S., and children born too early face serious complications which could last a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="5">About 450,000 babies are born prematurely each year, which is defined as a birth at least three weeks before their expected due date.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last year's report put the national preterm rate at 11.7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The U.S. preterm birth rate peaked in 2006 at 12.8 percent after a steady two-decade rise.</seg>
<seg id="8">The March of Dimes estimates that about 176,000 fewer babies were born prematurely because of improvements to the birth rate since 2006, for a cost savings of about $9 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although we have made great progress in reducing our nation's preterm birth rate from historic highs, the U.S. still has the highest rate of preterm birth of any industrialized country.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We must continue to invest in preterm birth prevention because every baby deserves a healthy start in life," March of Dimes President Dr. Jennifer L. Howse said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="11">The organization's goal is a 9.6 percent premature birth rate by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the report card, researchers calculate rates of premature births and track states' individual progress in lowering those rates.</seg>
<seg id="13">This year, six states received an "A" grade for meeting the 9.6 percent goal: Alaska, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon and Vermont.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-one states saw improvements in their preterm birth rates compared to last year's report.</seg>
<seg id="15">Three states -- Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama -- and Puerto Rico received "F's."</seg>
<seg id="16">The full list of grades can be found on the March of Dimes website.</seg>
<seg id="17">Overall, the U.S. received a "C" grade from the nonprofit.</seg>
<seg id="18">Worldwide, about 15 million premature babies are born prematurely -- that's about 1 in 10 births.</seg>
<seg id="19">A Nov.</seg>
<seg id="20">2012 study from the March of Dimes and other groups including the World Health Organization, Save the Children and U.S. National Institutes of Health, found that five simple interventions could lower global preterm birth rates by an average of 5 percent:</seg>
<seg id="21">Nearly eliminating induced labors and C-sections scheduled ahead of due dates unless they're medically necessary</seg>
<seg id="22">Helping women quit smoking.</seg>
<seg id="23">Using just one embryo, not multiples, in vitro fertilization.</seg>
<seg id="24">Providing regular injections of the hormone progesterone to certain women at high risk, largely because of a prior preterm birth.</seg>
<seg id="25">Putting a stitch into the cervix of certain high-risk women, those who have what's called a short cervix.</seg>
<seg id="26">The new report touted progress from states at reducing contributing factors linked to premature births.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia reduced the number of uninsured women of childbearing age, while 35 states and the District reduced the number of women smokers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Risk factors for preterm birth include previously having a child born prematurely, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, mom's age (either under 17 or over 40), and pregnancies spaced too closely together.</seg>
<seg id="29">Babies born prematurely face short-term health risks for breathing problems, heart conditions, brain bleeding, problems with controlling body temperature, digestive issues, anemia, jaundice, problems with metabolism and increased risk for infection from a weaker immune system, the Mayo Clinic points out.</seg>
<seg id="30">Long-term, premature birth is linked to cerebral palsy, cognitive difficulties, behavioral and psychological problems, problems with hearing and vision and other chronic health issues.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police Say Pa.</seg>
<seg id="2">Teacher Raped Student in School</seg>
<seg id="3">A western Pennsylvania high school shop teacher raped a 16-year-old student at school last year, state police said, and their investigation into him continues because it began with a recent complaint from another student about unwanted attention from him.</seg>
<seg id="4">That complaint surfaced last week, and school officials and the police eventually learned that Todd McCullough, 28, of Kiski Township, raped a Saltsburg High School student in the spring of 2012, police said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the assault, McCullough allegedly made inappropriate comments to the girl, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"On one occasion, the accused told the victim that she was looking 'hot' and that his girlfriend was going to be away this weekend," police wrote in the criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another time, McCullough allegedly complimented the girl on her tan and asked to see her breasts.</seg>
<seg id="8">McCullough then took the girl to a closet area and exposed himself to her, only to apologize days later.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some days after that, McCullough had the girl taken out of another class and raped her in a private room of the shop class area of the school, police said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Police haven't listed a date for the rape but said the girl recalls it occurred about the time of last year's prom.</seg>
<seg id="11">McCullough doesn't have an attorney and declined to comment after his arraignment Thursday on rape and related charges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He remained in jail unable to post $150,000 bond pending a preliminary hearing Nov.</seg>
<seg id="13">The probe started with accusations that McCullough made inappropriate statements to another female student, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="14">That investigation eventually led to the rape charges, which the accuser had previously revealed only to a friend, police said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Troopers from the Indiana, Pa., barracks consider the investigation "intense and ongoing."</seg>
<seg id="16">"This could be the initial phase of a significant investigation, and we won't rule out the possibility of additional charges or additional victims," Trooper John Matchik, the barracks' spokesman, said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Blairsville-Saltsburg School District issued a statement saying officials are cooperating with the investigation and, while not naming McCullough, said an internal investigation suggests the employee has violated district policies and state laws.</seg>
<seg id="18">Saltsburg is about 30 miles east of Pittsburgh.</seg>

<seg id="1">"How I Met Your Mother" will be coming to a close in 2014 after nine successful seasons on CBS.</seg>
<seg id="2">But no network in its right mind is ever willing to walk away completely from a cash cow, so that would explain why Deadline reported Wednesday that a possible "HIMYM" spinoff is currently in development.</seg>
<seg id="3">The spinoff, from "HIMYM" creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, as well as "Up All Night" creator Emily Spivey, would reportedly follow a young woman and her completely new group of friends as she searches for Mr. Right.</seg>
<seg id="4">In fact, the only connection between the group viewers got to know through "HIMYM" and the new series, dubbed by fans as "How I Met Your Father," will reportedly be MacLaren's Pub, the place the gang hung out throughout the course of the series.</seg>
<seg id="5">With fans at long last about to get the conclusion to the story they were promised nine years ago, their reaction to the idea of a spinoff with a very similar concept was mixed at best.</seg>

<seg id="2">Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed.</seg>

<seg id="6">"He's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The post is hardly ever emptied on Sundays</seg>
<seg id="2">"Many citizens will not yet have noticed that red dots indicating a Sunday post collection are still to be found on many post boxes in the town centre and its districts. However, if you read the small print on the yellow boxes operated by Post AG, you will quickly find out that the boxes are no longer emptied on Sundays and holidays," announced the FDP.</seg>
<seg id="3">An inquiry by the FDP confirmed this.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only the post boxes in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and at Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld are still emptied.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether there are still Sunday collections in Hofheim and Rosengarten is not addressed in the inquiry by the FDP.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FDP spokesperson for social and youth-related affairs, Fritz Röhrenbeck wants to dig deeper into this.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Sunday collection is an important postal service, especially in the case of scheduled post.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The company is radically and unacceptably cutting back on this, despite the price increase for letters in January 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thomas Bittner, Liberal Party Parliamentary Group and Municipal Association Chairman, is supporting his fellow group members: "What annoys me, is the fact that the collection times have been changed or cancelled on the quiet here".</seg>
<seg id="10">In so doing, the postal service is miles off the mark when it comes to public accessibility.</seg>
<seg id="11">"At least the post boxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must still be emptied on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also the case for the town centre that those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box with a Sunday collection on foot.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the Town Parliament, Röhrenbeck asked whether the Town Council was planning discussions with the postal service regarding this matter.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mayor Erich Maier responded that the postal service had not communicated with Lampertheim.</seg>
<seg id="15">To the best of his knowledge, however, there is a Sunday collection in Hofheim.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Decisions will then be made elsewhere," said Maier.</seg>

<seg id="1">CDC publishes new National School Food Allergy Guidelines</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- U.S. health officials urge schools to adopt food allergy guidelines as published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect students.</seg>
<seg id="3">John L. Lehr, chief executive officer of Food Allergy Research & Education, said his agency collaborated along with other groups on the development of the guidelines -- the first document of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="4">The voluntary guidelines are intended to support the implementation of school food allergy management policies in schools and early childhood programs and guide improvements to existing practices.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We strive to ensure that students with food allergies are both safe and included at school," Lehr said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">We strongly encourage schools to adopt these new guidelines, or to examine their existing plans to make improvements in line with the CDC's new recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Implementing these guidelines may help schools reduce allergic reactions, improve response to life-threatening reactions and ensure current policies are in line with laws that protect children with serious health issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">The guidelines' recommendations include:</seg>
<seg id="9">Avoiding the use of identified food allergens in class projects, parties, holidays and celebrations, arts, crafts, science experiments, cooking, snacks or rewards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Training transportation staff on how to respond to food allergy emergencies; having rapid access to epinephrine auto-injectors in case of anaphylaxis, and training staff on how to use an epinephrine auto-injector.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ensuring children with food allergies are not excluded from field trips, events or extracurricular activities, as well as physical education or recess activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using non-food incentives for prizes, gifts and awards.</seg>
<seg id="13">Designating allergen-safe zones, such as an individual classroom or eating area in the cafeteria, or designating food-free zones, such as a library, classroom, or buses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Georgia teen who died in 'freak accident' believe son was murdered</seg>
<seg id="2">The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They absolutely think their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.</seg>
<seg id="8">They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="11">What was the cause of death?</seg>
<seg id="12">Was his death the result of a crime?</seg>
<seg id="13">Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will follow the facts wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="15">My objective is to discovery the truth.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists" for a formal investigation, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."</seg>
<seg id="18">A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.</seg>
<seg id="21">A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="22">A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The teenager's parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died.</seg>

<seg id="1">AFG Media dresses up tech</seg>
<seg id="2">©Paul Clarke</seg>
<seg id="3">AFG has turned selfmockery into a global brand</seg>
<seg id="4">The question AFG Media, a four-year-old British costume maker, wants you to ask yourself the day after Halloween is: Why didn't I dress up as a monster clown in head-to-toe, skin-tight spandex?</seg>
<seg id="5">The clown outfit was the Edinburgh-based company's most popular design this season out of its range of flesh-hugging, face-encasing "morphsuits," which includes an evil surgeon, an elf and a crash-test dummy.</seg>
<seg id="6">AFG has taken a quintessentially British quality - self-mockery - and turned it into a global brand that thrives on an American tradition.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also branching out into a novel form of wearable technology - some of its latest costumes have slots for smartphones, so wearers could use an app made by AFG to stream animations simulating gruesome special effects, such as a beating heart gaping from a hole in the chest.</seg>
<seg id="8">IN Retail</seg>
<seg id="9">Including its roomier costumes and novelty T-shirts, the company gets about half of its £10.5m in annual revenue in the run-up to Halloween in September and October, says Gregor Lawson, marketing director and co-founder.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company got its start when the three founders threw in £1,000 each, sourcing high-quality suits from China with the help of Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company that is looking to go public.</seg>
<seg id="11">AFG's biggest markets are the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and Germany, where it sells through retailers and online.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the AFG's ambitions are much greater, according to Mr Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We want to revolutionise the costume industry," he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">It hopes to do this via expanding into wearable technology, a sector that will grow by 40 per cent between 2012 and 2018 to be worth $5.8bn, according to estimates from business intelligence company Transparency Market Research.</seg>
<seg id="15">By comparison, the fancy dress market in the UK is growing at a relatively sluggish 3 per cent annually, says David Pattison of market research company Plimsolls.</seg>
<seg id="16">In June, AFG bought Digital Dudz, a start-up founded by former Nasa engineer Mark Rober, who made the costume with slots for smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="17">AFG is in talks with Disney to launch a line of animation-enhanced T-shirts based on Marvel Comics superheroes such as Spiderman, and "ugly" Christmas sweaters featuring yuletide logs and a Santa face with roving eyes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The move into wearable technology could help the company expand its market beyond men between 16 and their late twenties, which make up 90 per cent of their customers, says Mr Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="19">And the origins of the name "morphsuit"?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is about how "people morph into a more fun version of their normal self while wearing it," Mr Lawson says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chrysler, Ford, GM post big October gains</seg>
<seg id="2">Chrysler, Ford, General Motors and Nissan all posted healthy October sales increases as the U.S. auto industry rebounded from a lackluster September.</seg>
<seg id="3">The gains signal that automakers made it through the 16-day partial government shutdown relatively unscathed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chrysler even predicted stronger industry sales for the month than most analysts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"After a choppy start to the beginning of the month, Chrysler Group sales accelerated in the second half of the month with renewed consumer confidence," Reid Bigland, the company's U.S. sales chief, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">All automakers report October sales on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. sales jumped 14 percent last month on strong demand for the F-Series pickup and the Fusion sedan.</seg>
<seg id="8">F-Series sales were up 13 percent to 63,803, its sixth-straight month of sales above 60,000.</seg>
<seg id="9">That hasn't happened since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sales of the Fusion midsize car jumped 71 percent over last October, when the old model was being phased out.</seg>
<seg id="11">But sales of Ford's small cars, the Focus and C-Max hybrid, fell around 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ford recently announced plans to idle the Michigan plant where both vehicles are made to cut down on excess inventory.</seg>
<seg id="13">At General Motors Co., sales rose 16 percent as its full-size pickup trucks rebounded from a poor showing in September.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chevy Silverado, GM's top-selling vehicle, posted a 10 percent increase to nearly 43,000, while the GMC Sierra pickup saw sales rise 13 percent to just over 16,500.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Chevy Impala large car posted a 40 percent increase, and Malibu midsize car sales rose nearly 64 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the Chevy Cruze compact, one of GM's biggest sellers, posted a 16 percent decline.</seg>
<seg id="17">Chrysler Group LLC said it sold 140,083 cars and trucks last month, up from 126,185 in October of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was the company's best October in six years, and its 43rd straight month of year-over-year sales gains.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chrysler was led by its two most profitable vehicles, the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV and the Ram pickup.</seg>
<seg id="20">Grand Cherokee sales were up 20 percent, while Ram pickup sales rose 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But sales of the tiny Fiat 500 dropped 36 percent as Chrysler offered a larger version and gas prices fell during the month.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company sold 579 new Jeep Cherokees in October.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sales of the small crossover SUV had been delayed as Chrysler smoothed out its rough-shifting transmission.</seg>
<seg id="24">Chrysler began shipping Cherokees on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nissan Motor Co. sales rose 14.2 percent to more than 91,000, an October record for the company.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nissan Division sales were up just over 15 percent, while the company's Infiniti luxury brand posted a 4.5 percent increase from a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of the automakers reporting so far, only Volkswagen posted a decline at 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="28">VW is up against strong growth from last year, but many of its models have faltered in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="29">Industry analysts predict an 8-to-13 percent sales gain for October, with sales running at an annual rate of about 15.4 million for the month.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Chrysler said its calculations show a 15.7 million annual rate, one that would make October the fourth-best month of the year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The increase follows a 4 percent drop in September because Labor Day weekend was counted in August figures this year.</seg>
<seg id="32">Analysts say the 16-day government shutdown in early October kept buyers out of showrooms early in the month, but that apparently was just a temporary slowdown.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It looks like the government shutdown ended just in the nick of time," said Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at the Edmunds.com auto website.</seg>
<seg id="34">Consumers started to get jittery by the middle of the month.</seg>
<seg id="35">But with the government back to work, most lost sales should be made up in the latter half of the month.</seg>
<seg id="36">Auto sales have consistently been a bright spot in the U.S. economy.</seg>
<seg id="37">Sales are closing in on pre-recession rates exceeding 16 million, far above the 2009 trough of 10.4 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Shell considering 2nd attempt to drill off Alaska's Arctic coast</seg>
<seg id="2">Shell Oil said Thursday that it would try - again - to drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska's Arctic coast, where last year ice and late permits forced its rigs to abandon the area without completing a well.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shell said it had not made a final decision about drilling next summer, but it said that it would file an updated exploration plan with the Interior Department in the next couple of weeks.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its new program will limit drilling to the Chukchi Sea and postpone plans to drill in the Beaufort Sea as well.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company said that it would lease Transocean's Polar Pioneer drilling rig as well as the Noble Discoverer rig it used earlier.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our decision to resume exploration will be driven by our readiness to do so safely, not by the need to meet arbitrary timelines," said Shell spokesman Curtis Smith.</seg>
<seg id="7">Shell's effort to drill in the Chukchi Sea is an expensive, long-running saga.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shell has spent several years and nearly $5 billion to buy leases, fight environmental groups in court and prepare to drill in an area about 70 miles off the Alaska coast.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the summer of 2012, however, Shell was thwarted by ice and trouble meeting permitting standards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, on its way to a warm water port, one of Shell's drill ships, the Kulluk, ran aground and later needed repairs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Just because they have a new piece of equipment, that's not evidence that they're going to have any fewer problems than they had in 2012," said Lois N. Epstein, the Arctic program director for the Wilderness Society.</seg>
<seg id="12">The environment is still very hazardous and risky.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shell also had trouble obtaining an air permit from the Environmental Protection Agency for the emissions from the drill ships.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shell paid $1.1 million in fines for air quality violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">But in 2012, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), a supporter of expanded drilling on federal lands and waters, attached a rider to the Interior appropriations bill that moved authority for the air permit to Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.</seg>
<seg id="16">A spokesman for Murkowski, Robert Dillon, said that Interior already had air permitting authority for offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and that Murkowski "felt DOI could do a better job without any loss of protection."</seg>

<seg id="1">M25 Closure Causes Severe Delays After Crash</seg>
<seg id="2">A lorry crash on the M25 is likely to cause rush hour chaos after the Highways Agency announced part of the motorway would be closed for most of the day.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police said there were severe delays on the northern part of the M25 after it was shut in both directions between junction 23 at South Mimms in Hertfordshire and junction 25 at the junction with the A10 north of Enfield in north London.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clockwise traffic caught immediately behind the crash has now been released, according to the Highways Agency.</seg>
<seg id="5">One person is in critical condition after the crash</seg>
<seg id="6">Motorists have been asked to consider alternative routes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police have arrested the lorry driver on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.</seg>
<seg id="8">He remains in custody at a police station in north London.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many drivers have taken to Twitter to express their frustration at the delays.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Thanks M25 - Nothing like spending 6 hours in traffic to round off your week," wrote David Hobson.</seg>
<seg id="11">Others were more upbeat about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="12">Aerial footage of the crash scene</seg>
<seg id="13">"M25 is shut in both directions this is the time where all the little rat runs you learn working in a van pay off," wrote Daniel Cooper.</seg>
<seg id="14">Four people were hurt when the lorry overturned around 9:30am, forcing police to close the carriageway while emergency services attended the scene.</seg>
<seg id="15">One man was taken to a hospital in Cambridgeshire by the Hertfordshire Ambulance Service, where he remains in a critical condition.</seg>

<seg id="2">Miley Cyrus seems to be the scariest monster out there this Halloween - at least if you're part of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="3">And you're not Miley Cyrus.</seg>
<seg id="4">The overly unleashed former tween pop star made her own mark on the holiday Wednesday by dressing as Lil Kim from the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, complete with a single purple pasty on her less-ample-than-Kim's left breast.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, of course, came after she tweeted obscene pumpkins carved to depict boy-on-girl and girl-on-girl sex acts to her millions of followers Wednesday (with the warning "xxxxxxplicit pornkinzzz #beware¿¿).</seg>
<seg id="6">And according to the New York Daily News, her male assistant got stuck wearing Miley's 2013 VMAs tongue-flashing teddy-bear onesie.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was simply no escape from the cult of Miley.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jenny McCarthy cut to the chase by dressing simply as Miley's tongue, tweeting a picture of the getup Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Yes indeed I am Miley's tongue," she wrote, then referred to the singer's "Wrecking Ball" video: "I craved sledgehammers all day."</seg>
<seg id="10">Joan Rivers, meanwhile, made her Miley even scarier than the real thing, showing up lumps and all as Miley-in-latex on E!'s "Fashion Police" Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="11">For Playboy's Halloween party over the weekend, Hugh Hefner and wife Crystal dressed up as Miley and Robin Thicke at the 2013 VMAs and snapped shots with Hef clad in Robin's "Beetlejuice"-style stripes and Crystal in a nude minidress, twerking him a la Miley.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same party, Paris Hilton donned a version of Miley's "before" costume from the VMAs - that devilish teddy-bear onesie.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, on Thursday, Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan brought the Cyrus-Thicke pairing 100% mainstream on "Live With Kelly and Michael."</seg>
<seg id="14">We think Strahan one-upped Hef with suit authenticity, as the Playboy honcho's duds clearly displayed a prison identification number.</seg>
<seg id="15">So remember tonight, if you're going out as Miley Cyrus, Hollywood has already been there, done that.</seg>

<seg id="1">MP Palmer to lay his interests bare</seg>
<seg id="2">Political News</seg>
<seg id="3">Wealthy businessman Clive Palmer will be forced to disclose a minefield of potential conflicts of interests in his role as a federal MP, with directorships of no fewer than 74 private companies involved in aviation, sport, mining, shipping, real estate and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="4">Concerns about the influence of Mr Palmer's interests on his political decisions were raised on Friday by Liberal National MP Wyatt Roy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Clive is an individual who is clearly pretty self-interested.</seg>
<seg id="6">I think there are pretty serious questions about that," Mr Roy said.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Fairfax Media investigation of Mr Palmer's wealth found his investments stretch from cane farms on the Sunshine Coast to coalfields in central Queensland, a Tahitian resort, prospecting operations in offshore gasfields, Chinese ship builders and Zeppelin airships.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past, the self-proclaimed billionaire has been circumspect about the source and nature of his wealth.</seg>
<seg id="9">But he will be required to submit a detailed list of his assets within 28 days of being asked to swear an oath of affirmation as a federal MP.</seg>
<seg id="10">Using company and property searches and statements from Mr Palmer and his companies, Fairfax has come up with a snapshot of a Palmer register.</seg>
<seg id="11">The assets will include substantial interests in mining and metal refining, which will bring into sharp focus his personal and party positions on the carbon and mining taxes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Roy, 23, said Mr Palmer should stop thinking of himself as a "novelty" act and model his parliamentary behaviour on that of former Australian Democrats leader Don Chipp.</seg>
<seg id="13">"His term in Parliament should be about the results he can deliver for his electorate," Mr Roy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Palmer responded: "Well poor old Wyatt's ... only a young boy that's never had a job."</seg>

<seg id="1">Gillard urges new goals to fight poverty</seg>
<seg id="2">PRIME Minister Julia Gillard has urged world leaders to set new goals to fight global poverty through green jobs, clean energy and a new global oceans' treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of more than 100 world leaders at the United Nations sustainable development conference in Rio de Janeiro, Ms Gillard delivered a seven-minute official address just after 8am (AEST) today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Given that the leaders had "already lowered other important ambitions," it made it all the more important that the summit sign off on a new agreement to put in place "sustainable development goals" (SDGs), the Prime Minister said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ms Gillard and the Australian delegation have pushed hard for the SDGs to replace the millennium development goals (MDGs), which were put in place to fight global poverty in 2000 and expire in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Prime Minister during the UN summit was appointed to co-chair a special task force to oversee the final years of the millennium goals and ensure all nations met their commitments.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everyone here knows that collective action is hard - and that global collective action can be even harder," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">(But) everyone here also knows that targets work ... (and) set the firmest possible basis for long-term success.</seg>
<seg id="9">Australia's aid budget is set to increase 60 per cent in the next five years, even though the Federal Budget delayed meeting its own MDG by one year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ms Gillard said Australia was "playing its part" in addressing climate change and creating green jobs by putting in place a price on carbon from July 1 and investing in renewable energy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Australia was also putting a new focus on the health of the oceans and managing the "blue economy" that they underpin, she said.</seg>
<seg id="12">She called for a "strong oceans governance convention" to be put in place and new marine protected areas to be established.</seg>
<seg id="13">We are not here this week just to talk to each other.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We're here to decide, to agree - and then to act," the Prime Minister said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The final day of the summit is expected to adopt a 50-page statement which includes a commitment to working on the detail of the new SDGs, which have the endorsement of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the second day of the summit, Ms Gillard addressed a breakfast function where she announced $33 million for action to protect fish stocks and conserve marine ecosystems, working with Asia-Pacific nations.</seg>
<seg id="17">She also addressed a UN women's forum, where she called inequality between men and women a "serious economic blindspot," worth an estimated $47 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ms Gillard, Australia's first female prime minister, lamented the fact that only 10 per cent of UN member nations are led by women, including two per cent of Pacific nations.</seg>

<seg id="4">SYDNEY ruckman Shane Mumford has been punished by the AFL club for an alcohol-related indiscretion in Melbourne.</seg>

<seg id="7">The 26-year-old has been fined, but will take his place in the Swans' side on Sunday when they host Brisbane at the SCG.</seg>
<seg id="8">Longmire did not reveal the exact nature of Mumford's misdemeanour, or his punishment, but acknowledged co-captains Jarrad McVeigh and Kieren Jack were called on to help deal with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We had an incident last week and we dealt with it internally a couple of days ago," Longmire said today.</seg>
<seg id="10">Going into a long week, Shane went to Melbourne and had a couple of drinks.</seg>
<seg id="11">We dealt with it with our captains and spoke to Shane about it and dealt with it under the players' code of conduct.</seg>

<seg id="14">It was disappointing from Shane's point of view and he acknowledged that.</seg>

<seg id="1">An Obama voter's cry of despair</seg>
<seg id="2">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
<seg id="3">He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism</seg>
<seg id="4">Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.</seg>
<seg id="11">The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.</seg>
<seg id="18">Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was simply nothing I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of "don't ask don't tell," to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.</seg>
<seg id="22">But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.</seg>
<seg id="23">I've reached a point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="27">It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is what troubles me most of all.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.</seg>

<seg id="1">Influenza vaccine during pregnancy safe for mother-to-be and baby</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- U.S. health officials recommend all pregnant women should be vaccinated against influenza, but only about a half are, researchers say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many mothers-to-be expressed concern if the vaccination would affect the baby, so researchers analyzed data from the flu seasons of 2009-12 involving about 1,100 mothers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Researchers from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Boston University, in collaboration with the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology found evidence of the H1N1 influenza vaccine's safety during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="5">The national study, which began shortly after the H1N1 influenza outbreak of 2009, found women who were vaccinated were no more likely to have a miscarriage and no more likely to have a baby with a birth defect than women who were not vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="6">Christina Chambers of the University of California, San Diego, said unvaccinated pregnant women were more likely to have more complications of influenza if they got sick, more likely to be hospitalized and even to die.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The overall results of the study were quite reassuring about the safety of the flu vaccine formulations that contained the pandemic H1N1 strain," Chambers said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe our study's results can help women and their doctors become better informed about the benefits and risks of flu vaccination during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The team from Boston University's Slone Epidemiology Center interviewed 4,191 mothers from four U.S. regional centers in the United States, who had either delivered a baby with one of 41 specific birth defects or delivered a normal infant.</seg>
<seg id="10">They compared the use of influenza vaccine in the two groups during the 2009-2011 flu seasons.</seg>
<seg id="11">The team also compared the risk of preterm delivery in vaccinated versus unvaccinated women.</seg>
<seg id="12">The study, published in the journal Vaccine, found overall, no significant evidence of an increased risk of any specific birth defects was noted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Star-struck on a Saharan road trip</seg>
<seg id="2">Dodging donkey-carts, sheep, goats and convoys of cyclists, I roll across the flat, fertile Sous Valley, sprinkled with bushy argan trees and orange groves, to reach a turn-off to Taroudant.</seg>
<seg id="3">When its crenelated ramparts come into view, their scale is so overwhelming that it looks like a film-set peopled by extras in flowing djellabas, accompanied by moth-eaten donkeys.</seg>
<seg id="4">These seven kilometres of rammed earth walls studded with soaring, arched gateways are relics of the town's offensive role back in the 16th century, when Agadir was under Portuguese rule and Taroudant was its nemesis.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although Taroudant is often dubbed a mini-Marrakech, I discover this engagingly sleepy town is no such thing, despite 500 foreigners choosing to live here.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is little hassle and a welcome absence of the Marrakchi frenzy.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, specific sights are scarce beyond the labyrinthine souk of Moroccan handcrafts and wily salesmen.</seg>
<seg id="8">After skirting the ramparts, I head into a different walled dimension at Dar Al Hossoun, a magnificent garden lodge hidden in olive groves.</seg>
<seg id="9">This densely planted horticultural paradise, sliced by one watery axis, a 30-metre ode to the iconic pool of the Alhambra, is a glorious tangle of wild grasses, palms, fruit-trees, euphorbia, roses, cacti and papyrus, even descending into a sunken garden of banana palms.</seg>
<seg id="10">Inside and out, French desert chic mixes so seductively with Moroccan artefacts that, on sinking into a sun-lounger stroked by a white hibiscus, I wonder if I really want to drive into the Sahara.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the sun sinks, frogs, cicadas and a flock of peacocks compete in a deafening chorus of croaks and howls.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's the mating season," explains Thierry, co-owner with Ollivier Verra.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are some nights when we can't even hear ourselves speak!</seg>
<seg id="14">The call of the cosmos is equally compelling, so the next day I cruise up through the greener landscapes of the Jebel Sirwa mountains.</seg>
<seg id="15">Berber women in dazzling full skirts and headscarves lug huge bales of grass on their heads; lone shepherds materialise out of nowhere to sprint after errant sheep.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is bucolic time-travel, until I hit the market town of Tazenakht.</seg>
<seg id="17">Here battered old vans are lined up, their roof-racks packed with sheep, saplings, plastic tubing and - why not? - a mattress and a TV.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then follows a tortuously pot-holed stretch through brutal, barren mountains where nothing grows and no one lives, before eventually reaching the one-horse town of Agdz.</seg>
<seg id="19">After a bite to eat and a refill for the car, I am ready to turn right for the final 100km to the Sahara.</seg>
<seg id="20">By now, despite seeing double with fatigue, I'm carried along by the magic of the Valley of the Draa, the intensifying afternoon light and the outline of Jebel Beni, a monumental escarpment fringed by a vast palm-grove.</seg>
<seg id="21">As mud-brick constructions take shape against the creases of the escarpment, superb ksars (fortified villages) and kasbahs (fortresses) multiply beside the road.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sprawling and interlocking, these mazes of crumbling ochre walls are always spiked by an immaculate pink minaret, emblem of belief and collective pride.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zagora passes in a flash of civic new-build, roundabouts and a tantalising sign showing Timbuktu to be 52 days south by camel.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then I am on the last stretch, teetering along a one-lane Tarmac road flanked by stony desert.</seg>
<seg id="25">Slaloming out of the path of lorries and Land Rovers, I at last spot the sign I have driven all this way for: Sahara Sky Desert Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="26">Built in splendid isolation in ksar-style with high walls, a majestic arched gateway, and corner turrets, it doesn't disappoint.</seg>
<seg id="27">My exhausted Dacia hurtles into the courtyard in a cloud of sand.</seg>
<seg id="28">Before I left London, an email from Helmut, the German manager, had warned me of possible sandstorms as well as mentioning the speed of the Lyrid meteor shower, about 50km per second (what other hotel puts that in an email?).</seg>
<seg id="29">However, he didn't prepare me for the intoxicating sight of vast, empty desert, speckled by a few nomad tents and dromedaries (Arabian camels), with the dune of Tinfou a gentle mound against that familiar silhouette of Jebel Beni.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Sometimes I feel like Robinson Crusoe on an island - in the sand!" comments Helmut, somewhat ruefully.</seg>
<seg id="31">Although sand creeps under doors and stacks up against the outer walls, the hotel interior is surreally hi-tech, with abundant flatscreen TVs and speedy Wi-Fi.</seg>
<seg id="32">And when I see the roof-terrace telescopes, I understand why people come all this way.</seg>
<seg id="33">These are professional beasts, some designed for night-sky photography via laptops, others with filters for watching sun activity.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sahara Sky is clearly an astronomer's paradise, its lobby walls plastered with enlargements of galaxies, nebulae and a "map" of the Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="35">There is even a library, with piles of specialist publications.</seg>
<seg id="36">Yet it functions well for lesser mortals as well, and the bar - allegedly the last before Timbuktu - lures thirsty Moroccans who, after sunset, slope in for a quick fix of Casablanca beer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Sarry-eyed: The night sky over the desert Our tagine dinner digested, the hotel guests (two Englishwomen, myself and an extended French family) gather on the roof for an astronomic session.</seg>
<seg id="38">Like a Dalek on heat, the Meade telescope whirs, following its GPS, swivelling up, down and around to focus on whatever target Helmut has keyed in.</seg>
<seg id="39">It feels thrillingly like a science-fiction film, although when Helmut trots out mind-boggling celestial statistics, I am reminded of Hindu mythology: triple, even quadruple digits don't exist, here we are in the realm of millions, billions and trillions.</seg>
<seg id="40">Saturn, which we watch in its multi-ringed glory, is 1,300,000 kilometres away, while our neighbouring galaxy, Andromeda, is 2.5 million light years away.</seg>
<seg id="41">Helmut then throws in that one light year equals just under 10 trillion kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="42">Take that!</seg>
<seg id="43">"Now we'll go into deep sky," he continues, searching for other galaxies.</seg>
<seg id="44">But we are unlucky, there is too much moonlight.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact the Moon is magnificently full, a time when no self-respecting astronomer would choose to star-gaze, but it means that we can also observe the lunar orb and its curiously two-dimensional craters.</seg>
<seg id="46">An added bonus that night is a partial lunar eclipse that slices off a chip before the Moon eventually resumes its full ghostly glow.</seg>
<seg id="47">As I look out across the desert, I imagine the nomadic Tuaregs revelling in the wash of blueish light as an alternative to the guiding path of the Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="48">Later, in bed in my cosy room, vivid with Berber colour, patterns and rugs, I get an even stronger sense of the elemental wilderness outside on planet Earth.</seg>
<seg id="49">That predicted sandstorm howls, soars and sweeps around the hotel, rattling windows and shutters and piling up more sand against the walls.</seg>
<seg id="50">It's not quite Super Nova, when a star implodes, but there is certainly a sense of man's fragility and of the immense power of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="51">However enthralling the desert may be, civilisation beckons too.</seg>
<seg id="52">Barely 3,000 people now live in the nearest town, Tamegroute.</seg>
<seg id="53">Most of their income comes from beautiful green-glazed pottery sold at roadside shops.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hot, dusty and monochrome, the thousand-year-old centre of rammed earth streets, roofed with palm-trunks, is typical of Saharan architecture from Libya to Timbuktu.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, despite this humble appearance, it turns out that Tamegroute is a holy town where pilgrims descend on the tomb of a 17th-century Sufi saint called Sidi Mohammed Ben Naceur.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the arcaded courtyard outside, sick women gather, hoping for miracles and dirhams.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, as a non-Muslim I cannot enter the sanctuary itself.</seg>
<seg id="58">Clay model: A village in the valley of Draa Luckily, Tamegroute's outstanding historic sight, a Koranic library (yet again echoing Timbuktu), is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="59">Only 4,000 manuscripts of an original 50,000 remain, the others having been lost or dispersed.</seg>
<seg id="60">Yet the examples displayed in dusty showcases prove to be as eye-opening as the galaxies, from the bold calligraphy of Samarkand to an ancient map of Alexandria, some Berber poetry, an illuminated Koran on gazelle-hide from 11th-century Cordoba and a 15th-century Egyptian book depicting zodiac signs, planets and the solar system - a reminder of how advanced early Arab astronomers were.</seg>
<seg id="61">From Tamegroute, Helmut takes me in his four-wheel-drive south to the Algerian border, a mere chain across the road, before we head out into the hushed, rippling dunes of the Sahara.</seg>
<seg id="62">Their poetry is only disturbed by spiralling sand-twisters, like dancing desert spirits; even the wind seems silent.</seg>
<seg id="63">On the way we stop at oasis villages where advancing desertification is dramatically visible, bringing dry water-channels, collapsing houses and an exodus of inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="64">Turbanned men in djellabas still trot by on donkeys or chat intensely, while women in billowing black robes, gossip and giggle, as they pick through a weekly souk.</seg>
<seg id="65">Apart from the odd vehicle, it is timeless, yet so much younger, trillions of years younger, than those mesmerising night skies.</seg>
<seg id="66">A few days later, on my way back to the 21st century, I stay one last night at a Berber kasbah in Taliouine, 1,000m up in a spectacular cleft of the Anti-Atlas.</seg>
<seg id="67">When I rise at an ungodly 5.30am to head for the airport, the courtyard is radiant with the waning moonlight, leaving a carpet of stars perfectly framed by the walls; I can just recognise Jupiter and its four moons, which we observed so perfectly with the telescope.</seg>
<seg id="68">Then, like Ali Baba, I sneak out through the heavy kasbah doors into the cool, silent night.</seg>
<seg id="69">With the chatter and music of Radio Désert to keep me awake in the car, the Moon stays with me until dawn breaks over the mountains, and I emerge unscathed from my entrancing Saharan nights.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank stocks" stellar run hits the buffers</seg>
<seg id="2">Investigations, litigation, fines: past misdemeanours and a wave of regulatory action have buffeted banks" share prices this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The stellar run enjoyed by European bank stocks, in particular, may finally have run out of road.</seg>
<seg id="4">Barclays, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse are among the biggest names in the industry whose shares have suffered over the past week, amid disappointing results and an escalating probe into alleged rigging of the foreign exchange market.</seg>
<seg id="5">IN European Equities</seg>
<seg id="6">The septimana horribilis caps a heady year for Europe's financial sector.</seg>
<seg id="7">Investor confidence in the eurozone has recovered following a promise by Mario Draghi, European Central Bank president, to do "whatever it takes" to save the euro.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the biggest European banks - as measured by the Eurofirst 300 banks index - have outperformed the wider European stock market by over two percentage points for the year to date.</seg>
<seg id="9">But, over the past three months, that outperformance has slipped to just a fraction of a percentage point, eroded by a slowdown in fixed income trading, the fall-out from the Libor rate fixing scandal and fears over further capital demands from regulators.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Relative to US banks, European valuations are looking punchy," says Ronit Ghose, banks analyst at Citi, "That doesn't mean banks are "sells" but to justify continuing outperformance we need to see earnings upgrades and third-quarter results have been a messy set of numbers."</seg>
<seg id="11">Top of the worry list are lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="12">Following JP Morgan's $13bn settlement with US authorities, investors are concerned that a volley of litigation by national regulators in Europe could signal the opening salvo of a wider barrage.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We have just stepped on a litigation landmine [although] it's taken a little time to dawn on the market," says a senior European banking analyst.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is something that banks have to set aside significant earnings for and the question is whether or not they can afford it at the same time when they're building [capital] reserves for other things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Swiss banks have been among the worst fallers.</seg>
<seg id="16">UBS and Credit Suisse tumbled nearly 10 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, this week in dollar terms.</seg>
<seg id="17">Deutsche Bank, whose share price fell by 3.6 per cent over the same period, has set aside €500m towards possible penalties in relation to global regulators" investigations into the Libor scandal that has seen Barclays, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland pay hundreds of millions in fines.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there is the deepening probe into foreign exchange trading.</seg>
<seg id="19">Friday's disclosure that six Barclays traders have been suspended has added to a sense among bankers and investors that an industry-wide investigation is rapidly spiralling into a scandal that might match the scale of the Libor saga.</seg>
<seg id="20">Barclays, UBS and Deutsche have said they are involved in the forex probe, with US banks Citi and JP Morgan confirming on Friday that they, too, were working with regulators.</seg>
<seg id="21">Regulators in the UK, US, Switzerland and Hong Kong are involved in the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Alberto Gallo, head of European macro credit research at Royal Bank of Scotland., says the unpredictable nature of the probes makes assessing banks" provisions uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Unlike bad loan charges, it's hard to estimate whether provisions for litigation are accurate or not, given their idiosyncratic nature," he says.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition to the legal worries declines in fixed income trading have hit profits at BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="25">This, combined with subdued markets and a move towards central clearing, has prompted many banks to rethink how they run their debt trading.</seg>
<seg id="26">UBS exitd large parts of its fixed-income business last year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Credit Suisse this month unveiled an overhaul of its own, focused on a restructuring of its rates business, which is the lowest-returning part of its investment bank.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lying in the background is European regulators" upcoming review of banks" balance sheets and stress tests.</seg>
<seg id="29">The tests, due to begin next year, are expected to lead to further capital raising.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Institutions which have large balance sheets but low risk-weighted assets like Barclays or Deutsche Bank will be penalised and pushed to delever or raise more capital," says Mr Gallo.</seg>
<seg id="31">Stricter regulation and higher risk weights will also impact the revenue mix of banks, and institutions which generate most of their revenues from investment banking and trading will have to diversify.</seg>
<seg id="32">Supporters maintain the regulatory review is a good thing in the longer term.</seg>
<seg id="33">It will, they argue, bolster transparency and harmonise national rules on risk weighting assets, capital buffers and the "bail-in" of creditors when a bank defaults.</seg>
<seg id="34">Huw van Steenis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says that banks" stalling share prices constitute a bump on the road to recovery, rather than a pothole: "Uncertainty always causes a discount [in share prices]."</seg>
<seg id="35">I think there's a lot of tactical selling by investors but the overall strategy is still long European financials.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gutach: Increased safety for pedestrians</seg>
<seg id="2">They are not even 100 metres apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorfparkplatz in Gutach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two sets of lights so close to one another: intentional or just a silly error?</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Gutacht's Mayor gave a clear answer to this question.</seg>
<seg id="5">"At the time, the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route," explained Eckert yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kluser lights protect cyclists, as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Bergle.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system, which officially became operational yesterday, is of importance to the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junction.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have the museum, two churches, the spa gardens, the bus stop, a doctor's practice and a bank, not to mention the traffic from the 'Grub' residential area.</seg>
<seg id="9">"At times of high road and pedestrian traffic, an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety," said Eckert.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office.</seg>
<seg id="11">"According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gutach on the B33 on a daily basis, of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent," emphasised Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary: "Here safety comes first, it's that simple," said Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="13">A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered, however, this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Arnold, every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts: "Using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree trunks, we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sulzbachweg without knocking over the traffic light posts".</seg>
<seg id="15">The traffic light system itself, which cost around EUR 15,000, is the "most modern system that is currently available on the market," explained Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="16">The system is fitted with coloured LEDs, which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights, even when the sun is low in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="17">And they are also energy-efficient: The older light systems consume around 100 Watts, with the new ones consuming just eight.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are three sets of lights per direction of travel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arnold explained the technology used by the new system: It is fitted with two radar sensors.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights, the top radar sensor checks the traffic status.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the street is clear, the pedestrian obtains a green light immediately, if not, there is a delay of around 15 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="22">An additional radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended.</seg>
<seg id="23">"If a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street, the green phase is extended, thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street," explained Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road.</seg>
<seg id="25">Yesterday this was not the case: The light had barely turned green for pedestrians when a luxury vehicle sped through on a red light.</seg>

<seg id="4">He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">So each scoop costs me around £140.</seg>
<seg id="13">It tastes pretty good though.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists</seg>

<seg id="1">Huawei 'extremely disappointed' with NBN ban</seg>
<seg id="2">Ban upheld: Huawei is still not allowed to participate in Australia's NBN.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Bloomberg</seg>
<seg id="4">Huawei has finally broken its silence after the Coalition government decided to uphold the ban on the Chinese telecom giant participating in the national broadband network, saying the company is ""extremely disappointed"."</seg>
<seg id="5">John Lord, the chairman of Huawei Australia and a former Royal Australian Navy admiral told the company's staff to hold their heads up high and be ""proud to be Huawei"."</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Lord's letter to staff came after Prime Minister Tony Abbott categorically shut down the speculation that Canberra was going to relax the previous government's ban on Huawei.</seg>
<seg id="7">""While much of this week's commentary has focused on cyber security,"" he said in a letter to all staff.</seg>
<seg id="8">""I want to make it crystal clear that Huawei has never been presented with any evidence that our company or technology poses any kind of security risk.""</seg>
<seg id="9">The former fleet commander played down the importance of the NBN to Huawei's business operation.</seg>
<seg id="10">""Despite the NBN decision, last year was our most successful year to date and today's Huawei's Australian business is bigger than ever.""</seg>
<seg id="11">Huawei Australia more than doubled its revenue in Australia last year and earned $368 million, a 61 per cent increase from the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="12">It has secured major contracts from major telcos including a contract to build part of Optus" superfast 4G network.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Lord reiterated the company offer to reveal its technology and source codes to be verified by Australian security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Huawei's offer has so far been ignored by both the Coalition and Labor governments.</seg>
<seg id="15">""That position still stands--we have nothing to hide, and we have complete confidence in the veracity of our equipment,"" he said, ""we have always understood that the bar is set higher for Huawei and because of that we are willing to go further than any other vendor to prove our security credentials.""</seg>
<seg id="16">He described Canberra's decision to ban Huawei was ""the exception, not the rule.""</seg>
<seg id="17">Huawei is building eight out nine NBNs around the world including Britain's, a close ally of Australia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="18">""These countries have not embraced Huawei cautiously, they have embraced us with open arms,"" said Mr Lord.</seg>
<seg id="19">Huawei established a cyber-security centre in Britain after it was awarded a large contract to supply equipment to the British equivalent of the NBN.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is staffed with security cleared personnel, some of whom used to work for Britain's signals intelligence agency, GCHQ</seg>
<seg id="21">The Chinese telco giant also appointed John Suffolk, the former chief information officer of the British government to be the head of its global cyber security operation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Huawei's charm offensive in Britain seems to have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="23">UK Chancellor George Osborne met Huawei's chief executive officer Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese army engineer in China during his recent visit and welcomed a further $2.2 billion of investment from Huawei.</seg>
<seg id="24">""There are some Western governments that have blocked Huawei from making investments,"" Mr Osborne reportedly said, ""not Britain, quite the opposite.""</seg>

<seg id="1">Freudenstadt: Quick moves take hosts by surprise</seg>
<seg id="2">With a slender squad, the TSV Freudenstadt Herren I team (Men's First Team) stepped into the Schiller School Gymnasium in Reutlingen to face TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb region.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Alb men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, it soon became evident that, due in part to their age, they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the Freudenstadt team.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gönningen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well-positioned offensive moves.</seg>
<seg id="6">They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks coming cleanly over the net from Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and their blocking game was not up to scratch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clear victories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the superiority of the Freudenstadt team in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Faced with this overwhelming and match-determining performance, the third set was won following a somewhat tame and spiritless performance, for a final score of 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).</seg>
<seg id="9">On 2 November, when they play TV Baiersbronn, who managed a clear victory in Nagold, they will step onto the court to face a much stronger opponent.</seg>
<seg id="10">TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the B Class, two teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced off in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.</seg>
<seg id="12">They produced a hard-fought two-hour match.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nerves on both sides, particularly when receiving the ball, resulted in errors and lost points; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments overeagerness saw potential points wasted.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, in this evenly matched game, the great physical effort of Marcus Blasutto's TSV team proved decisive in spite of tremendous commitment by both teams.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip</seg>
<seg id="2">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive special adviser," Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say," Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.</seg>
<seg id="9">What about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">Does he know about phone hacking?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says he doesn't, we say "Oh yes, he did".</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projects."</seg>
<seg id="15">During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.</seg>

<seg id="3">Police have released images of a cast net and thongs found on a beach near Weipa and are asking people who can help identify the owner of the property to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="4">Volunteers from the State Emergency Service are currently searching the area, which is a known crocodile habitat.</seg>
<seg id="5">The gear was found by a member of the public about 7am today on the bank of the creek near the carpark of a hotel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Weipa Town Authority posted a warning of a large "aggressive" crocodile stalking people and dogs on the beach just ten days ago.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the last near-fatal attack, Todd Bairstow, was lucky to survive after he was trapped in the jaws of a crocodile in March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Rio Tinto bauxite mine worker was fishing on the banks of Trunding Creek near the Albatross Hotel in Weipa when a 4m crocodile lunged out of the water.</seg>

<seg id="2">Welcome to the Big Shill - a.k.a. the Select USA 2013 Investment Summit - where a mayor from a city such as Carmel, Ind., population 85,000, could pitch the advantages of his new city center to such people as Lin Zuoming, president of China's giant aviation conglomerate AVIC.</seg>
<seg id="3">Having recruited the tired, the poor and the huddled masses, its seems, it's time to target the world's 1 percent, who this week have taken over the Marriott Wardman Park's 1,300 rooms for what U.S. officials hope will be two days of dealmaking.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I am here because I want your company to know there is no better place to do business than in the United States," Obama said in lunchtime remarks to the crowd, which included executives from the world's biggest corporations down to small startups trying to grow beyond the borders of such countries as the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="5">Why be outside the world's largest market?</seg>
<seg id="6">Obama asked, a barker at the world's richest carnival.</seg>
<seg id="7">When you bet on America, that bet pays off.</seg>
<seg id="8">The president was the headliner of an administration push to persuade foreign entrepreneurs to bring their money here, build plants, set up offices - and hire people.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's an endeavor serious enough that, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said, the country's ambassadors and foreign trade officials are going to have their job performance rated in part on how well they do in encouraging inbound investment to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They're going be judged," Pritzker said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just the way we advocate on behalf of exports, we're going to bring the same intensity.</seg>
<seg id="12">As if on cue, the coffee shops and bars of the Marriott were speckled with members of the nation's diplomatic corps - Gary Locke, ambassador to China, in a casual chat with delegates from that country, Ambassador to Singapore Kirk Wagar head to head with the director of a Singapore asset management firm.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign companies already have about $2.7 trillion in assets in the United States, including car factories, tech firms, banks and oil rigs.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the yearly flow of investment has lagged in recent years, and the administration, perhaps taking a cue from Malaysia, Georgia and other developing countries that have mounted extensive global marketing campaigns, is hoping it can rebrand the United States as the next best place to expand.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effort comes with the U.S. economy sitting at a seeming crossroads in the struggle to achieve more than sluggish growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">On one hand, major components of spending and demand - whether exports or retail sales - are growing more slowly than hoped.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other, some positive trends are starting to converge: a major boost in U.S. energy production has given the country an important new selling point; the stagnation of wages may be disappointing to U.S. workers but is also making the labor force more competitive internationally; political leaders have become aggressive in trying to open foreign markets, a potential plus for firms that make products in the United States.</seg>

<seg id="3">On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury," according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.</seg>
<seg id="7">GM's truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.</seg>

<seg id="3">INJURED Collingwood star Dayne Beams has revealed plans to return to football within the next two to three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking for the first time about the torn quad muscle that sidelined him for the past five games, Beams said he had plans to step up his running this week before aiming to return via the VFL in a fortnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">He suffered the injury the day before Collingwood's first game against North Melbourne and had a slight setback a few weeks later which brought about a more conservative approach from the medical team.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I'm not too far away," Beams said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="7">I have just got back into training and things are looking positive again.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously, with the little re-bleed that I had, they have gone the ultra-conservative path now.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a long year, so I have got to look after it, and hopefully come back in the second half of the season bigger and better.</seg>
<seg id="10">Beams said he would likely "step it up a bit this week and see how my legs feel."</seg>
<seg id="11">My ambitions compared to the physios' are completely different.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am hoping for a couple of weeks, but obviously I will have to come back through the VFL.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am looking at about two or three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 23-year-old midfielder said the injury had been "extremely frustrating," but it had been put into perspective by the season-ending knee injury suffered by his brother, Brisbane's Claye Beams.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dayne said: "I had never torn a muscle before, so it was a different feeling.</seg>
<seg id="16">Claye is laying up on the couch and it is just so disappointing for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">St Kilda is a club in crisis following the shock sacking of senior coach Scott Watters</seg>
<seg id="2">SCOTT Watters has been sacked as St Kilda coach, leaving a gutted football department and disgruntled players and staff in his wake.</seg>
<seg id="3">Watters was yesterday summoned to an 11am meeting in a city office with Saints president Peter Summers, vice-president Jack Rush and board member Andrew Thompson where he was told in a 20-minute meeting that he would be fired with a year to run on his contract.</seg>
<seg id="4">What Summers described as a "strong decision" was made at an unscheduled board meeting at 8am via phone hook-up.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was here that Watters" meddling in other departments and his strained relationships with colleagues and players were laid bare.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were also increasing concerns over his coaching, particularly on match day, where frequently changing tactics and mixed messages were common.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Herald Sun reported Watters had told Summers a month ago that he was willing to buy-in to a new structure and narrow his focus on coaching.</seg>
<seg id="8">It came after Thompson's review of the football department revealed an "endorsement that we have the right people in the right roles."</seg>
<seg id="9">But in the weeks since the club had become convinced that Watters" behaviour wasn't going to change.</seg>
<seg id="10">We hope everyone who comes in is successful long term, but it's obviously not unconditional.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We assessed things today and got to the decision we did," Summers said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's been ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="13">That (review) was an assessment of where we were at a point in time.</seg>
<seg id="14">We went through a period where other things became clearer.</seg>
<seg id="15">As things have emerged issues become clearer.</seg>
<seg id="16">Asked what those issues were, Summers said: "We met with Scott this morning and went through the reasons for our decision, but they will remain confidential between Scott and ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="17">He was disappointed, as I think we would all expect.</seg>
<seg id="18">Watters" sacking comes after the departures of assistant coaches Dean Bailey and Jaymie Graham and fitness boss Bill Davoren, while his relationship with football boss Chris Pelchen remained strained.</seg>
<seg id="19">Summers admitted there had been infighting, but denied it was the deal-breaker in Watters" demise.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's been reported there's been tension in the football department.</seg>
<seg id="21">We accept that.</seg>
<seg id="22">"But I've also said that, and I've operated for a long time in business, and tension isn't a bad thing necessarily," Summers said.</seg>
<seg id="23">They (Watters and Pelchen) probably got on the wrong side, but I don't want to harp on it, it's irrelevant going forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">I heard the working relationship of late was OK.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's been portrayed as one versus the other and it's not the case.</seg>
<seg id="26">They worked together over the last period quite well.</seg>
<seg id="27">When I spoke to Scott and Chris about that there hadn't been issues.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's an indication of the sort of issues we dealt with this morning in the board meeting, but I wouldn't overplay it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Everyone has got relationships in a club ... some of the personality issues we addressed during the year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Commodities: are they on the rebound?</seg>
<seg id="2">Meanwhile, there is clearly a revival in housing in the US.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chinese growth may not be as fast as it used to be, but it is still trundling along.</seg>
<seg id="4">So demand for the commodities will grow over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The rising supply from new copper mines in the next 12 months is already well known.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is what has depressed the shares and why they are now rather good value.</seg>
<seg id="7">I hold some BHP Billiton, which at £19.47 stands at 12.2 times prospective earnings for the current year and 11.4 for next.</seg>
<seg id="8">It offers a yield of 3.9pc, rising to 4.1pc.</seg>
<seg id="9">This rating would not be high for a company with moderate prospects.</seg>
<seg id="10">But in 18 months or two years, the increases in supply will have taken place and the prospects will be for continued increases in demand.</seg>
<seg id="11">Metal prices could rise more strongly, leading to higher profits and a more aggressive valuation.</seg>
<seg id="12">So at some point in the next 18-24 months I think the big mining shares will outperform.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am content to have a few and to be a bit early.</seg>
<seg id="14">And, because I have the shares, I will notice when things begin to happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">I will also notice if the shares resume a downward path and become, ahem, even better value.</seg>
<seg id="16">Smaller mining companies are a more dramatic story.</seg>
<seg id="17">They fell even more heavily in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Few investors wanted anything to do with them.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have nursed losses in Griffin Mining, a British company that mines zinc in China, but I have continued to buy more.</seg>
<seg id="20">In recent weeks, at long last, they have responded to the rise in the zinc price and have rallied by 20pc to 35p.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that level they stand at a mere five times forecast earnings for next year.</seg>
<seg id="22">And if the zinc price continues to firm, profits will be substantially higher.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have even had some uplift in the price of REA Holdings, my plantation company.</seg>
<seg id="24">The battered shares have rallied by 10pc to 406p.</seg>
<seg id="25">That is doubtless in response to a recovery in the palm oil price from around $820 to $900 a tonne.</seg>
<seg id="26">Commodities and commodity shares are usually considered good investments for late in the business cycle.</seg>
<seg id="27">We have probably not reached "late" yet but I think it is not too soon to put at least a little money into this area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, my broker, Brewin Dolphin, has sent my elder daughter, aged 19, an "appropriateness assessment" form to fill in.</seg>
<seg id="29">The form explains that Brewin is required to send the form because she has bought shares in an investment trust that has holdings in Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id="30">This apparently falls into the category of "non-mainstream pooled investments."</seg>
<seg id="31">Who "requires" that her "appropriateness" should be assessed?</seg>
<seg id="32">The European Union of course.</seg>
<seg id="33">The "Markets in Financial Instruments Directive" was accepted by some traitor to his country in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="34">Who did that?</seg>
<seg id="35">Oh yes, I remember.</seg>
<seg id="36">Personally I think a British man or woman should have an inalienable right to invest where he or she wants.</seg>
<seg id="37">The European Union should get a life and let me and my daughter live ours.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mastering the struggle to perfection.</seg>
<seg id="2">The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is perfectly suited to Horst Janson.</seg>
<seg id="3">Janson is an old hand himself when it comes to his profession, the art of acting.</seg>
<seg id="4">The old man, Santiago, is the best there is when it comes to fishing.</seg>
<seg id="5">As such, the pair complement one another superbly.</seg>
<seg id="6">You almost think that you can see the folds in the old man's neck, of which young fisherman Manolo speaks.</seg>
<seg id="7">When Santiago sits arched over on the chair, tired of life, this is a genuine emotion for Janson.</seg>
<seg id="8">Furthermore, the role of the old fisherman is a character role, through and through, which Janson masters excellently.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who doesn't give up and who ultimately wins the battle against the fish as a result of his knowledge and his strong will.</seg>
<seg id="10">For long periods, Janson is the only performer on the stage.</seg>
<seg id="11">He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, with the result that his monologues never become boring, not even for just a moment.</seg>
<seg id="12">His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that members of the audience forget that the sea in question consists merely of water bottles, illuminated in blue.</seg>
<seg id="13">Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man in the boat perform in front of Fischerdorf.</seg>
<seg id="14">During the course of the performance he has the respective active scene illuminated. Santiago's cabin and the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings of the Cuban lifestyle, with your songs and beautiful voice.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four musicians accompany with Cuban rhythms and guests at the bar at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Film review: Drinking Buddies (15)</seg>
<seg id="2">Eric Rohmer meets Richard Linklater in this amiable but not entirely plausible drama about two friends (Olivia Wilde and Jake Johnson) who work in an upmarket brewery.</seg>
<seg id="3">Their attraction to one another is self-evident but, as the film starts, they are already in relationships with other partners (Ron Livingston, Anna Kendrick).</seg>
<seg id="4">Joe Swanberg (one of the leaders of the "mumblecore" movement) shoots in long takes with constant close-ups and with minimal music, focusing on the behaviour of the characters with anthropological relish.</seg>
<seg id="5">As in Rohmer's movies, the protagonists are young, good-looking and prone to negotiating themselves into a huge romantic pickle.</seg>
<seg id="6">They drink vast quantities of beer without suffering from any noticeable hangovers while reading Camus and John Updike.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wilde has star quality, even if her character is hard to believe in.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.</seg>
<seg id="4">One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="6">The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.</seg>
<seg id="8">State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.</seg>
<seg id="9">The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kids may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels like there is hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."</seg>

<seg id="1">Snowden asks Germany to support him against US 'persecution'</seg>
<seg id="2">In an appeal for support from Germany, including a thinly veiled plea for asylum, Mr Snowden's letter called on the international community to stop America extraditing him on charges of espionage for leaking US spying secrets.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="4">I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the US will abandon this harmful behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pleading that he had performed a "public service" by stealing US intelligence secrets to reveal an "unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance," Mr Snowden argued in his letter that Germany and others owe him their gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These spying revelations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="7">The benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Snowden cited the "difficulties" of his asylum status in Russia that prevent him from leaving the country to cooperate with parliamentary and judicial investigators into alleged NSA surveillance activities in Germany, including the bugging of Angela Merkel's mobile telephone.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact," he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="10">""I look forward to speaking to you in your country when the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts in upholding the international laws that protect us all."</seg>
<seg id="11">Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, said on Friday that he would try and find a way for German officials to speak to Mr Snowden about NSA surveillance, in a move that could deepen a rift over the spying scandal between Germany and the US.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If the message is that Mr Snowden wants to give us information, then we will be glad to accept that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We will find a way to make a conversation possible if Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German officials.</seg>
<seg id="14">An interior ministry spokesman noted that Berlin had received an extradition request for Snowden on July 3 should he arrive in Germany and that Berlin has an extradition agreement with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="15">The asylum he has in Russia gives him security in Russia but not in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If he left he would not be able to return to Russia," said Mr Stroebele.</seg>
<seg id="17">He could imagine coming to Germany, as long it was guaranteed that he could stay in Germany or a comparable country thereafter and stay safe there.</seg>

<seg id="2">The chances of the relegated Ludwigsburg Budesliga basketball players remaining in the league have improved.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is because there is to be a wild card procedure, and the Neckar Riesen are now up against one applicant fewer.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Hamburg Towers basketball project is declining to make an application for a possible stand-in place.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We will not participate in the wild card process," said former national team player Pascal Roller, who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the Hansa town since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, there was no sigh of relief to be heard from Ludwigsburg.</seg>

<seg id="1">Networking between universities and companies is important</seg>
<seg id="2">On a visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, it was explained to Parliamentary President Guido Wolf in Titisee-Neustadt where the workforce of tomorrow will come from.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the Hochschwarzwald Support Centre, he addressed this important question alongside the executive principals of the vocational colleges and the district grammar school and the chairs of the parents' council.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Education is an important factor for the location," highlighted Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans Thoma School, which introduced the networked Hochschwarzwald Education Centre Schools Project.</seg>
<seg id="5">During the presentation, Wolf seemed impressed by the educational pilot project.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since 2011, there has been successful collaboration in Wälderstadt between the Support Centre, the District Grammar School and the Vocational School Complex.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also praised the family-friendly approach within the district.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is important, not only to keep the family life stage in mind, but, on account of demographic change, the period spent providing long-term care and support for relatives as well," explained Wolf.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long-term care and support of relatives.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Without support from their employer, the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract," said Wolf.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, nobody can afford to lose qualified workers," he added.</seg>
<seg id="12">Another, particularly important factor is that of networking between universities and companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After all, people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the region, along with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the State Parliamentary President, expressing his thorough conviction.</seg>
<seg id="14">For it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be covered.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, the district's advantage as a location is its advantageous location in south-west Germany, in immediate proximity to France and Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to this, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced first-hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"You must continue to be tenacious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better," he explained in the address given to the local politicians in attendance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fears for reef over port developments</seg>
<seg id="2">Threatened: Parts of the Great Barrier Reef, especially areas closer to the mainland, are deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="3">Much of the Great Barrier Reef is continuing to degrade, especially areas closest to the mainland, where new port developments are awaiting approval from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest strategic assessment of the reef confirmed that, while there were pockets of good news, hard coral had declined by half since 1986 in the bottom two-thirds of the reef, south of Cooktown.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report also found increased turbidity in the inshore areas of the reef, the result of increased sedimentation caused by run-off and development.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The Great Barrier Reef is in decline in a significant way," Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chairman Russell Reichelt said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Launching the report, Environment Minister Greg Hunt had a more optimistic assessment of "the jewel in Australia's environmental crown."</seg>
<seg id="8">This great reef is in good condition but with challenges in different parts.</seg>
<seg id="9">It can be better," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">New ports are planned along the Queensland coast adjacent to the reef, including at Mackay, Rockhampton and the world's biggest coal terminal at Abbot Point, north of Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Hunt will rule on Abbot Point before the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Environmentalists said the report reaffirmed that the developments should not proceed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nick Heath, from wildlife preservation group WWF, said: "This report appears to give no room to approve dredging and dumping in the inshore waters of the reef, given the scientific assessment of these sensitive areas tells us they are in either poor or very poor condition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Two wrongs don't make a right.</seg>
<seg id="15">With the reef in such a state already, often as a result of fertiliser pollution, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to dump in reef waters.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report said the impact of dredging - required on a huge scale to build the ports - was hard to ascertain but remained a concern.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Hunt said the report's recommendation that the negative impact of development and other factors on the reef had to be assessed for their "cumulative impact" had been accepted and would mean tougher standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">But he declined to rule out approving the port.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Any future development proposal will be assessed against the standards here and assessed against the science," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Cumulative impact.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is a tougher standard, and we make no apology for applying that tougher standard going forward.</seg>
<seg id="22">UNESCO, which oversees the world heritage status of the reef, has already voiced concern that the port developments might put the area on its "endangered" list.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Hunt said he was encouraged by "new science" that could prove more effective in combating the crown-of-thorns starfish infestations that were killing coral.</seg>
<seg id="24">New programs to stop run-off from farms would also make a difference, he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Crown-of-thorns starfish are responsible for 42 per cent of the coral damage.</seg>
<seg id="26">Storms account for 48 per cent of the degradation and bleaching accounts for the remainder.</seg>
<seg id="27">The assessment found seagrass meadows had also been affected, hurting populations of dugongs and turtles.</seg>
<seg id="28">All up, it said there was "reduced underwater aesthetic value."</seg>
<seg id="29">This, in turn, affects the image and human experiences of the reef.</seg>
<seg id="30">It said the reef generated $6 billion in annual income and supported 69,000 jobs, mostly through tourism.</seg>

<seg id="9">In the ladies' race it was Theresa Duelli of Team Albtraum who managed to take top place on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="10">In second and third places were Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The increasing number of riders that live or work in the area is a fantastic development.</seg>

<seg id="13">Participants' ages were also wide-ranging, with the youngest starters at ten years old up to the oldest at over 70.</seg>

<seg id="15">Four cyclists managed to break away from the top regional racers.</seg>
<seg id="16">These included Philipp Pangerl, a semi-professional mountain biker from the Black Tusk Racing Team.</seg>
<seg id="17">Together with a team mate, Pangerl has already twice been crowned World Champion in the 12-hour race.</seg>

<seg id="2">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader.</seg>
<seg id="8">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.</seg>
<seg id="12">UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
<seg id="13">At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market.</seg>
<seg id="14">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Banks are scouring through years" worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="16">News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks" increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that "you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices."</seg>
<seg id="19">The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained," Credit Suisse said.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.</seg>
<seg id="2">The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together."</seg>
<seg id="4">Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."</seg>
<seg id="11">We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" back Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exports power growth in UK manufacturing sector</seg>
<seg id="2">"This provides support for the view that an improving external environment (notably in the euro area) could help support UK growth, as well as the rebalancing toward a lower trade and current account deficit," said economists at Credit Suisse in a note.</seg>
<seg id="3">However they raised concerns about the decline in the "marked decline" in employment.</seg>
<seg id="4">However others took comfort from the growth in new orders.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said the data was a " strong leading indicator of future jobs growth."</seg>
<seg id="6">But he added: "The one caveat we will have to assign to the UK manufacturing remains the economic area 21 miles off our coast - Europe."</seg>
<seg id="7">Recent data from the Eurozone has remained poor, and should we see another European slowdown, we will not be unaffected here in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="8">We would expect the manufacturing sector to be the first part of the economy to show the strain as orders dry up.</seg>
<seg id="9">The manufacturing sector is still 9pc smaller than before the financial crisis, unlike the services sectors which has recovered all the ground lost during the downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">However economists said the growth was encouraging, regardless of the slowdown in the past two months.</seg>
<seg id="11">Barclays pointed out that the index is "still significantly above the long-run average of 51.3 and is consistent with a solid pace of expansion similar to what it experienced during the revival of manufacturing in 2010-11."</seg>
<seg id="12">Howard Archer, economist at IHS, added that the "very decent" data "provides some reassurance on the strength of the economy after some recent signs that it has lost some momentum after a surge in activity during the second and third quarters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch</seg>
<seg id="2">At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there," Mrs Amirthalinga says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.</seg>
<seg id="12">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">People are saying "the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="21">Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs," says Ms Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Searching for an iPhone in a haystack: During farm's festival, all sorts of stuff gets lost</seg>
<seg id="2">Specifically, her phone could have been buried under hundreds of pounds of straw on one of 10 hay wagons circulating through Butler's Orchard, a 300-acre farm.</seg>
<seg id="3">Or entombed in the hayloft, filled hip-high with spongy layers of straw.</seg>
<seg id="4">Or tucked away in the Magic Maze, 56 bales of straw covered by a tarp to make sure it's extra dark and impossible to see your feet, let alone a missing phone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The straw, it just eats stuff," said Ben Butler, 24, whose grandparents founded the farm, a Germantown institution that features a produce market, pick-your-own fruits and the annual pumpkin festival.</seg>
<seg id="6">You're sitting in straw, playing with your kids, rolling around, you kind of lose track.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a flash, keys slip out of a pocket or a cellphone disappears.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's not like a playground, where you can just go back and find it where you left it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially with the number of people in the barn and on the hayrides, things get tossed around and moved around.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a highly wired region in a nation where 56 percent of adults own smartphones, many who come to the farm to unwind in the country bring along their iPhones or Androids.</seg>
<seg id="11">And they lose them, often.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some, consumed in the frolic of a family day off, lose more important things.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gordon Hain's white-gold wedding band slipped off his finger Sunday as he was brushing straw from his son's hair in the hayloft.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It just slid off my finger and disappeared into the hay," said Hain, 31, of Silver Spring.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even knowing where it landed, I just couldn't find it.</seg>
<seg id="16">All the little bits of hay confuse the eye and it's hard to focus on a particular item, especially something as small as a ring.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was no contrast between it and the hay.</seg>
<seg id="18">He and his family were on hands and knees in the hayloft for about a half-hour, digging frantically and kicking up a cloud of dust, to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We were covered head to toe in hay by the time we walked out of there," said Hain, who had never taken off his ring since his wedding six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">I felt absolute numbness.</seg>
<seg id="21">Shock, really.</seg>
<seg id="22">To figure out the likelihood of finding something in a haystack by poking around with a long, thin stick, take the average cross-sectional area of the missing item and divide it by the area of the haystack, said Ian Stewart, a British mathematician and the author of "How to Cut a Cake: And Other Mathematical Conundrums."</seg>
<seg id="23">In other words, good luck.</seg>
<seg id="24">So many things disappear under all that hay at Butler's, which has been running its pumpkin festival for 33 years, that the farm computerized its lost-and-found system to speed connections between people and possessions.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Bags of stuff come in each day," said Karlene Southard, the office manager and commander of the lost-and-found operation.</seg>
<seg id="26">At her feet was the haul from the two days: a gray knit bunny hat, a left-handed red mitten coated in straw, an adult-size Batman beanie, a pink costume cowboy hat, a child's white sweater jacket, a pair of aviator sunglasses, a child's left-handed knit glove, a Sony camera, a baby bottle, a teething ring, a Honda key, a green water bottle, an empty Ray-Ban sunglasses case.</seg>
<seg id="27">Three drawers in a metal filing cabinet were brimming with more stuff, and a corner was filled with a couple of cardboard boxes full of items.</seg>

<seg id="3">Pakistani MPs elected Raja Pervez Ashraf as the country's new prime minister yesterday, seeking to end a political upheaval.</seg>

<seg id="1">Outdistancing Suicide, Papa's Family Curse</seg>
<seg id="2">The up-close-and-personal promise of cinéma vérité in the 1960s could be exploited in a number of ways.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some documentaries explored ordinary life as a subject ("Salesman," "High School"), but just as often they orbited stars (Bob Dylan in "Don't Look Back," John F. Kennedy in "Primary").</seg>
<seg id="4">The career of the award-winning filmmaker Barbara Kopple has intriguingly spanned this spectrum, as she has both risked her life to chronicle a miners strike in the 1976 stone-cold classic, "Harlan County, U.S.A.," and watched Woody Allen quip about hotel laundry service in "Wild Man Blues" (1998).</seg>
<seg id="5">All of that might sound like ancient history in this exhaustive (and exhausting) era of the reality show, which would be one way of mislabeling Ms. Kopple's latest film, "Running From Crazy."</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, this heart-wrenching and deceptively conventional documentary manages the tensions in its subject and in the vérité approach in a fruitful, illuminating and surprisingly moving way.</seg>
<seg id="7">The subject is Mariel Hemingway, and the film, commissioned by Oprah Winfrey's OWN cable channel, outwardly belongs to the genre of celebrity confessional, seemingly striking its balance of exposure and recognition of a cause or affliction.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Tall blonde, no problems," Ms. Hemingway says early on, acknowledging one possible dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the legacy she inherited is twofold.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a matter of famous ancestry and also of mental-health challenges: The suicide of her paternal grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, was only one of several in the family, and the issue (despite a glib phrase in circulation, "the Hemingway curse") is not romanticized here.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms. Kopple follows Ms. Hemingway while she visits with her family; gives speeches about mental health or her stabilizing wellness regime; and pursues ultimate workouts with a male companion.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the film keeps doubling back, through archival footage, to the painful trajectory of her high-flying sister Margaux, a brash model who committed suicide in 1996, and to the alcohol-fueled rancor of her parents.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms. Kopple skillfully deploys Ms. Hemingway's awkward attempts at heart-to-hearts as illustrations of relationships and stations in life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Hemingway's daughters, Dree and Langley, enjoy success yet make tellingly different acknowledgments in the film about both parts of their legacy.</seg>
<seg id="15">And an excruciatingly pleasant reunion with Ms. Hemingway's other sister, the often-institutionalized Joan (a.k.a.</seg>
<seg id="16">Muffet), says more in what goes unvoiced about distance, resentment and guilt.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Running From Crazy" - the title is Ms. Hemingway's phrasing - doesn't entirely escape the dangers of the confessional profile.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Ms. Kopple shows how people in Ms. Hemingway's position, with a family history of mental-health problems, confront a foreboding mirror, whether or not it also reflects a literary heritage and a Kennedy-grade bone structure.</seg>
<seg id="19">Running From Crazy</seg>
<seg id="20">Directed by Barbara Kopple; directors of photography, Andrew Young, Michael Call, Boone Speed and Phil Parmet; edited by Michael Culbya and Mona Davis; produced by Ms. Kopple and David Cassidy; released by Oprah Winfrey Network.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jumbo on the search for the "world's best ham": For the TV programme "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter established one thing right from the outset: The most important thing when it comes to ham are the legs of pork - turbo fattening does not provide a good basis for this.</seg>
<seg id="4">Can ham bought in a supermarket be as good as a quality product?</seg>
<seg id="5">Uli, boss of the large ham factory in Schwarzwald, explained to Jumbo how the Bonndorf company, "Adler", operates.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Germany's most-loved ham," said Jumbo, presenting the Black Forest ham.</seg>
<seg id="7">He could only enter the factory when wearing hair protection and a white coat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jumbo also had to first disinfect his hands before he could reach for the microphone.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jumbo seen getting something to keep him going at a fast food restaurant in Waldshut</seg>
<seg id="10">"Here they work with huge quantities," commented the television producers, astonished by the mass production of Black Forest ham.</seg>
<seg id="11">16,000 joints of meat per week speak for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="12">Weight, fat content and colour: Uli explained what was required for the best quality.</seg>
<seg id="13">The majority of the pigs are slaughtered at six months old.</seg>
<seg id="14">Television with standards?</seg>
<seg id="15">Even specific details such as the pH value of the meat play a role.</seg>
<seg id="16">The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I would be curious what would happen if you were to measure Roberto Blanco," said Jumbo cynically.</seg>
<seg id="18">Here the standard of private television production is presented in its purest form.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nonetheless, it is worth watching.</seg>
<seg id="20">The viewer sees that joints are still carved by hand.</seg>
<seg id="21">After all: Black Forest ham traditionally arrives on the shelf boneless.</seg>
<seg id="22">The secret of the ham is the mix of herbs combined with salt.</seg>
<seg id="23">The appearance of the smoking tower and furnace remind Jumbo of a submarine.</seg>
<seg id="24">The trick: Here fir branches in the smoker provide the special flavour of Black Forest ham.</seg>
<seg id="25">After 20 days in the smoke, the ham is finally almost black.</seg>
<seg id="26">"And now the slice will disappear inside Jumbo," he said, announcing his sampling of the product.</seg>
<seg id="27">"That is really delicious," said the TV star in conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="28">All those involved will be happy with that evaluation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Prolific goalscorer: Berisha is off contract at the end of the A-League season.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brisbane Roar general manager Sean Dobson is under no illusion the suitors will come thick and fast for star striker Besart Berisha, but has backed the club to keep his services should he stay in the A-League.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 28-year-old Albanian is in the final year of his current deal and Sydney FC are among rival outfits tipped to make a serious play now he has entered the final six months of his contract, which allows him to discuss potential offers if given permission by the Roar.</seg>
<seg id="5">A move for Berisha is understood to have been a major topic of discussion within the Sky Blues following their 4-0 rout to the Roar a fortnight ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Besart Berisha has become a cult figure among the Brisbane Roar faithful.</seg>
<seg id="7">Photo: Jonathan Carroll</seg>
<seg id="8">Sydney FC have one visa spot available after releasing Dutch defender Pascal Bosschaart last week and Frank Farina confirmed they have still have enough space within the salary cap to sign another player.</seg>
<seg id="9">But prying Berisha from the Roar won't be easy, given the striker has established himself as a cult figure in the orange shirt and has settled happily into the river city with his young family.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dobson said it would come as no surprise that rivals would circle and the club had already started informal discussions regarding Berisha's future.</seg>
<seg id="11">""We wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="12">But we've been talking for a couple of months and things are looking good.</seg>
<seg id="13">You never count your chickens in this game and we're well aware there's going to be competition," Dobson said.</seg>
<seg id="14">""I think what we can offer, the side we've put together and the style of football we play, is something he won't be able to get anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="15">The decision is his and that what makes the game great - there's always going to be some tension around free agents.""</seg>
<seg id="16">While the Roar remain confident that can keep Berisha should he choose to remain in Australia, fending off cashed-up raids from Europe, Asia or the Middle East won't be quite as simple for Brisbane and their billionaire Indonesian owners, the Bakrie Group.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sydney FC have generally opted for the high-profile international act to help bring the crowds, with Dwight Yorke, Juninho and now Allesandro Del Pierro the star attraction.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with the Italian striker unlikely to return next season, it would allow the Sky Blues to lash out if they wanted Berisha, who has a superb strike rate up front (36 goals in 58 games) and would no doubt he a huge hit with the Sydney faithful.</seg>
<seg id="19">""He's a bit like Kevin Muscat at the Victory a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">People love to hate him but you'd love to have him on your team.</seg>
<seg id="21">Bes knows where we are at, we know where he is and we think we can get to a positive resolution,"" Dobson said.</seg>
<seg id="22">""Other clubs will no doubt take a crack when the time is appropriate."</seg>

<seg id="6">Resuming at 4-369, WA's Jim Allenby and Ashton Turner wasted little time picking up where the rest of the batting card left off yesterday, crafting eight boundaries in the opening half-hour.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chris Tremlett (0-88) was unable to find a breakthrough for the second straight day, but his replacement from the Lillee Marsh end, Steve Finn, had immediate success.</seg>
<seg id="8">Finn struck with just his third ball of the morning, trapping Allenby LBW for 53.</seg>
<seg id="9">Finn could have had another soon after as a pull shot from Triffitt flew just wide of the deep square leg fielder, but the worst miss of the morning was yet to come.</seg>

<seg id="8">However, the reason for the desire to move is not arachnophobia, but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their house, and inside their home in their old age, she explained.</seg>
<seg id="9">Furthermore: Since undergoing a meniscus operation, the lady, in her mid-fifties, has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only recently, she released a book on the subject of "Living happily in old age - Which type of property is the best for me?".</seg>
<seg id="11">"Our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn't work in old age," she begins to recount.</seg>
<seg id="12">When she moved to the maisonette with her husband 20 years ago, it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now, in her mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries has different thoughts about it.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.</seg>
<seg id="15">The majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">Only other people get old, she says, smirking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only when the psychological strain becomes severe do people give it consideration.</seg>
<seg id="18">"But at this stage it can be too late," said Ries.</seg>
<seg id="19">In her book, the interior decorator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age.</seg>
<seg id="20">"However, which type of residence you choose is always a personal decision," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is no solution to overcoming old age.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even if you can afford to spend your retirement in Tuscany or Brittany, you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="23">And: 'Without a sound knowledge of the local language, you can even become lonely when living the dolce vita,' added the author, providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad.</seg>
<seg id="24">Her models include classic care models, alternative living arrangements and the often-mentioned pensioners' living community.</seg>
<seg id="25">In old age everyone has their quirks and ticks.</seg>
<seg id="26">'However, this type of residential community would not be for me,' she commented with a wink.</seg>
<seg id="27">Definitely nothing like student accommodation with a shared bathroom and kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="28">'In old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to,' said Ries.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pensioners' residential community can work.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it must operate differently to the classic student digs.</seg>
<seg id="31">And sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet,' she believes.</seg>
<seg id="32">With this opinion she is at least not alone in the State Capital.</seg>
<seg id="33">The experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the citizen's Life in Old Age service in the State Capital, is also that 'the majority of old people in Stuttgart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible'.</seg>
<seg id="34">Her agency agency advises people on the topic of 'growing old'.</seg>
<seg id="35">Therefore the experience of the Stiftung Warentest consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept inconveniences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nowadays there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barrier-free.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ries recommends that all those working on the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in-depth information and don't simply use the first tradesman that comes along.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nowadays there are specialists in renovation to suit the needs of the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even in the case of rental apartments some landlords can have this work carried out, even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat, clarified the interior designer.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free, even if it is as beautiful as ever.</seg>
<seg id="41">Waltraud Ries had to go through this experience herself.</seg>
<seg id="42">You could of course install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the cobbled path up to the door of the apartment, featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="43">She will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.</seg>
<seg id="44">She is more afraid of the move than of the spider on her front door.</seg>

<seg id="1">CFTC hit by budget constraints</seg>
<seg id="2">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission may have to forgo or delay certain investigations because of budget constraints as the agency works on setting priorities for the new fiscal year, agency officials said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The pressure is affecting morale and the CFTC's ability to retain and attract talent, they added.</seg>
<seg id="4">Employee sentiment was already down since the CFTC was the only regulatory agency that was essentially closed during the US government shutdown earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">IN Markets Regulation</seg>
<seg id="6">"One of the greatest threats to well-functioning, open, and competitive swaps and futures markets is that the agency tasked with overseeing them is not sized to the task at hand," said CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler in a speech Thursday, who added the agency has had to shrink 5 per cent because of budget issues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The agency is going through a strategic planning process, which is usually a routine practice.</seg>
<seg id="8">But this year, the agency is being forced to make tough choices because it does not have the money to fund all of its duties, especially because it now has added responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank legislation, said CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton.</seg>
<seg id="9">That may mean the CFTC will have to farm out certain issues to others, like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or rely on the National Futures Association to take on more self-regulatory functions because the CFTC cannot perform those duties, according to Mr Chilton.</seg>
<seg id="10">We will not be able to do everything Congress instructed us to do.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Everything is going to be slowed down," Mr Chilton said.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is going to be a lot more trial by fire rather than good, thoughtful governance because we just don't have the people.</seg>
<seg id="13">Another agency official said there would be "significant delays" in cases the CFTC investigates and in less egregious allegations, the agency may have to forgo enforcement efforts all together.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CFTC has stepped up enforcement cases in recent years and recently handed over $1bn in settlement money to the US Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="15">That includes hundreds of millions of dollars in fines related to the manipulation of Libor rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the meantime, several companies seeking clarifications from the CFTC on recently issued rules regarding swaps dealer registration and other matters have been waiting more than six months for an answer, people familiar with the matter said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's hard to make plans and figure out what is going on when all we get is silence," said one energy firm that is trying to find out if it needs to register as a swaps dealer.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CFTC is concentrating its resources on finishing rulemaking requirements from the Dodd-Frank bill, and therefore, does not have the staff to answer questions in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Gensler has also complained that the CFTC does not have the money to visit swaps dealers to ensure compliance.</seg>
<seg id="20">The agency, which has about 700 employees, relies on Congress for its budget appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Earlier this year, the Republican-dominated House of Representatives approved maintaining the current CFTC funding level of $195m, which is less than the Obama administration's 2014 fiscal year budget request of $315m.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, CFTC employees may be furloughed for as many as 14 days in this fiscal year, which began on October 1.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because Republican lawmakers have complained about CFTC over-reach, it is unlikely that they will get the full budget requested by the government.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vienna Airport abolishes passenger call-outs</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr. Max Maier, please make your way to Gate 24.</seg>
<seg id="3">In future, announcements such as this will no longer happen at Vienna International Airport.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority of loudspeaker announcements will cease - thus considerably reducing the noise level.</seg>
<seg id="5">The goal of this adjustment is to create a more relaxing atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">As airport spokesperson Peter Kleeman announced to Radio Vienna that in adjusting the approach towards announcements, Vienna Airport is following an international trend.</seg>
<seg id="7">Among others, the airports in Kopenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai have already done away with the noisy call-outs.</seg>
<seg id="8">By doing away with these announcements - on average around 200 personal call-outs come through the loudspeakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be calmer in future.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Experience has also shown that these individual announcements are relatively seldom taken notice of, and at the same time, all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them," said Kleeman while chatting to the radio broadcaster.</seg>

<seg id="2">Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scotland Yard said they had served a "surrender notice" on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fearing Stockholm would pass him on to the US, he sought refuge at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.</seg>
<seg id="6">Scotland Yard has "served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing," a spokesman said.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash</seg>
<seg id="2">The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.</seg>
<seg id="3">"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The issue will be resolved this evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.</seg>
<seg id="8">No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.</seg>
<seg id="12">The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cowell under fire for smoking beside his pregnant lover: Health campaigners warn X Factor mogul of damage he could cause unborn son</seg>
<seg id="2">TV mogul, 54, is self-confessed nicotine addict who enjoys a puff 'after sex'</seg>
<seg id="3">He has been photographed indulging habit round pregnant Lauren Silverman</seg>
<seg id="4">Action on Smoking and Health: 'Tobacco smoke can harm unborn child'</seg>
<seg id="5">By Alasdair Glennie</seg>
<seg id="6">Now he is to be a father, you might think Simon Cowell would want to start looking after himself - and his pregnant girlfriend - a little better.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it seems even the responsibilities of impending parenthood can't stop the TV mogul from lighting up a cigarette.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 54-year-old has been spotted smoking in the company of Lauren Silverman in the past weeks, leading to fears his habit could harm his unborn baby.</seg>
<seg id="9">Habit: Simon Cowell lights up as he leaves St Martin's Theatre, London, with New York socialite Lauren Silverman, who is reportedly carrying his child.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was criticised by the charity Action on Smoking and Health</seg>
<seg id="11">Lighting up: The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent star once confessed he started smoking at the age of eight</seg>
<seg id="12">Pictures of him puffing away by her side even prompted health charity Action on Smoking and Health to warn all pregnant women to avoid passive smoke because of the increased risks of congenital abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">After studying images of the pair, the charity's research manager Amanda Sandford said: "Tobacco smoke is toxic and can harm the unborn child so it's really important that pregnant women avoid breathing in tobacco smoke, whether through active or passive smoking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Studies show that babies born to women who were exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy are at greater risk of having a low birth weight, congenital abnormalities and are also at increased risk of dying shortly after birth.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cowell is a self-confessed nicotine addict, and once admitted he started smoking at the age of eight.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, he tried to kick his 40-a-day menthols habit by switching to smokeless electric cigarettes instead.</seg>
<seg id="17">The mogul recently said he felt he would be a good father despite not having a natural affinity with babies</seg>
<seg id="18">But he was soon back on the tobacco, admitting: "I equate smoking with having a good time."</seg>
<seg id="19">I shouldn't be saying this but, well, they're not illegal, are they?</seg>
<seg id="20">After sex - amazing.</seg>
<seg id="21">Last month, Cowell had a cigarette in his hand when he and 36-year-old Miss Silverman - who is five months pregnant - went out to dinner in New York.</seg>
<seg id="22">And he was smoking again over the weekend as they walked side by side down the street in Beverly Hills on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="23">The X Factor boss recently said he felt he would be a good father despite not having a natural affinity with babies.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said: "I'm not brilliant with babies.</seg>
<seg id="25">I never know what to do.</seg>
<seg id="26">But [once it's older] I think I'll be a good dad in terms of advice.</seg>
<seg id="27">And then I'll get to do all the things I want to do, like go to Disneyland or Universal Studios, teach him how to drive - I love all that.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, he added he would "100% absolutely not" change the child's nappies.</seg>
<seg id="29">Miss Silverman divorced her husband in August after it was revealed she was carrying Cowell's child.</seg>
<seg id="30">The New York socialite has told friends she wants to marry him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sydney form holds the key to classic Derby</seg>
<seg id="2">THE distinct class edge of Complacent is neutralised by his wide gate in Saturday's Victoria Derby at Flemington.</seg>
<seg id="3">Complacent is rated on 102 by Victorian handicappers and the next highest are Criterion (94) and Savvy Nature (92).</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the Complacent figures were earned at his past two starts, drawing the rails barrier, whereas Kerrin McEvoy will launch him from 14 in the classic if the two reserves come out.</seg>
<seg id="5">Derby fave: James McDonald and Savvy Nature win the Vase.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dom Beirne, the Betfair form analyst, reckons the Peter Snowden pair Complacent and San Diego (six) will go forward but the jockeying for positions to the first turn will be vital.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rails barrier will be a "godsend" to local three-year-old Polanski, Beirne says, because he should box seat.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Notions that Savvy Nature (11) would be ridden closer from a good barrier draw have to be dismissed completely," Beirne said.</seg>
<seg id="9">If jockey James McDonald is in any doubt, tie him to a lounge chair and make him view replays of his ride on It's A Dundeel in the Cox Plate last Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="10">After watching the race 20 or 30 times, find the tape of Arena winning the 1998 VRC Derby from barrier 14 and show him that 20 or 30 times.</seg>
<seg id="11">Larry Cassidy, on Arena, was following the instructions of astute owner "Big" Jack Ingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Come out and go back to last," he was told.</seg>
<seg id="13">For most of the race, Cassidy scouted the rail; Racenet maintained that Arena couldn't afford to give ground away "circling the field."</seg>
<seg id="14">Riding for luck obviously came into play but McDonald can be more relaxed on Savvy Dancer going back to the tail.</seg>
<seg id="15">While Beirne sees Polanski, successful in the Norman Robinson at Caulfield last start beating San Diego, getting a smooth passage, only one winner of that race has taken the Victoria Derby in the past 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="16">San Diego, to my eye, had more scope for improvement at Caulfield.</seg>
<seg id="17">Certainly the Moonee Valley Vase, going to Savvy Nature last Saturday against common opposition, has been a better guide than the Norman Robinson.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beirne has Savvy Nature, from the John O'Shea stable, on top with Polanski a saver.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps Savvy Nature was beaten in the Spring Champion Stakes at Randwick two starts back by Complacent which had a perfect run.</seg>
<seg id="20">Savvy Nature has had the benefit of another race and blinkers.</seg>
<seg id="21">I'm comfortable with McDonald.</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe his It's A Dundeel effort wasn't flash but the entire was under a fitness cloud.</seg>
<seg id="23">A week earlier, McDonald's navigation from the 18 gate on minor placegetter Dear Demi in the Caulfield Cup was exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="24">I'm going for Sydney form and the gamble that Complacent will have to work much harder than before.</seg>
<seg id="25">Verdict: Savvy Nature 1, Complacent 2, Criterion 3, San Diego 4.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bart Cummings influence in the Carbine Club Stakes goes back to Think Big taking the 1600-metre test for three-year-olds in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="27">Subsequent winners for him include Saintly (1995) and Lunar Rise last year, so Saintly Lad, prepared by him and grandson James, has to be considered, despite a poor Victorian handicap rating.</seg>
<seg id="28">Saintly Lad, a promising but somewhat erratic maiden, is on only 64, while favourite Hucklebuck, from Adelaide, is at 80 and has to give Saintly Lad only a kilo.</seg>
<seg id="29">Team Cummings has dispensed with blinkers on Saintly Lad which will have a noseroll applied.</seg>
<seg id="30">He's also taking on the Gai Waterhouse three-year-old, Equator, another on 80.</seg>
<seg id="31">Equator was a reasonable sixth, beaten 3.2 lengths, in the group 1 Spring Champion Stakes at Randwick on October 12.</seg>
<seg id="32">Back in class and distance, with Glen Boss up, should suit him.</seg>
<seg id="33">Verdict: Equator 1, Saintly Lad 2, Hucklebuck 3, Sir Andrew 4.</seg>
<seg id="34">Kelinni, a Chris Waller import, could be ready to produce his spring credentials in the Lexus following a setback before The Metrop at Randwick.</seg>
<seg id="35">Possibly he was ninth in the Caulfield Cup last start but downed less than three lengths.</seg>
<seg id="36">Still Araldo has the best recent credentials, beating Sea Moon on a justifiable protest over the Flemington 2500 metres on October 5.</seg>
<seg id="37">And Sea Moon is very good, confirmed in the Herbert Power subsequently in which Let's Make Adeal, the granddaughter of Let's Elope, was knocked rotten.</seg>
<seg id="38">Verdict: Araldo 1, Kelinni 2, Ironstein 3, Kingdoms 4.</seg>
<seg id="39">Considering the short odds about Zoustar, Missy Longstocking for the place is the best gamble in the Coolmore Stud Stakes in the opinion of Beirne.</seg>
<seg id="40">The straight-six course concerns me about Zoustar having his first attempt but not enough to take him on, particularly if the colt gets to a black price.</seg>
<seg id="41">Divine Calling appeals as the danger.</seg>
<seg id="42">Divine Calling was beaten a length by Zoustar at Hawkesbury in May but while the Chris Waller colt has improved considerably, so has Divine Calling, particularly in Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="43">Coming back from the 1600m of the Caulfield Guineas when a gallant second isn't a big hurdle.</seg>
<seg id="44">Verdict: Zoustar 1, Divine Calling 2, Missy Longstocking 3, Thump 4.</seg>
<seg id="45">Pakal, in the Mackinnon Stakes, is a best bet from bookmaker Tom Waterhouse.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Carried 60kg to victory last start in his dominant Cranbourne Cup win," Waterhouse wrote on the Racenet poll of leading betting houses.</seg>
<seg id="47">[Runner-up] Sertorius since franked form winning the Bendigo Cup.</seg>
<seg id="48">Majority of field unsuited dropping back from 2400m of Caulfield Cup.</seg>
<seg id="49">Despite the Cranbourne Cup only being a listed event, Pakal has a 107 rating, while the best in the weight-for-age Mackinnon is Solzhenitsyn on 114.</seg>
<seg id="50">Solzhenitsyn is untested over the 2000m trip but has the benefit of Rob Heathcote and Nash Rawiller.</seg>
<seg id="51">Heathcote horses are just so consistent.</seg>
<seg id="52">Of course Jet Away, the David Hayes import, is the favourite and put up what was described as an "amazing" fourth after pulling hard in the Caulfield Cup a fortnight ago.</seg>
<seg id="53">With a crossover noseband and Glen Boss atop he should settle better from the rails gate, particularly as stewards have been notified that Mourayan intends to lead.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watch Moriarty though.</seg>

<seg id="1">Home Office's 'Go Home' immigration vans campaign overwhelmed by hoax texts and calls</seg>
<seg id="2">Two thirds of text messages and one in seven of the phone calls were hoaxes, according to the study which was published on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The figures show that the campaign, dubbed Operation Vaken by officials, received 1,653 enquiries to its text or telephone lines.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only a tiny fraction of the texts and phone calls - just 58 or 3 per cent - were from genuine individuals, the Home Office said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report showed that despite the hoax calls, the scheme which resulted in 60 migrants leaving voluntarily was financially a success, with hundreds of thousands of pounds saved by not having to forcibly remove the immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mark Harper, the Immigration minister, suggested that while the advertising vans would not be used again, the campaign could continue.Mr Harper told MPs: "The advertising vans in particular were too much of a blunt instrument and will not be used again."</seg>
<seg id="7">But he said: "The most cost-effective communications were the adverts, leaflets and posters that advertised immigration surgeries in faith and charity groups, rather than the advertising vans or other forms of advertising used in the operation."</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Harper added: "The Government will continue to enforce the immigration rules and promote voluntary departure schemes to those who have no right to be in the UK - backed up with arrest, detention and enforced removal where individuals refuse to comply with the immigration rules or present a danger to the UK public."</seg>

<seg id="4">On Saturday 26 October, this exceptional mass will be heard from 7.00 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Marinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October, from 10.15, at the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.</seg>
<seg id="5">The so-called 'German Mass', with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des heiliges Opfers der Messe" (Songs to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the mass), D 872, is a spiritual work by composer Franz Schubert, dating from 1826, at at the time it was written was considered almost revolutionary.</seg>
<seg id="6">Patron Johan Philipp Neumann has in mind for the mass to be performed as part of the church services.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under the directorship of Hermann Schneider, the choir will be accompanied by the wind ensemble of the Frohsinn Tennenbronn Music Society, and by Noemi Lokodi on the organ.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trio boss probe ends for lack of evidence</seg>
<seg id="2">THE corporate regulator and the Australian Federal Police yesterday closed an international investigation into the alleged mastermind behind the failed $176 million Trio Capital, citing insufficient evidence.</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement came as the Australian Securities & Investments Commission released an update on Trio, which collapsed in 2009, and a former executive of the company pleaded guilty to 20 criminal charges in a Sydney court.</seg>
<seg id="4">Trio Capital investment manager Tony Maher, who changed his name from Paul Gresham, pleaded guilty in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court yesterday to charges including publishing false or misleading statements to create financial advantage.</seg>
<seg id="5">The charges related to Trio's ARP Growth Fund, of which Mr Maher had been a sole director.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fund was based in the British Virgin Islands and had held about $58m of investor funds before Trio collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Maher admitted to making false and misleading statements that led to Trio paying $500,000 to PST Management, which acted as investment manager for ARP.</seg>
<seg id="8">ASIC said it would cease the investigation into Jack Flader Jr, who it alleged was Trio's "ultimate controller," on the grounds it had insufficient evidence to prove wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="9">The regulator said in June it did not have sufficient grounds to launch action against Mr Flader.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yesterday it said it was abandoning that investigation.</seg>
<seg id="11">"ASIC, the AFP and our overseas regulatory counterparts have sought to obtain extra evidence to establish that Mr Flader breached Australian law," the regulator said.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, despite this work, there is insufficient evidence to prove Mr Flader breached Australian law.</seg>
<seg id="13">In these circumstances, ASIC is now finalising its investigation of Mr Flader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Trio Capital had moved investors' funds to the British Virgin Islands tax haven between 2004 and 2009 as part of the fraud, with $176m owned by self-managed superannuation fund members and direct investors moving offshore.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a parliamentary joint committee inquiry into Trio's collapse criticised ASIC over its handling of the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="16">The committee described the collapse as the "largest super fraud in Australian history."</seg>
<seg id="17">It called for "a much more rigorous criminal investigation, involving ASIC, APRA and the Australian Federal Police."</seg>
<seg id="18">The corporate regulator is gearing up to front an inquiry into its own effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="19">A date for that inquiry has not been set.</seg>
<seg id="20">Only one person has been jailed so far over the Trio collapse.</seg>
<seg id="21">Shawn Richard, a former investment manager with the group's Astarra Strategic Fund, was jailed in 2011 for 2 1/2 years after pleading guilty to two charges of dishonest conduct in carrying on a financial services business and to making a false statement about a financial product.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr Maher was released yesterday on conditional bail.</seg>
<seg id="23">He will be sentenced in the Sydney District Court on November 8.</seg>

<seg id="1">Council sets its sights on rail system</seg>
<seg id="2">Should the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing be reconstructed at great cost, in order to increase traffic safety?</seg>
<seg id="3">The Town Councils have decided that the answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Schiltach will have to contribute up to EUR 220,000 to the project.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Deutsche Bahn hopes to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="6">In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - collisions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they will be required to contribute one third of the costs, with the remainder divided between Deutsche Bahn and the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="8">Schiltach's town master mason, Roland Grießhaber, explained the peculiarities of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing to the Town Council.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the crossing, the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line.</seg>
<seg id="10">Larger vehicles, for example those that transport long logs, would be able to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic, without having to block the railway line.</seg>
<seg id="11">Grießhaber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course widen the adjoining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the subject of controversial discussion in the Town Council, as some council members cast doubt over the need to widen the road: Thomas Kipp summarised the perspective of the critics with this statement: "Do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles?"</seg>
<seg id="13">Mayor Thomas Haas retorted: The "Hirschen" railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is occasionally transported via this route, as the vehicles, which measure 20 metres in length, would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse.</seg>
<seg id="15">Furthermore, when the Hauptstrasse is blocked, the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel, argued Haas.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given that it is likely that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel will have to be reconstructed and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The councillors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was consented to by a majority, on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could, if required, extend the connecting road in the "Bahnhofstraße" direction to around 5.5 metres to accommodate oncoming traffic.</seg>
<seg id="19">The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could, on the other hand, bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep "Geroltzhäuser Weg".</seg>
<seg id="20">The Administrative Department had Deutsche Bahn's reconstruction plans investigated by the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg will be straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="21">The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck.</seg>
<seg id="22">The town, as the authority responsible for road construction, would then bear responsibility for this.</seg>
<seg id="23">The reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are, the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be consented to, argued Haas.</seg>
<seg id="25">At this point, the risk of a train collision with a vehicle positioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway crossings, on account of the fact that there is a midpoint from which there is a good line of sight, directly alongside the stopping point.</seg>
<seg id="26">The trains themselves, coming from the central station, must also be sufficiently slowed down so that there is no threat of collision.</seg>
<seg id="27">According to the councillors, the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority, as the town of Schiltach would "bear the brunt of the cost" for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck, since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="28">The committee considers the reconstruction of the "Vor Heubach" and 'Vor Kuhbach" railway crossings, for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bahn, to be unproblematic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="3">No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="6">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gender" on their official documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.</seg>
<seg id="25">German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="33">And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">He was given female hormones at age 12.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found out was horrifying.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.</seg>
<seg id="58">Surgery rendered him infertile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigma."</seg>
<seg id="61">"A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'" she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid it will encourage intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law is about assigning it at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'</seg>
<seg id="78">This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.</seg>
<seg id="80">We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.</seg>
<seg id="83">It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Allegory and Illusion," at the Rubin Museum</seg>
<seg id="2">Alkazi Collection of Photography</seg>
<seg id="3">Allegory and Illusion, at the Rubin Museum, focuses on 19th- and early-20th-century photography in South Asia, like these paint-enriched portraits of Dev Shamshere Rana and his wife Krishna Kumari of Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="4">A new show of portrait photography at the Rubin Museum of Art, "Allegory and Illusion" is a fascinating little piece of a very complicated puzzle.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ostensibly a focused, regional exhibition, it has much to say about the larger relationship between photography and colonialism (a subject big enough to fill several museums).</seg>
<seg id="6">Featuring material from India, Burma (now Myanmar), Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and Nepal, the show, whose subtitle is "Early Portrait Photography From South Asia," tracks the spread of photography from the mid-19th to early-20th centuries through areas that were then under British rule or influence.</seg>
<seg id="7">It includes many different forms of early photography, representing an array of markets and social classes: There are grand portraits of Nepalese royals, and palm-size cartes de visite for the masses; ethnographic albums by British photographers; and hand-painted photographs from Indian portrait studios.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some of those objects fit the standard narrative of early photography, the one we know from countless exhibitions on America and Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cartes de visite craze, for instance, parallels the one that swept America around the time of the Civil War.</seg>
<seg id="10">And a portrait of an Afghan tribesman by the British photographer Randolph Bezzant Holmes demonstrates fidelity to the pictorial aesthetic of Victorian photographers like Julia Margaret Cameron (who was, it's worth noting, the daughter of an East India Company official).</seg>
<seg id="11">Other items on display make photography out to be a tool of colonialist suppression; the 1868 ethnographic album "People of India," with its summary treatment of some 480 different castes, races and tribes, or the portrait of a snake charmer that treats photography as an extension of the "Company School" tradition of picturesque paintings made for East India Company officials.</seg>
<seg id="12">But still others show South Asians adapting photography to their own art traditions.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is particularly true of the portraits from India, which are often painted over in vivid colors and sometimes even embellished (as in a portrait of a Gujarati nobleman whose costume and sword have been adorned with velvet, sequins and gold-colored wire.)</seg>
<seg id="14">As the curators note, some of these works might be mistaken for miniature paintings.</seg>
<seg id="15">The photography scholar Christopher Pinney, writing in the catalog, goes so far as to refer to photography in colonial India as "a form of late painting."</seg>
<seg id="16">In a court portrait of Maharajah Venkat Raman Singh, the ruler of the princely state of Rewa, the figure is isolated against a flat, color-blocked background, and the underlying gelatin silver print is barely visible beneath the layers of oil paint.</seg>
<seg id="17">India, not surprisingly, is the source of roughly half the works in the show (which was organized by Beth Citron, an assistant curator at the Rubin, and Rahaab Allana, curator of the Alkazi Foundation for the Arts in New Delhi.)</seg>
<seg id="18">Most of the photographs from India, Burma and Nepal are studio portraits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the images from Ceylon, most of them taken by British photography studios like Skeen and Scowen, place figures in the landscape - the better to portray this small island colony, a center of coffee and tea production, as a land of plenty.</seg>
<seg id="20">One picture shows a group of aboriginal Vedda hunters posed outdoors with their bows and arrows.</seg>
<seg id="21">Another, less typical, depicts a boy from the "untouchable" Rodiya caste; a close-up, three-quarters view of his face, it seems more intimate and humane than the other ethnographic photos on view.</seg>
<seg id="22">The photographs from Nepal, in contrast, offer a glimpse of the royal life (and particularly the lives of princesses and maharanis, who were cloistered according to the custom of purdah).</seg>
<seg id="23">Nearly all of the images are formal court portraits, in which unsmiling faces peer out from the voluminous embroidered robes and heavy tiaras.</seg>
<seg id="24">What little we see of early photography in Burma comes mostly from the Italian-born British war photographer Felice Beato, who traveled throughout Asia (documenting the Crimean War right after Roger Fenton) and eventually set up shop in Burma.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the anonymous young women in his studio photographs wear traditional sarongs and clutch cheroots, or long Burmese cigars; their outfits may be a form of "passive resistance," as the curators suggest, but titles like "The Belle of Mandalay" imply a foreigner's exoticizing gaze.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Allegory and Illusion" presents us with many such conundrums: images that make it hard to tell whether photography was an accessory or a deterrent to colonial rule.</seg>
<seg id="27">This might be true even of the many images in the show that are, to us, overtly ethnographic; Mr. Pinney points out, in his essay, that India did not have much of a portrait culture before colonialism, and that its more "anonymized" tradition of figurative art may lend itself to less dehumanizing interpretations of these photographs.</seg>
<seg id="28">And the show, drawn entirely from the Alkazi's photography collection, has some notable gaps.</seg>
<seg id="29">What kind of portraiture, for instance, was happening outside the palaces in Nepal?</seg>
<seg id="30">At times, you wish the curators had just focused on India rather than offering a fragmentary picture of photography in some of the other British colonies.</seg>
<seg id="31">But, in the end, that's all right, because this is a teaser of a show: a call for further study of early photography, in South Asia and elsewhere in the colonial world.</seg>
<seg id="32">With time, you hope, the other pieces will fall into place.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Allegory and Illusion: Early Portrait Photography from South Asia" runs through Feb.</seg>
<seg id="34">10 at the Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea; 212-620-5000, rmanyc.org.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tourism: Descent to the Romans</seg>
<seg id="2">Beneath Cologne, a sewage channel from Roman times, measuring around 120 metres in length, has been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="3">Anyone visiting Cologne cannot miss the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two towers, measuring around 157 metres, extend into the heavens, making it Europe's second tallest church building.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, only a few visitors who marvel at the two ornate church towers realise that there is much to discover beneath the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rainer Schulze is an expert when it comes to the Cologne underworld.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre, right at the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tour begins in a somewhat unspectacular fashion: "We begin in the underground car park," says Schulze.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too tall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hurry past the Roman relics and simply drop off their car.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, anyone who takes a closer look on parking level D2 will discover an archaeological site, cordoned off by metal railings.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ruins measuring five metres tall, made from stones around the size of the palm of your hand, are waiting to be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="13">"These are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D," explains Schulze.</seg>
<seg id="14">Before returning to daylight, Schulze has participants take a glance into a dark, 15-metre shaft on the upper parking level.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is the well of the old cathedral, which is barely noticed at all these days.</seg>
<seg id="16">The next stop on the tour is the praetorium, where participants once again descend to the depths.</seg>
<seg id="17">Here we find the residence of what was once the most powerful man to the north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.</seg>
<seg id="18">One visitor wants to know what CCAA means.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which is basically amounts to "City under Roman Law and City of the Agrippinians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the Site of the Altars for the Imperial Cult".</seg>

<seg id="1">Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears</seg>
<seg id="2">Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had "never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation," the Commission was told.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.</seg>
<seg id="6">He conceded the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management "from myself down" failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.</seg>
<seg id="12">Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.</seg>
<seg id="19">YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">The hearing adjourned until December 20.</seg>

<seg id="1">You could call him the Dostoevsky of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2">Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysician, and to a certain extent his novels and stories also feature recurring themes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The external likeness is astounding: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.</seg>
<seg id="4">And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky - with his massive oeuvre - is considered the revealer and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is considered an American prophet, who is certainly highly esteemed within his own native country.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some titles have been released by the Heyne Verlag publishing house,the 'Haffman's cassette' featuring 118 stories was distributed by Zweitaudenseins.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dick illustrates America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, a fixation on security and the belief of having been chosen.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dick had 'God experiences', and his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps he was crazy, or perhaps drugs had affected his brain.</seg>
<seg id="9">He realised, early on, that computers are divinities.</seg>
<seg id="10">He wrote a 'Theology of the Computer' and questioned what separates humans from the machine, the creator from the creation.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is the "Blade Runner" problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">Killing.</seg>
<seg id="13">A master of science fiction.</seg>
<seg id="14">A fantastic writer.</seg>
<seg id="15">His stories have inspired film producers such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter story is now particularly significant.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Minority Report" originates from the year 1956, and exudes the scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.</seg>
<seg id="18">Here the principle of the "Pre-Crime" is developed, i.e. something that is now more or less official doctrine within the White House.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Dick's world, which is alarmingly similar to our own, mutants look into the future - and the police have access to this insight.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We arrest individuals who've broken no law," says the government official.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We get to them first, before they can commit an act of violence".</seg>
<seg id="22">And: "In our society we have no major crimes, but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals". They read time streams.</seg>
<seg id="23">They assume that bad things are going to happen and prevent the criminal thought turning into action.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dick's tale acts as a blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the phone tapping madness of the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="25">Anticipation of attack: This is also how Obama's drone philosophy and practices work.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, Dick's story is not yet finished.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Police Chief argues that there is no more division of power, the military controls daily life - and what is left of the State.</seg>
<seg id="28">Then the watcher is himself being watched and is convicted of a future crime.</seg>
<seg id="29">The system slips up.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is perfect, but it lies.</seg>
<seg id="31">It devises its own conditions.</seg>
<seg id="32">It not only accepts errors and victims, but builds itself on them.</seg>
<seg id="33">The system creates the threat that it is fighting against.</seg>
<seg id="34">To read Philip K. Dick means to get closer to the truth, time and time again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Will the bottom fall out of the Cristiano Ronaldo market?</seg>
<seg id="2">He is the highest-paid footballer on earth, so it was inevitable that Cristiano Ronaldo would eventually enter the world of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today he did so in spectacular fashion by exposing his skimpy pants to the world's media in the historic centre of Madrid.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thankfully the Real Madrid and Portugal forward was fully dressed as he pulled off the covers from a 19m-tall image of himself at the Palacio de Cibeles.</seg>
<seg id="5">The poster, which hung off the side of the historic building, showed him wearing nothing but a pair of tight trunks and signalled his take on the latest must-have product for every footballer looking to create a global brand - their own range of underwear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The night before, Ronaldo had scored a hat-trick in his team's victory over Sevilla, but the launch of his CR7 underwear range has made waves off the pitch and drawn comparisons with David Beckham's brand empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">The range goes on sale on Friday from £10 to £25 a pair and has led to suggestions that, with Beckham's retirement, Ronaldo has his sights firmly set on becoming the world's most valuable football brand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Revenue from the collection will sit alongside his £15m salary from Real Madrid as well as endorsement deals from Nike, Emporio Armani, Castrol and KFC that contribute to his reported £27m-a-year income.</seg>
<seg id="9">The CR7 collection also includes socks, but none of these was visible as Ronaldo told reporters in Madrid that design and fashion were his "passions" and that he was "proud" of the collection, which is a result of a collaboration with the New York-based designer Richard Chai and the Danish textile firm JBS.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ronaldo is following a path first trodden by David Beckham, who has used the power of his personal brand to amass a £200m fortune, selling or endorsing everything from watches and cars to underwear for H&M and his own fragrance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mark Borkowski, the publicist and media commentator, said footballers know they need to be quick to make their fortune: "Every footballer knows that there is a sell-by date tattooed on their rump," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The machine around Ronaldo isn't as sleek or well-oiled as Beckham's operation, but that doesn't mean to say he can't be a high-end-fashion achiever.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to research conducted by Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University, Ronaldo has many of the qualities required to make a strong sports-player brand: "The research we've done shows you need to play for a big team, be successful and, just like film stars, be physically attractive, if you hope to follow Beckham's path to becoming more than just a player."</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Ronaldo does have some challenges to overcome in pursuing a global brand for himself, Professor Chadwick added.</seg>
<seg id="15">Unlike, say, Beckham, he has a reputation as being individualistic and quite selfish, which for a lot of sponsors and people isn't a great brand proposition.</seg>
<seg id="16">There's also a feeling that his management has a reputation for simply taking the money, rather than necessarily fashioning a brand, and that Ronaldo is just a famous footballer trying to make even more money.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Borkowski agreed that Ronaldo is "quite aloof" but pointed out that Beckham started out as an "oik" and was the "most-loathed human being on earth" after the 1998 World Cup, when he was sent off against Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite this, he went on to forge his own hugely successful brand.</seg>
<seg id="19">Earlier this week, Ronaldo suffered an embarrassing mishap while using social media to promote a CR7 competition.</seg>
<seg id="20">In a hastily removed tweet, he wrote: "Thank you all for participating in the CR7 Boys Underwear Competition - it's been a real pleasure to see all of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="21">He also hit the headlines last month after his sarcastic reply to comments made by the president of Fifa, Sepp Blatter, at an Oxford Union event.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr Blatter mocked him for racking up "more expenses for the hairdresser" than rival Barcelona player Lionel Messi.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ronaldo's response came on his Facebook page: "This video shows clearly the respect and consideration that Fifa has for me, for my club and my country."</seg>
<seg id="24">Much is explained now.</seg>
<seg id="25">I wish Mr Blatter health and a long life, with the certainty that he will continue to witness, as he deserves, the successes of his favourite teams and players.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nothing sweet about this debate</seg>
<seg id="2">Controversial: ABC's Catalyst described cholesterol medications as toxic and potentially deadly.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's the kind of vitriol usually reserved for climate science.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's not the future of the planet that's at stake but the future of what we put in our mouths.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last week, the ABC's television science program Catalyst claimed the causal link between saturated fat, cholesterol and heart disease was "the biggest myth in medical history."</seg>
<seg id="6">It followed up this week by describing cholesterol medications as toxic and potentially deadly.</seg>
<seg id="7">After seeing the first episode, Australia's top medicine safety expert, Professor Emily Banks, urged the ABC not to air the follow-up, lest it unjustifiably encourage people to go off their anti-cholesterol medications, known as statins.</seg>
<seg id="8">"If people stop using their statins . . . it's very likely that it will result in death," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Catalyst delved into a raging debate: has dietary guidance telling us to avoid fats pushed us towards more harmful sugar and carbohydrates instead?</seg>
<seg id="10">But the program also went a step further, arguing cholesterol was just an innocent bystander in the body's attempts to deal with the sugar-damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not a big leap to claim statins were dangerous, and the research supporting them fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="12">Most experts in the field say there are huge holes in this thesis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Somehow, among the tribal online world, the debate has turned into one where you are either with the argument, or against it.</seg>
<seg id="14">But could both sugar and fat contribute to heart disease?</seg>
<seg id="15">The National Heart Foundation says excess sugar consumption causing problems does not rule out high cholesterol as a danger.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Heart disease is multifactorial," chief executive Dr Lyn Roberts says.</seg>
<seg id="17">You have to look at a range of risk factors to know your risk for heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="18">She says increasing sugar consumption is one of many changes in our diet, including increasing portion sizes, that have changed over her lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="19">The National Prescribing Service says managing sugar intake is important, particularly for people at risk of both diabetes and heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">"But we certainly have a lot more evidence around the negative effects of higher than acceptable levels of cholesterol, I'm not sure there's such an evidence-base around blood sugar," manager of the service's MedicineWise phone line Sarah Spagnardi says.</seg>
<seg id="21">She says cholesterol medications work by lowering the level of "bad," or LDL cholesterol, while increasing "good" HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trial after trial has found that doing so is likely to cut the number of plaques that form in the arteries and restrict blood flow.</seg>
<seg id="23">Science writer Garry Taubes couldn't have said it better: "What you do in bad science is you ignore any evidence that's contrary to your beliefs, your hypothesis, and you only focus on the evidence that supports it," he told Catalyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">Catalyst focused heavily on the opinions of US experts - one of whom believes vaccines can cause autism and another who promotes chiropractic and chelation for heart problems - while downplaying the conclusions of other expert groups.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Cochrane Collaboration - the world's highest authority on medical evidence - published a review in January covering nearly 57,000 people, finding deaths, heart attack and stroke were all reduced among people taking statins.</seg>
<seg id="26">Or there's the 2007 study in the Lancet, which pooled data from almost 900,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="27">It's finding?</seg>
<seg id="28">The lower the cholesterol, the fewer heart disease deaths.</seg>
<seg id="29">The research referenced in Thursday's episode knowns as the "4S study" did not have its primary finding - "highly significant reductions in the risk of death and morbidity" - discussed.</seg>
<seg id="30">University of Melbourne media ethicist Dr Denis Muller says it's important programs like Catalyst discuss areas of medical debate and controversy.</seg>
<seg id="31">But there is a duty on the reporter to be fair about the quality of the science it's based on.</seg>
<seg id="32">University of Sydney professor of pharmacy Andrew McLachlan, who has not conducted industry-funded research into statins, says he was concerned by what he saw as a lack of balance to allow viewers to make their minds up.</seg>
<seg id="33">"A reasonable person would never take a medicine that some 'experts' refer to as 'toxic'," he says.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is strong and emotive language.</seg>
<seg id="35">McLachlan says the weight of evidence shows cholesterol medications are effective and their benefits outweigh harms in people at moderate to high risk of heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">The risks of side effects from the medication are real.</seg>
<seg id="37">Many users report muscle cramping, while the US Food and Drug Administration warns patients could experience impairments to thinking and memory and an increased risk of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="38">Little is known about how many Australians at low-risk of heart disease are inappropriately prescribed statins but evidence from the AusHEART study indicates it could be up to 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Head of the school of public health at the University of Sydney Professor Glenn Salkeld says part of the answer will lie in developing better decision aids where people can input their risk factors (such as weight) and preferences (such as not to take medication).</seg>
<seg id="40">In the end, he says people must also get the message that prevention is better than cure.</seg>
<seg id="41">We pay a high price, many billions of dollars, for not heeding this advice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Some people will benefit from taking a prescription drug and others will not.</seg>
<seg id="43">All compelling reasons to . . . start exercising and switch to a diet rich in fruit, vegetables and healthy fats, like the Mediterranean diet.</seg>
<seg id="44">NPS Medicines Line: 1300 633 424</seg>
<seg id="45">The sugar thesis explained</seg>
<seg id="46">Science writer Gary Taubes believes we have the diet story upside down.</seg>
<seg id="47">People who are fat either eat more, or exercise less.</seg>
<seg id="48">But what if their body's compulsion to store and hold fat is forcing them to eat more and stripping them of the energy for exercise?</seg>
<seg id="49">Sugar creates such a compulsion.</seg>
<seg id="50">It produces insulin, pushing fatty acids into fat cells and temporarily locking them there - removing a source of energy.</seg>
<seg id="51">Taubes says fat doesn't do that, yet the push to low-fat diets has shifted people from fat and towards sugar.</seg>
<seg id="52">He wants the traditional food pyramid turned on its head.</seg>
<seg id="53">Instead of being told to eat only small amounts of fat and large amounts of carbohydrate we should be told to do the reverse.</seg>
<seg id="54">But changing the advice would mean organisations such as the Heart Foundation admitting they have been wrong, as well as antagonising industry.</seg>
<seg id="55">How would the sugar industry cope if food producers tried to remove it from every processed product?</seg>
<seg id="56">Or the grains industry, if we were advised to abandon porridge, corn flakes and bread in the morning?</seg>

<seg id="1">Tablets on a Plane - NYTimes.com</seg>
<seg id="2">It took a while, but common sense has finally prevailed when it comes to the rules governing travelers" use of electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Aviation Administration announced on Thursday that passengers could soon be allowed to use tablet computers, e-books, music players and other devices in planes at almost all times as long as their wireless functions are disabled by putting the device in "airplane mode."</seg>
<seg id="4">The editorial board backed changing F.A.A."s policies earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">The F.A.A. has long resisted allowing passengers to use electronic devices once plane doors are closed and before aircraft reach 10,000 feet even when the gadgets were not transmitting data.</seg>
<seg id="6">To many passengers the restriction seemed illogical and it was widely flouted.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under the new F.A.A. guidelines, airlines can start allowing the use of electronic devices once they have proved to the agency that the gadgets will not interfere with navigation systems, avionics and other equipment.</seg>
<seg id="8">The agency expects that will happen by the end of the year in the case of many airlines.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers will still be forbidden from making cellphone calls on planes at all times under Federal Communications Commission rules.</seg>
<seg id="10">But they can connect their phones and other devices to the wireless Internet services provided (for a fee) by many airlines once planes have reached 10,000 feet.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new guidelines sensibly allow airline crews to require passengers to shut down devices in special circumstances like during periods of low-visibility, when some landing systems may not be able to tolerate electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="12">At least some of the credit for the F.A.A."s change of heart belongs to my colleague Nick Bilton who questioned the agency's policies on electronic devices as far back as 2011.</seg>
<seg id="13">He wrote:</seg>
<seg id="14">New technologies are often greeted with fear and that is certainly true of a disruptive technology like cellphones.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yet rules that are decades old persist without evidence to support the idea that someone reading an e-book or playing a video game during takeoff or landing is jeopardizing safety.</seg>

<seg id="1">Man shot by officer was "fighting everyone" outside homeless shelter, witness says</seg>
<seg id="2">When officers were called to the scene to break up the assault, the man turned on one of them, too, Fairfax County police said.</seg>
<seg id="3">An officer opened fire during the melee, hitting the man.</seg>
<seg id="4">Washington said she saw the aftermath from a shelter window.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The man was shot in the chest and the police were trying to stop his bleeding, but he was still fighting them," Washington said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The man, whom police have yet to identify, later died at a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several others injured in the assault were also taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries, police said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident remained under investigation Thursday and police did not give an indication of what might have set the man off.</seg>
<seg id="9">Washington said the man was a resident of the 50-bed shelter, near the Tulley Gate of the army base on Richmond Highway.</seg>
<seg id="10">The shooting is also being investigated by the police Internal Affairs bureau, which is standard in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="11">Marvin and Debra Britt, who live in an apartment near the shelter, said they heard the shooting unfold and said there was a large police and emergency response.</seg>
<seg id="12">Like others, they said they heard three shots fired.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I was sitting here on my laptop - then pop, pop, pop," Debra Britt said in her living room Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Marvin Britt said he saw at least four people loaded onto stretchers and taken to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">Britt said he had seen the victim sitting in front of a nearby 7-11 shortly before the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="16">He sometimes saw the man drinking near the side of the same store.</seg>
<seg id="17">Surveillance video from the 7-11 obtained by NBC 4 Washington showed the same man smashing a 2-liter bottle of soda and swiping items off a counter inside, apparently just after Britt saw the man at the store.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rev. Keary Kincannon of the Rising Hope United Methodist Church said the man was a regular at the church's soup kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kincannon said he was respectful, quiet and kept to himself.</seg>
<seg id="20">"When people asked him to help, he would pick up a broom or move food around the pantry," Kincannon said.</seg>
<seg id="21">He was more than willing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kincannon said he knew little of the man's background and did not know of any family in the area.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shooting comes two months after Fairfax County police shot a 46-year-old Springfield man at his home, following a call for a domestic dispute.</seg>
<seg id="24">John Geer's father said his son was unarmed at the time of the shooting, but there was a gun on a nearby staircase.</seg>
<seg id="25">The investigation into that case continues.</seg>

<seg id="2">BEIJING (Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party on Friday banned officials from sending or printing new year cards or calendars if they have been paid for with public funds, the latest step in the government's crackdown on waste, extravagance and graft.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The printing and production are more and more extravagant, and the waste is greater and greater," the central government said on its main website (www.gov.cn).</seg>
<seg id="4">This is not only an expression of formalism, but drives extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="5">The order covers all government and party departments, state-owned industries and financial bodies, though an exception will be made for those which deal with foreigners and overseas Chinese, as long as they rein in costs, the notice said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese President Xi Jinping has sought to address growing public anger at the illegal or unethical behavior of party officials, especially those with flamboyant lifestyles, often seen as a sign they are corrupt.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since taking office in March, Xi has called corruption a threat to the party's survival and vowed to go after powerful "tigers" as well as lowly "flies."</seg>

<seg id="2">ANOTHER general fled to Turkey from neighbouring Syria and joined the swelling ranks of rebel soldiers based close to the border, the Anatolia news agency reported today.</seg>
<seg id="3">The defection brought to 13 the number of generals seeking refuge in Turkey since the revolt against Syrian President Bashar al Assad's regime erupted 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition to the general, two colonels and some 30 soldiers flanked by their families crossed into Turkey late on Sunday, Anatolia said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The refugee camps in the southeastern provinces of Hatay, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa and Kilis shelter more than 33,000 Syrians, a number that surged after a recent escalation of violence in Syria, particularly in northwestern towns near the Turkish border.</seg>
<seg id="6">Monitoring groups say some 15,000 people have been killed in the uprising against the Assad regime, as UN officials say they fear a full-blown civil war in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="7">Turkey, once a close ally of Syria, summoned an emergency NATO meeting for on Tuesday after accusing Damascus of shooting down one of its military planes in international airspace.</seg>

<seg id="2">AN Argentine widow spent days in her late husband's tomb, setting up a bed, internet access and even a small cooker next to his coffin, officials said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police found Adriana Villareal had carried out some work in the tomb holding her husband's coffin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"She had a radio, a computer, internet, a chair and a small cooker," said local police commissioner Gustavo Braganza.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
<seg id="9">She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.</seg>
<seg id="11">An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.</seg>

<seg id="2">Andy Murray says he will only play in January's Australian Open if he is fit enough to win the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Wimbledon champion has begun rehabilitation work following an operation on his back last month.</seg>
<seg id="4">Recovery from the surgery to address a disc problem has prevented Murray from appearing at the ATP World Tour Finals in London in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You don't come back just to play a match," said Murray.</seg>
<seg id="6">If I come back I want to be in the shape to win it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Scot has finished as runner-up three times in Melbourne, losing the 2013 final in four sets to Novak Djokovic.</seg>

<seg id="15">You realise how much you miss from competition where you're away from it.</seg>
<seg id="16">It will be hard missing London, but I'll just have to make the best of it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nissan slashes full-year profit forecast by 15%</seg>
<seg id="2">Nissan slashed its full-year profit forecast by 15 per cent and removed its second-in-command after a disappointing quarter it blamed on volatile demand and recall-related costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Japan's second-largest carmaker by sales said on Friday it now expects net income of Y355bn ($3.6bn), down from its previous projection of Y420bn.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company announced that Toshiyuki Shiga, its longstanding chief operating officer and a man once considered a potential heir to chief executive Carlos Ghosn, will step aside, in a move seen responding to a series of recent missteps by the company as it rapidly expands.</seg>
<seg id="5">"So, we have a mixed bag," said Mr Ghosn.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nissan's problems in emerging markets during the quarter mirror a wider trend across the industry, with Volkswagen, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler this week all reporting cooling growth in markets such as South Asia and South America, with US demand sustaining much of the industry's profits.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Ghosn, who also runs Renault of France as part of an alliance, has staked his reputation and the future of the Japanese company on an aggressive push into emerging markets.</seg>
<seg id="8">This year the carmaker said it would resurrect the Datsun marque after an absence of more than 30 years and roll it out as a low-budget brand in India, followed by Indonesia, Russia and South Africa over the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="9">In September Nissan announced it would be the first international carmaker to build vehicles in Myanmar and begin assembling vehicles in Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Ghosn said that the group has been "stretched" during a quarter that saw nine factories either under construction or in the process of being expanded.</seg>
<seg id="11">That rapid ramp-up in sales and market penetration has exposed some issues at the Japanese carmaker, such as production niggles in Russia and strategic mistakes in Thailand, seen as reasons behind the moving of Mr Shiga to a vice-chairman role after eight years as COO.</seg>
<seg id="12">His responsibilities will be split between three men reporting directly to the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a departure from Nissan's typical modus operandi Mr Ghosn presented the quarterly results himself on Friday, saying he wanted to demonstrate he was taking steps to overcome the disappointing performance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The average age of the executive team is too high . . . we want to do this renewal in a progressive way," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nobody is taking it as a kind of punishment . . .</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't want to give the impression there are tensions or conflicts, this has been done in good understanding.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Shiga's move comes just two months after Mr Ghosn reshuffled the Renault top management after the ousting of former COO Carlos Tavares, another man tipped for the top job, over public comments suggesting he could get a better job at a rival carmaker.</seg>
<seg id="18">The carmaker sold 2,439,000 vehicles in the first half, down 1.5 per cent compared with the same period the year before, but volumes increased in Japan and the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">In China, the world's biggest auto market, it sold 592,000 cars - a fall of 8.3 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is it ever OK to cry at work?</seg>
<seg id="2">Whilst there are some obvious scenarios such as the death of a loved one or some unexpected seriously bad news in which crying simply cannot be helped, the thought of public weeping makes me seriously uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="3">I hail from a long line of emotionally-repressed Celts and believe there is very much a time and a place for crying; namely never, ever in the office.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's not that I fear being assessed as weak, vulnerable or simply incapable, it's just not the way I am.</seg>
<seg id="5">But for some women the reaction of colleagues, particularly men, largely influences whether they feel it appropriate to shed a tear or not.</seg>
<seg id="6">Conflicted between offering a sympathetic shoulder or looking the other way, it's easy to see why they may start panicking when the tears start flowing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's my worst nightmare when my female colleagues start crying," says caterer Ali, 30.</seg>
<seg id="8">I want to help but I just freeze - my mind literally goes blank.</seg>
<seg id="9">They probably think I'm judging them or secretly rolling my eyes, but I just don't know how to react.</seg>
<seg id="10">This paralysis is something manager Patty, 42, has witnessed many times throughout her career.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Men go into panic mode when the floodgates open - science says that it even dramatically reduces their testosterone levels," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some seem to think that a patronising pat on the shoulder will make everything ok (it does not).</seg>
<seg id="13">Others see it as their time to shine as a knight in armour and attempt to solve the dilemma/seriously hurt whoever caused it.</seg>
<seg id="14">But listen up men, sometimes we need you to shut up for once and offer a good pair of ears.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if they have to fake it, I'd want a man to be rational, comforting and solicitous (and armed with a giant box of tissues).</seg>
<seg id="16">Sheryl Sandberg: weeping advocate</seg>
<seg id="17">Whether or not the great preserve of the British stuff upper lip will continue to govern our workplaces in future years remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="18">A prime example of the unemotional, practical mindset, Margaret Thatcher once said that "to wear your heart on your sleeve isn't a very good plan; you should wear it inside, where it functions best."</seg>
<seg id="19">Talking to The Telegraph earlier this year, Sandberg said wryly:"I say I cry at work.</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not sure Baroness Thatcher could have done that.</seg>
<seg id="21">Maybe Sandberg's right, and we could all benefit from a little more emotional honesty in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the resounding impact of the images of Mrs Thatcher crying as she left Downing Street for the last time further convinces me that open displays of emotion should remain firmly reserved for moments of crisis.</seg>
<seg id="23">And on that issue, this lady is not for turning.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some handy techniques to help prevent yourself from crying in the workplace:</seg>
<seg id="25">1) Take a deep breath</seg>
<seg id="26">It may sound ridiculously simple, but concentrating on your breathing focuses your mind on another activity and lessens the emotional stress of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stress makes us breathe in short, shallow gasps, so forcing your body to inhale more oxygen will calm you physically as well as mentally.</seg>
<seg id="28">2) Withdraw from the situation</seg>
<seg id="29">If possible, try to swiftly exit to somewhere private, like the bathroom or an empty meeting room to take a minute to calm yourself.</seg>
<seg id="30">You'll be able to return feeling more</seg>
<seg id="31">3) Carry props to distract yourself</seg>
<seg id="32">When put in a stressful situation like giving a presentation, holding a physical object like a notebook or sheaf of papers can act as an unconscious barrier between yourself and the problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">4) Mentally prepare yourself</seg>
<seg id="34">That meeting you've been dreading or long-delayed assessment is never going to be enjoyable, but putting yourself in as positive a mind frame as possible can work wonders.</seg>
<seg id="35">Listening to a motivational tune, composing answers to difficult questions to fire back at the asker and telling yourself the stress will quickly pass are all coping techniques that will help prevent that frog in your throat.</seg>
<seg id="36">5) Look at their eyebrows</seg>
<seg id="37">When you feel like you're going to cry during a face-to-face conversation, focusing on their eyebrows creates the impression of eye contact without the intense emotional connection.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama's Health Care Walk Back</seg>
<seg id="2">Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."</seg>
<seg id="3">With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">Addressing what he called the "flurry in the news" about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You're going to get a better deal," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone "miserably" since October.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am eager to earn your confidence back.</seg>
<seg id="14">An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="3">Fremantle post a thrilling one-point victory over Richmond in their AFL clash at Patersons Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fremantle coach Ross Lyon addresses the media after his side's thrilling one-point win over Richmond.</seg>
<seg id="5">Tigers coach Damien Hardwick shows his anger after losing the match by one point to the Dockers.</seg>
<seg id="6">THE AFL has conceded a score review should have been called in the dying minutes of last night's Fremantle and Richmond clash at Patersons Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tiger Matt White snapped a shot at goal with about four minutes remaining that would have put his side four points in front.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ball bounced in to the leg of the goal umpire standing against the post as it appeared set to cross the goal line.</seg>
<seg id="9">Play on was called, before the Dockers took the ball over the line for a rushed behind.</seg>
<seg id="10">A furious Damien Hardwick labelled the call a "joke" after the game and insisted a score review should have been called for because, from his vantage point, he felt the ball had crossed the line for a call.</seg>
<seg id="11">AFL spokesman Patrick Keane admitted today the goal umpire made an error.</seg>
<seg id="12">" (The) AFL view is that a review should have been called by goal umpire last night," Keane said."</seg>
<seg id="13">The AFL will also ask the umpiring department to review line positioning of goal umpires.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both Hardwick and Fremantle coach Ross Lyon believed the ball had gone through for a goal before bouncing off the umpire's leg and back into play</seg>
<seg id="15">Freo break Richmond hearts</seg>
<seg id="16">White ended up kicking a goal a minute later to give Richmond the lead, but Dockers goalsneak Hayden Ballantyne snapped the winner with 84 seconds left to secure the 12.9 (81) to 12.8 (80) triumph.</seg>
<seg id="17">""We've got this fantastic thing called a review system haven't we?</seg>
<seg id="18">Fair dinkum," Hardwick said.</seg>
<seg id="19">""At the end of the day there's a field umpire, a goal umpire, and four or five blokes sitting up in a box upstairs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Someone make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Seriously, in a tight game - joke.""</seg>
<seg id="22">Lyon said he understood Hardwick's frustrations all too well.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the 2009 grand final when Lyon was coach of St Kilda, Geelong forward Tom Hawkins was awarded a goal despite his shot shaving the post.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Cats ended up winning the match by 12 points.</seg>
<seg id="25">""I've seen the other side of the coin," Lyon said.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the end of the day, we're all humans.</seg>
<seg id="27">We all make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="28">""Damien is entitled to voice an opinion but I'll leave it to the papers and the AFL to sort it out."</seg>
<seg id="29">Hardwick was confident captain Trent Cotchin would be fit for Saturday night's clash with Geelong at the MCG.</seg>
<seg id="30">Cotchin hyper-extended his knee late in the second quarter, but managed to play out the match and finished with 26 possessions and seven clearances.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tigers debutant Nick Vlastuin put in a gutsy effort in defence, while former Crow Chris Knights played his best game for Richmond with three goals from 20 possessions.</seg>

<seg id="3">Another said her prof kept "forgetting" her marked assignments in his office, where he overshared about his divorce.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was still married.</seg>
<seg id="5">Another claimed her instructor asked the women in his class if they were lesbians, then declared he'd "dated a lesbian once."</seg>
<seg id="6">Such squirmy tales the professor-seducer stereotype proliferated on the Twitter account of Mallory Ortberg earlier this month, when the editor asked her followers to post all their stories of "the male professors you had in college who thrived upon and demanded female admiration to function."</seg>
<seg id="7">From the hallowed halls of academia, the tales came poring in.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The intellectual and physical seduction of young female students by older, male professors - usually in the humanities, and in the throes of midlife crises - is so common in movies and books that it's become a cliché," Colleen Flaherty wrote of the thread at Slate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Flaherty said that the thread "examines a dark side of that cliché in real-life academe, one in which professors" advances - intellectual and otherwise - feed a need for validation and flattery, and at times cross the line into sexual harassment."</seg>
<seg id="10">Flaherty interviewed Ortberg, who said it was key not to dismiss such behaviour as "seductive."</seg>
<seg id="11">Others in the piece argued that all profs narcissistically crave attention: some use that instinct for good, bolstering their students" performance, while others behave boorishly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Other critics said power, not gender, is to blame in the dynamic, while others argued that gender is intrinsically tied to that (tenured) abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then there was the small chorus of women who said they'd had no such encounters to speak of, one writing that she was on " (friendly, not creepy) hugging and drinking terms with a few" of her instructors.</seg>
<seg id="14">Flaherty also asked where the student fell in the equation, interviewing an academic who's written on the topic and points out that some students also desperately seek out the attention of their profs.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I also think there's nothing wrong with it, as long as people behave appropriately, because education involves emotions and creates relationships," William Deresiewicz told Slate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Some will no doubt cry feminist male-bashing at the very idea of a male prof - beleaguered by mid-life crisis - flirting with his female charges.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then again, the stories are plentiful, and Ortberg describes undergraduate students contemplating which profs it is "best to steer clear of."</seg>
<seg id="18">Hardly great news for education.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. policy should encourage highly skilled, foreign Ph.D. students to stay, experts urge</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 - Attracting more talented foreign students to study at U.S. universities and encouraging them to launch entrepreneurial ventures here could help "revitalize innovation and economic growth" in this country, a trio of economists led by University of Colorado Boulder Professor Keith Maskus concludes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Maskus and co-authors Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, associate professor at the Yale School of Management, and Eric T. Stuen, assistant professor at the University of Idaho College of Business and Economics, make this case in the Policy Forum of the Nov.</seg>
<seg id="4">1 edition of the journal Science.</seg>
<seg id="5">The economists' perspective draws on their study of 100 research-intensive U.S. universities in 23 science and engineering fields, which found that both U.S. and foreign students are "essential causal inputs into scientific discovery."</seg>
<seg id="6">The trio has also found evidence that increased student diversity boosts innovative research.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maskus and his collaborators have found that high-performing foreign-born Ph.D. students improve the "creation of knowledge" in U.S. universities.</seg>
<seg id="8">When knowledge is created, it tends to drive entrepreneurial investment and economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, the researchers found, "The productivity of the average American university science and engineering laboratory in generating publications is a bit higher if it has students from 10 different countries than if it has 10 students from one country."</seg>
<seg id="10">That might not seem intuitive, Maskus acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="11">What it comes down to is that people trained in different traditions tend to have different specialties in terms of how they come to a teamwork environment.</seg>
<seg id="12">And teamwork is more productive, more efficient if you have people with divergent ideas, so they can play off of each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such diversity of intellect, capacities and specializations makes a measurable difference, Maskus added.</seg>
<seg id="14">It doesn't matter so much on a factory line, but it matters a lot in an intellectual sense when you're trying to be innovative and creative.</seg>
<seg id="15">The publication comes as Congress weighs whether and how to change the U.S. immigration system.</seg>
<seg id="16">A bipartisan bill that cleared the U.S. Senate in June but has stalled in the House includes provisions that partly mirror those recommended by Maskus and his team.</seg>
<seg id="17">Based on data showing that highly skilled Ph.D.s in science and engineering tend to generate new jobs where they work, the bill would pave the way for Ph.D.s in science and engineering who are from foreign countries to gain permanent U.S. residency after graduation.</seg>
<seg id="18">U.S. law requires foreign students to leave the country after earning their Ph.D.s unless they find employers willing to sponsor their visas, which, Maskus and his colleagues note, might not lead to permanent U.S. residency.</seg>
<seg id="19">In recent years, the percentage of foreign Ph.D.s remaining in the United States after graduation has declined.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Senate bill would grant a green card, or permanent residence, to foreign students who get a Ph.D. in science or engineering at American universities.</seg>
<seg id="21">The bill would also facilitate green-card status to those who have recently earned doctoral degrees in science and engineering at recognized scientific institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Maskus and his colleagues also recommend an entrepreneurship visa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a visa could be granted to those who have secured a patent and met certain milestones for getting that idea commercialized.</seg>
<seg id="24">The idea is similar to an investment visa -- granted based on immigrants' investment in the U.S. economy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This year, Canada implemented an entrepreneurship visa that includes inventive foreign Ph.D.s.</seg>
<seg id="26">The program aims to attract science and engineering graduates from U.S. universities.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Ultimately we think this is an important way of reinvigorating economic growth and technological change in the U.S.," Maskus said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Additionally, the trio contends that decisions to grant student visas to prospective graduate students from foreign countries should be granted on more factors than just their ability to pay.</seg>
<seg id="29">Historically, the ability-to-pay requirement has been used by immigration officials as an indicator that foreign students will return to their countries of origin.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of foreign Ph.D.s in science and engineering, such a requirement "is short-sighted," Maskus said.</seg>
<seg id="31">The country should welcome people who can contribute in developing innovation and new technology and permit them to stay.</seg>
<seg id="32">"You have to have access to the best innovative inputs and resources in the world," Maskus said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Europeans recognize that, the Australians, the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="34">Addressing a commonly expressed fear, Maskus and his collaborators do not find evidence that granting green cards to high-performing foreign Ph.D.s would displace American Ph.D.s.</seg>
<seg id="35">The research of Maskus, Mobarak and Stuen reinforces recommendations of groups ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the National Academy of Sciences.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grangemouth: Miliband urged to condemn Unite union</seg>
<seg id="2">LABOUR was facing fresh pressure over the fall-out from the Grangemouth dispute last night, as the Tories called on Ed Miliband to condemn "thuggish" attempts by the Unite union to target managers at the plant.</seg>
<seg id="3">A week after the crisis that nearly led to the closure of the petrochemical site, the union was yesterday forced to defend its use of so-called "leverage tactics," where managers who worked for the plant's owner were directly targeted at home.</seg>
<seg id="4">One Ineos director said he feared for the safety of his wife and two children after 30 Unite protesters turned up at his house during the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tactics prompted the Conservative chairman Grant Shapps to write to Mr Miliband yesterday, insisting he distance himself from the "intimidation."</seg>
<seg id="6">Unite, however, defended the tactics, saying they had been successful.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last week, it was forced to capitulate to Ineos after the firm said it would close Grangemouth's petrochemical plant.</seg>
<seg id="8">Unite was forced to accept a no-strike deal at the plant for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its own organiser, Stephen Deans, resigned from his job earlier this week after being presented with evidence of an internal investigation into his conduct.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Deans is also expected to be ousted as chairman of the Falkirk West Labour Party in a confidence vote this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">It follows a bitter internal row over allegations he used his position in Unite to sign up Grangemouth workers to join Labour, in order to ensure his union's favoured candidate, Karie Murphy, stood for the party in the seat.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police Scotland confirmed its officers had attended an address in Dunfermline on Friday, 18 October, following reports of a protest but said the occupants were not present .</seg>
<seg id="13">However, one unnamed Grangemouth boss was reported as saying a "mob" had gathered at his house.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their intent was to gain concessions.</seg>
<seg id="15">"But taking it to someone's home, to someone's drive, during the school holidays, is way over the line," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It had quite an impact on my kids.</seg>
<seg id="17">My wife is very concerned they could turn up at any time again.</seg>
<seg id="18">They know where I live.</seg>
<seg id="19">The daughter of another director said she had received a "wanted" poster criticising her father at her home in Hampshire.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prime Minister David Cameron said the "leverage" allegations were "shocking" and should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="21">In his letter to Mr Miliband, Mr Shapps said Unite, which is the Labour's largest donor, had sent a so-called leverage team to "threaten senior Ineos executives at home, and to seriously intimidate their families."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said it was "clear from Unite's website" the tactics were a "consistent strategy."</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Shapps wrote: "Unite claim that this is both "legal and legitimate.""</seg>
<seg id="24">I'm sure you'll agree it falls way short of decency.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Last year [Unite leader] Len McCluskey praised this as "a new, sophisticated, smart way to do business.""</seg>
<seg id="26">He continued: "The Labour Party, and the Scottish Labour Party, backed Unite and their actions throughout the Grangemouth dispute."</seg>
<seg id="27">You must now accept the consequences of this disastrous misjudgment.</seg>
<seg id="28">If Mr Miliband did not, he said, Labour would "send out the message to the British people that you are too weak to stand up to the union bosses that bankroll your party."</seg>
<seg id="29">However, Unite claimed the tactic had secured "landmark victories" against employers such as Honda, London Buses and Mayr Melnhof Packaging.</seg>
<seg id="30">A spokesman said: "All the activities referred to are both legal and legitimate."</seg>
<seg id="31">Bad employers should have nowhere to hide.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unite also said Mr Shapps" letter showed how "our basic liberties - including the right to protest - are not safe with the Tories."</seg>
<seg id="33">Labour had last night made no response to Mr Shapps" comments.</seg>
<seg id="34">First Minister Alex Salmond said Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont had been "silent" over the Grangemouth dispute, which now threatens to cause further internal damage for Labour, with Mr Deans" future being decided at an extraordinary general meeting of the Falkirk party this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="35">It follows reports that Unite subverted an internal Labour inquiry into alleged vote-rigging in Falkirk through threats, intimidation and dirty tricks.</seg>
<seg id="36">The allegations are contained in an internal Ineos investigation into Mr Deans, and include suggestions Unite arranged for people in Falkirk to withdraw their evidence against the union.</seg>
<seg id="37">Both Mr Deans and Ms Murphy had been suspended by Labour after evidence was submitted to party officials.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, that inquiry was dropped after the evidence was removed.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr Miliband is now facing intense pressure to kick-start an inquiry again, with senior figures including Jack Straw urging an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="40">Meanwhile, UK government figures have countered SNP claims that Alex Salmond rescued the plant by persuading Ineos to reverse its decision.</seg>
<seg id="41">They said Chancellor George Osborne last week wrote to Ineos reiterating a £125 million loan guarantee was still available if it decided to invest as planned.</seg>
<seg id="42">Last weekend, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said the result was an example of Scotland having "the best of both worlds," as the UK and Scottish governments had tried to come up with a rescue package.</seg>
<seg id="43">Direct action tactic that involves targeting people in their homes</seg>
<seg id="44">UNITE'S website provides information on "leverage" - which it describes as "a relatively new tool helping Unite to defend and strengthen its agreements and protect and empower its workplace reps."</seg>
<seg id="45">The basic idea behind leverage, it says, is to make "all interested parties aware of the treatment received by Unite members at the hands of an employer."</seg>
<seg id="46">Interested parties are defined as anyone from shareholders, competitors, customers and even the marketplace itself.</seg>
<seg id="47">The process kicks in, says the union, when it makes a judgment that an employer is acting "immorallly.""</seg>
<seg id="48">"If the union judges this to be the case, it will then conduct "lawful protest" so that employers cannot "hide behind veils of secrecy.""</seg>
<seg id="49">"It adds: "Where Unite members are involved in such lawful protest, the union will use its best endeavours to ensure such members are aware of their rights of lawful protest.""</seg>
<seg id="50">This is not to replace negotiation, but to supplement it, the union argues.</seg>
<seg id="51">"In the case of Ineos, "leverage" appears to have included protests outside the homes of the senior members of staff."</seg>
<seg id="52">Unite claims that similar direct action forced a change of heart in other disputes with companies such as Honda and London Buses.</seg>
<seg id="53">However, in the case of Ineos, the attempt seems only to have increased the resolve of the private firm to dig in its heels and refuse all of the union's demands.</seg>
<seg id="54">Unite was then forced to capitulate to Ineos last week, leaving workers with fewer rights - including a ban on strike action for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="55">But the union is defending its tactic and says it will pursue it again, adding that "bad employers should have nowhere to hide."</seg>

<seg id="1">'After Midnight' brings music of legendary Cotton Club to Broadway</seg>
<seg id="2">By Patricia Reaney</seg>
<seg id="3">NEW YORK (Reuters) - "After Midnight," a Broadway musical featuring original arrangements by jazz great Duke Ellington, melds classic songs from the 1920s and 30s with dance to recreate Harlem's Golden Age and the legendary Cotton Club.</seg>
<seg id="4">The show, which includes a big band of 17 musicians chosen by Grammy-winning jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, 25 dancers and singers and rotating guest stars, opens on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="5">It joins a list of Broadway productions showcasing music - from Motown hits and Beatles classics to 1960s tunes by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons and rock'n'roll legend Janis Joplin.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Beautiful," a musical about singer-songwriter Carole King, will open early in 2014 and "The Rascals: Once Upon a Dream," a hybrid concert/Broadway show featuring the '60s group and hits such as "Groovin' and "It's a Beautiful Morning," will return for a limited run later this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">"After Midnight" director and choreographer Warren Carlyle said putting original arrangements from decades ago to dance posed unique challenges for him.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am such a fan of tradition and what came before us but I also feel we have a duty to carry jazz music forward and those orchestrations have really inspired me," said Carlyle, who also choreographed "Follies" and "Finian's Rainbow."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I wanted to honor what came before but also feel free to reinvent," he added.</seg>
<seg id="10">The more than 20 songs in the show, set against a narrative of Langston Hughes poetry, harken to Harlem and the Cotton Club nightclub, which was immortalized in Francis Ford Coppola's 1984 film of the same name.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is a celebration of jazz music done in a contemporary way with some really talented dancers, singers, actors and musicians," said Carlyle.</seg>
<seg id="12">Producer Scott Sanders described the Cotton Club in its heyday as the coolest place in the city, which attracted the leading talent of the day.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Great performers would drop into the production show and do a couple of numbers, so you had the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Judy Garland and Fanny Brice all going to 125th Street on a Sunday night and doing their songs in this incredible institution," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was the Jazz Age and Prohibition and people wanting to get dressed up and have a good time.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's that atmosphere that Carlyle tries to recreate with each song and the story told within it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"After Midnight" originated from a production called "Cotton Club Parade."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Broadway show will include a rotating list of guest stars including R&B singer and the winner of the third season of the American Idol singing competition Fantasia Barrino and pop and country singer-songwriter k.d. lang.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It was the first spark of marrying Broadway and dancers and singers and performers with jazz and this music and the Ellington charts and the classic, timeless songs," said Sanders about the original production.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although songs such as "Cotton Club Stomp," "Daybreak Express" and "Creole Love Call," were written decades ago, Sanders said the tunes are put through the prism of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It's a great soup of incredible ingredients," he added.</seg>

<seg id="2">Parking in Frankfurt could soon be noticeably more expensive.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to the proposal, parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="2">Power Line Under Lake Champlain</seg>
<seg id="3">A New York company announced Thursday it hopes to build a 150-mile power line from the Canadian border under Lake Champlain and then across Vermont to the town of Ludlow where it would connect to the New England electric grid.</seg>
<seg id="4">The $1.2 billion New England Clean Power Link line could carry up to 1,000 megawatts of Canadian hydro-electricity, enough to supply about 1 million homes, said Donald Jessome, president of TDI New England.</seg>
<seg id="5">TDI New England is a subsidiary of the New York based Blackstone Group, which would provide funding for the project.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jessome said he expected it would take five years to complete the regulatory process and construction.</seg>
<seg id="7">They hope to begin transmitting power in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gov. Peter Shumlin said he knew of the proposal and had met with its backers, but he seemed to question whether it would be needed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it's important to recognize that power transmission is going through an interesting time right now," Shumlin said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clearly, there's a huge demand for clean, green renewables, which hydro is, to our south.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, there are technologies being developed that might make us question how much transmission we're going to need in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Promoters of the Clean Power Link project say it would help provide clean energy to New England and help Canadian power producers find a market for an abundance of hydropower produced in Quebec and other parts of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They along with our team see the need for connecting renewable energy to markets that are both growing and have a very, very strong need for new renewable resources coming into the marketplace," Jessome said, referring to the investors.</seg>
<seg id="14">We very much like the buried model because it preserves the natural beauty of the communities we're going through.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Vermont proposal is similar to a proposal in New York state for a 330-mile power line from Canada to New York City that would also run under Lake Champlain and the Hudson River.</seg>
<seg id="16">Jessome said the New York project is being done by a different company, but the same people who are now working on the Vermont proposal.</seg>
<seg id="17">Getting Canadian power to U.S. markets has been a key point of recent meetings between the Eastern Canadian premiers and the New England governors.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Hydro Quebec has a lot of surplus power and it's all basically designed to be sold in the U.S market," said David Runnalls, an energy expert with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think tank.</seg>
<seg id="19">They can still generate hydropower pretty cheaply and they sell power into the U.S. market and they make a lot of money out of it.</seg>
<seg id="20">But there are other Canadian power producers that could also seek to sell electricity in the United States, including projects in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Runnalls said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Jessome said it would be possible to move power from eastern Canada to the United States via the lines he is proposing.</seg>
<seg id="22">In New Hampshire, the proposed 180-mile Northern Pass power line project would carry up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to southern New England, on wires hung on poles, has been met by fierce opposition.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jessome said they would take the time necessary in Vermont to work with people who might have concerns about a major power project passing through their communities.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We pride ourselves working with the communities, listening to all of the different stakeholders who are going to have a say in a major project like this," Jessome said.</seg>

<seg id="8">Fairfax Media understands Ms Benson's family remained interstate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Faulkner said Ms Benson had achieved significant progress in her short time with Seqwater.</seg>
<seg id="10">"A lot has been achieved in our first year as an integrated bulk water business and a large part of our success has been due to Terri's leadership," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Seqwater board meets on Monday when an interim chief executive will be announced.</seg>
<seg id="12">In October, SeqWater's 300 staff were told they would be moving to Ipswich from March 1 , 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rangnick scolding for refs: Mane is no diver</seg>
<seg id="2">As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the present winning form of the Austrian Bundesliga table-toppers, Red Bull Salzburg, the Sporting Director of the "Bulls" expressed equal disappointment with the referees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"There is currently a dangerous trend, with Mane and Alan being dubbed as 'divers'," he said at a press conference in Salburg on Thursday, in defence of the two tricky offensive players.</seg>
<seg id="4">The most recent cause for Rangnick's criticism was the yellow card for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, whereby the Senegalese striker was penalised for supposed play acting - admittedly this was not justified, as shown by TV footage.</seg>
<seg id="5">"A blatant wrong decision," commented Rangnick, who referred to Harkam as being "completely out of his depth".</seg>
<seg id="6">Harkam also played "his part" in the escalation between Salzburg Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.</seg>
<seg id="7">He firmly defended his German compatriot: "In each individual situation I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt".</seg>
<seg id="8">Schmidt himself did not wish to have any contact with his colleagues after the skirmish with Hütter.</seg>
<seg id="9">I do not know why.</seg>
<seg id="10">"After all, I was the one who was insulted," emphasised the 46-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, with regard to the winning run, Rangnick sang his team's praises.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There are only two words for it: Really good," he stated.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is not a lot you can criticise.</seg>
<seg id="14">Most of all, the manner in which the team is playing is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must stay composed and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="16">There will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer window.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is no major reason to change anything.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Unless a player comes forward and expresses the desire to leave the club," explained Rangnick.</seg>

<seg id="1">Some irked by Hallmark's 'Deck the Halls' lyric change</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Officials at Hallmark's Missouri headquarters said a holiday ornament that removed the word "gay" from "Deck the Halls" was not meant to offend.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kansas City company's Facebook page received numerous complaints about an ornament featuring a red sweater reading, "don we now our fun apparel," instead of the traditional "don we now our gay apparel" from the1800s Christmas carol, KCTV, Kansas City, reported Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Changing the words to Christmas Carols -- REALLY?</seg>
<seg id="5">You can be sure that myself and many others won't be buying your cards anymore," a Facebook user named Carl commented.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company said the ornament, designed by artist Matt Johnson, is meant to celebrate gaudy Christmas sweaters, not cause offense.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Hallmark created this year's Holiday Sweater ornament in the spirit of fun," the company said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the lyrics to 'Deck the Halls' were translated from Gaelic and published in English back in the 1800s, the word 'gay' meant festive or merry.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today it has multiple meanings, which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trend of wearing festively decorated Christmas sweaters to parties is all about fun, and this ornament is intended to play into that, so the planning team decided to say what we meant: 'fun.'</seg>
<seg id="11">That's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid</seg>
<seg id="2">Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.</seg>
<seg id="11">A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy," Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.</seg>
<seg id="13">"No," Mr Tripodi replied.</seg>
<seg id="14">I can't remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn't that.</seg>
<seg id="15">Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid.</seg>

<seg id="2">Emerging Adelaide Crows defender Luke Brown has passed a concussion test and is fit to play this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">YOUNG Crows defender Luke Brown passed a concussion test at West Lakes today to be clear for action against AFL premiership favourite Hawthorn at AAMI Stadium on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brown's confirmation allows Adelaide to stay with the 22 players named at selection on Thursday night and keeps Richard Tambling on the emergency list.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most significant news from selection is the return of key forward-ruckman Shaun McKernan to the line-up for the first time this season as Adelaide copes with the loss of key forward Taylor Walker for the rest of the season with a knee injury.</seg>
<seg id="6">Adelaide assistant coach Scott Camporeale noted his midfield unit would be seeking to supply a new-look attack.</seg>
<seg id="7">McKernan is listed as partnering Josh Jenkins in the Crows forward line, replacing the Walker-Tippett tandem that pushed the Crows to within five points of the Hawks in last year's preliminary final.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Josh Jenkins has been there for the whole year, Tom Lynch has come in for the past fortnight, so we need to generate more goals midfield-wise and hit the scoreboard from there to pick up the slack," Camporeale said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shaun has been in really good in the SANFL.</seg>
<seg id="10">He kicked five (with Glenelg at the weekend) so he deserves an opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="11">He is probably like for like with 'Tex' (Walker).</seg>
<seg id="12">That's probably really the only change.</seg>
<seg id="13">Off-field, the change in the Adelaide Football Club's front office at West Lakes has begun with Craig Burton, the general manager of marketing and communications, no longer in his position.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is considered the start of a reshuffle of the Adelaide administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Leg almost hacked off: Rocker retrial</seg>
<seg id="2">A bloody attack within the 'Rocker' scene is to be re-investigated after more than four years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Proceedings for attempted murder, grievous bodily harm and material damage, brought against two 30-year-olds have begun before the Frankfurt District Court.</seg>
<seg id="4">They are being accompanied by strict security precautions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The accused initially remained silent.</seg>
<seg id="6">They are said to have been active within the Rocker scene and to have at the time belonged to the Bandidos.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Public Prosecutor accused them of having stabbed and beaten three men in a car in Finowfurt, together with unknown accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="8">All the victims were seriously injured, with one man almost losing a leg.</seg>
<seg id="9">The victims were said to have belonged to the competing gang, the Hell's Angels.</seg>
<seg id="10">One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seems that the attack was preceded by a car chase involving several cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to accusations, this was part of a turf war and represented a demonstration of power.</seg>
<seg id="13">The two accused were acquitted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the time, a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.</seg>
<seg id="15">The assailants had worn masks and had not been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Federal Supreme Court repealed the verdict following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred the case back to the District Court for a re-trial.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another offence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Proceedings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the crime.</seg>
<seg id="19">The police inspector responsible at the time was invited as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="20">The central point of focus was on mobile phone conversations between the accused and third parties, which the police had intercepted.</seg>
<seg id="21">What makes things difficult is that Rockers almost always observe what they consider to be complete silence appearing before the court - they say absolutely nothing.</seg>
<seg id="22">This also applies in the case of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the first trial, only one of the victims spoke out.</seg>
<seg id="24">When asked, Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor's Office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial.</seg>
<seg id="25">A further eleven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial.</seg>

<seg id="2">A German lawmaker said he met Edward Snowden in Moscow on Thursday, and that the National Security Agency leaker is prepared in principle to help Germany investigate allegations of surveillance by U.S. intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hans-Christian Stroebele, a lawmaker with Germany's opposition Greens who is a prominent critic of the NSA's alleged actions, posted on Twitter a picture of himself with Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said on his website that Snowden gave him a letter to German authorities which he will present in Berlin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stroebele told ARD television that Snowden "made clear he knows a great deal."</seg>

<seg id="9">Germany's government was one of many that rejected an asylum request from Snowden earlier this year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Investors back bold founders' Asia thrust</seg>
<seg id="2">Richard Hemming for wealth Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="3">THE prices of iProperty and iCar Asia have both doubled in the past six months, and the leap of faith investors are making that the two young founders' vision comes off is breathtaking.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is no accident that these two companies, putative followers of Realestate.com.au and Carsales.com, are among the few counters that you can buy on the ASX with operations directly exposed to Asian consumer markets.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are looking to dominate the online sales of property and motor vehicles and their online classifieds business model is one that has what investors love: big operating margins of 50 per cent plus, low capital investment, and big dividend-paying potential.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem is that these two companies are many years behind their bigger brothers and are trying to make headway in the online markets of Southeast Asia that are much less mature.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unlike their bigger brothers, they also don't have market dominance, which is the real secret behind their success (Realestate.com.au owner REA has a market cap of $5.5 billion).</seg>
<seg id="8">Filling this gap is the investors' faith in management, and more importantly, in the strategic direction of the founders Patrick Grove and Luke Elliott.</seg>
<seg id="9">The share price rise means that their joint-owned company, Catcha Media, which has stakes in both iProperty and iCar Asia, is now worth just under $300m.</seg>
<seg id="10">Grove and Elliot are in their mid-30s and have left the running to experienced operators. iProperty chief executive Shaun di Gregorio was previously a senior executive at Realestate.com owner REA.</seg>
<seg id="11">He says that despite their youth, Grove and Elliott have the knowledge and experience in the fast moving Asian online space: "They are passionate about online classifieds and have been in the region for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="12">They have the relationships, the networks and haven't made the mistake of landing here and within six months thinking they can achieve wins.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have gone the distance.</seg>
<seg id="14">iProperty is based in Malaysia, which is the only market in which it is currently profitable.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also has a presence in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Its big market is property developers rather than real estate agents, which reflects these countries' fast economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company listed on the ASX in 2007, has a market cap of $330 million and should only make about $18m in revenues this calendar year.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be break-even next year. iCar Asia has been listed for just over a year and has a market cap of $108m.</seg>
<seg id="19">It will be some years before it breaks even based on the $410,000 cash it received for the three months to September 30, which is before costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Both are achieving big quarterly increases in cash receipts, but this is hardly surprising considering their start-up nature, and the numbers are insignificant compared with their burgeoning market caps.</seg>
<seg id="21">But di Gregorio indicates the vast potential that the emerging Asian economies have:</seg>
<seg id="22">These markets might be six or seven years behind, maybe more.</seg>
<seg id="23">But it's not like 12m yacht racing.</seg>
<seg id="24">China's (online property classifieds business) SouFun is 100 per cent new property.</seg>
<seg id="25">Where these businesses can go to in emerging markets is twice the size of REA's revenues.</seg>
<seg id="26">In fiscal 2013, REA generated $336m in sales, and is forecast to deliver $422m in the current year.</seg>

<seg id="2">A "genuineness" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown.</seg>
<seg id="3">The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the "genuineness" criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about "whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."</seg>
<seg id="10">Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Marriage is and remains the most important journey of discovery a person can undertake," said the philosopher Sï¿½ren Kierkegaard.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tips, at least as to how the wedding celebration can be a success, have now been given at a special trade fair in the Domäne in Hechingen.</seg>
<seg id="4">Important suppliers of all wedding-related products and services were represented.</seg>
<seg id="5">A trend: The retro look is back once again.</seg>
<seg id="6">This begins with the wedding clothing.</seg>
<seg id="7">White is a must, best muted or in cream.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the front, dresses with numerous ruffles and embroidery are in, often with a veil, while to the rear they run down the back and often end in a train.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, opinions differ, as Stefanie Koch from the Modehaus Kleidermüller emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="10">For men, suits with a waistcoat and neckerchief are most popular, although some people do choose cream or brown combinations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Selecting the venue is important, it was explained.</seg>
<seg id="12">Plain adjoining rooms are not ideal, the ambience should be special.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this regard, the Domäne drew attention to their own facilities in the carriage house.</seg>
<seg id="14">Uwe Link has an offer for anyone who wants to set off in a carriage.</seg>
<seg id="15">"However, carriages are also popular for hen parties," he commented.</seg>
<seg id="16">People were also on the lookout for romantic ideas for invitations, flower arrangements and wedding photographs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The "After-Wedding Photo" is becoming increasingly fashionable - that is, series of pictures taken a few days after the celebration, at special locations, preferably in front of waterfalls or the like, but in full wedding clothing, explained Elisabeth Keidel.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many other details for a successful wedding were presented in the Domäne on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="19">Flower arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests with style.</seg>
<seg id="20">The correct cosmetics and nail care mustn't be forgotten.</seg>

<seg id="1">Maintenance day at the small 'Engländerhütte'</seg>
<seg id="2">For what was then the fifth maintenance day in the follow-up to the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte (Englishman's Cottage) in Ibach</seg>
<seg id="3">Following suggestions from the population, the of the valley in the area of the cottage was to be cleared, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Kaiser, many hikers refer to this area as the showpiece of the Schluchtensteig, where the landscape provides the ideal framework for fantastic views.</seg>
<seg id="5">He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasised that the maintenance day is a suitable instrument through which to strengthen the connection between people and nature,</seg>
<seg id="6">He is offering every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental aspects should also be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="8">This environmental aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council, following the greeting by Regional Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken on the role of patron and wished the campaign every success.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Tribukait, the tourist objective of the vision coincided with the goal of preserving the now extremely overgrown old Allmend grazing pasture, with its specific protected habitats, through its opening and connection to the still existing grazing land.</seg>
<seg id="10">Certain species, such as rare butterflies or grasshoppers, cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas.</seg>
<seg id="11">They require these clear pathways in order to preserve their species.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tribukait said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned biosphere area.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current measures do not integrate seamlessly into these plans.</seg>
<seg id="14">A biosphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status, and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the Life Project and the previous care days.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the various statements, forest ranger Christoph Wehle and Life Project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.</seg>
<seg id="16">The larger trees had been cut down in advance, although forest tractors were on-call if required.</seg>
<seg id="17">One group of helpers were to take care of the clearance of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone wall.</seg>

<seg id="1">Free birds: This undercooked effort leaves bad taste</seg>
<seg id="2">In the 3D animated kids" movie Free Birds, a couple of turkeys time-travel back to the first Thanksgiving to get their species off the menu.</seg>
<seg id="3">The movie's animal rights, vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents - at least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 17th-century turkeys as face-painted, headband-wearing native Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">The entire movie, written by Kevin Smith's producing partner, Scott Mosier, and director Jimmy Hayward (Horton Hears a Who!), is well-intended but maladroit, with a clever premise and cute animation that are undermined by the trite sci-fi parody plot and manic, unfunny banter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Owen Wilson provides the voice of Reggie, a smart, misfit bird who can't get his fellow turkeys" beaks out of the corn long to acknowledge their imminent execution.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when he's picked by the U.S. president's daughter as the official White House-pardoned turkey, Reggie turns from prophet to sybarite at his rustic Camp David cabin, gobbling delivery pizzas and Mexican soap operas.</seg>
<seg id="7">The easy life ends when he's kidnapped by Jake (Woody Harrelson), the zealous, dopey leader of the Turkey Liberation Front who persuades Reggie to help hijack the government's top-secret, egg-shaped time machine (robot voiced by George Takei) and go back to Plymouth Colony in 1621 to reset the holiday meal.</seg>
<seg id="8">The movie's action-crammed second half drops pointless references to Braveheart to Pocahontas (with Amy Poehler as the Chief Broadbeak's daughter, Jenny), but beyond giving kids second thoughts about fighting for the drumsticks, there's little reason to be thankful for this undercooked, over-stuffed effort.</seg>

<seg id="6">"We had a long courtship before anything was [public], just writing letters to each other," the "Roar" singer, 29, told Entertainment Weekly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Study offers new theory of cancer development</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 - For more than 100 years, researchers have been unable to explain why cancer cells contain abnormal numbers of chromosomes, a phenomenon known as aneuploidy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many believed aneuploidy was simply a random byproduct of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, a team at Harvard Medical School has devised a way to understand patterns of aneuploidy in tumors and predict which genes in the affected chromosomes are likely to be cancer suppressors or promoters.</seg>
<seg id="5">They propose that aneuploidy is a driver of cancer rather than a result of it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The study, to be published online in Cell on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="7">31, offers a new theory of cancer development and could open the door for new treatment targets.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you look at a cancer cell, it looks like an unholy mess with gene deletions and amplifications, chromosome gains and losses, like someone threw a stick of dynamite into the cell.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It seems random, but actually previous work has shown that there is a pattern to which chromosomes and chromosome arms are altered -- and that means we can understand that pattern and how or if it drives cancer," said senior author Stephen Elledge, Gregor Mendel professor of Genetics and of Medicine at HMS and professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">"What we have done is to propose a new theory about how this works and then prove it using mathematical analysis," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mining for answers</seg>
<seg id="12">For decades since the "oncogene revolution," cancer research has focused on mutations -- changes in the DNA code that abnormally activate genes that promote cancer, called oncogenes, or deactivate genes that suppress cancer.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of aneuploidy -- in which entire chromosomes or chromosome arms are added or deleted -- has remained largely unstudied.</seg>
<seg id="14">Elledge and his team, including research fellow and first author Teresa Davoli, suspected that aneuploidy has a significant role to play in cancer because missing or extra chromosomes likely affect genes involved in tumor-related processes such as cell division and DNA repair.</seg>
<seg id="15">To test their hypothesis, the researchers developed a computer program called TUSON (Tumor Suppressor and Oncogene) Explorer together with Wei Xu and Peter Park at HMS and Brigham and Women's.</seg>
<seg id="16">The program analyzed genome sequence data from more than 8,200 pairs of cancerous and normal tissue samples in three preexisting databases.</seg>
<seg id="17">They generated a list of suspected oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes based on their mutation patterns -- and found many more potential cancer drivers than anticipated.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then they ranked the suspects by how powerful an effect their deletion or duplication was likely to have on cancer development.</seg>
<seg id="19">Next, the team looked at where the suspects normally appear in chromosomes.</seg>
<seg id="20">They discovered that the number of tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes in a chromosome correlated with how often the whole chromosome or part of the chromosome was deleted or duplicated in cancers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Where there were concentrations of tumor suppressor genes alongside fewer oncogenes and fewer genes essential to survival, there was more chromosome deletion.</seg>
<seg id="22">Conversely, concentrations of oncogenes and fewer tumor suppressors coincided with more chromosome duplication.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the team factored in gene potency, the correlations got even stronger.</seg>
<seg id="24">A cluster of highly potent tumor suppressors was more likely to mean chromosome deletion than a cluster of weak suppressors.</seg>
<seg id="25">Number matters</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 1971, the standard tumor suppressor model has held that cancer is caused by a "two-hit" cascade in which first one copy and then the second copy of a gene becomes mutated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Elledge argues that simply losing or gaining one copy of a gene through aneuploidy can influence tumor growth as well.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The loss or gain of multiple cancer driver genes that individually have low potency can add up to have big effects," he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's a terrific study," said Angelika Amon, a professor of biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the project.</seg>
<seg id="30">These novel algorithms of identifying tumor suppressors and oncogenes nicely provide an explanation of how aneuploidies evolve in cancer cells, and the realization that subtle changes in the activity of many different genes at the same time can contribute to tumorigenesis is an exciting and intriguing hypothesis.</seg>
<seg id="31">These findings also may have answered a long-standing question about whether aneuploidy is a cause or effect of cancer, leaving researchers free to pursue the question of how.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Aneuploidy is driving cancer, not simply a consequence of it," said Elledge.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other things also matter, such as gene mutations, rearrangements and changes in expression.</seg>
<seg id="34">We don't know what the weighting is, but now we should be able to figure it out.</seg>
<seg id="35">Going forward, Elledge and Davoli plan to gather experimental evidence to support their mathematical findings.</seg>
<seg id="36">That will include validating some of the new predicted tumor suppressors and oncogenes as well as "making some deletions and amplifications and seeing if they have the properties we think they do," said Elledge.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rapist in South Africa: two life sentences</seg>
<seg id="2">Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was condemned to two life sentences on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was reported by broadcaster SABC.</seg>
<seg id="4">The victim later died as a result of the serious injuries.</seg>
<seg id="5">Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the start of the week.</seg>
<seg id="6">The crime had caused nationwide horror.</seg>
<seg id="7">The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial estate in Bredasdorp, near Capetown.</seg>
<seg id="8">For 14 hours, doctors battled to save the life of the victim, ultimately in vain.</seg>
<seg id="9">The sight of the young girl was so horrific that the carers and nursing staff required psychological support.</seg>
<seg id="10">During the trial, Kana admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also admitted to beating and raping her, however he denied being responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police had initially assumed that there were multiple attackers, however, they released two suspects from custody as the evidence against them was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the proceedings the public prosecution also emphasised that they were convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rapes are almost part of everyday life in South Africa: There are around 64,000 reports of sexual assault every year.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is almost ten times as many as in Germany, although with a population of 82 million people, Germany has a much higher number of residents than South Africa (50 million).</seg>
<seg id="16">Police and women's associations in South Africa, however, estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual assault to be 10-25 times as high.</seg>

<seg id="1">Canceled U.S. health plans are disruptive part of reform -Cigna CEO</seg>
<seg id="2">Thu Oct 31, 2013 2:25pm EDT</seg>
<seg id="3">(Reuters) - The hundreds of thousands of Americans whose individual insurance policies will be canceled as Obamacare takes full effect next year are experiencing a disruptive element of healthcare reform, the head of health insurer Cigna said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the past week, reports of pending plan cancellations have become a political problem for President Barack Obama, who promised years ago as he was pushing to pass the healthcare law that Americans who liked their health plans could keep them.</seg>
<seg id="5">While that remains true for most people with insurance, a small percentage of the 17 million Americans with individual policies are now getting notice that they will terminate next year because they do not comply with new benefits required by Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many insurers are offering new, compliant policies to replace those that are expiring, but they may be significantly more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nearly half of U.S. consumers with individual health plans are also expected to qualify for tax credits to buy insurance on new state exchanges under Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="8">"When you are that individual who has a benefit plan and it's working for you and your family at your current life stage and you are told that you no longer have that choice, that's disruptive and that's the environment that as a country we are going through right now," Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cigna had about 232,000 people in individual policies at the end of September, according to company filings.</seg>
<seg id="10">Competitor WellPoint Inc, which operates 14 Blue Cross Blue Shield licenses including the Anthem and Empire brands, has about 1.8 million people in individual plans.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aetna Inc, which bought smaller insurer Coventry earlier this year, has 650,000 members in these plans and will drop about 50,000 members when it exits the California market at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In defending the healthcare law on Wednesday, Obama said it was not to blame for the plan cancellations, and that the real fault lies with "bad apple" insurers who were allowed to sell cut-rate policies that offered minimal coverage for people when they needed them the most.</seg>
<seg id="13">Cordani declined to comment on Obama's remarks, but noted that individual plans have been subjected to numerous new requirements under the law.</seg>
<seg id="14">States determine the minimum eligible benefits and there are federal requirements, so in some states elements such as the size of the deductible could disqualify an individual plan for 2014.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's as simple as that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">WellPoint and Aetna declined to comment on specifics about policy cancellations or about the president's comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cordani said that Cigna has a small individual insurance business and is not significantly impacted by needing to cancel these plans.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, it has about 125,000 employer-sponsored plans that will end on January 1, 2014 because they do not comply with the law.</seg>
<seg id="19">These plans typically targeted seasonal or hourly workers, he said, and it was clear from when the health reform law was passed in 2010 that they were going away.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brett Morris steps up bid to lure brother Josh back to St George Illawarra</seg>
<seg id="2">Centre stage: Josh Morris (right) will play his first Test in two years, against Fiji this weekend, while his twin Brett will be rested.</seg>
<seg id="3">Manchester: If Josh Morris does end up switching back to St George Illawarra when his contract at Canterbury expires next year, his twin brother Brett should ask the Dragons hierarchy for a bonus, with Josh declaring a "desire" to once again play alongside Brett.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brett is using the time spent in camp with the Australian team in the UK to persuade his brother to again link with him in the Red V. It's been five years since Josh last played for St George Illawarra, and the Canterbury outside back said he was enticed by the thought of playing alongise his brother again.</seg>
<seg id="5">"There is always pressure from him," Josh said.</seg>
<seg id="6">I probably put just as much as he puts on.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's all in good fun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brett is pretty up to date with all [the rumours].</seg>
<seg id="9">I don't have Twitter and he gets on and retweets - I think that's what it's called - and he likes to start rumours and spread fires.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's all harmless fun.</seg>
<seg id="11">He would really like me to go back there and I'm off-contract next year.</seg>
<seg id="12">I will just concentrate on footy while I'm over here and then having a good year at the Bulldogs.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is always going to be a desire to play in the same side together.</seg>
<seg id="14">Two Test matches and a handful of Origin appearances alongside each other is enough to whet their appetite for now.</seg>
<seg id="15">Playing apart has helped their careers progress, according to Josh.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It works better at the moment with us at different clubs because it gives us a goal to strive for to play rep footy with one another," Josh said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We want to be named in these sides and in the Origin sides.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are individuals more in different teams and judged on that rather than being a package deal for one club.</seg>
<seg id="19">While they don't have to wear coloured wrist bands to help identify them like did when their first burst into first grade at St George Illawarra, their identity still remains a source of confusion for some teammates, particularly Canberra rookie Josh Papalii.</seg>
<seg id="20">The twins are roommates for the first time since their teens.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We shared rooms until we were about 14 or 15 and a couple of wrestles here and there meant a couple of holes in the wall," Josh said.</seg>
<seg id="22">He got kicked out because I was cleaner so I get the big room.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was pretty happy with that.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is messier than me but he has gotten a lot better since he moved out of home and had a little kid and got engaged.</seg>
<seg id="25">He has changed a fair bit.</seg>
<seg id="26">One position they won't be fighting over is playing fullback at their respective clubs.</seg>
<seg id="27">Injuries have meant the brothers have dabbled in the No.1 jersey at times.</seg>
<seg id="28">Josh played a handful of games at the back for Canterbury this year but doesn't want to be a permanent replacement following Ben Barba's defection to Canterbury.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Long-term I don't see myself as a fullback," Morris said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I played a bit a fair bit at the end of the year filling in when Benny was injured.</seg>
<seg id="31">I did enjoy it but it's not a position I see myself playing in a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="32">I think Des knows that and I'm sure he has his eyes on someone.</seg>
<seg id="33">Having watched Australia's opening pool game from the sidelines, Josh will make his Test return against Fiji on Saturday night (Sunday, 7am AEDT).</seg>

<seg id="3">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we've not been in that situation before -- it's all completely new.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was "full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name."</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama to foreign investors: Come to America!</seg>
<seg id="2">Embattled by the botched rollout of the health care law, partisan gridlock in Congress and allied fury over spying allegations, US President Barack Obama on Thursday drummed up support of the United States as a "land of opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="3">Speaking at the first "SelectUSA Investment Summit" in Washington, he called for a renewed effort to entice job-creating foreign business to open shop in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="4">Obama announced he would expand and enhance the SelectUSA program, which was launched in 2011 to coordinate state and local incentive programs to attract overseas companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The President praised the competitiveness of the US economic climate which has made the country the number one destination of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">After leaving the US for a decade, jobs are now starting to come back again, Obama said, citing Caterpillar, Ford and Intel as domestic examples.</seg>
<seg id="7">Obama also cited companies not based in the US like Japanese carmaker Honda that is expanding production operations in Ohio, in Alabama and Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="8">"And today, more Hondas are made in America than anyplace else in the world," Obama added.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-day conference, sponsored by the US Commerce Department, brings together 1200 business leaders, global investors, government officials and representatives from states, territories and the District of Columbia to explore business and investment opportunities in the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">The goal of the meeting is to promote the US as the first destination for business investment and to demonstrate the Obama administration's commitment to business investment as an engine for economic growth and job creation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the recent political brinkmanship in Congress that brought the US within shouting distance of a default, Wall Street executives depicted the country as investment-safe.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have the most resilient capital markets in the world, the most robust banking in the loan market and were quickest to resolve the banking crisis," said Larry Fink, CEO of investment firm BlackRock.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gene Sperling, Director of the National Economic Council, cited advanced manufacturing, cheap energy prices and an internationally coveted higher education system as additional reasons to invest in the US.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Sperling and other participants were also quick to name a few obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among them were an underfunded infrastructure, the lack of comprehensive immigration reform and the looming fiscal wars in Congress, which create uncertainty and unpredictability for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the US economy seems to be on track to renew its growth path, albeit slowly, according to analysts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Right now, the US is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world.</seg>
<seg id="18">The five largest sources are the UK, Japan, Germany, Canada and France.</seg>
<seg id="19">Together with the rest of the EU and Australia, they represent nearly 80 percent of US FDI stock.</seg>
<seg id="20">Direct investment in the US economy exists across industry sectors.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the US government, more than one third of FDI is in manufacturing.</seg>
<seg id="22">International companies maintain US manufacturing operations in chemicals, primary and fabricated metals, transportation components ranging from aerospace to motor vehicle manufacturing, textiles and more.</seg>

<seg id="1">The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall, serving as the foremost boundary between the old school yard - which is due to be renovated - and Kirchstrasse, will once again feature on the renovation cost plan for the town of Bräunlingen.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the days before the Kilbig Autumn Folk Festival, when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard, a small corner wall with balustrades was installed to stabilise and relieve the static load on the old natural stone wall, which is more than one hundred years old.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlingen Municipal Planning and Building Control Authority, the ongoing procedure plans to involve the Regional Memorial Authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall.</seg>
<seg id="4">A cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals, which will then be submitted to the Town Council, which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure.</seg>
<seg id="5">A decision is expected to be made in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Following the renovation, plastering and planting of trees in the old internal school yard, within the two wings of the 1912 school, as a subsequent measure the boundary wall, which is in need of refurbishment, must be renovated from the ground up within the foreseeable future.</seg>
<seg id="7">The historic, one hundred-year-old boundary wall between the old school-yard and Kirchstrasse is in need of renovation, primarily as a result of water and frost damage, on account of the lack of drainage, and is leaning forwards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage, however, at present the wall is not in danger of collapse.</seg>
<seg id="9">A secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils, and this is the purpose of the current fortification work.</seg>
<seg id="10">The school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008/2009, however, high unplanned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Regional Memorial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming.</seg>
<seg id="12">If this authority were to impose requirements, then the town of Bräunlingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument preservationists.</seg>
<seg id="13">The pupils of the Bräunlingen Primary School, who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building, with a new hall, will soon be able to use the old school yard as well.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC 'not sorry for Jo Brand's Prince Harry cocaine joke'</seg>
<seg id="2">Jo Brand implied that Harry 'snorts' cocaine on Have I Got News for You</seg>
<seg id="3">Also called Prince George's godfather William van Cutsem 'Hugh', the name of his brother and late father</seg>
<seg id="4">BBC has apologised for the mistake but says the joke is 'tongue in cheek'</seg>
<seg id="5">The BBC has apologised over a controversial joke which suggested Prince Harry takes cocaine - but only for getting the name of a friend of the Royals wrong in the gag.</seg>
<seg id="6">Comedian Jo Brand said on Have I Got News for You: 'George's godparents include Hugh van Cutsem - I presume that's a nickname as in Hugh van cuts 'em and Harry then snorts 'em.'</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, Prince George's godfather is William van Cutsem, whose brother and late father are both called Hugh, and the BBC has now apologised to Clarence House for the error.</seg>
<seg id="8">Controversy: Jo Brand, left, made a joke on Have I Got News for You which implied that Prince Harry took drugs</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the corporation has stood by the satirical suggestion that Harry takes drugs, saying that it was 'clearly tongue-in-cheek'.</seg>
<seg id="10">The joke was made on last Friday's edition of the comedy news quiz by Ms Brand, a member of the anti-monarchist organisation Republic.</seg>
<seg id="11">Panellists were discussing the christening of Prince George when she made the quip, which was written by producers and appeared on the host's autocue.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence that Prince Harry, a serving Army officer, has ever taken Class A drugs, although he is said to have smoked cannabis as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="13">Error: Ms Brand also referred to Prince George's godfather William van Cutsem, pictured with his wife Rosie, as 'Hugh', the name of hsi brother and late father</seg>
<seg id="14">The error about Mr van Cutsem's name added to the outrage expressed by many viewers.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was considered particularly insensitive as the elder Hugh van Cutsem, a close friend of Prince Charles, died just two months ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">The BBC wrote to Kensington Palace apologising for the mistake after Royal aides apparently contacted the corporation to complain.</seg>
<seg id="17">A BBC spokesman said: 'We apologise for the factual inaccuracy in last Friday's programme and have edited iPlayer and future repeats accordingly.'</seg>
<seg id="18">Shock: Fellow panellist Ian Hislop asked, 'Have we lost the lawyers?' after Ms Brand's joke</seg>
<seg id="19">Honourable: The fourth in line to the throne has served on two tours of duty to Afghanistan as an Apache pilot</seg>
<seg id="20">But the corporation has refused to budge from its previous argument that the drug reference was nothing more than a joke which should not be considered offensive.</seg>
<seg id="21">'Have I Got News For You is a satirical news quiz and the audience is used to the often irreverent humour,' a spokesman said this week.</seg>
<seg id="22">This was clearly a tongue-in-cheek comment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms Brand, 56, also said she would not apologise, pointing out that she did not write the joke but adding: 'I thought it was funny.</seg>
<seg id="24">I don't really understand what the fuss is about.'</seg>
<seg id="25">After she made the crack, fellow panellist Paul Merton looked shocked, while Ian Hislop said: 'Have we lost the lawyers?'</seg>
<seg id="26">Lord Dannatt, former head of the Army, later said that the suggestion was 'outrageous' and 'most inappropriate'.</seg>
<seg id="27">Defence minister Anna Soubry added: 'That is disgraceful, shoddy, appalling and out of order.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prince Harry does an outstanding job in the Army and always goes the extra mile to help wounded service personnel and veterans.</seg>

<seg id="1">NYSE Liffe tackles coffee and cocoa queues</seg>
<seg id="2">Coffee roasters and chocolate makers could benefit from lower raw materials costs as the exchange that oversees the warehousing of official stocks attempts to tackle delivery queues for coffee and cocoa.</seg>
<seg id="3">The queues to remove coffee and cocoa beans from NYSE Liffe warehouses have led to extra costs for traders and end users, leading to calls for tighter regulation.</seg>
<seg id="4">IN Commodities</seg>
<seg id="5">The London-based exchange this week announced a consultation on warehouse delivery practices and charges, seeking detailed information from its users.</seg>
<seg id="6">The move comes as IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) prepares to take over NYSE Euronext.</seg>
<seg id="7">ICE has indicated that warehousing practices on soft commodities deliveries would be one of the priorities among the issues to be reviewed once the deal is completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Long waiting times at official commodity exchange warehouses have been a problem over the past few years, and have been especially acute in the metals industry.</seg>
<seg id="9">Long queues at aluminium and copper warehouses have triggered complaints from metal users and the London Metal Exchange is considering proposals to cut waiting times, which can be as long as a year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Waiting times for robusta coffee deliveries at NYSE Liffe warehouses have been especially long in Antwerp, according to traders, causing concern among end users.</seg>
<seg id="11">As waiting times peaked in 2011-12, those seeking coffee bean deliveries had to wait as long as four months, adding to storage fees.</seg>
<seg id="12">Traders said large chocolate and coffee groups had held meetings with the exchange to air their worries.</seg>
<seg id="13">Part of the problem was that there had been no rules for minimum delivery rates, said market experts.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last year, the Belgian competition authorities ordered Antwerp-based warehouse keeper Port Real Estate, handling coffee beans certified by NYSE Liffe, to make a minimum rate of deliveries after Armajaro Trading, the soft commodities trader, lodged a complaint that the warehouse group was moving out the commodity at an unreasonably slow pace.</seg>
<seg id="15">NYSE Liffe later came out with its own minimum delivery rate rules at the end of last year, stipulating that warehouses holding less than 30,000 tonnes of coffee certified by the exchange should deliver a minimum of 250 tonnes per day, and requiring those holding more than that level to move out a minimum of 500 tonnes per day.</seg>
<seg id="16">Coffee traders said the waiting times had come down to about 6 to 8 weeks but said the exchange's consultation was a welcome move.</seg>
<seg id="17">"[The queues] are not as egregious as a year ago but there still needs to be improvement," said one coffee market specialist.</seg>
<seg id="18">In cocoa, the minimum delivery rate rules are scheduled to be implemented in December this year.</seg>
<seg id="19">As with coffee, warehouses holding less than 30,000 tonnes of certified cocoa must load out a minimum of 250 tonnes per day, while those holding more than 30,000 tonnes need to move out a minimum of 500 tonnes per day.</seg>

<seg id="1">Banker on top of his game</seg>
<seg id="2">'More work to be done': Cameron Clyne is confident the bank can lift profits further next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Louise Kennerley</seg>
<seg id="4">This time last year, National Australia Bank boss Cameron Clyne was in the hot seat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Investor frustration was building after a 22 per cent decline in annual profits backed up a perception the bank had a knack for springing unpleasant surprises.</seg>
<seg id="6">By December the anger had boiled over, with more than one in five shareholders voting against the remuneration report at the annual general meeting - a rare rebuke for a big bank.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fast forward to today and the outlook for the country's fourth biggest lender is looking more positive, amid signs its long-struggling British business may have put the worst behind it.</seg>
<seg id="8">In an interview with Weekend Business after the bank this week posted 9 per cent growth in full-year profit, to $5.94 billion, Clyne concedes there was a "bit of a market sentiment issue last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">But he said that "solid" results since then show it is getting on with the job of lifting returns.</seg>
<seg id="10">Moreover, he appears increasingly confident the bank can lift profits further next year as the long-suffering British economy picks itself up from the floor.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The UK is a legacy matter and I think we've just got to work our way through it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="12">If you've got a more buoyant economy then clearly what you've got is more economic activity, profitability improves, loan losses go down, more people are looking at the UK as a market to expand, so I think you've just got a whole series of things that are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Clyne was put in the the top job at the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008, NAB's troubled British business has been a consistent drag on profits and a weight on its share price.</seg>
<seg id="14">Coupled with the bank's exposure to toxic debt during the financial crisis, the British experience has helped make NAB the clear underperformer among its peers over five or 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Now, Britain is much less of a drag, as the economy finally recovers from a crippling recession.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nonetheless, Clyne concedes there is still more work to be done to improve shareholder returns.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is an area where the bank still lags its rivals, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Westpac.</seg>
<seg id="18">We would like to be the bank that's providing the best return to shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="19">That has been obviously an Achilles heel for us," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">But pleasingly we've had strong [total shareholder return] over this year and we're not the laggard over three years now.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't declare victory by any means on that because there's a lot more work to be done.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unlike its rivals, NAB's share price high this year, at $35.60, is still well below the record of $44.84 touched in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">But after a sector-leading 43 per cent gain in the stock over the past year, several broking analysts are also more bullish on NAB.</seg>
<seg id="24">Macquarie's Mike Wiblin predicts profit growth in the double-digits for next year on the basis that its vast business banking arm will benefit from a lift in corporate borrowing.</seg>
<seg id="25">"NAB is still the cheapest of the banks despite the sources of discount, namely the UK and Aussie impairment getting better," says Wiblin, who has a buy rating on the stock.</seg>
<seg id="26">Not all of are so positive.</seg>
<seg id="27">UBS analyst Jonathan Mott points out that profit before provisions for bad loans has now been flat for seven quarters.</seg>
<seg id="28">And for all the talk of a bounce in corporate borrowing, lending to business is virtually flat, growing by just 1 per cent a year.</seg>
<seg id="29">NAB also remains a long way from its former glory in the mid-1990s, when it was the largest of the big four by market capitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Clyne, a towering former rugby player, argues size is not the right gauge of performance.</seg>
<seg id="31">Indeed he says it is still possible to be the best when you're the smallest of the majors, as NAB is today.</seg>
<seg id="32">I don't focus on size, because I think that can lead you down to a situation where pursuing that is your sole goal, as opposed to saying well it might be fine to be fourth in terms of size if you're also delivering superior returns to shareholders and also superior offerings your customers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Earlier this year, speculation erupted over who may replace Clyne as the next boss of NAB when it hired investment banker Craig Drummond as its next finance chief.</seg>
<seg id="34">Clyne won't talk about how much longer he may spend in the role, but he does nominate what he sees the key benchmarks for success in his time leading the bank.</seg>
<seg id="35">First, he wants to make the bank stronger than it was when he started.</seg>
<seg id="36">Second, he wants to neutralise those "legacy issues" - which have also included exposure to toxic subprime debt and inadequate spending in technology.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think on both those topics, if I was to finish tomorrow, I feel we've had success on both fronts," Clyne says.</seg>
<seg id="38">There's no question that this bank is immeasurably stronger on just about every metric than it was five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite perceptions of being the laggard, Clyne also points out that if Britain is excluded, its return on equity is 17.4 per cent, better than many rivals.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is largely academic for many shareholders, of course.</seg>
<seg id="41">But Clyne argues these high returns from its domestic operations show its main business is indeed "firing on all cylinders," at a time when the outlook for its British arm is also more promising.</seg>
<seg id="42">There's a lot of things you don't control.</seg>
<seg id="43">Obviously a very material driver for us is the UK.</seg>
<seg id="44">But I just go back to saying this bank is stronger than it was five years ago, it will be stronger tomorrow than it was today ... and we're not adding to the legacy, we're strengthening the franchise," he says.</seg>
<seg id="45">So I'm quite relaxed that whatever time frame it is that I'm no longer CEO, as long as the bank's stronger than it was when I started, that's fine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Man Says He Was Drunk, Angry When Killed Neighbors</seg>
<seg id="2">A 66-year-old great-grandfather told police he was filled with anger and alcohol when he shot two women with an assault rifle in a Detroit retirement home, enraged at what he believed were their persistent intrusions into his relationship with another woman.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mike Reda's videotaped interrogation with Detroit police detectives was played in court Thursday during a hearing at which a judge determined there was enough evidence for him to stand trial on two counts of first-degree murder, assault with intent to murder and other felony charges.</seg>
<seg id="4">He's accused of shooting Deborah Socia, 59, and Maria Gonzalez, 61, on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="5">20 at the two-story, 80-unit Pablo Davis Elder Living Center on the city's southwest side.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I was drunk, I was angry," Reda told investigators.</seg>
<seg id="7">I just couldn't take it no more.</seg>
<seg id="8">Reda said during the interrogation on the day after the shootings that he was retired, lived alone at the center and had seven children as well as more than two dozen grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="9">He had dated the same woman for several years, but said the two women had befriended her and frequently kept the girlfriend away from him.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said he'd been drinking brandy and couldn't remember most details of the day, but later in the interview told the two detectives that he approached Socia and another man, Paul Fratangelo, on the center's grounds with his MP5 rifle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Reda said his rifle discharged one time "by accident."</seg>
<seg id="12">Reda said he then went inside to Gonzalez's apartment, kicked in her door and shot her twice in the head.</seg>
<seg id="13">He asked detectives twice if the women were alive or dead, and at the end of the interview one investigator told him they were dead.</seg>
<seg id="14">Reda paused, sighed heavily and said, "That's really bad."</seg>
<seg id="15">Defense attorney Bryan Sherer declined comment before and after the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Friends and family members of the victims also declined comment outside court.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fratangelo testified that he was sitting on a bench with Socia, smoking a cigarette and talking before dinner, when Reda walked toward them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Fratangelo, 61, said Reda swung his weapon back and forth between the two while ordering Fratangelo to "basically get on my knees and pray."</seg>
<seg id="19">I said, 'Mike, not this.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not like this.</seg>
<seg id="21">We're both vets.'</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm basically pleading with my life," Fratangelo said, adding that Reda seemed "on edge" but "very composed."</seg>
<seg id="23">Fratangelo said Socia asked Reda what he was doing, and he fired his gun one time.</seg>
<seg id="24">Afterward, Fratangelo said he entered the building and tried to trap Reda between two sets of doors.</seg>
<seg id="25">Fratangelo then "bolted down the hall," told Socia's son that "Mike is on a rampage" and to "call 911."</seg>
<seg id="26">The judge struck down Sherer's argument that Fratangelo wasn't injured or threatened so his client shouldn't be held on the charge of assault with intent to murder.</seg>
<seg id="27">Reda's first appearance in trial court is scheduled for Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">9 haunted spots across America</seg>
<seg id="2">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</seg>
<seg id="3">Thomas House</seg>
<seg id="4">The Whaley House</seg>
<seg id="5">St. Augustine's lighthouse</seg>
<seg id="6">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</seg>
<seg id="7">Savannah, Georgia</seg>
<seg id="8">Charleston, South Carolina</seg>
<seg id="9">A Hollywood hotel makes no promises that you'll spot Marilyn Monroe</seg>
<seg id="10">There are reports of St. Augustine's lighthouse attracting "visitors" to its site</seg>
<seg id="11">The extraterrestrial Mothman made West Virginia's Point Pleasant famous</seg>
<seg id="12">(CNN) -- America is haunted.</seg>
<seg id="13">At least several paranormal investigators, all of whom promise to have witnessed the supernatural, told CNN they believe it to be true.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's why we've taken cues from experienced investigators and experts for fright-inspired destination ideas this Halloween season.</seg>
<seg id="15">Here are some of their favorites.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hollywood Roosevelt, California</seg>
<seg id="17">Located on Hollywood's Walk of Fame across from Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Hollywood Roosevelt has a glamorous history: Marilyn Monroe was the hotel's most famous resident.</seg>
<seg id="18">It turns out, she might still be there, according to Brad and Sherry Steiger.</seg>
<seg id="19">Paranormal authors and investigators, the Steigers were filming at the hotel with several productions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sherry was explaining the history of the hotel's most famous mirror, in front of which many visitors have had psychic experiences.</seg>
<seg id="21">And as we were standing there, a gentleman just jumped back like he'd been shoved and he said, 'Who do you think you are?'</seg>
<seg id="22">"Well that stopped production and we had to find out," Brad said.</seg>
<seg id="23">I asked the man what had happened.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said, 'Well this blonde lady came running like she owns Hollywood and pushes me aside.'</seg>
<seg id="25">If you go: You can simply book a room at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you want to try to spot Marilyn, the hotel offers a "Marilyn Monroe package" ($1,800/night) which includes a stay in the Marilyn suite and tickets to the Marilyn exhibit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thomas House, Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee</seg>
<seg id="28">With a history dating back to the late 1800s, the Thomas House in Red Boiling Springs began as the Cloyd Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="29">Indeed, one of the ghosts still said to roam the bed and breakfast is Sarah Cloyd.</seg>
<seg id="30">Visitors trade reports of possible deaths on the property, which may fuel activity.</seg>
<seg id="31">The hotel was featured on "Paranormal State" in 2009, an A&E cable network program that aired until 2011.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you go: You can go for dinner and the "Ghosts of the Inn" show and tour, and book a room at the bed and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Thomas House also hosts several "Ghost Hunt weekends," with the next available dates in January, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Whaley House Museum, San Diego, California</seg>
<seg id="35">One of the Steigers' most memorable visits is "right on the tourist map, but it still packs a metaphysical punch," Brad Steiger said.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that's the Whaley House in old San Diego.</seg>
<seg id="37">The California house has a long history; and, like its home state, the house has been many things at different times, with origins dating back to the 1800s and including several hangings.</seg>
<seg id="38">"It just kept growing," Brad said.</seg>
<seg id="39">It started as, the judge, his home.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then it became a courthouse and his home.</seg>
<seg id="41">Then it became a theater and his home.</seg>
<seg id="42">Then there were hangings that took place in the backyard and eventually that hanging area, where people were hanged, became part of the house.</seg>
<seg id="43">While investigating, Sherry said she captured psychic phenomena on film -- a picture of a noose, coming right down in the room.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I had no inkling anything would develop and lo and behold, there were so many pictures," she said.</seg>
<seg id="45">What should have been a photo of one of the beds instead revealed a ghostly figure, just waking up.</seg>
<seg id="46">If you go: Now a museum, tourists can take tours.</seg>
<seg id="47">St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum, Florida</seg>
<seg id="48">First christened as a lighthouse in 1824 (it started out as a watchtower) the structure lost a long battle with the shoreline before collapsing during a storm in 1880.</seg>
<seg id="49">Luckily, its successor had already been completed in 1874.</seg>
<seg id="50">That lighthouse is now St. Augustine's oldest structure -- a status that has given it plenty of time to attract "visitors."</seg>
<seg id="51">What's more, a keeper's house was added to the grounds in 1876 and people lived and worked the lighthouse for decades, until 1955.</seg>
<seg id="52">The unexpected was at play at the lighthouse when investigator Jason Hawes and his team visited.</seg>
<seg id="53">They believed they would disprove the reports of activity, finding "just local sounds and things of that nature."</seg>
<seg id="54">"And we actually caught some of the 'holy grail,' what appeared to be people leaning over rails, showing up on thermal, showing up on infrared when there's no one else in there," said Hawes, founder of the Atlantic Paranormal Society and one of the stars and producers of SyFy's long-running "Ghost Hunters."</seg>
<seg id="55">If you go: While other tours are available, the "Dark of the Moon" tour is billed as "the only ghost tour that gets you in the tower."</seg>
<seg id="56">The town of Gettysburg has its share of haunted history.</seg>
<seg id="57">No wonder: Approximately 7,000 people died -- both Union and Confederate soldiers -- during the Battle of Gettysburg at the heart of the Civil War.</seg>
<seg id="58">About another 3,500 died in the weeks and months following the battle.</seg>
<seg id="59">Buell, founder of the Paranormal Research Society and host of A&E's "Paranormal State," remembers getting shot there.</seg>
<seg id="60">Except he never was.</seg>
<seg id="61">We were taking a ghost tour of Gettysburg (National Military Park) and suddenly I was having trouble breathing ...</seg>
<seg id="62">"I was wheezing and I was having trouble breathing and the pain, it got worse," Buell said.</seg>
<seg id="63">Buell went to the hospital, and the doctors ran some tests.</seg>
<seg id="64">Long story short, suddenly they come running back and they tear off my shirt and they said something like, 'Where's the exit wound?'</seg>
<seg id="65">"" Buell said.</seg>
<seg id="66">But no exit wound ever appeared on his body.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you go: There are several Gettysburg ghost tours, including Gettysburg Ghost Tours and Ghosts of Gettysburg (which is hosted by a former park ranger).</seg>
<seg id="68">Charleston and Savannah</seg>
<seg id="69">Older cities such as Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, remind tourists that they just might be walking on bones.</seg>
<seg id="70">Savannah is "literally built on its dead," Hawes said.</seg>
<seg id="71">When they're going to put up buildings, they have to do tests, core samples, to see if they find any bones.</seg>
<seg id="72">Robert Edgerly, founder of one of the city's popular walking ghost tours and author of "Savannah Hauntings," said that the 17hundred90 Inn is one of his favorite local spots.</seg>
<seg id="73">The 17hundred90 Inn, first built in the 1800s, is proud of its paranormal history, with an entire section of the website devoted to people's experiences.</seg>
<seg id="74">The inn's most famous resident is Anne Powell, who reportedly fell from a window to her death, though the event is clouded with rumor.</seg>
<seg id="75">Charleston is no less spooky -- especially the Old City Jail, which is famous for the prisoners kept locked behind its bars, including Lavinia Fisher, often thought of as America's first female mass murderer.</seg>
<seg id="76">If you go: Savannah visitors can book a room at the 17hundred90 Inn.</seg>
<seg id="77">Charleston features many tours, with the Ghost & Dungeon Walking Tour, Charleston's Ghost Hunt and Ghosts of the South among the options.</seg>
<seg id="78">Gilliland's Ranch, Trout Lake, Washington</seg>
<seg id="79">Gilliland's Ranch, in Trout Lake is fairly new as a paranormal hotspot, at least measured against the decades- or centuries-plus history of some of the other locales on our list.</seg>
<seg id="80">Owned and operated by James Gilliland -- whose resume includes minister, counselor, author and radio host -- the ranch distinguishes itself in other ways: Buell said he was "guaranteed" to experience activity on his first visit, a rare and rarely true claim.</seg>
<seg id="81">Gilliland "claimed he was being visited by aliens, all the time, and that there were supernatural beings on his property," Buell said.</seg>
<seg id="82">So a friend, another paranormal aficionado, took up the claim and reported back.</seg>
<seg id="83">He's like, 'I swear to you, all night long we had experiences in this place ...</seg>
<seg id="84">"Every night, something happened,' " Buell said.</seg>
<seg id="85">A big ball of light would appear and then split up into triangles and then regroup -- circling and darting unnaturally, according to Buell's friend.</seg>
<seg id="86">Many people claim to have experienced contact with extraterrestrial life at the ranch, with anecdotes spread across the Web.</seg>
<seg id="87">If you go: Contact the ranch to schedule a private tour.</seg>
<seg id="88">Reservations are required.</seg>
<seg id="89">Point Pleasant, West Virginia</seg>
<seg id="90">West Virginia's Point Pleasant is synonymous with the story of the Mothman, an extraterrestrial creature sighted throughout the town in the late 1960s and made famous by the book "The Mothman Prophecies," later adapted as a film starring Richard Gere.</seg>
<seg id="91">The town boasts several landmarks, including the Mothman Statue, which depicts the creature as a silvery humanoid, with teeth bared.</seg>
<seg id="92">The Lowe Hotel is nearby, offering an easy second stop on any personalized ghost tour.</seg>
<seg id="93">Not only does it house the Mothman Museum, the hotel is home to a small coterie of otherworldly figures.</seg>
<seg id="94">Many people assume the experiences in the town have stopped.</seg>
<seg id="95">Not so.</seg>
<seg id="96">While he was visiting, Buell had some "really crazy experiences," including a brush with the Mothman that involved an underground munitions bunker, a voice-activated tape recorder and a psychic.</seg>
<seg id="97">"You want to talk about something right out of 'The X-Files' -- here's Point Pleasant," he said.</seg>
<seg id="98">If you go: Book a room at the Lowe Hotel and take a tour of the hotel museum.</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tea party is aghast.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.</seg>
<seg id="11">This really is a must for our nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is not a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars get many more miles to the gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
<seg id="25">California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People are paying more directly into what they are getting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is looking into one.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="49">The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.</seg>
<seg id="63">An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.</seg>

<seg id="1">Former Cleveland Police officer guilty of a string of sex crimes including EIGHT rapes</seg>
<seg id="2">Wayne Scott, 37, was previously employed by Cleveland Police</seg>
<seg id="3">He has been found guilty of the rape and attempted rape of a woman</seg>
<seg id="4">He had already admitted raping another victim seven times, a court heard</seg>
<seg id="5">Scott has been remanded in custody until sentencing next month</seg>
<seg id="6">Guilty: Wayne Scott, who was employed by Cleveland Police, has been convicted of a string of sex crimes</seg>
<seg id="7">A former police officer has been convicted of a string of sex crimes - including eight rapes and two serious sexual offences against a child.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wayne Scott, who was previously employed by Cleveland Police, was found guilty of the rape and attempted rape of a woman today after a five-day trial.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 37-year-old had already admitted raping a different woman seven times over a number of years, a court heard.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Scott's colleagues are appealing for any more of his victims to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="11">Detective Superintendent Peter McPhillips, of Cleveland Police, said: 'I am pleased with the outcome given today.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne Scott is a sexual predator who has been a disgrace to the office of constable and deserves to be behind bars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Scott was arrested in August 2011 following on-duty allegations, and subsequently suspended and dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Our objective since has been to discover whether his behaviour was more widespread and to protect the public from him.</seg>
<seg id="15">That objective has now been achieved.</seg>
<seg id="16">During the trial, Newcastle Crown Court heard that Scott had ripped off his victim's jeans and underwear before attempting to rape her.</seg>
<seg id="17">He had then raped her in his car in a subsequent attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">Locked up: The 37-year-old was found guilty of the rape and attempted rape of a woman today, after already admitting raping another victim seven times over a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Above, Scott is pictured in custody</seg>
<seg id="20">Scott had already confessed to two common assaults, one sexual assault and two counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual touching, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had also referred to himself as 'sexed up" during a police interview and had made advances to some of his former colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">Today, Mr McPhillips paid tribute to the strength and courage of Scott's victims as they had gone through the court process.</seg>
<seg id="23">'The offences for which Scott has been convicted of today occurred off duty but as a police officer he knew better than most the severity of his crimes,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was a disgrace to his uniform and there can be no place for people like him in the police service.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the jury delivered its verdict, Judge James Goss QC said he would pass sentence on December 23.</seg>
<seg id="26">Scott has been remanded in custody until then.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former US intelligence expert, Edward Snowden, may make further statements regarding the US espionage scandal from his Russian asylum.</seg>
<seg id="3">Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was reported by the Interfax Agency with reference to groups aware of the situation, which were not named in greater detail.</seg>
<seg id="5">Such matters are to be clarified at an intergovernmental level, it was stated.</seg>

<seg id="7">"If this were to happen, he would lose his status as a refugee," said the Agency, quoting their source.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snowden would be at risk of deportation if he were to travel there, the source continued.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scandals surfacing in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Washington, as polls show voter distaste for politicians</seg>
<seg id="2">In Los Angeles, a former aide to City Councilman Jose Huizar filed a lawsuit alleging that he had harassed and punished her when she refused to provide sexual favors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not true, the married councilman said; it was a consensual affair.</seg>
<seg id="4">Another former council aide has filed a lawsuit alleging that a second councilmember, Mitch Englander, not only allowed a harassing environment to exist in his office but also took part with inappropriate remarks.</seg>
<seg id="5">He denied it.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Sacramento, an FBI affidavit was said to claim that state Sen. Ronald Calderon (D-Montebello) had accepted more than $60,000 in bribes from undercover FBI agents, allegations first reported Wednesday by the Al Jazeera television network.</seg>
<seg id="7">By Thursday morning, as Calderon's attorney was pleading his innocence, other legislators were scrambling to avoid being sucked into the quicksand.</seg>
<seg id="8">State Senate leader Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento took issue with Calderon's claim that as a favor he had hired an unqualified woman onto the Senate staff.</seg>
<seg id="9">The woman, unbeknown to any legislator, was an undercover FBI agent.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Washington, Republicans and Democrats showed no signs of abating their partisan tit-for-tat, most recently at a congressional hearing Wednesday where Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was raked over the coals for the balky opening of the federal healthcare.gov website.</seg>
<seg id="11">The meeting was replete with multiple references to Kansas - Sebelius is a former governor of the state, which means she deals with mentions of Dorothy and Toto and not being in Kansas anymore the way Californians bear the cross of flakiness, blond hair and surfers.</seg>
<seg id="12">At few points did it appear that anyone actually wanted to solve the problems of the healthcare rollout, with Republicans castigating and Democrats defending the administration.</seg>
<seg id="13">(ABC News columnist and former Bush campaign hand Matthew Dowd had a novel suggestion: how about holding hearings to ask questions to which you actually want answers, and which might solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14">No word on whether he had takers.)</seg>
<seg id="15">As the healthcare measure's tough start continued, President Obama pleaded for patience, promised the fixes would be made and blamed part of the mess on Republicans who had blocked the measure at every turn in legislatures, statehouses and the courts.</seg>
<seg id="16">All of it begged a question when NBC News and the Wall Street Journal released their newest poll.</seg>
<seg id="17">The question wasn't why 70% of the country thinks America is on the wrong track.</seg>
<seg id="18">The question: From what vat of optimism springs the 22% who think things are going well?</seg>
<seg id="19">The poll was the latest in a series of surveys to suggest indelicately that America would like its political leaders to either shape up or go away for a very, very long time.</seg>
<seg id="20">The number who thought things were going well wasn't the lowest of all time - it had actually gone up since earlier in the month - but both President Obama and congressional Republicans were suffering through their lowest numbers on record.</seg>
<seg id="21">Obama's job approval was 42%, to 51% negative.</seg>
<seg id="22">His image among Americans - historically, the repository for their good feelings toward him even if the country is sliding downhill - was only 41% positive, the lowest of his tenure in the Oval Office, and 45% negative.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Republican Party was liked even less, at 22% positive and 53% negative, also a record.</seg>
<seg id="24">The poll generated some suggestions that voters might exact revenge on Congress in the 2014 elections.</seg>
<seg id="25">But there were other suggestions that things may just continue along in the current, addled way.</seg>
<seg id="26">Asked whether they want Republicans or Democrats to control Congress next year, voters were split almost equally.</seg>
<seg id="27">Asked whether they would vote to reelect their own representative, about three in 10 said they would - a number which stands to rise as memories of the recent impasses fade (assuming they are not replaced by images of new impasses).</seg>
<seg id="28">All told, bad news all around.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not that it changed anything: Within hours the Senate was tied up in knots again, as minority Republicans blocked two Obama administration appointments, setting up the possibility of a renewed partisan fight over the Senate's filibuster rules.</seg>

<seg id="1">Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmate with machetes</seg>
<seg id="2">Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two boys, aged 14 and 12, had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old to death and threw the body into a well, reported the "El Paï¿½s" newspaper on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">They then went and played football in front of their homes in a working class district.</seg>
<seg id="6">The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres to the north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.</seg>
<seg id="7">A five year-old half-sister of the younger offender, who they took with them, was to make a statement as an alibi, stating that she was sexually assaulted by the boy.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, when the girl described the progression of events to the police without mentioning an attack against herself, the two boys confessed to the pre-meditated murder of the 11-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="9">The older of the pair cited a rivalry on the football field as the motive.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was provisionally taken to a psychiatric young offenders institute.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany over US surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."</seg>
<seg id="9">Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.</seg>
<seg id="14">If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.</seg>
<seg id="16">However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."</seg>
<seg id="17">Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
<seg id="18">The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."</seg>

<seg id="2">TASMANIAN Premier Lara Giddings is hopeful a pulp mill can still be built in the state with failed timber company Gunns' permit going on the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gunns receivers KordaMentha have asked for expressions of interest in the company's assets, which include the controversial pulp mill project's permit and Bell Bay site.</seg>
<seg id="4">The assets also include several forestry businesses and 96,850 hectares of hardwood and softwood plantations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gunns' inability to attract an investor partner to build the $2.3 billion pulp mill is considered a major factor in the company's collapse last year.</seg>
<seg id="6">The mill has also attracted fierce opposition from environmentalists and its permit is likely to still be subject to a court challenge by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I strongly support the construction of a pulp mill to value-add our extensive plantation resource and create jobs at a time when they are needed more than ever," Premier Giddings said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">If the pulp mill proceeds, it will be the single biggest capital investment in Tasmania's history, it will generate significant employment and I am confident it will meet world's best practice environmental standards.</seg>
<seg id="9">Expressions of interest for the assets close at the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rejected railway bid the reason Clive Palmer turned against Newman Government</seg>
<seg id="2">Anthony Albanese says Clive Palmer needs to be aware of the rules about conflicts of interest.</seg>
<seg id="3">A THWARTED bid to build his own railway in Queensland's Galilee Basin is behind billionaire Clive Palmer's bitter war with Premier Campbell Newman which has descended into name calling and corruption claims.</seg>
<seg id="4">Senior Government sources yesterday insisted Mr Palmer remains smarting over a decision last year to reject his railway bid in preference for two other alignments promoted by his rivals with mines in the area.</seg>
<seg id="5">The decision has stranded Mr Palmer's emerging thermal coal mine in western Queensland, potentially costing him millions of dollars in delays and forcing him to negotiate with Indian mining giants GVK and Adani as well as rail operator Aurizon over access.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sources within meetings at which the original flare-up was ignited, and eventually compelled Mr Palmer to launch his own political party, claim the billionaire at one stage arrived with his own legislation drafted which he wanted the Newman Government to introduce.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mining magnate Clive Palmer has been elected to the federal parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">The mining magnate's law would have made him owner and operator of the only railway line to service the Galilee Basin, forcing rivals to be customer whose coal would have been exported out of what would have been known as "Palmer's Wharf" at Abbott Point.</seg>
<seg id="9">``He kept saying he had all these backers and support for it," one source said.</seg>
<seg id="10">``He just wanted it handed to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Mr Palmer's corruption allegations centre on claims lobbying by Howard government minister Santo Santoro influenced the decision.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie recently wrote to the Crime and Misconduct Commission to urge the watchdog to investigate and compel Mr Palmer to produce any evidence in his possession.</seg>
<seg id="13">After claiming the Sunshine Coast Federal seat of Fairfax, Mr Palmer yesterday revealed plans to make Mr Newman "suffer slowly," claiming he had evidence of Government corruption that he would release when he was ready.</seg>
<seg id="14">He insisted a question of integrity hung over the Newman Government and he planned to use parliamentary privilege to expose how certain companies were being favoured over others.</seg>
<seg id="15">"As a member of parliament I think I only get to speak once every two weeks, I only get to ask a question once every two weeks so you might have to wait a while," Mr Palmer said.</seg>
<seg id="16">,Clive Palmer is the new MP for Fairfax.</seg>
<seg id="17">Pic Glenn Barnes</seg>
<seg id="18">``But that's okay because there's an old saying that if you're going to make someone suffer, let them suffer slowly.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Queensland Premier ditched his customary position against commenting on Mr Palmer and accused the mining magnate of being driven by a vendetta after his push for favourable treatment failed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Newman said Mr Palmer had his own integrity issues and accused the self-proclaimed billionaire, resort operator and budding film maker of planning to shirk his responsibilities as an MP to declare his interests.</seg>
<seg id="21">"He continues to make the assertion that he does not need to declare his pecuniary interests," the Premier said.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="23">He is now or shortly will be a fully-fledged sworn in Member of the Commonwealth Parliament and he must declare his pecuniary interests and obey the law.</seg>
<seg id="24">Insisting the Government had stood up to the push for preferential treatment, Mr Newman promised to full enforce State powers in relation to Mr Palmer's struggling north Queensland nickel refinery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We will not allow Mr Palmer to walk away from his environmental obligations in Townsville at his nickel refinery," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor will we allow him to walk away from his obligations to his employees in Townsville.</seg>
<seg id="27">After months of taking pot shots at other politicians, Mr Palmer was forced onto the defensive but welcome the Premier's backdown on not commenting about him.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I welcome the fact that the Premier's going to be talking publicly again," he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">I wouldn't want to muzzle the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="30">He said he had certificates of environmental excellence from the Government and had never walked away from environmental obligations.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Palmer said he planned "the biggest declaration in the world" of an elected official while insisting he was not motivated by revenge.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There's certainly no revenge in my heart - more love, not revenge, more reconciliation and forgiveness," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">I don't have anything against Campbell Newman personally.</seg>
<seg id="34">I just don't like what he does.</seg>

<seg id="1">More Yang Than Yin?</seg>
<seg id="2">Better Fix Your Life Force</seg>
<seg id="3">The fight is the thing in "Man of Tai Chi," Keanu Reeves's down-and-dirty and generally diverting directing debut.</seg>
<seg id="4">A story about the past and the future, the good and the bad, the strong and the weak, the movie finds a Januslike Mr. Reeves looking in two directions at once: toward the old-school kung fu movies of once upon a matinee time and the modern China emblemized by the high rises that slice through smog-swathed Beijing, where most of the story unwinds.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's there that Tiger (Tiger Chen) logs hours between lessons with a tai chi master, Yang (Yu Hai).</seg>
<seg id="6">Talented but headstrong, Tiger has a serious qi (life force) problem.</seg>
<seg id="7">It controls him, Master Yang warns, rather than the reverse, which leaves Tiger unbalanced (he's more yang than yin) and opens the door for the ensuing narrative complications.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Use four ounces to deflect 1,000 pounds," advises a classic tai chi adage, words that Tiger has a hard time embracing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Intent on proving that there's more to tai chi than meditation and old people moving really slowly in public parks, he competes in televised events that bring him to the attention of a wealthy fixer, Donaka Mark, one of those cackling villains, played by Mr. Reeves himself, in one of his few wrong moves here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Written by Michael G. Cooney, "Man of Tai Chi" hits its largely generic paces efficiently, introducing elements like a tough female Hong Kong cop, Suen Jing-Si (the reliably sympathetic Karen Mok), who knows that Donaka is up to no good.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some scenes in the Hong Kong police station where Jing-Si and her supervisor, Wong (the great Simon Yam), modestly thicken the thin plot and show that Mr. Reeves has watched his share of Hong Kong procedurals.</seg>
<seg id="12">While Jing-Si tries to figure out what role Donaka plays in illegal fights, Donaka chases after Tiger to be his next underground champion, slithering through the shadows as he feeds both Tiger's vanity and empty pockets.</seg>
<seg id="13">"He likes it," Donaka observes of the fighting Tiger who locks arms and legs around bigger men who snap like twigs, a comment that suggests Mr. Reeves knows exactly what his audience wants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Chen isn't much of an actor and, with his inexpressive face and stillness, he tends to disappear into the background whenever he's not fighting.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Reeves seems to have figured this out, and he keeps Mr. Chen in consistent, beautiful motion - the fight choreographer is Yuen Wo Ping - staging many of the encounters inside an austere gray room.</seg>
<seg id="16">There, men transform into gyroscopes as limbs and torsos spin, and you are reminded, once more, that one of the enduring pleasures of cinema is watching the human body move.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Man of Tai Chi" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).</seg>
<seg id="18">Martial arts violence.</seg>
<seg id="19">Man of Tai Chi</seg>
<seg id="20">Opens on Friday</seg>
<seg id="21">Directed by Keanu Reeves; fight choreography by Yuen Wo Ping; written by Michael G. Cooney; director of photography, Elliot Davis; edited by Derek Hui; music by Chan Kwong Wing; production design by Yohei Taneda; costumes by Joseph A. Porro; produced by Lemore Syvan; released by Radius/TWC.</seg>
<seg id="22">Running time: 1 hour 45 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Travelling BVB fans created terrible scenes with flares in the Veltins Arena before the district derby against Schalke</seg>
<seg id="2">Borussia Dortmund announced that there would be serious consequences.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before Friday's Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart, the 'Ultras' responded with silence - initially.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was an unusual, almost ghostly atmosphere that the fans created until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmend and VfB Stuttgart, in the Signal Iduna Park.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was mainly the chants of away fans that could be heard.</seg>
<seg id="6">The south stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and the loudest - of BVB fans stand, was initially unusually quiet: No singing and no battle cries.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 'Capo's' podium, the individual who usually coordinates the unison chants, remained empty.</seg>
<seg id="8">And right at the front, on the stand, a single large flag with the text "Stadium Ban Section" blew in the wind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when goalkeeper, Roman Weidenfeller, was the first BVB player to step onto the field, did cheers briefly erupt, as is usually the case.</seg>
<seg id="10">When his team mates followed, there was loud singing and scarves were waving -  but by no means everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the central blocks of the south stand, blocks 12 and 13, nothing moved.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even stadium announcer, Norbert Dickel, speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the derby victory, the win against Arsenal, the contract extension of coach Jörgen klopp - did not raise spirits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just five minutes before kick-off, the Capo climbed onto his podium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point, lifted with a large shout, as Dickel asked for a shout from each section of fans as usual.</seg>
<seg id="14">As always, the south stand was left until the end, and finally the stand resumed its usual role as the loudest section of the stadium.</seg>
<seg id="15">And as soon as the vociferous request for "derby winners stand up" came from the south stand upon kick-off, everything was back to normal.</seg>
<seg id="16">The previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days.</seg>
<seg id="17">Immediately before the local district derby against FC Schalke 04, some of the travelling BVB fans fired flares into the crowds of spectators and onto the pitch - and in so doing almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.</seg>
<seg id="18">The kick-off was delayed on account of the chaotic scenes,</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result, BVB Chairman Hans Joachim Watzke had invited the heads of the Dortmund Ultras fan group to his office - and if Watzke's words are to be believed, this was a rather uncomfortable meeting for the fan representatives.</seg>
<seg id="20">"There will be massive impact for the entire Ultra movement," announced the BVB Chairman on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="21">As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from organising choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I have banned it," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="23">We cannot ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding pyrotechnics in Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the Ultras were given the option of several different punishments - they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to accept.</seg>
<seg id="25">Otherwise BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week, said Watzke.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It will be severe," assured Watzke.</seg>
<seg id="27">It will be interesting to see the reactions in the south stand then.</seg>

<seg id="1">USC at Oregon State sure to cause a commotion</seg>
<seg id="2">CORVALLIS, Ore. - Pete Carroll did not want to acknowledge it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nor did Lane Kiffin.</seg>
<seg id="4">During their coaching tenures at USC, whenever they were asked why it was so difficult for the Trojans to defeat the Beavers on the road, they routinely praised Oregon State Coach Mike Riley.</seg>
<seg id="5">But they usually avoided mention of another factor for fear of distracting their players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ed Orgeron, USC's interim coach, praised Riley this week - "When the Trojans get up there, he seems to always have his team ready," he said - but he also cited an environment at Reser Stadium that will make it tough once again when the Trojans play Oregon State on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="7">A top-ranked USC team escaped from the fog-shrouded stadium with a victory in 2004, but since then Trojans teams ranked No.</seg>
<seg id="8">3, No.</seg>
<seg id="9">1 and No.</seg>
<seg id="10">20, respectively, were cut down by Riley, unintimidated Beavers players and some of the loudest, most engaged fans in the Pac-12 Conference.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Pretty insane," USC offensive lineman John Martinez said, describing the noise the last time the Trojans visited Reser Stadium in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thanks to Pac-12 scheduling, USC did not play Oregon State the previous two seasons, allowing the Trojans to skip a trip to Corvallis.</seg>
<seg id="13">But here they are again, an unranked 5-3 team hoping to improve its bowl-game prospects and keep alive interim Orgeron's drive to become the full-time coach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Riley, of course, has been mentioned as a candidate, though he has said he was not interested.</seg>
<seg id="15">USC wanted to hire Riley in 2000, but the former Trojans assistant could not get out of his contract with the San Diego Chargers.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2010, he also declined overtures from USC.</seg>
<seg id="17">This season, Riley and longtime offensive coordinator Danny Langsdorf are overseeing the top passing team in major college football, which features quarterback Sean Mannion and receiver Brandin Cooks.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Friday, the Beavers will debut new orange uniforms and helmets before a crowd that has been called to create an "Orange Out."</seg>
<seg id="19">During this week's Pac-12 coaches teleconference, Riley said "the only real explanation" for the Beavers' success against USC at Reser Stadium was "we maximize our playing when we've played them in the past."</seg>
<seg id="20">That's what it's always taken, they've been so good.</seg>
<seg id="21">Consider:</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2006, unbeaten, third-ranked USC fell behind, 33-10, early in the third quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">Co-offensive coordinators Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian abandoned the game plan and had quarterback John David Booty wing the ball all over the field.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Trojans came back and pulled to within 33-31 on Booty's touchdown pass to Steve Smith.</seg>
<seg id="25">But a two-point conversion pass to Dwayne Jarrett was batted away by an Oregon State lineman, and the Beavers recovered the ensuing onside kick.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It was David and Goliath and we just kept saying, 'Chop off their head,'" Oregon State receiver Sammie Stroughter said after the Beavers ended USC's 27-game conference winning streak,</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2008, top-ranked USC was coming off a victory over Ohio State.</seg>
<seg id="28">But unranked Oregon State, a 25-point underdog, got big performances from running back Jacquizz Rodgers and his brother James, a multitalented receiver, to upset the Trojans, 27-21.</seg>
<seg id="29">USC trailed 21-0 at halftime before pulling to within 21-14 on touchdown passes by quarterback Mark Sanchez to Ronald Johnson and Damian Williams.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Oregon State intercepted a pass and Jaquizz Rodgers scored a touchdown.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sanchez's late touchdown pass to Patrick Turner pulled the Trojans to within six points, but Oregon State recovered an onside kick and ran out the clock.</seg>

<seg id="2">Leonardo DiCaprio with Carey Mulligan in Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby.</seg>
<seg id="3">THE dramatic vocal performances of Jay-Z's Angels on Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby will keep the soundtrack in the charts for the rest of the year.</seg>
<seg id="4">While the music's executive producer Jay-Z opens the 14-track record, nine of the songs feature some of the best female voices of our times.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is no surprise that the reworking of the Amy Winehouse hit Back To Black by his missus Beyonce with Andre 3000 may be the most controversial musical moment from Gatsby.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is almost unrecognisable from the original, darker and so cut and pasted, it gives you the jitters after a couple of minutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The entire soundtrack is epic and edgey with orchestral flourishes or Jazz Age stylings underpinning most of the songs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Will.i.am's new offering Bang Bang channels the Charleston, features some nifty scatting and Louis Armstrong-inspired vocals with a rather naughty lyric hook.</seg>
<seg id="9">His Black Eyed Peas bandmate Fergie teams with Q-Tip and GoonRock on A Little Party Never Killed Nobody, which is also heavy on the jazz meets house vibe and could enjoy singles success.</seg>
<seg id="10">Listen to the The Great Gatsby soundtrack sampler below.</seg>
<seg id="11">Lana Del Rey (Young And Beautiful) and Florence And The Machine (Over The Love) were commissioned to write new songs for the film which are entirely what you would expect from both great artists and will no doubt prove to be captivating soundbeds in the film.</seg>
<seg id="12">And hits off it, should they be released commercially.</seg>
<seg id="13">Another original tune hails from The XX and their slavish fans will revel in its dark and insistent backing, metronomic beat and breathy, deep vocals which climax with an orchestral swell.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sia delivers a powerful performance worthy of Adele on Kill And Run which could easily also serve as a Bond theme.</seg>
<seg id="15">While the Back To Black cover may not tickle everyone's musical fancy, Jack White proves almost understated but compelling on his treatment of U2's Love is Blindness while Emilie Sande is perfect on the jazzified Crazy In Love, staying faithful to Beyonce's melody.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bryan Ferry's whispered smokey barroom reimagining of his own hit Love Is The Drug comes off a little bit creepy but a hell of a lot cool.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the finds unearthed by Jay-Z and Luhrmann is the big soul vocal of Coco O of Danish electro duo Quadron on Where The Wind Blows which is bedded by some old time piano sampling.</seg>
<seg id="18">And of course there's Gotye's Heart's A Mess - an old "hit" here but likely to keep the fan fires burning for him overseas where it won't be as familiar to his very large fan base.</seg>

<seg id="2">The highs and lows of Chris Brown</seg>
<seg id="3">Brown's bodyguard says he "was just doing his job" when he hit the man, report says</seg>
<seg id="4">"My bodyguard handled it," Brown told a Secret Service officer about incident</seg>
<seg id="5">A Metropolitan Police Department officer denies victim told him Brown never hit him, report says</seg>
<seg id="6">A Secret Service officer contradicts what the MPD officer says</seg>
<seg id="7">Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Secret Service report on Chris Brown's alleged assault on a man in Washington on Sunday offers insight into the singer's possible defense strategy.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document obtained by CNN suggests that Brown's bodyguard will take the rap for a man's broken nose, while lawyers could question the creditability of one of the police officers who investigated the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I was on the (tour) bus when I guess someone tried to get on and my bodyguard handled it," Brown told a Secret Service officer investigating the incident on a sidewalk in front of the W Hotel just a few blocks from the White House.</seg>
<seg id="10">The incident happened around 4:25 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sunday, hours after the singer hosted a party at a nearby nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Christopher Brown committed no crime," his attorney Danny Onorato said Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">We understand that his security acted to protect Mr. Brown and his property, as he is authorized to do under District of Columbia law.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are confident that Mr. Brown will be exonerated of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Brown bodyguard Christopher Hollosy -- who stands 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 240 pounds -- told investigators he punched the man in the face because he tried to follow Brown into the tour bus.</seg>
<seg id="16">The man was trying to get to Brown, so he "was just doing his job" as a bodyguard when broke his nose, he said, according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="17">Assault charge against Chris Brown reduced</seg>
<seg id="18">Brown's weekend arrest in the District of Columbia threatens his freedom in California, where he is serving felony probation for the 2009 domestic violence conviction in his attack on ex-girlfriend Rihanna.</seg>
<seg id="19">Beating the simple assault charge in Washington would help his lawyer persuade a Los Angeles judge not to find him in violation of probation rules, which require him to stay out of any legal trouble.</seg>
<seg id="20">Brown, 24, checked himself into a "rehab facility" Tuesday in an effort to "gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior, enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point," his representative told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is unclear if Brown's rehab stint will cause him to miss two court dates next month -- including a November 20 probation hearing in Los Angeles and a November 24 preliminary hearing on the assault case in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prosecution of the assault charges against Brown and his bodyguard is based on statements given to investigators by the alleged victim -- identified as Isaac Adams Parker, 20, of Beltsville, Maryland -- and a woman who is a friend of Parker.</seg>
<seg id="23">Cop's credibility questioned</seg>
<seg id="24">The woman, who is not identified in the police reports, told a Secret Service officer that the violence started when she and a female friend were standing on each side of Brown, posing while the singer's bodyguard used her cell phone to take a photo.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Parker "moved in" and tried to take his own photo with Brown and the women, she heard Brown tell Parker, "I'm not with that gay s--t," and then "I feel like boxing," according to the Secret Service report.</seg>
<seg id="26">Brown then punched Parker in the face with a closed fist, she said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Parker also told the Secret Service officer that when he tried to get into the photo, Brown said "I ain't down with that gay s--t," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Another witness told the officer that he saw Brown chase Parker and swing at him, but he couldn't see if Brown's punch landed on Parker.</seg>
<seg id="29">But Brown's lawyers could raise questions about Parker's credibility -- or at least the credibility of one of the investigating police officers -- based on what the Secret Service officer reported.</seg>
<seg id="30">Chris Brown fast facts</seg>
<seg id="31">A friend of Brown's says that a Metropolitan Police Department officer told him that Parker said Brown never hit him, the Secret Service report says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The report says the officer denied to other detectives that he had spoken to Brown's friend.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, the Secret Service officer contradicts him.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A uniformed Secret Service officer approached detectives and verified that he overheard the MPD officer" telling Brown's friend that Parker said Brown never hit him, the report says.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parker "denied he ever told anyone" that Brown had not hit him, according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="36">Anger management rehab?</seg>
<seg id="37">There has been no indication that Brown has a substance abuse problem.</seg>
<seg id="38">The behavior that has landed him in legal trouble over the past several years has been anger management.</seg>
<seg id="39">Brown's brutal attack on Rihanna on the eve of the Grammys in February 2009 resulted in a felony domestic violence conviction that carried a lengthy probation period.</seg>
<seg id="40">A judge found him in violation of that probation in August because of discrepancies in proving he fulfilled the court-ordered 1,400 hours of community labor.</seg>
<seg id="41">He imposed another 1,000 hours of work.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Los Angeles County district attorney appears in no mood to cut Brown any breaks, which suggests that prosecutors will ask for jail time for him because of the arrest early Sunday in the shadow of the White House.</seg>
<seg id="43">While the simple assault charge in Washington is a misdemeanor, it could trigger a probation revocation.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hit-and-run charge against Chris Brown dropped</seg>
<seg id="45">Brown is in a vulnerable position.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Los Angeles judge overseeing his felony probation could order him to complete as many as four years in prison for the beating of Rihanna if he is found in violation of probation.</seg>
<seg id="47">Prosecutors have declined to comment on if they will seek to put him behind bars.</seg>
<seg id="48">Brown spent 36 hours in a Washington jail and was taken to court in shackles Monday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="49">He was released and ordered to report to his California probation officer within 48 hours.</seg>
<seg id="50">He checked into an undisclosed California rehab facility the next day.</seg>
<seg id="51">The probation officer's job is to prepare a report for the Los Angeles judge who will decide if Brown will be found in violation of his probation.</seg>
<seg id="52">Going to rehab could allow Brown lawyer Mark Geragos to argue that the entertainer is getting proper help for his core problem.</seg>
<seg id="53">The statement from Brown's representative did not disclose how long he intends to stay or what might be a "healthier vantage point" for him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mark Hutchings is on the verge of making his AFL debut for West Coast.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Will Russell Source: PerthNow</seg>
<seg id="4">IF Mark Hutchings is named for his AFL debut this weekend, he'll be trying to keep his first game as simple as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Simple is how Hutchings likes to go about his footy.</seg>
<seg id="6">After all, it is what helped him get drafted to West Coast.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 21-year-old has been a standout performer for West Perth in the WAFL over the first seven rounds and his name continues to be thrown up by Eagles coaches as a possible inclusion each week.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hutchings was an emergency for last Saturday's game against Port Adelaide where the Eagles surrendered a 41-point lead to ultimately lose by five points.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eagles coach John Worsfold is likely to ring the changes following that embarrassing defeat, potentially opening the door for Hutchings to play against the Western Bulldogs at Patersons Stadium on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="10">If selected, Hutchings has promised to take the same approach into his first AFL game as the one that saw him poll an astonishing 51 Sandover Medal votes in last year's count, only to finish second behind Port Adelaide recruit Kane Mitchell (58).</seg>
<seg id="11">"You try not to think about it too much, you just do what you do and that's play footy," Hutchings said.</seg>
<seg id="12">You let the coaches make all the hard decisions, that's what they're getting paid to do.</seg>
<seg id="13">""What you're getting paid to do is play footy.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's pretty simple.</seg>
<seg id="15">I just try to keep it as simple as I can and it seems to take all the pressure off.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mark Hutchings never gave up hope of playing AFL.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hutchings was rookie-listed by St Kilda at 18, but lasted only one year at the Saints before returning to his family and friends in the west.</seg>
<seg id="18">The East Perth product switched to WAFL rivals West Perth in early 2011 and has worked hard over the past two seasons to earn another shot at the elite level.</seg>
<seg id="19">Being on the cusp of an AFL debut is not something Hutchings was contemplating this time last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I didn't have any grand plans of playing for the Eagles or anything like that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">The two years since coming back from Melbourne have been hard work.</seg>
<seg id="22">You learn a lot about how to play football and a lot about yourself.</seg>
<seg id="23">""I definitely feel like I've earned (this second chance) and now you feel like you owe it to yourself to make the most of this opportunity because you've worked so hard.</seg>
<seg id="24">The past couple of months have been whirlwind but great.</seg>
<seg id="25">I'm really enjoying it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hutchings admitted he feared his AFL dream was over after being delisted by St Kilda, but he stayed true to himself and never gave up hope.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mark Hutchings in action for West Perth this season.</seg>
<seg id="28">Picture: Justin Benson-Cooper Source: PerthNow</seg>
<seg id="29">Inspired by the likes of other mature-aged players such as Fremantle's Michael Barlow and Geelong's James Podsiadly, Hutchings said he was now better equipped to handle the pressures of being an AFL footballer.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Obviously the last few years there's been a few mature-age draftees around 23 or 24, and I'm only 21," he said.</seg>
<seg id="31">I knew there was still a few more years for my window of opportunity, so I wasn't too hung up on this year being the year.</seg>
<seg id="32">""The coaches have been happy with how I'm going and I'm happy that I'm sort of edging closer to that first game.</seg>
<seg id="33">The coaches have said, 'Just keep going at it, just be patient, be ready, make sure you're playing well and the time will come'.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax fizzy drinks by 20%, say doctors</seg>
<seg id="2">A 20 PER cent tax on fizzy pop would cut the number of overweight people in Britain by nearly half a million, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">Researchers say as the biggest consumers of sugary soft drinks, young adults would benefit the most.</seg>
<seg id="4">The study, published on bmj.com, claims a 20 per cent tax on sugar sweetened drinks would reduce the number of adults who are obese by 180,000 and who are overweight by 285,000.</seg>
<seg id="5">Researchers say the tax would also raise more than a quarter of a billion pounds a year to help the NHS cope with the burden of Britain's poor national diet.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the new study by the Universities of Oxford and Reading, the tax would cut the overall number of overweight and obese people by just over two per cent (2.2), although researchers calculate it could raise £276 million annually.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an accompanying editorial, Jason Block, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School in the United States, says the study provides evidence that a 20 per cent tax on sugary drinks can work and he calls on more countries "to implement high taxes and measure the results."</seg>
<seg id="8">A proposal by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges calling for the UK to pilot and monitor the effect of a one-year tax on sugary drinks "would be a good start," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We now need policy makers to act and provide opportunities for real-world evidence on a 20 per cent tax on sugar sweetened drinks," he concludes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation (BHF), which helped fund the study, said: "Guzzling fizzy drinks is now the daily norm for around 40 per cent of 13-year-olds."</seg>
<seg id="11">The effects on young people's health are a major concern.</seg>
<seg id="12">This research suggests that a health-related food duty could be an effective way - particularly in young people - to help reduce obesity.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, Terry Jones, director of communications at the Food and Drink Federation, said: "There are obvious limitations to any study of this type, as the paper's authors themselves highlight."</seg>
<seg id="14">Many food and drink products are already subject to VAT of 20 per cent in the UK and making them more expensive for people at a time when household budgets are already squeezed is not the answer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: "There's ample evidence to suggest that taxing soft drinks won't curb obesity, not least because its causes are far more complex than this simplistic approach implies."</seg>

<seg id="1">ESA makes decision on major space missions: Missions costing billions</seg>
<seg id="2">Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="3">There were 30 proposals to choose from, five of which are still in the running.</seg>
<seg id="4">Distant worlds.</seg>
<seg id="5">Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets near other stars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Whether or not life exists on at least some of these, no-one knows.</seg>
<seg id="7">The choice is a difficult one: Should we search for gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="8">Or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmos?</seg>
<seg id="9">Or search for planets similar to the Earth and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?</seg>
<seg id="10">These are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency, ESA.</seg>
<seg id="11">For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should greatly advance research.</seg>
<seg id="12">The budget for "L-Missions" such as this lies at around one billion Euro.</seg>
<seg id="13">The projects are planned to start in 2028 and 2034.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the beginning of September, the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
<seg id="15">30 ideas were up for debate, of which five have now made it onto the short list.</seg>
<seg id="16">Numerous panels are assessing the proposals, posing questions to the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the coming days, a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.</seg>
<seg id="18">In total, four main questions were chosen by the ESA, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, initiated in 2007, are to find the answers.</seg>
<seg id="19">What are the conditions required for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
<seg id="20">The precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - lie in proverbial darkness.</seg>
<seg id="21">A large infra-red telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.</seg>
<seg id="22">And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life exist there?</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to pursue this question, the "Cheops" space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail.</seg>
<seg id="24">The possibilities are, however, limited - Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro.</seg>
<seg id="25">With larger instruments, astronomers could map planets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres, and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity.</seg>
<seg id="26">How does the solar system function?</seg>
<seg id="27">This question should also provide information regarding the preconditions for the origins of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">The magnetic activity of a star, the interaction of its magnetic field and the emitted particle radiation play an important role.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system, to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="30">With the "Solar Orbiter", the ESA has already approved an M-class mission (for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro) to address this matter.</seg>
<seg id="31">The probe is to be launched in 2017 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="33">They want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.</seg>
<seg id="34">The ESA is planning that the first of the total of three L-Missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme will address this subject.</seg>
<seg id="35">The "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is planned to begin its journey in 2022.</seg>
<seg id="36">Eight years later it will reach Jupiter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.</seg>
<seg id="37">What are the basic physical laws of the Universe?</seg>
<seg id="38">Outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature, as known to us, are still valid there.</seg>
<seg id="39">There may also be deviations that could show physicians the path to a new theory, under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united.</seg>
<seg id="40">How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?</seg>
<seg id="41">13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.</seg>
<seg id="42">Alongside the materials familiar to us, from which stars, planets and life forms such as ourselves are composed, there exists dark matter, the gravitational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="43">Thus far, researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.</seg>
<seg id="44">With "Euclid", the ESA has already approved an M-mission, planned to commence in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="45">With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
<seg id="46">Proposals that are in the running...</seg>
<seg id="47">Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.</seg>
<seg id="48">The proposal with the best chance of approval as an L-mission, in the opinion of many experts, is "E-Lisa", a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many physicians perceive this to entail changes in the structure of space-time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="50">To date they have never been proved to exist.</seg>
<seg id="51">The scientists behind the project hope that Elisa could achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="52">The mission involves placing a detector, consisting of two or three probes, in outer space.</seg>
<seg id="53">Unlike systems on Earth, it could also prove gravitational waves created during the Big Bang, and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="54">Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission place: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which among other things would research black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "prism", a mission for the measurement of cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which would find and investigate planets similar to Earth.</seg>
<seg id="55">Among others, proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from Mars, conducting research on the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as proposals in the area of solar physics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mercury Prize 2013: why James Blake is a worthy winner</seg>
<seg id="2">James Blake is a worthy winner of the 2013 Barclaycard Mercury Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's Blake not Blunt, even if presenter Lauren Laverne mistakenly introduced him by the name of British music criticism's least loved singer songwriter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sentimentally, I suppose most people would have liked to see David Bowie carry off a prize that, in its celebration of adventurous British pop music, seems to have been made in his image.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Blake continues that tradition by making melodic, succinct, emotional pop so technologically spaced out that it really couldn't have existed at any other moment in time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, if Bowie was in his creative prime right now, he might well sound like this.</seg>
<seg id="7">His second album, Overgrown, is music full of spaces, with sub bass sounds that rattle your bones, and strung out melodies that use digital effects to render something more, not less human.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is really quite extraordinary stuff, and if the Mercury judges persuade the music lovers of Britain to investigate it further, then they will have done a worthwhile job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not that anyone seemed to be paying attention when he performed onstage earlier in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">At first, his hi tech torch song was so unassuming half the room didn't seem to notice he was even there, chattering through his autotuned soul until the synthetic sounds got so deep and loud our insides were vibrating.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Barclaycard Mercury Prize is a tough gig.</seg>
<seg id="12">The artists have to sing for the record industry's supper, which does seem slightly craven and demeaning for musicians deemed to be edgy, independent and adventurous.</seg>
<seg id="13">Performances are pitched at a level of intensity not really apparent in the blase indifference of a canape nibbling, wine sipping, evening wear clad music business audience.</seg>
<seg id="14">At times the chatter and clink of glasses makes Britain's most dynamic artists seem like a sideshow at a cocktail hour.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Roundhouse staging was brilliant, however, a cleverly split two tier stage, with one band playing on top of the other to facilitate speedy turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="16">It could be the future of festivals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Everyone gave it their best shot, from the dynamic rock of Foals and Savages to the computer grooves of Jon Hopkins and Disclosure, the celebratory electro soul of Rudimental and the solo piano intensity of Laura Mvula.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bowie, predictably, didn't show up, sending some startling video footage in his place.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Arctic Monkeys closed the show, and there wasn't a musician on the shortlist who could have followed them, with their perfect balance of stylish appearance and swaggering performance.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the back of five number one albums in a row, the Arctic Monkeys justifiably behave like kings of all they survey.</seg>
<seg id="21">In contrast, James Blake looks like a nervous interloper.</seg>
<seg id="22">But he sounds like the future, making music that couldn't have even been concieved at any other moment in time.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have a feeling that David Bowie would approve.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thu Oct 31, 2013 6:31pm EDT</seg>
<seg id="3">(Reuters) - AS Roma became the first team to win their opening 10 Serie A games of the season when they overcame bottom side Chievo 1-0 thanks to Marco Boriello's late header on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defiant visitors defended resolutely and physically for more than an hour and looked capable of denying Roma the record until striker Boriello broke the deadlock in the 67th minute.</seg>
<seg id="5">Roma, under new coach Rudi Garcia who took over at the start of the season, have 30 points, five clear of Juventus and Napoli with more than a quarter of the campaign completed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chievo have taken only four points from 10 games but made life unexpectedly difficult and frustrating for the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The packed their defense, harried Roma in midfield and stood over the ball at free kicks to stop them being taken quickly.</seg>
<seg id="8">Roma, who have conceded only one goal all season, were missing talismanic striker Francesco Totti and Ivorian forward Gervinho and they struggled to make chances against the wall of yellow shirts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tempers flared several times until the home side finally broke through when Alessandro Florenzi ran on to Miralem Pjanic's pass, weaved his way through a crowded area and chipped the ball up for Boriello to head in at the near post.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chievo could have equalized when Roma goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis failed to hold Luca Rigoni's long-range effort but Alberto Paloschi was offside as he closed in for the rebound.</seg>
<seg id="11">Garcia has transformed Roma from the erratic, bickering outfit who limped home in sixth place last term and lost to arch-rivals Lazio in the Coppa Italia final.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will try for an 11th consecutive win when they visit Torino in their next match on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="1">RICHARD KAY: Oligarch sues over his 'too small' statue</seg>
<seg id="2">By Richard Kay</seg>
<seg id="3">Beauty: Russian tycoon Andrey Melnichenko, pictured with wife Aleksandra, has taken legal action over the height of a sculpture</seg>
<seg id="4">First it was the painting of his £200 million superyacht, and now it's a statue he bought from an art dealer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Either way, it has drawn the Berkshire-based Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko into a legal wrangle.</seg>
<seg id="6">So while he sues Dulux for £62million, he has also taken legal action over the height of a sculpture which he purchased for a trifling £423,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">For when the figure was delivered, Melnichenko and his stunning former supermodel wife, Serbian-born Aleksandra, discovered it was half the size they had expected it to be.</seg>
<seg id="8">The work - two huge sleeping heads entitled Sonno Grande [big sleep] - by acclaimed Polish artist Igor Mitoraj should have been more than 7ft tall, according to the Melnichenkos, who are known for their money-no-object tastes.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the sculpture which was delivered was under 4ft in height.</seg>
<seg id="10">So Melnichenko, who at 41 is one of Russia's most powerful industrialists, decided through Isle of Man-based art company Hamilton Art Ltd to sue the New York art dealer which supplied it, David Benrimon, for both breach of contract and fraud.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time he claimed a whopping £2.6million in damages.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to legal documents, Benrimon has reached an agreed settlement with the oligarch, having earlier denied selling an undersized head.</seg>

<seg id="1">Alex Ross: Georg Friedrich Haas Arrives in New York: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">The opening minutes of Georg Friedrich Haas's Third String Quartet, which unfolds in total darkness and can last more than an hour, are so unsettling that the members of the JACK Quartet - who have performed the piece almost twenty times, and will play it again on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="3">19, as part of the White Light Festival - prep the audience with a "practice run" beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lights are turned off briefly, and anyone who feels too uncomfortable with the plunge into pitch-blackness can leave before the music begins.</seg>
<seg id="5">Occasional adverse reactions are understandable: it's like being buried alive.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the sounds that Haas elicits from the quartet - a minutely varied array of musical cries, whispers, songs, and sighs - gradually allow the ears to map a space that the eyes cannot see.</seg>
<seg id="7">The musicians are positioned around the hall, playing from memory.</seg>
<seg id="8">Toward the end, there is a quotation from the Responsoria of Carlo Gesualdo, the shadowy Renaissance master: it has the feeling of an occult communication.</seg>
<seg id="9">What begins as an experience of deprivation becomes one of radically heightened awareness.</seg>
<seg id="10">Haas, a sixty-year-old native of Graz, Austria, is among the leading European composers of the present day - a master of avant-garde techniques who has a flair for assembling large-scale structures.</seg>
<seg id="11">This year, he became a New Yorker, when Columbia University appointed him to its music faculty.</seg>
<seg id="12">I met him the other day at the Hungarian Pastry Shop, in Morningside Heights, which Haas described as "a very special place with an anachronistic Austrian-Hungarian character."</seg>
<seg id="13">He had with him, as reading material, a pocket score of Bartók's Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta.</seg>
<seg id="14">Soft-spoken and bespectacled, Haas is still adjusting to the tempo and the timbres of New York life.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yet he has long been open to American influences, having made a study of such experimental composers as Harry Partch and La Monte Young, who abandoned conventional Western scales in favor of intricately shaded, microtonal divisions of the octave.</seg>
<seg id="16">Haas's fascination with microtones, and particularly with the shimmering spectrum of overtones that arise from a resonating note, leads to an abiding ambiguity in his work, a pendulum swing between consonant purity and dissonant density.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the end, he says, "This distance between consonance and dissonance is a fiction."</seg>
<seg id="18">The two terms are all wrong for the complexity of our experience.</seg>
<seg id="19">Haas likes to present old instruments in new guises.</seg>
<seg id="20">His most recent theatre piece, "Thomas," which shows a man watching his partner die in a hospital ward, employs a spidery microtonal ensemble of harpsichord, harp, accordion, zither, mandolin, and guitar.</seg>
<seg id="21">He is also writing a concerto for four alphorns, drawing on the natural resonances of those long-tubed instruments, which have been echoing across Alpine valleys for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="22">And he plans to make further use of the in-the-dark effect, because of its power to focus the ears on sonic possibilities that, even after a century of modernism, still seem to him underexplored.</seg>
<seg id="23">"One thing I believe one hundred per cent," he told me.</seg>
<seg id="24">In each era, human beings will want to express themselves by creating new soundscapes.</seg>
<seg id="25">There will be no end of new music, ever.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israel will be first to receive V-22 Osprey aircraft from U.S.</seg>
<seg id="2">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said Thursday that it will provide six V-22 Osprey aircraft to Israel, making it the first foreign country to receive the advanced tilt-rotor planes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The planes can land and take off vertically by tilting their two propellers, expanding the Israeli military's ability to conduct long-range, high-speed troop movements into areas without runways and maritime search-and-rescue operations, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who announced the move in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League in New York, said the V-22 "will greatly enhance the range and effectiveness of Israeli special forces."</seg>
<seg id="5">He said the Israeli shipment would be part "of the next order to go on the assembly line."</seg>
<seg id="6">The first planes are likely to be delivered in two years and will be modified "to meet the specific requirements" of the Israel Defense Forces, a senior U.S. Defense official said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He agreed to discuss the deal only if he was not identified by name.</seg>
<seg id="8">The U.S. has long pledged to keep Israel's military stronger than any combination of its regional rivals, a U.S. policy referred to as giving Israel a "qualified military edge."</seg>
<seg id="9">Though the planes will not be delivered for several years, the U.S. official said, the V-22 "will help the IDF better deal with threats emanating not only from Iran, but also stemming from the civil war in Syria" and "maritime challenges."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since entering service in 2007, the V-22 has been used by the Marines and the U.S. Air Force in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and senior Marine officers said the plane has proved itself as one of the safest in its inventory, despite concerns during its development about its reliability.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the Marines, the plane is a replacement for the CH-46 helicopter, which is used primarily to transport Marines ashore from ships.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hagel also announced in the speech that he was ordering the head of the National Guard "to take immediate action" to ensure that same-sex spouses" of military personnel in the National Guard are able to register for full benefits and receive identification cards giving them access to military bases, in keeping with a Pentagon policy that went into effect in September.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the new policy, National Guard commanders in nine states that do not permit same-sex marriage - Texas, Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia - have refused to register same-sex spouses at National Guard installations and issue them identification cards, citing a "potential conflict" between state law and the Pentagon policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">They required same-sex spouses to travel to federal military installations to register for benefits.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Not only does this violate the states" obligations under federal law, their actions have created hardship and inequality by forcing couples to travel long distances to federal military bases to obtain the ID cards they're entitled to," Hagel said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said the chief of the National Guard Bureau, Gen. Frank Grass, would meet with the nine National Guard commanders, who will be "expected to comply with both lawful direction and [Defense Department] policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">Hagel "is prepared to take further action should the states not come into compliance," the senior Defense official said, noting that 114 Army and Air National Guard sites are not providing cards to eligible same-sex spouses.</seg>
<seg id="18">Chad Griffin, the head of the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates on behalf of gays and lesbians, said, "Guard members and their families serve this country every day, and it is unacceptable that any state would make it unreasonably difficult for these heroes to access the benefits they are entitled to under federal law."</seg>

<seg id="2">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.</seg>
<seg id="5">South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia's export routes through Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="7">Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."</seg>
<seg id="8">Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year's end.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Second retrial set for Arizona man accused in 1991 â€˜temple murders</seg>
<seg id="2">By David Schwartz</seg>
<seg id="3">PHOENIX (Reuters) - A man accused of killing nine people at a Thai Buddhist temple west of Phoenix over two decades ago will go on trial for the third time next month after a jury deadlocked on whether he was guilty of Arizona's deadliest mass murder.</seg>
<seg id="4">An Arizona judge on Thursday ordered jury selection to begin anew on November 18 in the case of Johnathan Doody, who was accused of killing six monks and three others at the temple in 1991 in execution-style murders that drew international attention.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thailand-born Doody, 39, was convicted in 1994 of killings that became known as the "temple murders."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was granted a new trial after a U.S. appeals court tossed out his conviction in May 2011, saying it was based on a coerced confession.</seg>
<seg id="7">A judge last week declared a mistrial in the month-long retrial that revisited the shootings at the Wat Promkunaram temple in Waddell, Arizona, in which the victims' bodies were found with a shot to the back of the head, arranged face down in a circle.</seg>
<seg id="8">Prosecutors alleged during the second trial that robbery was a motive, with Doody and accomplice Alessandro "Alex" Garcia, then 16-years-old, stealing the victims' cash and property.</seg>
<seg id="9">As he did in the original trial, Garcia testified that Doody masterminded the robbery, ordered that no witnesses be left and fired each fatal shot.</seg>
<seg id="10">Defense attorneys disputed those claims and said there were no corroborating witnesses to place Doody there that day.</seg>
<seg id="11">Garcia is serving 271 years in prison for the murders and an unrelated homicide.</seg>
<seg id="12">Opening statements on the retrial are expected to start on December 4 before Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Joseph Kreamer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Doody is not eligible for the death penalty because he was a juvenile at the time of the slayings.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC News - Polish priest wanted over Dominican child sex-abuse</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 10:46</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutors in Dominican Republic have asked their attorney-general to extradite a Polish Roman Catholic priest on child-abuse charges involving thousands of pornographic images.</seg>
<seg id="4">The priest, Rev Wojciech Gil, is accused of abusing seven children.</seg>
<seg id="5">Authorities say they also found more than 80,000 inappropriate images and videos of children on his computer.</seg>
<seg id="6">In phone calls to reporters in the Dominican Republic, he has denied the accusations, saying he has been framed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The priest was in Poland on holiday when the allegations first surfaced earlier this year and has not returned to the mountain town of Juncalito where he led a parish for eight years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Polish police announced last month they had located the priest but he was not detained, since an Interpol warrant asked only for his location.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now, Santiago prosecutor Luisa Liranzo told a news conference he was being indicted on charges of abusing seven children.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the complaints against the priest alleges he promised children he would take them to the beach and to Europe if they dressed in revealing underwear and appeared in videos and photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another alleges he abused one boy for as long as three years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The case is complicated by the lack of an extradition treaty between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="13">Polish justice officials earlier this month asked their Dominican counterparts to share documents and evidence in the case.</seg>
<seg id="14">They have launched their own investigation into allegations of paedophilia against Rev Gil and another priest, Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, who served as Vatican representative to the Caribbean island before his recall earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The two men may face trial in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this month, Poland's Catholic bishops issued an apology for clergy who have harmed children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Town Council delighted with solid budget</seg>
<seg id="2">Every time discussion in Town Council meetings turns to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has good reason to smile.</seg>
<seg id="3">The municipality coffers in Herdwangen-Schönach are well stocked and the administration has been debt-free since 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this sense, this the 2012 budgetary year, can also be recorded as a complete success.</seg>
<seg id="5">This became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget came in at more than EUR one million higher than originally planned, at around 7.6 million Euro.</seg>
<seg id="7">The administrative budget surplus, at around EUR 1.8 million, also stood at around EUR one million above projections.</seg>
<seg id="8">The surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities' contribution towards income tax.</seg>
<seg id="9">The capital budget also stood well above the projected values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead of the projected EUR 1.5 million Euro, the value for last year was EUR 2.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned, the reserves also came in higher.</seg>
<seg id="13">In total, they managed to increase the general contingency reserves by around EUR 2.1 million, to a total of EUR 4.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and its team for the good work.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A job like this is not something you achieve overnight," said Gerster in praise of the annual financial statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">He and the Town Councillors are clearly delighted with the good figures.</seg>
<seg id="17">It may sound like a paradox, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, according to Gerster, from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are prerequisites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other requirements, the towns and municipalities applying for the subsidies must levy certain municipal rates.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We have to address the subject of municipal rates, as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies," commented Gerster regarding this matter.</seg>

<seg id="6">In spite of a shutdown, they were able to visit the Statue of Liberty on the second day, and climb the statue on foot.</seg>
<seg id="7">They then moved on to the Financial District, via Wall Street, to visit the 9/11 memorial.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the third day, the pupils were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Building, enjoying the views from a height of 373 metres.</seg>
<seg id="9">They then made their way through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets, via the Rockerfeller Center, to Central Park, which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Autumn sun.</seg>
<seg id="10">Following a short flight from New York to Boston, the pupils have now arrived with their host families and are experiencing the school day at Weymouth High School.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ode Heard Round the World</seg>
<seg id="2">With the release last spring of a phenomenally popular iPad app, an exhibition at the Morgan Library & Museum of the original manuscript, and now the documentary "Following the Ninth: In the Footsteps of Beethoven's Final Symphony," the Ninth seems to be having a cultural moment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, that's not quite right: Since its premiere in 1824, it has never truly left the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="4">Beethoven capped his last and greatest symphony with a grand chorale finale, a stirring setting of Schiller's "Ode to Joy."</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the earliest artists to recognize the personal as political in a time of repression, Beethoven was seen as offering a universal prayer - "All men will be brothers" - that was both hopeful prophecy and liberation battle cry.</seg>
<seg id="6">Directed by Kerry Candaele, the film touches only lightly on the Ninth's ethereal qualities, instead examining its potent legacy as anthem: Chilean demonstrators who sang the Ode during the Pinochet dictatorship, a Chinese student organizer who broadcast it at Tiananmen Square, an East Berliner who heard the concert conducted by Leonard Bernstein after the Wall was dismantled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Attention is also paid to Japan's loving devotion to the Ninth, known as Daiku, which is sung in hundreds of concerts around the country every December.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a lot of ground to cover, and adding even a brief discussion of the repression Beethoven saw rising in Europe would have lent invaluable context.</seg>
<seg id="9">But "Following the Ninth" rotates easily among its interviewees" accounts about what the Ninth meant to them.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's thrilling to see footage of a chorus of Chilean protesters singing outside a torture prison and a former inmate recall the inspiration it gave him in a time of despair, how "it was hope" he heard.</seg>
<seg id="11">Newsreel clips from Beijing and Berlin; watching Daiku societies prepare for a rendition of the Ninth after the devastation of the 2011 tsunami - all the film's segments are smartly assembled and gracefully paced.</seg>
<seg id="12">Oh, and the score's pretty good, too.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the Ninth</seg>
<seg id="14">In the Footsteps of Beethoven's Final Symphony</seg>
<seg id="15">Opens on Friday in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Written and directed by Kerry Candaele; directors of photography, Chris Bottoms and Nick Higgins; edited by Alejandro Valdes-Rochin; produced by Mr. Candaele, Ali Eckert and Oliver Herder; released by Area23a and Battle Hymns Productions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What happens with my e-mail when in transit?</seg>
<seg id="2">E-mail is short for electronic mail.</seg>
<seg id="3">Are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspondence, similar to that of the traditional postal service, implemented into the design of this Internet-based service?</seg>
<seg id="4">When designing the early Internet services, the focus lay on making communication possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thus, when developing the underlying technical protocols, no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the interception-proof exchange of mail.</seg>
<seg id="6">For this reason, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.</seg>
<seg id="7">When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the pair's computers then directly connected?</seg>
<seg id="8">Anna's email program or browser first sends the mail to her service provider's mail server.</seg>
<seg id="9">If she has a Gmail account, for example, this would be Google.</seg>
<seg id="10">This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.</seg>
<seg id="11">En route, the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Benni can then call up the content from his provider.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are traditional e-mails read by third parties on their journey through the net?</seg>
<seg id="14">The majority of e-mails are read several times by software robots en route to the recipient.</seg>
<seg id="15">Checks are generally carried out by the sender's provider as to whether the mail contains malware as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="16">A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, the providers check whether it is nuisance or unwanted spam mail, which are deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do the robots have other tasks?</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of systems such as Gmail, the robots also identify the information that Google requires for displaying context-based advertising.</seg>
<seg id="20">If Anna and Benni communicate about their upcoming holiday travels via Gmail, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Do unknown individuals also read the e-mails?</seg>
<seg id="22">The probability of unauthorised persons reading a mail is extremely low.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, theoretically, it is possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">Within companies, administrators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Law enforcement authorities and Secret Services also have legal authorisation to intercept or take note of e-mails.</seg>
<seg id="26">This may include potential illegal spying activities.</seg>
<seg id="27">Is it possible to protect e-mails against being read?</seg>
<seg id="28">With an encryption using the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively protected against being read.</seg>
<seg id="29">With great technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communicating with whom.</seg>
<seg id="30">How important are Yahoo and Google within the e-mail market in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="31">According to a study conducted by Convios Consulting in August 2013, among the main mail services in private use, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="32">While the number of Yahoo Mail accounts has fallen recently, Google's Gmail managed to grow considerably.</seg>

<seg id="1">According to dictionaries, veganism is a sub-category of vegetarianism, yet the two do differ considerably.</seg>
<seg id="2">For while vegetarians allow themselves to consume cream tarts, ice cream or a strong Edam, these indulgences are off the menu for vegans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Milk, cheese, egg - alongside avoiding meat and fish, vegans refrain from eating all products of animal origin - even honey is not permitted.</seg>
<seg id="4">You might ask what is left, however, upon closer inspection the world of vegan nutrition is characterised by great resourcefulness.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Spreads are very popular," explained Ute Henkelmann the owner of the local health food store, which provides a host of special products for vegans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store on "Domgasse".</seg>
<seg id="7">The New Zealander has been vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he can find (almost) everything that he needs to get by. "In 1997 I adjusted my diet and became a vegetarian".</seg>
<seg id="8">At the turn of the millennium I took the next step and became vegan.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, it wasn't just the diet that convinced me, but also my choice of shoes," said Proctor, who prefers artificial leather over normal leather.</seg>
<seg id="10">He realised that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products.</seg>
<seg id="11">First and foremost, being vegan is a matter of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I don't want animals to have to die for me," said Proctor, expressing the maxim of vegans, which applies to all their consumer behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather than missing burgers, scrambled eggs or gummi bears, the vegan has quickly discovered entirely new products that really inspire him.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is a double bonus," says Proctor now, "in actual fact being vegan is not about doing without, it's not about asceticism, but rather it is an enhancement". Regarding the assumption that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options, Proctor puts this down to force of habit.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it is precisely this conditioning that results in many a well-intentioned attempt failing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The temptation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up, similar to with smoking," says Proctor, providing a comparison.</seg>
<seg id="17">And he argues: "Certain flavours are not linked to animal produce".</seg>
<seg id="18">Often it is the herbs or the type of preparation that provide the flavour.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You can, however, create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, when attending a barbecue party, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.</seg>
<seg id="21">He ensures a balanced, varied diet, whereby everything should also have a good hearty flavour.</seg>
<seg id="22">Of course you want to have something with a bit of bite, that is fair enough.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It should be tasty, but this doesn't necessarily mean animal-based food," said Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has not suffered any damage to his health or eating disorders - another wide-spread assumption.</seg>
<seg id="25">Converting has had a positive effect for me.</seg>
<seg id="26">I do not consume any foreign cholesterol and have increased my vitamin intake.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are top athletes who also have an exclusively vegan diet.</seg>
<seg id="28">"My blood values are excellent - I have myself checked on a regular basis," revealed Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many critics of veganism warn in particular of the lack of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Because animals are fed on fodder instead of grazing, it is dubious whether the vitamin B12 content in meat sold in freezers is actually high," commented Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="31">For vegans there is also the option of taking the co-enzyme in the form of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="32">"My B12 values are fine," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="33">Proctor does not have to travel far to buy food.</seg>
<seg id="34">There are basic foodstuffs available everywhere, and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.</seg>
<seg id="35">I can find everything I need locally.</seg>
<seg id="36">I only purchase special items now and again.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Many people overlook the fact that even though ready-made vegan products are expensive, it is well-known that this is also the case for "normal" ready-made products.</seg>
<seg id="38">In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed.</seg>
<seg id="39">"In home cooking, there is much to be discovered - with a few minor tweaks you can achieve good, if not sometimes better results," said Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="40">Margarine in place of butter, a little more baking powder and bicarbonate of soda in place of egg - Proctor has even managed to astonish his in-laws with his vegan cheese cakes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The vegan adds new spice to family parties.</seg>
<seg id="42">When you cook together there is a certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The situations that may arise are as varied as the people themselves," said Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of course he has already met with scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="45">Do you not like my food any more?</seg>
<seg id="46">"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - as a vegan you have to be tactful in such matters.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I do not disapprove of people, I am part of this society," said Proctor, explaining that he was not choosing a life of isolation.</seg>
<seg id="48">And on closer observation, the everyday world does not appear quite so 'un-vegan' - and vegans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed.</seg>
<seg id="49">Fast food is also permitted.</seg>
<seg id="50">Chips are available everywhere!</seg>
<seg id="51">"Many doner kebab houses offer falafel, or even vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="52">In a pizzeria he avoids pasta dishes or just orders a pizza without cheese, all just a question of habit.</seg>
<seg id="53">Restaurants are slowly adapting to things.</seg>
<seg id="54">"When I began eating a vegan diet 13 years ago, things were even more difficult," says the New Zealander, and he points out: "You have to talk with people, make them aware".</seg>
<seg id="55">"If enough requests are made, they will perhaps be inclined to expand their menus," he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="56">There are vegan restaurants opening up, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or Cafï¿½ Vogelfrei.</seg>
<seg id="57">Proctor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="58">Essentially, vegan dishes are for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="59">Anyone can eat them, they are the exact opposite of exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, as they rule others out," assessed Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="61">"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to rule out the majority of scandals from the outset," says Proctor.</seg>
<seg id="62">However, purchasing vegan products can be difficult to start with.</seg>
<seg id="63">OInce you come to understand that peanuts, in particular, may also contain animal additives as a colourant, people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics with so many hurdles and pitfalls.</seg>
<seg id="64">Therefore, for this reason and others, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book. "Veganissimo - Tierische Inhaltsstoffe und ihre Alternativen" (Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives) explains the many ingredients hidden in both foodstuffs and cleaning agents.</seg>
<seg id="65">"You gradually develop an internal scanner and you know which symbols and logos you have to look out for". Proctor has learned that "it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or stumble".</seg>
<seg id="66">Veganism is an important moral compass, which has an effect on your consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="67">Perhaps he won't manage to help you break old habits altogether, but at least he manages to teach consumers to critically question their habits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Watch as Woman Goes From Average to Fabulous in 37 Seconds</seg>
<seg id="2">It happened in 37 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a brief time-lapse video, a woman goes from average to stunning, all with the help of makeup and heavy photo editing to alter her perceived flaws.</seg>
<seg id="4">Upworthy.com contributor Laura Willard shared the video on her blog on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">She wanted to show how dramatically a model's image could be changed and said she's using the short clip to remind her daughter that the bodies shown in magazines may not start out so perfect.</seg>
<seg id="6">Should Retouched Images Carry Warning Labels?</seg>
<seg id="7">"Even when I was, by society standards, thin and in really good shape and healthy, it was never good enough for me," Willard told ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="8">I want my daughter to see this video and I want her to see more like it because it makes it apparent how unrealistic this really is.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video, titled "The power of Adobe Photoshop," shows a near-naked woman posing for a photo shoot.</seg>
<seg id="10">And then her image is digitally edited - to make her stomach flatter, her eyes bigger and her arms, legs and neck longer and slimmer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her lips, nose and face all get the magic touch of the digital airbrush.</seg>
<seg id="12">Heavy makeup is added.</seg>
<seg id="13">Her hair is fuller, and her skin is polished and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="14">And at the end of the clip, the woman is transformed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That's not how people look," Willard said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's not real.</seg>
<seg id="17">Global Democracy first posted the video online in 2012 in a bid to get disclaimers on airbrushed ads, but since Willard reposted it, it has racked up almost four million views as of Wednesday night.</seg>

<seg id="2">Brendan Rea with his dairy cows at his Allansford farm.</seg>
<seg id="3">SOME rhythms never change.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brendan Rea isn't a morning person, yet he rises at 4.15am every day to milk the cows.</seg>
<seg id="5">As his father once did.</seg>
<seg id="6">And his father before him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The milk heads down the hill to the Warrnambool Cheese and Butter Factory, as it always has from the Rea properties since James Rea - Brendan's great grandfather - helped found the business in 1888.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yet some cliches, framed from sepia images of mud and milk pails, faded long ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Brendan Rea monitors his cows with computers, more carefully than a helicopter parent supervises a child.</seg>
<seg id="10">He bristles at city tags of dairy farmers as dozy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Forget gumboots and pre-dawns.</seg>
<seg id="12">He'd rather talk lactoferrin or "whey protein concentrate."</seg>
<seg id="13">Rea went to university and runs a multi-million dollar business - today, he lands in Brazil for a conference.</seg>
<seg id="14">Like everyone else, it seems, from the surrounding low-lying paddocks to newsrooms here and overseas, Rea is abuzz about the future of "his" company.</seg>
<seg id="15">The scenarios shift almost as often as his cows visit the dairy.</seg>
<seg id="16">No one knows what will happen or when, including WCB itself.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I wish I knew," chief executive David Lord said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="18">I think there might be a little bit more to play out yet.</seg>
<seg id="19">Will it be settled by Christmas?</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope so," Lord ventured.</seg>
<seg id="21">Dairy farmers doing it tough?</seg>
<seg id="22">Think instead of "instant millionaires."</seg>
<seg id="23">That's the talk, anyway, of locals who last week sat on shares valued at up to 37 times what they paid for them in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="24">For many, whose families have held a stake in the former WCB co-op for generations, the decision to sell a stake in the now public-listed company had never been a consideration - until now.</seg>
<seg id="25">Threads of gossip have turned to the older gentleman, unhitched and well-known, who has been roughly valued at $25m.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are whispers about spikes of jealousy from those who own fewer shares than their peers.</seg>
<seg id="27">And there is widespread sympathy.</seg>
<seg id="28">Recent times have been tough.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps two dozen or more dairy farmers have been forced to sell in the district.</seg>
<seg id="30">If there are untold spoils in takeover uncertainty, they are to be selectively taken.</seg>
<seg id="31">Wim Kampschoer at his dairy farm.</seg>
<seg id="32">Warrnambool stockbroker John Hutson, of RBS Morgans, tells of an "emotional ride" for clients.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many of them sat tight when the WCB share price passed $9 last Tuesday, then gave Hutson instructions to sell at that same price after the shares closed below $9 that same day.</seg>
<seg id="34">New millionaires may exist, Hutson believes, but mostly on paper.</seg>
<seg id="35">International forces have driven the swirl.</seg>
<seg id="36">They have descended from Japan and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="37">Lino Saputo is the chief executive of Canada's biggest dairy company, Saputo, which wants control of WCB.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lino Saputo Jr has hosted a travelling roadshow of southwest Victorian towns this week.</seg>
<seg id="39">Like a politician on the hustings, he appears to have cut through.</seg>
<seg id="40">He has spoken of "family values" and breakthrough expansions into Asian markets.</seg>
<seg id="41">Saputo has eyed off WCB for a decade.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has obstacles to overcome, including the Foreign Investment Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="43">The WCB board supports Saputo's takeover bids.</seg>
<seg id="44">That many locals believe Saputo can best preserve local heritages hints of many wrinkled ironies.</seg>
<seg id="45">The moorings on a 125-year WCB history began to loosen on September 12, when rival dairy Bega made a takeover bid for WCB.</seg>
<seg id="46">This bid valued each WCB share at $5.78.</seg>
<seg id="47">Saputo followed with a $7 bid.</seg>
<seg id="48">Murray Goulburn, a co-operative, offered $7.50 a share.</seg>
<seg id="49">Saputo offered $8 a share.</seg>
<seg id="50">A few days later, Lion, a Japanese company, bought 10 per cent of WCB, pushing the share price past $9.</seg>
<seg id="51">This appeared to muddle Saputo's bid for WCB.</seg>
<seg id="52">New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra's buying up to 10 per cent of Bega further confused matters.</seg>
<seg id="53">Rea summed up a wider view - there are pros and cons in every scenario.</seg>
<seg id="54">Bega is seen to be too small, for example, and Murray Goulburn too stretched.</seg>
<seg id="55">Everyone recognises the need to push into China.</seg>
<seg id="56">One farmer on a visit there was told protein is an obsession there - the belief is that milk makes you taller.</seg>
<seg id="57">In Rea's case, there's the question of 200,000 family shares (which closed yesterday at $8.26).</seg>
<seg id="58">"The outcome I want to see is what is in the best interests of the industry," he says.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nick Renyard at his farm.</seg>
<seg id="60">Dairy farmer Nick Renyard, of Timboon, has owned WCB shares since he was five.</seg>
<seg id="61">Family chats in recent days, he says, have touched on selling.</seg>
<seg id="62">Wim and Chris Kampschoer, of Cooriemungle, were forced to have a similar chat some months back.</seg>
<seg id="63">No matter the future of WCB, Kampschoer expects to be milking cows until he is 80.</seg>
<seg id="64">Around here, after all, some rhythms never change.</seg>

<seg id="5">Clark was rested for most of the final quarter of the Demons' big win against GWS last weekend - his troublesome right foot packed in ice.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were fears he may have reinjured a bone in his foot - an injury which cost him half a season in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">But coach Mark Neeld said scans this week showed only a minor problem, and no recurrence of the bone issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The majority of it is really good news," Neeld said today.</seg>
<seg id="9">He's got a mid-foot sprain and he's rolled the ankle - all in that one area.</seg>
<seg id="10">""He's not going to play this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">It will be a week-by-week thing.""</seg>
<seg id="12">Clark won't be risked in the Gabba clash on Sunday, with the Lions also hampered with the loss of key midfielder Daniel Rich for two months with a broken shoulder blade.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Demons eased some of the pressure on themselves with a club record 12-goal final quarter to put away GWS last weekend and post their first victory of a tumultuous season.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Neeld played down any outside pressure to back up the GWS performance with victory against another struggling club in the Lions.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said it was more about improving weaknesses and building on strengths for a club in a rebuilding phase.</seg>
<seg id="16">""When you're restarting a footy club and rebuilding a list, it's not done that way," Neeld said."</seg>
<seg id="17">See all the Round 5 teams as they drop from 6pm at SuperFooty</seg>
<seg id="18">""It's about 'this is what we did well', and we work to continue those strengths.</seg>
<seg id="19">And 'these are the areas we continue to need to improve', so we'll go and do that.</seg>
<seg id="20">""Clubs in our position, you don't say: 'We won this week and it's really important to back it up this week'.</seg>
<seg id="21">We see things a whole different way.</seg>

<seg id="1">Problem of gender differences on physics assessments remains unsolved</seg>
<seg id="2">1, 2013 - In a new synthesis of past work, researchers found that women consistently score lower than men on common assessments of conceptual understanding of physics.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, when examining the factors that may account for these differences (such as student background and test-taking strategies), no clear pattern emerged.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, despite previous claims that the causes of this gender gap have been pinpointed, the problem remains unsolved and poorly understood.</seg>
<seg id="5">This has critical importance for science education reform.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many changes have been made in college science instruction in the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="7">Numerous classrooms have shifted from a traditional lecture presentation to more interactive formats that aim to engage students in building their own knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="8">Physics has been a forerunner of this movement, in part because of early and ongoing research on how students grapple with key ideas in this difficult field.</seg>
<seg id="9">Comparisons of student understanding have been made possible through the development of "concept inventories" -- multiple choice tests of student understanding, developed through years of research, enabling the same test to be given to students in a variety of classrooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">"These tests have been very important in the history of physics education reform," said Dr. McKagan, who co-authored the new analysis.</seg>
<seg id="11">Past studies have shown that students in classrooms using interactive techniques get significantly higher scores on these tests than do students in more traditional lecture settings; "these results have inspired a lot of people to change the way that they teach," said McKagan.</seg>
<seg id="12">But several studies had also reported that women's scores on these tests are typically lower than men's.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We set out to determine whether there is a gender gap on these concept inventories," said lead author Madsen, "and if so, what causes it."</seg>
<seg id="14">The authors combined results from 26 previous studies of several common physics concept inventories, covering 12 different institutions.</seg>
<seg id="15">They found that women almost always score lower than men on these tests (12% on average for tests about force and motion), both before instruction, and at the end of the course.</seg>
<seg id="16">The same trend is also found when comparing male and female students' gains on the tests, showing that this gap is not simply due to differing levels of incoming knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is some variation across studies -- the gender gap sometimes goes up and sometimes goes down, but rarely goes away, observe the authors.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women also receive lower scores on course exams (4% on average) than do men, which can impact course grades.</seg>
<seg id="19">These results mirror those in other studies of gender differences on other types of science and math tests, such as standardized placement exams.</seg>
<seg id="20">One key finding from the study is that, while there is a gender gap in performance on concept inventories, the performance of both men and women is improved when they experience an interactive classroom.</seg>
<seg id="21">These teaching techniques improve student gains on these tests by four times as much as the size of the gap between men's and women's scores.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, previous results on the positive impact of interactive teaching techniques are still valid for both men and women.</seg>
<seg id="23">Another important result of the authors' analysis is that no obvious factor appears to be responsible for women's lower scores.</seg>
<seg id="24">Unlike the impact of interactive engagement on student performance, "we haven't found a miracle that solves the gender gap," said McKagan.</seg>
<seg id="25">The authors cross-checked the results from studies investigating the potential impact of student background, their beliefs about physics, the teaching method used, their ingrained stereotypes about women's abilities, and the wording of test questions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some studies -- several of which were quite high-profile -- demonstrated that one or more of these elements had a significant influence, but most were contradicted in other studies.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of the more promising findings is that women's poorer background preparation in physics may account for much of the gender gap, but those results have not been replicated outside of a single university and may be reflective of several underlying causes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Such contradictory results suggest that gender differences in physics performance are a particularly thorny and complex issue.</seg>
<seg id="29">When a single study claims to have found a solution to gender differences in science, it should be treated with healthy skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="30">Research on female performance in math and science more broadly have also met with contradictory results, though social factors -- such as stereotypes -- appear to contribute powerfully to gender gaps.</seg>
<seg id="31">While the gender gap on physics concept inventories remains an unsolved problem, the researchers suggest some take-home messages for instructors.</seg>
<seg id="32">One is that the use of interactive teaching techniques can improve student understanding for both genders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Another is simply to recognize that there is a gender gap on conceptual assessments and exams, and that addressing this gap will require creativity on the part of the instructor.</seg>
<seg id="34">Prior work suggests some strategies that an instructor may take (such as having students reflect on their values prior to a test), but it is important not to rely too heavily on any one technique.</seg>
<seg id="35">The authors call for researchers to devote additional attention to investigating the underlying causes of this gender gap and possible interventions.</seg>

<seg id="1">How your dog's wagging tail can reveal its emotions</seg>
<seg id="2">If they are experiencing negative emotions, such as feeling threatened, then their tail will move slightly more to the left.</seg>
<seg id="3">While the subtle bias in movement can be difficult for humans to detect, when video footage of the behaviour is slowed down it becomes more obvious.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dogs, however, seem to be able to pick up on these signals.</seg>
<seg id="5">The researchers found that dogs heart rates increased and they showed signs of anxiety when they saw a strange dog with its tail wagging slightly to the left.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the dog met a strange dog whose tail wagged slightly to the right, then the animals remained calm and showed a relaxed heart rate.</seg>
<seg id="7">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, who led the research at the Centre for Brain Sciences at the University of Trento, said: "We know from neurological studies in humans that the left and right hemispheres in the brain produce different emotional responses."</seg>
<seg id="8">In dogs, single organs like the tongue or tail is controlled by both sides of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="9">There can be competition and dominance between these two sides.</seg>
<seg id="10">When they move their tail, it is more bias to the left or to the right depending on which side of the brain is more dominant at the time.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seems dogs pick up on this when they meet other dogs and it forms a type of communication between them.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the dogs taking part in the study watches a dog on a screen wag its tail to the left (University of Trento)</seg>
<seg id="13">Previously researchers have shown that dogs can convey their emotions through their facial expressions.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, little research has been done to examine whether they may also be reflected in the way they wag their tails.</seg>
<seg id="15">Professor Vallortigara and his colleagues showed 43 dogs video footage of another dog wagging its tail or sitting still.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also used a silhouette of a dog to remove any other physical signals.</seg>
<seg id="17">A graphic showing the experimental set up used to assess how dogs reacted to tail wagging in a video of another animal (University of Trento)</seg>
<seg id="18">They measured the animals" heart rates and monitored their physical responses to look for signs of how they were feeling.</seg>
<seg id="19">When the video showed the dog's tail wagging slightly more to the right, the animals watching remained relaxed, with their ears hanging down, lips loose and eyes slowly blinking.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the dog's tail wagged to the left, however, the animals" heart rate increased and their hair stood on end, they looked away, lifted their paws and showed other signs of stress.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Professor Vallortigara does not think that the animals are consciously communicating their emotions, but rather that it is a consequence of the way their brains are wired up.</seg>
<seg id="22">He said: "I think there is some sort of communication, but I don't think it is in anyway intentional."</seg>
<seg id="23">We don't know exactly if the receiver is consciously picking up the signal, but I think it is more likely not to be.</seg>
<seg id="24">Instead it is likely to be because the movement is activating either the right or left hemisphere of the brain by attracting their attention to the left or right side of their vision.</seg>

<seg id="8">Two-thirds of women admit trying to transform their boyfriend's appearance, a study reveals.</seg>
<seg id="9">They buy £500 worth of clothes and spend more than six months buffing and grooming their man - often to make him look more like their favourite celebrity.</seg>
<seg id="10">Two thirds of women admitted to changing the way their partner looked, with some saying they were embarrassed and ashamed to be seen in public with their boyfriend when they first began dating - was this the case for Victoria and David Beckham? (pictured, left, in 1998 and, right, in 2012)</seg>
<seg id="11">More than a third (36 per cent) admit they were "embarrassed and ashamed" to be seen in public with their boyfriend at the start of their relationship.</seg>
<seg id="12">They were worried about his choice of clothes (34 per cent), hair style (22 per cent) and even smell (9 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="13">Some 68 per cent admit they "improved" their partner's appearance, with 48 per cent buying his clothes.</seg>

<seg id="30">She said: "When I first met my partner I was attracted to his lively personality and great sense of humour."</seg>
<seg id="31">His hair looked a mess and his clothes had seen better days but I knew they were things that could easily be put right.</seg>

<seg id="4">One major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called EEC Levy from 5.277 to 6.3 Cents per kilowatt hour.</seg>
<seg id="5">This levy will be reset by the four operators of the large power grids, in October of each year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Derby winner must beat pain barrier</seg>
<seg id="2">Tough test: Fiveandahalfstar wins the 2012 Victoria Derby.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Victoria Derby is a true classic race and a genuine test of the young thoroughbred.</seg>
<seg id="4">The race, run over 2500 metres, is testing because, to be competitive, the horse needs to have a blend of sprinting and staying abilities, skeletal maturity, a relaxed racing attitude, and the ability to cope with pain and perform, which is not always a characteristic of young horses.</seg>
<seg id="5">A three-year-old racehorse is still a juvenile and relatively immature.</seg>
<seg id="6">The average horse's life span is somewhere between 25-30 years and throughout that life span there are many developmental changes as the horse grows and matures.</seg>
<seg id="7">A simple analogy would be to say a three-year-old racehorse has the skeletal maturity of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bone is a very dynamic tissue and it responds and adapts to the stress put upon it.</seg>
<seg id="9">When a two-year-old horse begins training the skeleton adapts, with bones getting stronger in response to training so that the horse can withstand the tremendous forces associated with galloping.</seg>
<seg id="10">Frequently this bone adaptation is associated with "shin soreness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Shin soreness is simply the cannon bone adapting to training.</seg>
<seg id="12">This occurs in every horse and, from time-to-time, it causes lameness.</seg>
<seg id="13">A horse still experiences further growth and maturity of the bones up to and past the age of seven.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore the bones of these young horses are not fully developed and this is seen clinically by the incidence of fetlock and knee chips, almost exclusively in young horses.</seg>
<seg id="15">Often at this time of the year, if there has been little rain, hard tracks can contribute to the incidence and frequency of bone soreness and bone problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">The concussive forces associated with galloping are passed up the leg and are absorbed by the bones, tendons and joints of the lower limb.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the young horse is not able to cope with these forces then soreness, lameness and bone chips are the likely result.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thus the training and racing required to gain entry into the Victoria Derby has acted as a natural selection process akin to Darwinian Theory - only the strong survive.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is not to say that concussion-related problems are only the domain of young horses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Already this spring, hard tracks, joint and foot problems have been associated with Puissance De Lune and It's A Dundeel.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even on Moonee Valley's renowned soft track, both horses were disappointing in last Saturday's Cox Plate with questions arising about Puissance De Lune's racing future.</seg>
<seg id="22">A horse racing over 2500 metres is probably similar to a human racing over 1500 metres.</seg>
<seg id="23">This means that these horse athletes need to perform both anaerobically and aerobically.</seg>
<seg id="24">The anaerobic component is short and allows the horse to sprint from the barriers to get a good position in the field.</seg>
<seg id="25">Aerobic performance relates to an athlete's ability to absorb oxygen during the event and convert that oxygen into muscle energy.</seg>
<seg id="26">When aerobic performance fails, this leads to the build-up of lactate in the muscles, which leads to fatigue and diminished performance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the athlete with the better aerobic function can perform faster for longer.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many factors influence aerobic function or capacity - such as training, fitness, blood counts, muscle function - but two factors are critical, upper airway function and cardiopulmonary function.</seg>
<seg id="29">Horses can only breathe through their nose with this air passing through a narrow throat - larynx and pharynx and then down to the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="30">This means that good function in the throat is vital to an efficient airway and thus to aerobic function.</seg>
<seg id="31">Indeed, the throat is an area where horses have a lot of problems, such as roarers (a paralysed larynx), soft-palate displacement and pharyngitis.</seg>
<seg id="32">Without discussing the technical aspects of these problems, they all limit or reduce the amount of air getting to the lungs and clearly have a huge impact on aerobic function.</seg>
<seg id="33">Once the air reaches the lungs it needs to be delivered around the body to the muscles very efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this area a horse needs a good blood count and needs the heart to be an efficient pump.</seg>
<seg id="35">Any problem, albeit a minor one to any of these systems, will ensure that the horse will not run the 2500 metres.</seg>
<seg id="36">Oxygen is carried in the red blood cells, and we have seen that this can be improved by a number of factors.</seg>
<seg id="37">The illegal use of EPO as a doping agent is specifically aimed at increasing the red cell count.</seg>
<seg id="38">Similarly, altitude training causes the body to naturally produce more red blood cells to help the body cope and adapt to the lower oxygen in air altitude.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was stated in the media this week that last week's Cox Plate winner Shamus Award had been in a specifically designed and very expensive stable to mimic this high altitude.</seg>
<seg id="40">It will be interesting to see how the authorities act to such developments as our industry has always loved the charisma of the battler competing and beating the "big boys."</seg>
<seg id="41">In Saturday's Derby, the $4000 purchase Polanski, trained by Robbie Laing, will be the sentimental favourite for that reason.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the horse's own endeavour and its ability to cope with pain is a factor.</seg>
<seg id="43">The great and successful racehorses all have this feature - they want to win and they seem to be able to compete with injuries and ailments that would normally make a horse uncompetitive.</seg>
<seg id="44">Pain will be a factor on Saturday, simply because we have young horses racing over a long distance.</seg>
<seg id="45">Perhaps all these factors mean that the winner of this classic race should be assured of a stud career because winning reflects superiority in so many areas.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, this is not always the case, which might explain the dominance of foreign horses in our best endurance race, the Melbourne Cup.</seg>
<seg id="47">Australian racing has a thirst for the quick riches and results that two-year-old racing offers, meaning that stallions and bloodlines producing precocious horses do well.</seg>
<seg id="48">Indeed, the Chris Waller-trained Zoustar, racing in Saturday's Coolmore Stud Stakes over 1200 metres, is hailed as the next superstar with a future stud career and a $20 million price tag.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Way of Life, and Its Slow Death</seg>
<seg id="2">The Tuareg are good people, Robyn Symon's billowy but deadly serious documentary "Behind the Blue Veil" tells us early on.</seg>
<seg id="3">Theirs is a matriarchal society (unusual for Muslims), monogamous and family-oriented.</seg>
<seg id="4">They cherish the desert, because they feel fully alive there.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is their culture.</seg>
<seg id="6">And they are being forced into extinction.</seg>
<seg id="7">"When one wants to eliminate you," a young man observes, "he will not take care of you."</seg>
<seg id="8">Ms. Symon's film illustrates bluntly the Tuareg people's unmet needs for education and medical care in Mali, one of five countries into which they have been divided; the scarcity of water; and the fading away of their livelihood, the trans-Saharan caravan trade.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then there are what reporters refer to as "the northern Mali rebels," who want their own state, wielding automatic weapons.</seg>
<seg id="10">But they are Tuareg, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Perhaps this is not surprising, considering that they have been the victims of massacres and that their land has been stolen by the government, corrupted by the international drug trade and infiltrated by Al Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="12">The filmmakers focus on an 11-year-old boy who goes to school in nearby Timbuktu and plans to become a doctor and help his people.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even in his story, obstacles seem to outweigh hope.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first half of "Behind the Blue Veil" makes a case for the noble cause of preserving a way of life; the second half admits its near-futility.</seg>
<seg id="15">When a Tuareg man pleads for his people's ancient culture to be saved, a couple of sympathetic but practical Europeans tell him, in essence: Get in line.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tinder couple take their romance offline</seg>
<seg id="2">Sydney musician Saraya Beric and Brisbane pilot Peter Williams are a Tinder success story.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Supplied.</seg>
<seg id="4">WHOEVER said Tinder was merely a meat market was mistaken and this loved-up couple is proof.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sydney musician Saraya Beric and Brisbane pilot Peter Williams are up and away after meeting through the social networking app last month.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tinder is a location-based dating app which highlights fellow singles in your area.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 30 billion profile ratings and 300 million matches have been made through the app, which has been around for just over a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Saraya, a violinist and performer, says it was love at first swipe for the high-flying couple.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was surprised to meet someone.</seg>
<seg id="10">It started off as a bit of a joke when I was bored.</seg>
<seg id="11">I was in Brisbane hanging out with friends when they grabbed my phone and downloaded the app.</seg>
<seg id="12">We were at a bar and having a few wines so we just started going through everyone.</seg>
<seg id="13">I'm pretty picky and said 'no' to the majority," she said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I said yes to Peter because he looked nice and a few days later he matched back.</seg>
<seg id="15">One of his photos was pretty funny so I said something about it and we just got chatting.</seg>
<seg id="16">We had really good conversation and the same ideas about things so there was common ground there.</seg>
<seg id="17">Get aquainted with Tinder, the dating app of choice for Aussie singles.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 29-year-old - who has works with artists including The McClymonts, Goldfrapp, M-Phazes, 360, Boy & Bear, Illy and Josh Groban - said they took their romance offline and went on a date a week later.</seg>
<seg id="19">When he picked me up I thought he was cute.</seg>
<seg id="20">I was a little bit relieved that he actually turned out to look like his photos," she said.</seg>
<seg id="21">I thought I'd meet up with him for a few hours but we went to a bar and just chatted nonstop.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then we went to a restaurant at Southbank ... it ended up being a seven-hour date.</seg>
<seg id="23">He didn't even kiss me goodnight.</seg>
<seg id="24">I was a little bit disappointed but thought 'OK treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen'.</seg>
<seg id="25">Despite living in separate states, they've since caught up five times, including a date at Sea World.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sydney violinist Saraya Beric performing.</seg>

<seg id="28">He's met my mum and I've met his.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's really fast moving.</seg>
<seg id="30">From our first date and the conversations we've had we both know we want the same things.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are no games.</seg>
<seg id="32">We both want to have a family one day," Saraya said.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's nice to meet someone who knows and cares a lot about family.</seg>
<seg id="34">I don't want kids right now but I want them in the future so it's good to know he does too.</seg>
<seg id="35">We've talked about marriage but just jokingly.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's really funny because we've only been dating a month.</seg>
<seg id="37">He makes me laugh.</seg>
<seg id="38">Peter, who's been single for about three years, said he had just joined Tinder to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Because I do contract flying I wasn't getting any opportunities to meet anyone, even friends, socially," he said.</seg>
<seg id="40">I actually wasn't looking for a relationship.</seg>
<seg id="41">To be honest I wasn't expecting to meet anyone let alone go on a date and actually like someone.</seg>
<seg id="42">When I met Saraya, without sounding too mushy, we just clicked and I guess you can't choose the time when something starts to work.</seg>
<seg id="43">The 34-year-old, who previously worked in emergency services, said he was initially impressed by Saraya's profile.</seg>
<seg id="44">She had posted a long list of criteria - including honesty, loyalty and cheekiness - to be met by any potential match.</seg>
<seg id="45">It brought a big smile to my face and certainly made her stand out from the rest.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though I wasn't looking for a relationship, when I saw that, I read the list and thought 'challenge accepted'," he said.</seg>
<seg id="47">I think the first thing that hit me was our sense of humour.</seg>
<seg id="48">We have uncanny sense of humour, both quite warped, so that was probably the big thing.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think Tinder's been getting a bit of a negative rap and in my case it's been absolutely nothing like that.</seg>
<seg id="50">I've made some friends off it and met an amazing person in Saraya, and I hope our relationship will grow further.</seg>
<seg id="51">It's moved quickly but we're both quite grounded.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's going well at the moment and we both hope it keeps going.</seg>
<seg id="53">Who knows what the future holds but we're certainly both giving it the space to grow.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria Peace Envoy Renews Call for Talks</seg>
<seg id="2">The U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria ended a days-long visit to Damascus on Friday, calling on both the government and the opposition to attend a peace conference in Geneva later this month but acknowledging the gathering cannot take place if the opposition refuses to take part.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lakhdar Brahimi, who had traveled to Damascus at the end of a Mideast tour to muster regional support for the conference, appeared uncertain about prospects for the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will say it's happened only when it happens," he told reporters at a press conference in Damascus, urging both sides to cooperate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Brahimi's plea came just hours after officials said Israeli warplanes had attacked a shipment of Russian missiles inside a Syrian government stronghold - a development that threatened to add another volatile layer to regional tensions from the Syrian civil war.</seg>
<seg id="6">An Obama administration official confirmed the Israeli airstrike late Thursday, but provided no details.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another security official said the attack occurred late Wednesday in the Syrian port city of Latakia and that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the attack.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no confirmation from Syrian officials, and state media made no mention of the reports.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since the civil war in Syria began in March 2011, Israel has carefully avoided taking sides, but has struck shipments of missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Syrian military, overstretched by the civil war, has not retaliated, and it was not clear whether the embattled Syrian leader would choose to take action this time.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assad may decide to again let the Israeli attack slide, particularly when his army has the upper hand on the battlefield inside Syria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The U.S. and Russia are pushing for a peace conference bringing both sides of the Syrian civil war to the table in Geneva later this month.</seg>
<seg id="14">More than 120,000 people have been killed in the nearly three-year-old conflict, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based watchdog that closely monitors the violence in Syria through a network of activists across the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">The U.N. said in July that 100,000 Syrians have been killed, and has not updated that figure since.</seg>
<seg id="16">Millions of Syrians have been uprooted from their homes because of the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="17">Brahimi warned that if the crisis goes on, expectations are that those directly affected by the crisis may reach half of Syria's total pre-war population of 23 million people.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It is time for Syrians to cooperate and for others in the region and outside to cooperate with them to end this crisis," Brahimi said.</seg>
<seg id="19">The envoy, who met this week with Syrian President Bashar Assad and Damascus-based opposition groups, said the Syrian government has confirmed it would attend.</seg>
<seg id="20">Deeply fractured Syrian opposition groups are also split on whether to attend the Geneva talks.</seg>
<seg id="21">They also disagree over conditions for taking part - from demands that Assad step down right away to guarantees that he would not be part of a negotiated solution for the country's future</seg>
<seg id="22">This time, Brahimi appeared to put the onus on the opposition, saying talks in Geneva cannot "go forward without the opposition."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The participation of the opposition is essential, necessary and important," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Secret Service whistleblower, Edward Snowden is, in principle, willing to hold a discussion with the German authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, he first wishes for his situation to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was made clear by the former NSA employee, currently sought by the USA, in an open letter that Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele made public on Friday following a meeting with Snowden, and passed on to the Federal Government, the Federal Parliament and the Federal Public Prosecutor General.</seg>
<seg id="4">The letter was purported to have been worded as follows:</seg>
<seg id="5">To whom it may concern,</seg>
<seg id="6">I have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am Edward Joseph Snowden, formerly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the United States National Security Agency, and Defense Intelligence Agency.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the course of my service to these organizations, I believe I witnessed systemic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a result of reporting these concerns, I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution that forced me from my family and home.</seg>
<seg id="10">I am currently living in exile under a grant of temporary asylum in the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am heartened by the response to my act of political expression, in both the United States and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="12">Citizens around the world as well as high officials ï¿½ including in the United States ï¿½ have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
<seg id="13">These spying revelations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust.</seg>
<seg id="14">The benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mitigated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalize political speech with felony charges that provide no defence.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="17">I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of facts regarding reports in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law.</seg>
<seg id="19">I look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved, and thank you for your efforts in upholding the international laws that protect us all.</seg>

<seg id="1">Japan yakuza and banks: Mobster connections?</seg>
<seg id="2">By Kevin Voigt and Junko Ogura, CNN</seg>
<seg id="3">November 1, 2013 -- Updated 0803 GMT (1603 HKT)</seg>
<seg id="4">Three of Japan's largest banks are under scrutiny for making loans to underworld groups</seg>
<seg id="5">Mizuho has punished 54 executives loans to people affiliated with the yakuza, the Japanese mafia</seg>
<seg id="6">Expert: "Yakuza have been tremendously successful because they can work out in the open"</seg>
<seg id="7">Tokyo (CNN) -- As Japanese authorities widen their investigation into ties between financial institutions and organized crime, an investigative reporter says the current allegations have left with a sense of "déjà vu."</seg>
<seg id="8">"In 2004, Citibank (Japan) lost their private banking license because they were allowing yakuza to do many complex transactions," Jake Adelstein, author of "Tokyo Vice" and an expert on Japan's mafia -- known as the yakuza -- told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="9">They got spanked in 2009 for failing to update their databases and allowing yakuza to do business with them again.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country's financial regulator, will send inspectors to Japan's three largest banks -- Mizuho Bank, Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Bank -- to "review over their corporate governance, legal compliance and overall risk management," said Hiroki Kato, director of the Inspection Bureau of the FSA.</seg>
<seg id="11">The on-site inspections are scheduled to begin next week.</seg>
<seg id="12">All three banks declined to comment on the review when contacted by CNN.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ties to gangs</seg>
<seg id="14">Mizuho has already come under scrutiny after 54 executives, including the bank's president, were punished after it was revealed an affiliate made more than $2 million in loans to people with ties to organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mizuho Financial Group chief executive Yasuhiro Sato apologizing for loans to gangsters in Tokyo on October 28.</seg>
<seg id="16">Yakuza is the name given to Japan's organized crime syndicates.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adelstein -- the only American who has worked a crime beat for the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper -- has called them "Goldman Sachs with guns" because of the financial prowess and sometimes brutal means.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The yakuza have been tremendously successful because they can work out in the open," Adelstein told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have business cards, they have office buildings.</seg>
<seg id="20">People know who they are -- they have fan magazines and they have a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="21">Strict code</seg>
<seg id="22">Members are said to follow a strict code of discipline -- and often sport full body tattoos.</seg>
<seg id="23">The biggest and wealthiest yakuza gang -- the Yamaguchi-gumi -- is said to number nearly 40,000 members.</seg>
<seg id="24">Robert Feldman of Morgan Stanley Japan once called the Yamaguichi-gumi "Japan's largest private equity group."</seg>
<seg id="25">Belonging to a yakuza gang itself is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="26">But members are known to engage in drugs, prostitution and gambling.</seg>
<seg id="27">After recent crackdowns by Japanese authorities, yakuza are making more strides into white-collar crime, experts say.</seg>

<seg id="1">China plea paper 'to be overhauled'</seg>
<seg id="2">A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the New Express is to undergo "full rectification," the regulator said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "rectification" order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.</seg>
<seg id="7">A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="8">"New Express's editorial management was disordered," the regulator said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license."</seg>
<seg id="10">It had also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.</seg>
<seg id="12">After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.</seg>
<seg id="15">I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've realised my wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pupils to get religious guidance despite protests</seg>
<seg id="2">Church ministers will continue to address pupils in school, after a call for religious observance to be scrapped was rejected by the Scottish Government.</seg>
<seg id="3">The sessions, usually during school assemblies, still have a "clear value," ministers said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Parents can already opt out if they do not want their children to take part in the activity, also known as "time for reflection."</seg>
<seg id="5">The National Secular Society lodged a petition at Holyrood calling for a change that would have resulted in parents having to opt in, with the presumption being that they did not want their children to take part.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Rev Sandy Fraser, convener of the Church of Scotland's education committee, welcomed the government's decision and said there were "misconceptions" about the modern form of religious observance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Chaplains are only ever there if the school invites them in," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">They are not trying to convert children.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are essentially raising awareness of spirituality, of otherness, a sense of something other than materialism.</seg>
<seg id="10">Religious observance or time for reflection in 2013 is a wide-ranging and inclusive experience led by professionals who understand the diversity of 21st-century Scotland and see that diversity as strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Scottish Government said the current system was "relevant and up to date" and that ministers were "not persuaded, based on the evidence given, that a move to an opt-in system would be helpful to young learners."</seg>
<seg id="12">In a submission to Holyrood's petitions committee, the government said: "[Religious observance] can offer opportunities for young people to reflect meaningfully on different points of view and values, including their own."</seg>
<seg id="13">"It creates chances to think about the nature and possible meaning of life and humans" place in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">It can promote critical thinking, supporting the development of awareness that not all people think the same or share the same ideas and experiences about life.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the National Secular Society said the current opt-out presumed a "uniformity of belief and practice" among pupils and was no longer appropriate for modern Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="16">It also said only one parent in five was "properly aware" of their right to opt out.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Situations frequently arise where by default a child takes part in religious activities of which the parents would strongly disapprove," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead, parents and older pupils should be able to opt in to religious observance, which would avoid "such distressing situations."</seg>
<seg id="19">It said this would ensure the "integrity of participation in religious observance and should be welcomed by believers and non-believers alike."</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the Scottish Catholic Education Service also rejected an opt-in system.</seg>
<seg id="21">Director Michael McGrath insisted current safeguards were sufficient, adding that religious observance offered young people a chance to celebrate the "values, beliefs, traditions and achievements" of the school community.</seg>
<seg id="22">He told MSPs: "It is designed uniquely to address the need for students to develop their spiritual capacities, providing time and space to reflect deeply on events, experiences, aspirations."</seg>
<seg id="23">Such reflection is supported by the wisdom from the treasury of our country's culture and our religious traditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it can also be enriched by the varied experience of other cultures, faiths and traditions.</seg>
<seg id="25">This important experience is not provided for by any other area of the curriculum.</seg>

<seg id="2">A school rated "weak" and "unsatisfactory" by inspectors has reached a "turning point" according to its headteacher.</seg>
<seg id="3">St Joseph's RC in Selkirk was falling below standards in all categories.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inspectors said children had not been "achieving well" but were now starting to "feel better about their learning."</seg>
<seg id="5">Both Education Scotland and Scottish Borders Council are to provide support to help the school improve.</seg>
<seg id="6">The school was the subject of a visit in September this year and will be visited again in the next 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">Inspectors found work needed to be done to improve performance across all the main indicators used to measure the quality of education being provided.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, they noted steps had already been taken to address the issues and that staff were enthusiastic and recognised the "need to improve children's experiences."</seg>
<seg id="9">Right direction</seg>
<seg id="10">Headteacher Karen Gray said: "St Joseph's has recently gone through a difficult period.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, we are pleased that the inspection recognised that the school had reached a significant turning point.</seg>
<seg id="12">The inspection and the report confirmed that the new management team had correctly identified the needs of the school and had already taken steps to move the school forward in the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="13">She said the school was now moving forward at a "rapid rate" with staff, pupils and parents all working together.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ann Robertson, who chairs the parent council, said: "The report clearly highlights that the success of the school now lies with combined efforts of the new teaching staff, the children and the parents, all of whom want to work together to improve the children's learning.</seg>
<seg id="15">St Joseph's parent council wishes to work with the teaching staff to bring about any necessary changes and also wants to highlight that they fully support the teaching staff in their efforts to do so.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aquino's reformist image skewered by Philippine pork barrel politics</seg>
<seg id="2">A scandal over lawmakers" misuse of public funds has become the biggest crisis of Philippine President Benigno Aquino's three-year rule, tainting his carefully crafted image as a corruption fighter and undermining his ability to push economic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Aquino has struggled to keep the scandal at arms length since late July, when a whistle-blower revealed that some lawmakers, including the president's allies, were stealing up to half the money being allocated to local projects from discretionary government funds.</seg>
<seg id="4">While corruption allegations are far from new in the Philippines, the revelations have struck a chord with Filipinos because of the scale of the wrongdoing and the shock that little had changed despite Aquino's reform drive.</seg>
<seg id="5">Aquino, the only son of democracy icon and former president Corazon Aquino, has tried to tap into the public mood by saying he too is outraged by the corruption, which was corroborated in a detailed report by the state auditing body.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the allegations have drawn closer to the presidency, suggesting Aquino has failed to convincingly tackle a culture of political patronage that centres on the $586-million Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), widely known as the "pork barrel."</seg>
<seg id="7">His popularity rating plunged by 15 points in a recent opinion survey to 49 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The focus has now shifted to a separate development fund set up quietly in 2011 by Aquino's administration, the Disbursement Acceleration Program.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among its disbursements were transfers totalling 1.1 billion pesos ($25.5-million) to 18 senators last year after they voted to impeach the Supreme Court chief justice, who was seen as an Aquino rival.</seg>
<seg id="10">Aquino has vehemently denied allegations this amounted to political bribery, accusing his opponents of trying to distract attention from the real scandal.</seg>
<seg id="11">I have never stolen.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am not a thief.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I am the one who goes after thieves," Aquino said in a national television address on Wednesday night to explain his position.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greasing the wheels Aquino, 53, won office on a platform of curbing the corruption that has drained government coffers and entrenched poverty in the Philippines, a country of 97 million people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since then the Philippines has recorded strong growth, improved its public finances and been awarded investment grade ratings, partly dispelling its "sick man of Asia" reputation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Investors cite the anti-corruption drive as an important reason for the growing belief the rebound is sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="17">Indeed, the Philippines" position on Transparency International's corruption perceptions index has improved, rising to 105th out of 176 countries and territories last year from 129th in 2011, overtaking Indonesia and Vietnam.</seg>
<seg id="18">A higher ranking means a cleaner public sector.</seg>
<seg id="19">Aquino said in July that the country loses 200 billion pesos a year to corruption, or about 1.8 per cent of economic output.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The mistrust will affect confidence, and confidence affects investors" perception," said Astro del Castillo, managing director of Manila-based investment house First Grade Finance Inc.</seg>
<seg id="21">The president has taken a tough line on tax evaders and launched criminal cases against former officials, including his predecessor Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, her family and allies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Aquino led efforts to remove the head of the anti-graft agency on allegations of corruption while the anti-corruption agency ombudsman filed graft charges against police generals over the inflated price paid for helicopters and the fake repair of armoured vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the current scandal shows how discretionary funds are a crucial mechanism for controlling the two-chamber Congress in a country where party loyalties are weak.</seg>
<seg id="24">After initially resisting calls for "pork barrel" reform, Aquino announced in August that he would abolish for next year the PDAF of 70-million pesos for each lower-house member and 200 million pesos for each senator, a total of 25.2-billion pesos ($586-million).</seg>
<seg id="25">The funds are meant for local development projects such as schools, health centres and road construction, as well as for the distribution of medicine and fertilizer.</seg>
<seg id="26">The abolition of the fund could severely inhibit Aquino's ability to push through reforms such as a planned increase in mining taxes seen as crucial to attract investment into the moribund sector.</seg>
<seg id="27">It could also delay implementation of a complex peace deal to end a long-running Muslim rebellion in the resource-rich south.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The executive needs the pork as badly as the legislature because the executive needs laws to be passed; he needs elbow room to convince these legislators," Leonor Briones, a former national treasurer, told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cash-filled bathtubs Filipinos were shocked by media accounts of the opulent lifestyle of the woman who is suspected of running a massive kickback scheme for lawmakers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Janet Lim Napoles, the wife of a former Marine major, has been accused by the Department of Justice of setting up fake non-government organizations that since 2007 received lawmakers" pork barrel funds and then routed the money back to them.</seg>
<seg id="31">The whistle-blower, a former associate of Napoles, testified to the Senate in a public hearing that the businesswoman received so much cash she would stash it in the bathtub of her luxury Manila home.</seg>
<seg id="32">Napoles was arrested and charged with plunder in September, along with 30 others including three senators and five former congress members.</seg>
<seg id="33">Before her arrest, Napoles denied involvement in the scheme and said her wealth came from her family's investments in coal mining in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="34">The accusations that Aquino himself used public funds to buy off senators has forced him on the defensive and distracted him from his economic agenda.</seg>
<seg id="35">Last week, he reorganized his communications staff and reduced the exposure of two spokespersons who had struggled to deal with the media.</seg>
<seg id="36">The scandal has also sharpened questions over how much Aquino has achieved since he took power in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="37">Despite investigating hundreds of tax evasion and smuggling cases, his government has yet to win a single conviction.</seg>
<seg id="38">Critics say Aquino has failed to support reform measures to reduce the influence of money politics, such as the pending anti-graft Freedom of Information Act.</seg>
<seg id="39">They also say his efforts have targeted political foes far more than allies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"This perception endangers what gains he has made in the past three years and curbs the potential for any sustained gains in the long-term fight against corruption," said Mars Buan, senior analyst at Pacific Strategies and Assessments in Manila.</seg>

<seg id="2">Spying 'at Australian diplomatic facilities'</seg>
<seg id="3">Whistle-blower Edward Snowden says Australian embassies are being secretly used to spy on Asia.</seg>
<seg id="4">PT1M22Shttp://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-2wi48620349October 31, 2013</seg>
<seg id="5">Indonesia's foreign ministry has called in Australia's ambassador and issued a "strong demand" that he immediately explain the news that the Australian embassy in Jakarta was used as a post to spy on Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="6">If news that Australia conducts clandestine surveillance activities through its embassy in Jakarta is true, such activities are highly unacceptable</seg>
<seg id="7">In a statement issued late on Thursday, the foreign ministry "strongly demands clarification and an explanation" of the revelations published by Fairfax Media.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa has asked the Australian ambassador Greg Moriarty to immediately explain the news that the Australian embassy in Jakarta was used as a post to spy on Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Photo: Andrew Meares</seg>
<seg id="10">But Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa will not take the meeting - he is in Perth attending a conference with his Australian counterpart Julie Bishop.</seg>
<seg id="11">A departmental spokesman said ambassador Greg Moriarty would meet a "senior official" instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">Calling in an ambassador is a strong diplomatic step, and the revelations and swift response threaten to increase tensions in the relationship between the two countries at a time when Prime Minister Tony Abbott is seeking to hose down ill-feeling in Indonesia from his electioneering over asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Fairfax Media reported on Thursday that a document leaked by Edward Snowden showed Australian embassies were being secretly used to intercept phone calls and data across Asia as part of a US-led global spying network.</seg>
<seg id="14">China has also reacted angrily to the claims, demanding an explanation from the US.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We demand that foreign entities and personnel in China strictly abide by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other international treaties, and they must not, in any form, engage in activities that are incompatible with their position and status and that are harmful to China's national security and interest," Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said at a daily briefing for reporters.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just 12 hours before the story was published, Australian immigration minister Scott Morrison was in Jakarta asking for Indonesia's help to combat people smugglers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The statement said Mr Moriarty, had been requested to come to the Foreign Affairs office on Friday to "provide an official explanation from the Australian Government."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The actions that were carried out, as they were reported, absolutely do not reflect the spirit of friendship that has been well maintained between neighbouring and friendly countries, and are a serious breach of security that is unacceptable to the Indonesian Government," the statement says.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the first version, the foreign ministry said: "If the story is confirmed, Indonesia will lodge a strong protest against the action."</seg>
<seg id="20">However, a "corrected" version was later issued without that sentence.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a serious security breach and is inconsistent with diplomatic norms and ethics ... Spying on friends is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokeswoman for Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was the "prerogative of host governments to call in diplomatic representatives for discussions."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Australia and Indonesia share a wide range of economic, political and security interests and we are close partners in the region and in global forums such as APEC, the G20 and the East Asia Summit," the spokeswoman said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The latest revelations come after it was revealed German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other foreign leaders had their personal phones tapped byt eh US National Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday night, Bob Carr said that while he was foreign minister it was a "safe assumption" to operate as though his phone calls were being monitored.</seg>
<seg id="26">When asked by ABC's Lateline whether he operated under the assumption that his calls were being monitored while he was Australia's foreign minister, Mr Carr said it was a "safe assumption."</seg>
<seg id="27">"In travelling in some parts of the world, one felt that advice more pressing than in other parts of the world," the recently retired NSW senator said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Protests in Hong Kong as Leung Chun-ying sworn in as chief executive</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of protesters take to the streets chanting slogans against new Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hong Kong's Chief Executive-elect Leung Chun-ying, right, and his wife Regina.</seg>
<seg id="4">HONG Kong's biggest protest for nearly a decade has packed the former British colony's streets in a defiant reception for its new leader and a show of popular anger after 15 years of Chinese rule.</seg>
<seg id="5">The rally came after Leung Chun-ying, a millionaire property consultant seen as close to China's communist authorities, was sworn in as chief executive in front of Chinese President Hu Jintao - who had his speech interrupted on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hu's visit and Leung's inauguration have become focal points for growing discontent towards Beijing, which has surged to a new post-handover high amid soaring housing costs, limited democracy and perceived meddling by China.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Hong Kong has become much worse off," Eric Lai of the Civil Human Rights Front told the marchers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Our rights are under serious threat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Organisers put the crowd at 400,000, their largest claimed turnout for eight years.</seg>
<seg id="10">A poster with a picture of Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying reading "Guard the values of Hong Kong, tell Hong Kong people to say no to communist authority" is burnt by protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In sweltering heat the last of the marchers reached their destination almost six hours after the first set out, and along the way they blocked streets far across the city, stranding buses and trams as they surrounded them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hong Kong does not yet choose its leader by universal suffrage, and Leung was elected as chief executive in March by a committee stacked with pro-Beijing business elites.</seg>
<seg id="13">A spokesman for the Hong Kong government said it "fully respected" freedom of expression and the right to "take part in processions," and would listen to the demonstrators' views "in a humble manner."</seg>
<seg id="14">Earlier, as President Hu began his speech to around 2300 guests at Leung's inauguration, a protester inside the harbour-front venue repeatedly shouted "End one-party rule."</seg>
<seg id="15">A protester hits a cut-out picture of wolf which represents new Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying during a pro-democracy protest march in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The man also referred to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in Beijing, and was rapidly bundled away by security personnel, while the audience drowned him out with extended applause for Hu.</seg>
<seg id="17">Beijing's support for "one country, two systems" and the right of Hong Kongers to rule the territory was "unwavering," said Hu.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We will follow the Basic Law ... to continue to advance democratic development in Hong Kong," said the president, who will step down as part of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition in Beijing starting later this year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Late on Sunday some 300 protesters held a demonstration outside the Beijing representative office in Hong Kong, burning copies of the city's mini-constitution before dispersing around midnight.</seg>

<seg id="2">On a night when the World Series trophy was carried onto the ice, the Bruins gave Boston sports fans one more reason to cheer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zdeno Chara scored the tying goal on a power play with under 3 minutes remaining in regulation and Jarome Iginla had the lone goal in a shootout to rally the Bruins past the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's a sports city, clearly," said Chris Kelly, who had an assist and was wearing a World Series championship T-shirt after the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crowd here is always awesome.</seg>
<seg id="6">Halloween night, a lot of people might decide to take their kids trick-or-treating.</seg>
<seg id="7">But not in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="8">They're here.</seg>
<seg id="9">And they witnessed another win for the home team.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bruins players came out for warmups wearing World Series caps, and the crowd got into it midway through the second period when Boston Red Sox highlights from their clinching win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Wednesday night at Fenway Park were shown on the JumboTron.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bruins team President Cam Neely and Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino then came onto the ice and held the World Series trophy high above their heads.</seg>
<seg id="12">During the timeout, Kelly instantly noticed the trophy.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I wouldn't mind getting a picture with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Carl Soderberg scored his first NHL goal and Tuukka Rask made 21 saves for the Bruins, who mustered only one shot in the first period but still managed to snap a two-game skid.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think we have a lot of competitive guys and when you're down, that desperation level kicks in," said defenceman Torey Krug, who also had an assist.</seg>
<seg id="16">We've got to do a better job of starting games out.</seg>
<seg id="17">Devante Smith-Pelly scored less than 2 minutes into the game, Mathieu Perreault had a goal and an assist and Jonas Hiller stopped 21 shots for the Ducks.</seg>
<seg id="18">But they went 0 for 4 on the power play, dropping the league's worst unit to 7.3 per cent (4 for 55).</seg>
<seg id="19">Anaheim was on the verge of its fourth straight victory until Patrick Maroon's tripping penalty with 2:58 left in the third period gave Boston late life.</seg>
<seg id="20">"That's three games in a row that we've taken a penalty in the last 2 minutes of the game," Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said.</seg>
<seg id="21">It didn't take long for the Bruins to capitalize.</seg>
<seg id="22">David Krejci scooped up a loose puck just outside the crease and slid a pass through the legs of defenceman Cam Fowler that Chara easily slipped past Hiller with 2:50 to go, setting off a celebration in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Iginla then put Boston ahead in the shootout with his wrist shot over Hiller's glove.</seg>
<seg id="24">After Rask turned aside two weak attempts by the Ducks, Ryan Getzlaf hit the crossbar to end the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"They didn't have a shot on goal in the first period until the 18-minute mark," Boudreau said.</seg>
<seg id="26">But if you don't score, eventually a really good team is going to come up and bite you and that's what happened.</seg>
<seg id="27">After scoring the game-winner with 0.8 seconds left last Thursday to stun the San Jose Sharks, the Bruins gave up a pair of late goals in each of their previous two games, including two power-play tallies 23 seconds apart in a setback to New Jersey on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the buzz in the building Thursday following Boston's third World Series title in the last 10 years, the Bruins got off to a slow start.</seg>
<seg id="29">A slap shot by Chara more than 18 minutes into the game was Boston's lone shot of the first period.</seg>
<seg id="30">Anaheim had five shots, but needed only one to score.</seg>
<seg id="31">Smith-Pelly got his first goal of the season 1:52 into the game to give the Ducks a quick lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After the World Series trophy came out, the Bruins picked up their play.</seg>
<seg id="33">They tied the score minutes later when Soderberg broke in alone on Hiller and slipped the puck between his legs for his first career goal.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It means a lot to me," Soderberg said.</seg>
<seg id="35">I've been playing in Europe for 10 years at the highest level there, but it's still not the NHL.</seg>
<seg id="36">I came here at 28 years old, so I wanted to see if I could play in the NHL.</seg>
<seg id="37">I'm pretty glad I scored.</seg>
<seg id="38">Perreault's fifth goal put the Ducks back on top with 20.9 seconds remaining in the second.</seg>
<seg id="39">After winning a faceoff in the Bruins zone, Perreault corralled a pass inside the circle just seconds later, spun to his right and slid a shot by Rask's right leg.</seg>
<seg id="40">"That goal in the last 20 seconds of the second would probably have broken a lot of teams" backs."</seg>
<seg id="41">"It didn't break ours," Bruins coach Claude Julien said.</seg>
<seg id="42">I'd rather give my team credit for this one than say we're fortunate.</seg>
<seg id="43">For us to come out here and play a great game and then battle right until the end and win this against a team that was fresh and waiting for us here, if anything, I would say that's a real gutsy effort on our part.</seg>
<seg id="44">Notes: The Bruins recalled C Ryan Spooner from Providence of the AHL and he got his first NHL point when he assisted on Soderberg's goal.</seg>
<seg id="45">He also missed the first shot of the shootout. ...</seg>
<seg id="46">The Ducks played without forward Teemu Selanne, expected to miss two weeks after losing four teeth and receiving 40 stitches in his mouth following a high stick in a victory over Philadelphia on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="47">The 43-year-old ranks second on the active scoring list with 1,437 points and plans to retire after the season. ...</seg>
<seg id="48">Boston's one shot in the first was its fewest in a period since getting just one in the third period of a win over New Jersey on Jan.</seg>
<seg id="49">It was Boston's first overtime game this season, and Anaheim's third.</seg>

<seg id="6">The bigger cliff, which I'm surprised people aren't talking about, is emergency unemployment benefits Jan.</seg>
<seg id="7">"1," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, financed by the federal government for states that met certain unemployment and state benefit thresholds, was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- commonly referred to as the Recovery Act, or the stimulus.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was a temporary increase in the maximum amount of food stamp benefits people could get monthly as part of Washington's response to the Great Recession.</seg>
<seg id="10">The EUC program extended unemployment benefits to jobless workers beyond the normal maximum of 26 weeks up to 99 weeks at first and later to 73 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The maximum returns to 26 weeks Jan.</seg>
<seg id="12">Friday's change in the food stamp program, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, cuts monthly benefits 13.6 percent -- or, more precisely, ends a 13.6 percent increase in SNAP benefits from the stimulus act.</seg>
<seg id="13">Benefits to a family of four receiving the maximum amount drop Friday to $632 from $668, the U.S. Agriculture Department says.</seg>
<seg id="14">The maximum benefits for a single adult fall to $189 from $200.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cuts leave recipients with an estimated average $1.40 to spend on each meal, the department says, citing its Thrifty Food Plan.</seg>
<seg id="16">The number of people on food stamps jumped to nearly 48 million in July from about 26 million in 2007, before the recession started, the government said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The increase is due to a rise in the number of people who lost their jobs and needed food assistance, government efforts to increase food stamp usage by families that didn't know they were eligible, and relaxed eligibility standards in some states, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says.</seg>
<seg id="18">The food stamp cuts -- which are projected to reduce federal spending $5 billion in the current fiscal year and $6 billion the next two years -- are separate from additional cuts House and Senate negotiators are considering as they work out a farm bill.</seg>
<seg id="19">Food stamps are part of the farm bill.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Republican-controlled House version of the farm bill proposes cutting $39 billion from food stamps over 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Democratic-controlled Senate proposes cutting $4 billion over the same period.</seg>
<seg id="22">Food stamps are expected to cost taxpayers $76.4 billion this fiscal year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Uk weather: Wild weather returns with 60mph gales, heavy rain and risk of flooding on washout weekend</seg>
<seg id="2">Met Office issues warnings for London and southern and eastern counties</seg>
<seg id="3">Gusts of up to 60mph predicted in parts of Wales</seg>
<seg id="4">Areas battered by St Jude storm to bear the brunt for a second time</seg>
<seg id="5">By Lizzie Parry and Lizzie Edmonds</seg>
<seg id="6">Swathes of the UK have been warned to expect flooding this weekend as mother nature unleashes a second barrage of stormy weather.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Met Office has issued a warning for southern England, alerting people to the risk of localised flooding today and on Sunday as heavy rain hits the coast.</seg>
<seg id="8">The areas caught in the eye of the powerful St Jude storm last Sunday and Monday are expected to once again bear the brunt of the bad weather - with close to one inch of rain predicted in the south east.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wet weekend: Heavy rain is expected in the south and eastern areas of the country, while 60mph winds are predicted in some areas of Wales</seg>
<seg id="10">Predictions: The Met Office have warned of localised flooding today and on Sunday in southern England</seg>
<seg id="11">Many areas will see torrential downpours and high winds, which will continue tomorrow, with gusts of up to 60mph predicted in Wales.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stormy weather will strengthen on Sunday when the worst of the weather arrives and the risk of flooding will be at its highest following days of rain.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are fears the latest spell of disruptive weather will hamper recovery efforts following the impact of the worst storm in Britain for 26 years, which killed five people.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tim Fields of the Energy Networks Association said: 'A lot of the places that are still without power are quite remote, with small numbers of people where there are downed power lines.</seg>
<seg id="15">Destruction: St Jude's storm, the worst to hit the UK in 26 years, pulled down this two-storey scaffolding in Leyton, east London, crushing cars and blocking 100m of road</seg>
<seg id="16">Powerless: Monday's storm pulled down electricity lines, including the one pictured in Brentwood, Essex, leaving thousands of homes without power</seg>
<seg id="17">All the network operators will be in close contact with the Met Office during the weekend and we hope to have everyone back on supply by the end of next week.</seg>
<seg id="18">Flooding does not normally present a huge threat to the energy infrastructure but extensive flooding would definitely pose a risk.</seg>
<seg id="19">Billy Payne, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said the latest spell of unwelcome weather will not be a repeat of last week's powerful storm.</seg>
<seg id="20">'It will not be welcomed but it is not expected to be anywhere near as bad as last week,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will still be windy but the main risk this weekend is of lots of heavy rain.</seg>
<seg id="22">On top of the rain we have already had it could lead to flash flooding, particularly on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Dark Universe," at the Hayden Planetarium</seg>
<seg id="2">American Museum of Natural History</seg>
<seg id="3">Dark Universe This Hayden Planetarium exhibition follows light to show the expansion of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History, was showing off an exhibit about the history of the universe outside the Hayden Planetarium there eight years ago, he says, when a schoolteacher approached him and said, "You don't really believe all this Big Bang stuff, do you?"</seg>
<seg id="5">Shades of those bumper stickers and billboards you see in some parts of the country: "Big Bang?"</seg>
<seg id="6">You've got to be kidding - God.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a mountain of evidence, still piling up, that the universe was "born in fire" 13.8 billion years ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cosmic space has been stretching ever since, taking the galaxies for a ride.</seg>
<seg id="9">Where, we don't know.</seg>
<seg id="10">And so, Dr. Mac Low said in an interview, the teacher's question planted a seed in his mind for "Dark Universe," the space show opening at the planetarium, in the museum's Rose Center for Earth and Space, this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">With a script by the esteemed science writer Timothy Ferris, directed by the museum's Carter Emmart and narrated by the planetarium's director and man about the cosmos, Neil deGrasse Tyson, the show promises to guide us through a century of discovery about the past, present and future of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="12">My reaction, both times I saw it, was that the century of discovery went by way too fast.</seg>
<seg id="13">Aficionados of the Hayden's space shows - this is the fifth - know that Mr. Emmart, the museum's director of astrovisualization, drawing on the enormous databanks of the world's astronomers, can take you on a trip that makes Hollywood's most vaunted special effects, including those in the hit "Gravity," look like a cartoon.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I was happily swooning through the cosmos, stars and galaxies floating crisply by like the fluff you get from blowing on a dandelion, ready to go anywhere, when the final credits started rolling.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is as good a place as any to applaud the selection of Dr. Tyson as narrator in place of the usual celebrities who have signed on in the past.</seg>
<seg id="16">Not that they were bad, but Dr. Tyson, a forceful presence and advocate of science whose many appearances on Bill Maher's cable show have gained him the nickname there of the Preacher, is a celebrity in his own right, soon to be the star of the revamped "Cosmos" TV series.</seg>
<seg id="17">He moves about the universe as comfortably and confidently as a man in his own kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="18">He knows what's in the refrigerator, what's good and what's stale, and how to rustle up a treat without a recipe.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the 25 minutes of the planetarium show, we hang out at the Mount Wilson Observatory, overlooking Los Angeles, where the expansion of the universe was first discerned, and cruise past the space station, which is carrying an instrument that physicists hope will identify the mystery sauce of the universe: dark matter.</seg>
<seg id="20">We dip into the clouds of Jupiter with the Galileo probe to retrieve evidence - a heavy form of hydrogen - that the whole universe was once hotter than the center of the sun, hot enough for forging simple atoms in the Big Bang.</seg>
<seg id="21">But atoms are only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="22">The "Dark Universe" title is more than just poetic allusion.</seg>
<seg id="23">Discoveries in the last couple of decades, while underscoring the Big Bang, have revealed that the universe as now understood is a more complicated place than we can perhaps ever see.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only 5 percent of it consists of ordinary matter, made of atoms that we know and love.</seg>
<seg id="25">A quarter of the universe, by mass, astronomers say, is made of some invisible and not yet understood dark matter, which is detectable only by its gravitational pull on visible matter.</seg>
<seg id="26">And a whopping 70 percent of the universe is made up of an even more mysterious entity known as dark energy, a cosmic antigravity.</seg>
<seg id="27">We can't see that, either.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Dr. Tyson puts it at one point, "There's more to the universe than meets the eye."</seg>
<seg id="29">You might well wonder just how big a triumph a theory is that leaves 95 percent of the universe to the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="30">You might think that it's pretty cool that we still have so much of creation to discover.</seg>
<seg id="31">Or, if you tend toward cynicism, you might hark back to that bumper sticker: You must be kidding.</seg>
<seg id="32">You might also wonder how they are going to make a show out of dark stuff that you can't see and that few of us understand.</seg>
<seg id="33">The producers have gone easy on abstract explanations in favor of visual experiences, filling the dome with not just images of stars but also film shot at ground-based observatories and in space.</seg>
<seg id="34">There's something for everybody: Even kids who don't understand astrophysics will thrill to the hulking views of spacecraft like Galileo, Planck and the international space station passing overhead like the empire's battle cruisers in "Star Wars."</seg>
<seg id="35">But, as Dr. Mac Low and his colleagues show us, it is by following the light that astronomers have been drawn inexorably into the dark.</seg>
<seg id="36">If that sounds, well, Voldemortean, it is.</seg>
<seg id="37">One sequence, shown entirely in black and gray, shows tendrils of dark matter snaking across the sky, connecting and growing into a web, while sound effects that seem right out of a Harry Potter movie play in the background.</seg>
<seg id="38">These dark tendrils will form the cradles where stars and life will eventually form.</seg>
<seg id="39">As an example of the evidence for dark matter, we are shown a time-lapse view of a giant cluster of galaxies: trillions of stars and thousands of galaxies swarming together like bugs in a dish.</seg>
<seg id="40">Such compendiums of matter turn out to warp space like a lens, magnifying and distorting the images of galaxies even more distant.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the movie, those distorted galaxies swirl around the edges of the cluster like fish, so that the whole thing looks like an evil eye in space.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Dark Universe" opens on Saturday at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, Central Park West at 81st Street; 212-769-5100, amnh.org.</seg>

<seg id="1">PM's crackdown on company secrecy welcomed</seg>
<seg id="2">Lifting the "cloak of secrecy" around the true ownership of shadowy shell companies will help combat corruption and ensure taxes are properly paid, David Cameron said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Prime Minister announced that a UK register of the beneficial ownership of companies would be made public, shining a spotlight on international cash flows.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cameron, who made tax transparency a key theme of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, urged other world leaders to build on the commitments made at Lough Erne.</seg>
<seg id="5">He promised a "relentless" pursuit of businesses which break the rules and said that by making the register public it will be easier for firms and developing countries to see who they are really dealing with.</seg>
<seg id="6">Speaking at the Open Government Partnership summit in London, he said: "For too long a small minority have hidden their business dealings behind a complicated web of shell companies - and this cloak of secrecy has fuelled all manner of questionable practices and downright illegality."</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to make the UK register publicly accessible was broadly welcomed by campaigners and business leaders.</seg>
<seg id="8">Katja Hall, chief policy director at the CBI said: "Businesses back the creation of a beneficial ownership register which will support efforts to promote transparency and stamp out illicit financial activity."</seg>
<seg id="9">The real prize is the ability to track ownership information around the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now that the UK has chosen to make this a public register, ensuring others follow our lead will be critical to its success and to maintaining a level playing field.</seg>
<seg id="11">Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, added: "Most British businesses already have transparent ownership structures."</seg>
<seg id="12">However, many will be concerned that the introduction of a universal register of beneficial ownership could create unintended consequences for law-abiding businesses, such as increased regulatory and reporting burdens.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five ways to make the most of Aberdeen's International Street Market</seg>
<seg id="2">With everything from potted plants to pain au chocolat on offer, the International Street Market has something to suit all tastes.</seg>
<seg id="3">But instead of wandering the stretch of stalls without much thought, why not take a look at our guide to making the most of the three-day market.</seg>
<seg id="4">Who knows, you might pick up a bargain or two...</seg>
<seg id="5">Seek out the freebies</seg>
<seg id="6">Let's be honest, who doesn't love picking up a few free samples at markets?</seg>
<seg id="7">The stalls selling cheeses, breads and pastries will undoubtedly have some on display but you will hit the jackpot if the hot food stalls start up selling with trays of samples.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sniff out the freebies near closing time - you might just grab a plate of food for next to nothing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eat seasonably</seg>
<seg id="10">Now that the weather has taken us into autumn, our shopping baskets should have changed with the seasons.</seg>
<seg id="11">But are you still picking up fruits and vegetables that are flown halfway across the world to your local supermarket?</seg>
<seg id="12">Then why not ask greengrocer stall holders for some advice.</seg>
<seg id="13">They can pick out the best produce and advise what to eat and what to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="14">Stallholders with a genuine passion for their products will have the best advice and may give you a couple of cooking tips to boot, giving you more for your money.</seg>
<seg id="15">Warm up with some exciting new cuisines</seg>
<seg id="16">Aberdeen may be teeming with restaurants offering cuisines from across the globe but the authenticity of some chain restaurants can be dubious.</seg>
<seg id="17">Look out for stallholders conversing in their mother tongue - if it matches their produce then it will have that authentic flavour.</seg>
<seg id="18">The colder weather is also perfect for French and Spanish street food, so indulge in crispy churros with oozing melted chocolate or a French crepe doused in icing sugar.</seg>
<seg id="19">Pick up some alternative dinner options</seg>
<seg id="20">The Saturday night dinner bell may herald the arrival of the takeaway menu but why not pick up something different to try?</seg>
<seg id="21">Butchers specialising in alternative meats are commonplace at international markets, so why not pick up some Springbok or Wild Boar burgers to widen your culinary horizons?</seg>
<seg id="22">For the same price as pre-made supermarket desserts you can also pick up a beautiful piece of patisserie at the French bakery stalls.</seg>
<seg id="23">If you don't want to go all out you can still pick up a couple of pieces of baklava to accompany your Saturday night curry - many stalls will work by weight so you can take only what you need.</seg>
<seg id="24">Try your hand at haggling</seg>
<seg id="25">It may be seen as a big no-no in the UK, but in these tough economic times there is no shame in negotiating a better price.</seg>
<seg id="26">Markets like these are a great starting point and you could walk away with a couple of pounds knocked off.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you plan on picking up a couple of items a good place to start is to ask the seller to throw in something extra.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plus its brilliant practice for negotiating better deals on big purchases like car insurance or electrical goods elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="29">There are a wealth of tips online if you fancy a go and remember - the worst they can say is 'no'.</seg>
<seg id="30">Are you heading to the international market this weekend?</seg>

<seg id="1">Dave King says 'no consensus' in Rangers boardroom power struggle</seg>
<seg id="2">Rangers oldco investor Dave King has revealed he has been unable to reach a "consensus agreement" with shareholders locked in a boardroom dispute.</seg>
<seg id="3">The South Africa-based businessman has been in Scotland holding meetings with Rangers International Football Club plc stakeholders recently, as it gears up for a power struggle at its first annual general meeting (AGM).</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, he said that "certain influential shareholders are unwilling to compromise" in the boardroom battle at Ibrox.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr King also claimed that his convictions for breaching tax legislation in South Africe have "has no effect whatsoever on my ability to serve as a director of companies."</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this year he agreed to pay the South African Revenue Service £44.75m after pleading guilty to contravening tax legislation by failing to provide correct information about incomes earned over a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The payment agreement included a fine as an alternative to an 82-year jail term for 41 terms of breaching the tax legislation, while the revenue service also agreed to drop prosecutions over fraud charges in relation to his business dealings.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a statement released on Friday, Mr King said: "During the last week I engaged a number of stakeholders, both in Glasgow and London, to seek a compromise to the current imbroglio that is restricting the operational capability and the governance at the club.</seg>
<seg id="9">I have also had follow up telephone conversations since my return to South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="10">I thank every person that I met for maintaining confidentiality about the details of each meeting.</seg>
<seg id="11">I thank the media for their patience when being met with a repeated "no comment" from me.</seg>
<seg id="12">I appreciate the importance to the community of what is happening at Rangers but I believe that the best interests of the club will not be facilitated by playing it out in the media.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the last two years we have all witnessed the destructive value when individuals, who should be putting the club first, advance personal agendas through the media in an attempt to influence the most important stakeholder in Rangers Football Club- the fans.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result is the polarisation of interests that we are experiencing and the loss of valuable time and money in preparing the club to be competitive with our Glasgow neighbours, and other teams, when we return to the top flight of Scottish football- as we surely will.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thankfully the manager continues to make progress through the leagues despite the distractions he has had to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="16">He continued: "Unfortunately, I have been unable to reach a consensus agreement at this time despite the constructive manner in which everyone approached the discussions with me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Certain influential shareholders are unwilling to compromise at this time and it seems inevitable, unless there is a change of heart, that an acrimonious AGM lies ahead.</seg>
<seg id="18">In my view, the AGM will not be decisive irrespective of its outcome.</seg>
<seg id="19">A continued polarisation is what I was desperately trying to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the avoidance of doubt and to avoid speculation I advise that Paul Murray and Sandy Easdale both displayed a constructive and flexible attitude during my discussions with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">I also take the opportunity to disassociate myself from the speculative and misinformed press coverage around my fit and proper status.</seg>
<seg id="22">Let me make my position clear.</seg>
<seg id="23">The settlement of my legal disputes in South Africa was concluded on a basis that has no effect whatsoever on my ability to serve as a director of companies.</seg>
<seg id="24">I presently sit on the board of many companies, including serving as executive chairman of a main board stock exchange listed company in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="25">I have confirmed with my UK attorneys that the legal position is no different in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="26">That leaves only the subjective elements that would apply to any person joining a public company board or becoming involved in a football club under the auspices of the SFA.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rangers International currently have two board members in the form of finance director Brian Stockbridge and non-executive member James Easdale.</seg>
<seg id="28">It planned to hold its first annual general meeting on October 24, but was prevented from doing so by opposition shareholders - including institutional investors and former oldco director Paul Murray - who took the company to the Court of Session to postponed the event and to force it to consider the appointment of new board members.</seg>
<seg id="29">A new date for the annual general meeting has not been set yet.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last month, Rangers International posted its first annual results which showed it had run at an operating loss of £14.3m for the 13 months until June this year.</seg>
<seg id="31">Previously, Rangers had announced that Mr King was in discussions about taking the role of chairman of the company board, however there have been no further developments regarding that appointment.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr King's appointment would need to be vetted by the Scottish FA and by Rangers International's nominated advisor (nomad) to the London Stock Exchange, Daniel Stewart and Company.</seg>
<seg id="33">Both the football authorities and the advisors would consider his convictions, as well as his involvement as a director of Rangers oldco which is currently in the hands of liquidators BDO.</seg>
<seg id="34">In his statement, the 58-year-old claimed to have assurances from the South African tax authorities that it had no problems with him sitting on the boards of companies.</seg>
<seg id="35">He is currently the executive chairman of Johannesburg investment firm Micromega, which trades on the country's stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr King said: "I am fully alert to key questions that are likely to be put to me and I am confident that my responses will be persuasive.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, at this point I have not approached the SFA other than my discussion in 2012 to establish what the elements of the fit and proper test would be.</seg>
<seg id="38">The SFA is clearly not in a position to consider an application that I have not yet made.</seg>
<seg id="39">Such an application would only happen if I am able to reach an in principle agreement to become actively involved in the club's affairs- as is my continued stated intention.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the request of the nomad, I have supplied a letter from the South African Revenue Services confirming that they see no difficulty with me continuing to sit on the board of companies.</seg>
<seg id="41">Again, however, due to my inability to make immediate progress it is not necessary to engage further with the nomad at this time.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the time arises there may be other questions I have to respond to.</seg>
<seg id="43">I will do so on request.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sometimes a traffic light simply never turns green.</seg>
<seg id="3">The contact loop on the road does not react, or the light itself is defective.</seg>
<seg id="4">What should you do - drive through on red?</seg>
<seg id="5">If an affected person has waited for a sufficiently long period of time at a red light, and provided the crossing is clear, they can drive on, explained Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in "Motorrad" (Motorcycle) magazine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The waiting time must, however, be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently on a case-to-case basis.</seg>
<seg id="7">Becker advises that you wait at least five minutes before a fault with the traffic lights can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Anyone who drives on in spite of a red light must, however, be aware that he/she will be fully liable for any resulting accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who waits for less than five minutes has, under certain circumstances, not waited long enough, warned Becker, referring to a ruling of the Hamm Higher Regional Court.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the case in question, a driver ignored a light that was permanently red after around three minutes and and was held responsible for negligently jumping a red light.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic lights were actually not defective, but rather turned green just a few minutes later.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was spared a driving ban on account of the special circumstances - but was not spared a fine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australian ambassador summoned by Indonesia over embassy spy claims</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian ambassador Greg Moriarty emerges from the Indonesian foreign ministry on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Michael Bachelard</seg>
<seg id="4">Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa has said that reports the Australian embassy was used to spy on Indonesia were "not cricket," after Australia's ambassador to Indonesia was summonsed by the Indonesian foreign affairs department.</seg>
<seg id="5">Addressing reporters from Perth on Friday, Dr Natalegawa said that the Indonesian government was seeking an explanation to revelations this week in Fairfax Media of widespread spying in Indonesia from the Australian embassy building in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="6">The operation was so secret, sources said, that some employees of the embassy were unaware of it.</seg>
<seg id="7">"If Australia was itself subject to such an activity, would you consider it as being a friendly act or not?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm not sure what's the right term in Australian terminology.</seg>
<seg id="9">I guess it's not cricket.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dr Natalegawa acknowledged that some countries had "certain capacities" to gather information.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's one thing but, whether you would want to put that into effect and therefore potentially damaging the kind of trust and confidence that have been nurtured and developed over many decades and years is something that we may want to ponder.</seg>
<seg id="12">Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said Dr Natalegawa had raised his concerns with her in Perth and that she took them seriously.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's long-standing practice for Australian governments not to comment on intelligence matters and I will be adopting that long-standing practice," she said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Australian ambassador Greg Moriarty spent less than 20 minutes in a meeting with the secretary-general of Indonesia's foreign affairs department after being called in to explain revelations of spying from his embassy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Moriarty arrived looking grim shortly before 9am local time and brushed past the press pack, saying, "I'm here to talk to the foreign ministry not to the media."</seg>
<seg id="16">About 20 minutes later he emerged, stopping briefly to say, in English then in Indonesian: "I just had a meeting with the secretary-general.</seg>
<seg id="17">From my perspective it was a good meeting and now I have to go and report to my government.</seg>
<seg id="18">The summons came as a result of revelations in Fairfax Media of widespread spying in Indonesia from the Australian embassy building in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="19">Calling in an ambassador is a strong diplomatic step, and the revelations and swift response threaten to increase tensions in the relationship between the two countries at a time when Prime Minister Tony Abbott is seeking hose down ill-feeling in Indonesia from his electioneering over asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="20">The foreign ministry had earlier issued a "strong demand" that Mr Moriarty immediately explain the news.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The actions that were carried out, as they were reported, absolutely do not reflect the spirit of friendship that has been well maintained between neighbouring and friendly countries, and are a serious breach of security that is unacceptable to the Indonesian government," the Indonesian statement said.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry said after the meeting that Mr Moriarty had been called in to "seek clarification and to convey the message as in the press release."</seg>
<seg id="23">The response came after the Indonesian president's senior foreign affairs adviser also protested strongly, saying the use of an embassy for such purposes was "unacceptable," a "serious security breach," and carried the potential to "damage trust and confidence."</seg>
<seg id="24">Adviser Teuku Faizasyah said that, "illegal ways of collecting information, including through intercepting phone conversations, is against the very principle of good bilateral relations."</seg>
<seg id="25">If news that Australia conducts clandestine surveillance activities through its embassy in Jakarta is true, such activities are highly unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is a serious security breach and is inconsistent with diplomatic norms and ethics ...</seg>
<seg id="27">Spying on friends is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mutual trust is the very foundation of any good bilateral relations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Halloween 2013: By the Numbers</seg>
<seg id="2">When I was little, Halloween was magical.</seg>
<seg id="3">My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nowadays, I've become more of a scrooge.</seg>
<seg id="5">I haven't signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won't this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">But stats show that I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
<seg id="8">One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends.</seg>
<seg id="9">Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
<seg id="12">As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
<seg id="14">I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.</seg>
<seg id="15">We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="17">That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="23">The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's a mystery I have yet to solve.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.</seg>
<seg id="27">They have the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like "nice face."</seg>
<seg id="29">Finally, let's talk pumpkins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lucky for us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="33">The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manatee deaths break record high with two months left this year</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- About 15 percent of Florida's 5,000 manatees have died in 2013 -- a record high -- with more deaths expected by the end of the year, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St. Petersburg reports 769 manatees have been killed so far this year, the Tampa Bay (Fla.)</seg>
<seg id="4">Times reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm sure we're going to wind up well over 800," said Pat Rose of the Save the Manatee Club.</seg>
<seg id="6">The previous record was set in 2010 when 766 manatees died -- mostly due to a drop in ocean temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities say boaters are not to blame, and that overall, the number of manatee deaths from being hit by boats are down.</seg>
<seg id="8">This year, the manatee die-off has been linked to a massive Red Tide algae bloom in southwest Florida, which caused at least 276 deaths, said Kevin Baxter of the state's wildlife biology lab.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another major factor into the manatee deaths this year has been a mysterious ailment that has killed 116 manatees in the Indian River Lagoon on Florida's east coast, Baxter said.</seg>
<seg id="10">An investigation into the Indian River Lagoon deaths is being conducted, he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Tom MacKenzie said the manatee may be elevated to an endangered species, rather than threatened, sometime next year.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We are concerned about the high mortality," MacKenzie said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon, German time.</seg>
<seg id="3">In an announcement, the operator cited technical problems as the reason.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the other eleven options markets, including two also operated by Nasdaq OMX, business continued as normal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most recent incident is the latest in a series of both small and large breakdowns suffered by the stock exchange operator.</seg>
<seg id="6">As recently as last Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for one hour due to data transfer errors.</seg>
<seg id="7">In August of this year there were two breakdowns in a single week.</seg>
<seg id="8">First of all, US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent large quantities of incorrect purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a result, the stock exchange operators required almost an entire day to look through and delete the orders.</seg>
<seg id="10">Two days later, half of all stock dealing in the USA came to a standstill for several hours, due to a computer failure in the Nasdaq exchange.</seg>
<seg id="11">Furthermore, last year the listing of Facebook on the stock exchange caused quite a furore.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Nasdaq systems could not cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders, the Exchange Supervisory Authority established at a later date, imposing a record penalty of 10 million dollars on the company.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rhenus Midgard has also invested highly in land</seg>
<seg id="3">They stockpile the coal that arrives on ships.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the company also has other irons in the fire at the location.</seg>
<seg id="5">Besides coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is also active in the field of wind park logistics, among other ventures.</seg>
<seg id="6">The coals shimmer black in the storage yard in front of the embankment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Here two huge blue stacker and reclaimer machines distribute or load the coals as required.</seg>
<seg id="8">With each movement of the handling machines, a shrill warning noise rings out over the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The signals are for the purpose of security and are legally prescribed," said Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.</seg>
<seg id="10">Unfortunately, in the event of unfavourable wind, they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 40-year-old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected.</seg>
<seg id="12">In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in a position to make the warning signals quieter by means of the implementation of technical measures.</seg>
<seg id="13">In future he will also seek open dialogue with neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="14">For Matthias Schrell has some further plans at the location.</seg>
<seg id="15">With the construction of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard is continuing to focus on coal exports for power stations and is one of the major powers in this sector in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thanks to the mooring basin to the front of the terminal, sunken to a depth of 18.5 metres, it has for some time now been possible to unload Capesize bulk carriers here.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In terms of handling, this year we hope to break the 3 million tonne mark," said Schrell.</seg>
<seg id="18">Alongside the local Eon power plant, the imported coals also go to power plants inland.</seg>
<seg id="19">When the GDF-Suez plant is added to the network, around 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="20">The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second transport belt could see this rise to 10 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">Defiant: Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim at a rally earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has been forced to cancel a visit to Sydney next week because of what his party calls continuing attempts to persecute and silence him in Kuala Lumpur.</seg>
<seg id="5">The visit that included appearances at two forums and a debate on Islam had been organised for three weeks after Malaysian students in Australia were threatened not to attend an event where was speaking at the Festival of Ideas in Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tian Chua, vice-president of Mr Anwar's People's Justice Party, told Fairfax Media the trip had to be cancelled because Mr Anwar has been ordered to attend a hearing in Malaysia's Federal Court relating to an appeal against his acquittal on a sodomy charge.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Tian said lawyers for Mr Anwar tried to have the court appearance changed to another date but judges insisted it go ahead on November 7, the day he was scheduled to be in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Tian said he could not say the court set the date to block Mr Anwar travelling to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="9">But he said Mr Anwar had been acquitted of the charge in Malaysia's High Court on January 9 last year and the appeal is ""part of a campaign of persecution to reduce his effectiveness to challenge the government"."</seg>
<seg id="10">""Anwar is very disappointed he had to cancel the trip to Sydney,"" he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Anwar received a standing ovation in Adelaide after appearing in conversation with ABC broadcaster Waleed Aly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier a student adviser at the Malaysian consulate in Sydney had warned that ""stern action"" would be taken against students on Malaysian scholarships who attended the event.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Anwar later criticised the Abbott government for failing to speak out about the threats, which some students ignored.</seg>
<seg id="14">William de Cruz, speaking for Bersih Sydney, a group that advocates clean and fair elections in Malaysia, said ""we were fully expecting standing room only at two forums we had been working on, one specifically for Malaysian students and the other for the wider public"."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Anwar was also scheduled to speak at a IQ2 debate that would have been broadcast nationally by the ABC.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger over Bali bomb plotter's sentence</seg>
<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">"He should be put in front of the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and "died" three times while on life support.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.</seg>
<seg id="18">To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it's not much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He didn't give himself up," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek may yet appeal his sentence.</seg>

<seg id="2">Higher taxes on the sale of multimillion pound homes in London - many of which are bought by wealthy foreign investors - are being considered by George Osborne ahead of next month's Autumn Statement.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Chancellor is examining the capital's buoyant property market - where prices continue to soar far ahead of the rest of the country - as a potential source of extra revenue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last year's rise to seven per cent in stamp rate duties on the sale of houses worth more than £2m has made no difference to the booming trade in luxury properties.</seg>
<seg id="5">Coalition ministers believe the sector could withstand the imposition of higher taxes - a move advocated by the Liberal Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="6">One possibility is a further rise in stamp duty rates on the most expensive houses, it is understood.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another is introducing capital gains tax on foreign buyers of the British properties, who are currently exempt from the tax.</seg>
<seg id="8">Treasury sources stressed reports of extra tax demands on the purchasers of high-end property was speculation and no decisions had been taken by Mr Osborne.</seg>
<seg id="9">He faces the challenge of finding more than £1bn and the move on multimillion pound properties is attractive to ministers as it would be politically uncontentious.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arsenal v Liverpool: Aly Cissokho issues rallying cry that victory at the Emirates will signal the Reds are top-four contenders</seg>
<seg id="2">Defender Aly Cissokho believes Liverpool can prove they are long-term top-four contenders with victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite the Reds sitting third - where they are two points off the top having lost just once in the league and possessing two in-form strikers in Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez - doubts remain over their ability to sustain a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Valencia loanee Cissokho insists the Merseysiders have enough experience and quality in their ranks to see it through to the end of the season and secure a return to the Champions League for the first time since the 2009-10 season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I think if we could get the three points against Arsenal it would send a strong message to the other teams in the competition," said the Frenchman.</seg>
<seg id="6">We'll take it one match at a time but we have started well and we are near the top of the league, although there will be difficult matches.</seg>
<seg id="7">""The tough ones can be against the lower teams in the league, where you might think of having a more relaxed outing.</seg>
<seg id="8">But if you're setting out to qualify for the Champions League through a domestic league like the Premier League you really have to concentrate and remain serious for each match, whether it's against a team from the lower end of the table or one right at the top.</seg>
<seg id="9">""We're only a couple of weeks ahead of the international break, so it would be good to take the three points at Arsenal, and look forward to the next home match and try to stay at the top of the table during the break.""</seg>
<seg id="10">Cissokho believes the Reds have a core of players who will lead them through some of the more testing times.</seg>
<seg id="11">""We have players in the squad like Kolo Toure, Steven Gerrard, Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel, who have plenty of experience and who have started in some big European matches as well," he told LFC TV."</seg>
<seg id="12">""We are at one of the biggest clubs in the world and they motivate everyone.""</seg>
<seg id="13">Playmaker Philippe Coutinho returns to the squad for the match at the Emirates having been out of action for more than six weeks after a shoulder operation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manager Brendan Rodgers is arguably selecting from his strongest squad of the season with only defender Jose Enrique, whose knee problem continues to be managed, and forward Iago Aspas (thigh) missing.</seg>
<seg id="15">The centre of defence and central midfield are the two areas of main competition with vice-captain Daniel Agger unable to regain his place in a three-man backline after injury with the same applying to midfielder Joe Allen, a £15million signing in the summer of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodgers insists that is good for the club, even if it does mean he has to devote more time to assuring those players not in the team they remain integral to his plans.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some of those fringe players featured in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Wrexham in midweek and Rodgers insists he is not concerned by rumours - dismissed by the player - suggesting Agger could be looking for a way out.</seg>
<seg id="18">""I talk with the players with individuals and as a group," said Rodgers."</seg>
<seg id="19">""These players, players like Daniel Agger, Joe Allen, Luis Alberto, Raheem (Sterling), are working tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="20">The biggest thing is identifying - and for them to recognise that you're aware of - how hard they're working and how difficult it is.</seg>
<seg id="21">""It's something that's part of my management.</seg>
<seg id="22">Every player here for me is very important.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's also part of being a professional.</seg>
<seg id="24">Football is unique.</seg>
<seg id="25">Everyone talks about football being a business but I don't know any other business where you have 25 in an office but you can only pick 11 once or twice a week.</seg>
<seg id="26">""But that's my job, that's my problem and I manage it the best I possibly I can.</seg>
<seg id="27">You look at some of the other squads around and you have to have players fighting so that they know when they play, they have to be at their best.</seg>
<seg id="28">""That's something we're developing here.</seg>
<seg id="29">We've got a long way to go to get to that level, but it's certainly something that's improving all the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Daniel is one that understands fully the situation and I've reassured him.</seg>
<seg id="31">""It's going to be the whole squad that allows us to succeed and he's a player that respects the decision.</seg>
<seg id="32">He's fighting and waiting for that moment, and when he does get back in he'll be in there to fight to keep his place.</seg>

<seg id="2">At least 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of the year, in the Evangelical Parish of Bisingen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The theme of the day in the parish hall was "Sayings from the Bible" and "Expressions from the Middle Ages".</seg>
<seg id="4">Zita Köhler, the Chairperson of the Parish Council, agreed to give a talk on Biblical proverbs after breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Proverbs contain pearls of wisdom, commandments or warnings," she explained.</seg>
<seg id="6">She compared several German sayings with the corresponding Bible verses and explained the meaning.</seg>
<seg id="7">She referred to sayings such as: "Holzauge sei wachsam" (keep your eyes peeled), "wie Schuppen von den Augen fallen" (like scales falling from one's eyes), "ein Auge auf jemand werfen" (to cast an eye on someone), "den Seinen gibt's der Herr im Schlaf" (good things come to some when they sleep) and "seine Hände in Unschuld waschen" (to wash one's hands of something).</seg>
<seg id="8">On several occasions, the speaker asked those listening to guess what proverb they were based on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Expressions from the Middle Ages were addressed by Parish Councillor Christel Dehner: "Aller guten Dinge sind drei" (All good things come in threes), "blau machen" (to skip school/work), "etwas verhauen" (to wallop something).</seg>
<seg id="10">She explained the meaning and origin of the expressions, which she referred to as "bridges to the past".</seg>
<seg id="11">To round off the morning there was a tombola.</seg>
<seg id="12">The prizes were placed, covered, on a table and were humorously paraphrased prior to being presented to the winners.</seg>

<seg id="6">ST KILDA made history last night.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unfortunately their season has now been consigned to the same status.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Saints broke new ground as the first team to host an international premiership match, and they used the occasion to display heart and determination in short supply at times this year.</seg>
<seg id="9">First they beat the AFL's in-and under specialists at their own game early on, then they kick-started a last term comeback that captivated the crowd of 22,546 Wellington fans.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet by the end of a night in which Sydney just did what they do best - stop an opponent in their tracks, surge, and stifle a late charge - the Saints were still 1-4 and out of the finals race.</seg>
<seg id="11">This was not quite the game to showcase everything that is glorious about the AFL, with the game at times more rugby than the aerial pinpong non-converts have accused it of resembling.</seg>
<seg id="12">Still, with Wellington abuzz to the sounds of the AFL for a week and Westpac Stadium two-thirds full last night, it was a mighty promising start.</seg>
<seg id="13">'Proud' Watters lauds beaten Saints</seg>
<seg id="14">For the first and last quarters St Kilda showed everything coach Scott Watters had demanded, out Sydney-ing Sydney through the efforts of Nick Riewoldt (27 touches) and Lenny Hayes (eight tackles, 11 clearances).</seg>
<seg id="15">Sydney's Jarrad McVeigh and St. Kilda's Clinton Jones go in hard.</seg>
<seg id="16">Picture: Hillyard Philip Source: The Daily Telegraph</seg>
<seg id="17">Then just as Sydney and Anzac Medallist Dan Hannebery seemed certain to lock down the game as they have so often at their SCG fortress, the Saints came alive again.</seg>
<seg id="18">From 26 points down at the last break, the kids finally began matching the work ethic of the older brigade.</seg>
<seg id="19">By the time Leigh Montagna's silky goal from deep in the pocket had reduced the margin to ten points, the Westpac Stadium crowd was rocking for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jon Ralph - 'Cake tin' serves up soggy dish</seg>
<seg id="21">Shane Mumford's goal in time on iced the contest for Sydney, but given the fleet of kids the Saints carried in their line-up there was no disgrace in the loss.Not only did the Saints fight to the end, they did it with a side including first-gamers Brodie Murdoch and Josh Saunders, as well as Tom Lee (one game), Seb Ross (two) and Nathan Wright (two) all playing last night.</seg>
<seg id="22">All of them showed glimpses at times, and while Riewoldt (31), Hayes (33) and Montagna (29) clearly the club's best three players, it seems St Kilda supporters are prepared to come along for what could be a rocky ride.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sydney's Adam Goodes fends off St. Kilda's Nathan Wright.</seg>
<seg id="24">The good news was those elder statesman led from the front all night, Riewoldt running himself to exhaustion and inspiring fellow veterans in Sam Gilbert into some rousing first-half action.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sydney just absorbed St Kilda's best blows, then got on with the job of rebounding from that humbling loss to Geelong last week.The old stagers took time to warm to the contest, but soon midfield stars Josh Kennedy, Dan Hannebury and Jarrad McVeigh were dominating the clinches.</seg>
<seg id="26">Luke Parker belied the slippery conditions to kick two critical goals in a low-scoring match, and Kieren Jack's 13 tackles showcased his rugby childhood.</seg>
<seg id="27">St Kilda had the first five inside 50s and all the momentum, and could so easily have led by three goals in an inkling.</seg>
<seg id="28">Yet an interchange infraction to Ahmed Saad gifted Josh Kennedy a long-rang goal and then Jarryn Geary's long bomb seemed to have crossed the goal line before video reviews from a shocking TV angle handed Ted Richards the mark.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sydney's Mike Pyke crunches Justin Koschitzke after taking strong mark.</seg>
<seg id="30">Yet with such inexperience in this St Kilda side - and Sydney containing so many flint-hard matchwinners, the Swans inevitably too control.</seg>
<seg id="31">They would pile on the pressure - and 28 of the next 41 inside 50s - through a combination of brilliance, luck and St Kilda mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Ben McGlynn was gifted a goal-line goal when Gilbert could not force the ball through, a controversial push-in-the-back call on Tony Armstrong won Kieren Jack another, and the brilliant veteran Jude Bolton capped off another sure-handed display with a third.</seg>
<seg id="33">From the main break, with St Kilda ten points down and battling, it looked like getting ugly.But St Kilda's rousing finish ensured that even if they remain locked on only win, nearly everyone went home happy last night.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the last weekend in August, the Vogtsbauernhof Black Forest Open Air Museum in Gutach near Hornberg will once again be firmly in the hands of children.</seg>
<seg id="2">Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on a Saturday and Sunday, this year on on 24 and 25 August, to a colourful party for children and families as part of the summer holiday programme, with numerous participation activities and events.</seg>
<seg id="3">"On both days, adults and children alike can learn various traditional handicrafts," said the press release.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether producing soap, turning candles, felting or making silk, there is a suitable activity whatever your age.</seg>
<seg id="5">The children will receive help from regional artisans, present from 11.00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="6">Activities will also be taking place in the museum workshop.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young guests will be able to demonstrate their manual skills building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or spinning tops.</seg>
<seg id="8">The host of old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or walking on stilts, promises plenty of fun.</seg>
<seg id="9">Here speed and coordination are the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="10">For any miniature detectives, the open air museum will be offering a mystery tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at midday and 2.00 p.m. respectively.</seg>
<seg id="11">On a tour of the premises, the children will have to work out which stories are true and which have been made up.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, visitors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open air museum on a carriage journey drawn by Black Forest Chestnut horses.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not just horses that can be found and admired on the grounds, but many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the Sunday the children will also be able to enjoy the clown, Otsch, who will be doing pranks with the museum guests from 11.00 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, a cosy and magical alternative will be provided by Hermann Büttner.</seg>
<seg id="16">The story-teller will be taking the younger guests to the wonderful world of fairytale at 11.00 a.m., 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="17">The traditional children's dance group from Gutach will also be performing at 11:30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furthermore, on both event days, from 11.00 a.m. until 5.00 p.m., numerous artisans such as the broom maker, the sewer, the spinner, the weaver and the baker will be letting visitors look over their shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, visitors to the open air museum can expect a varied holiday programme right through to the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Wuerttemberg.</seg>

<seg id="1">I should cocoa: Chefs are giving chocolate a starring role in savoury dishes</seg>
<seg id="2">Yet, as well as tangling the tastebuds, it was one of the most beautifully sensory flavour experiences I've ever enjoyed and most definitely not a cheffy gimmick.</seg>
<seg id="3">The salt and sweet, the silk and crunch was definite proof that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most people's first experience of chocolate in a savoury dish is chilli-rich Mexican mole, traditionally served with turkey, and consisting of up to 30 ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomasina Miers, co-founder of the 11-strong Wahaca chain, recalls the first she ever tasted as being "disgusting," but stresses that "a good mole is like nectar of the gods, with the chocolate balancing the heat of the chillies, the earthy notes of spices and sweetness of dried fruit."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem is successfully executed savoury chocolate dishes, and poorly conceived ones are as different as choc and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="7">But plenty of chefs manage the former.</seg>
<seg id="8">As of 14 November, the savoury chocolate floodgates will well and truly open when Hotel Chocolat's Rabot 1745, a "cocoa-centric" restaurant and bar in London's Borough Market, will let diners sample the cocoa cuisine of its sibling, the Boucan Restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="9">That was launched in 2011 in a 140-acre cocoa plantation in Saint Lucia, bought by company founders Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris, and featuring on-site cocoa-bean roasting and small-batch chocolate making.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sample dishes include fish tartare with cacao pulp and shaved horseradish on fennel, cucumber and nibs (roasted cacao beans); cacao-glazed pork belly; red mullet fillet with a chocolate and mustard condiment; scallops with white chocolate, horseradish dressing and curried nib oil; brill with cacao tortellini and a port and nib sauce; or breast of guinea fowl marinated in roasted cacao with nib-infused sheep's milk yoghurt.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Because we're doing our own couverture [very high quality chocolate], we can offer a 'bean-to-plate' experience," says Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">We are offering a cocoa, rather than a chocolate, menu.</seg>
<seg id="13">Cocoa beans are very like grapes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their flavour is influenced hugely by terroir and climate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But we are 200 years behind the wine business, and need to catch up by reconnecting cocoa agriculture with chocolate luxury.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is so much of the plant you can use, to make everything from cocktails and sorbets to an emulsion for fish tartare.</seg>
<seg id="17">Our nibs are freshly roasted for taste and aroma.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most people have only tried the commercially available type, which taste like the bottom of a hamster's cage.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We don't waste anything," says Jon Bentham, Hotel Chocolat's executive chef.</seg>
<seg id="20">We even smoke meat and fish over burning cocoa-bean shells, fry chips in cocoa butter and make cacao gin using botanicals from Saint Lucia, such as macadamias and coriander, as well as the traditional juniper berries.</seg>
<seg id="21">Trevor Hambley, head chef at The Gallivant, in Camber, East Sussex, makes a goats' cheese and chocolate croquette.</seg>
<seg id="22">Martin Deadman, owner and chef of The Bull, in Wrotham, Kent, serves venison with blackcurrant and chocolate sauce: "We age our venison for three weeks, so the stronger flavour marries well with other strong flavours.</seg>
<seg id="23">The sauce we use is a game jus flavoured with blackcurrants and 70 per cent dark chocolate.</seg>
<seg id="24">In his Adventures with Chocolate (Kyle Cathie), chocolatier Paul A. Young includes recipes for a honey-cured bacon, Stilton and chocolate sandwich, Jerusalem artichoke velouté with chocolate pecorino wafers, Marmite ganache, chocolate vinegar, a chocolate sauce for fish and a dark chocolate and chilli gnocchi with mascarpone and pecorino.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Chocolate in savoury dishes has moved on from venison swimming in overly rich dark chocolate sauce," he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">Confidence has risen, meaning new recipes and techniques are springing up.</seg>
<seg id="27">I love roasting belly pork over cocoa beans, so the pork fat confits the beans and they become as crunchy as the crackling.</seg>
<seg id="28">I also use 100 per cent cocoa solids as a seasoning on everything.</seg>
<seg id="29">Cherish Finden, executive chef of the Langham London, features a cauliflower and white chocolate mousse as part of her chocolate afternoon tea, while Eric Snaith, head chef at Titchwell Manor, in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, makes a white chocolate and cauliflower pannacotta.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sophie Michell, executive chef of Pont St, in London's Belgraves hotel, is planning a foie gras, white chocolate and cognac terrine with fig chutney, and white chocolate and miso-glazed halibut with wild herb and radish salad for her 2014 Valentine's Day menu.</seg>
<seg id="31">Daniel Galmiche, executive chef at The Vineyard, near Newbury, Berkshire, says: "I use it in savoury dishes in autumn and winter, such as venison with parsnip puree, salsify and a jus infused with clove and 70 per cent Venezuelan chocolate - very fresh, with an acidity bringing a lovely accent to the sauce."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Chocolate can be a great ingredient in savoury food, in particular with dark red meat, hare and duck, but must be used with a balanced hand and sensitivity," says Jacob Kenedy, chef and co-owner of London's Bocca di Lupo and Gelupo, who serves duck in chocolate and marsala.</seg>
<seg id="33">Together with acid flavours, such as vinegar or tomato, and/or hot or aromatic spices, it can be revelatory.</seg>
<seg id="34">Too many sweet notes and it's as if someone has melted a Mars bar over your main course.</seg>
<seg id="35">To find a dissenting voice, we must turn to Rowley Leigh, chef/proprietor of London's Le Café Anglais, who says: "I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a revolting notion, but it is one I have little sympathy with.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the old hotel kitchens, when they made a demi-glace, a lot of the old boys had a secret of slipping a tiny bit of couverture into the pan.</seg>
<seg id="37">But you must use it sparingly.</seg>
<seg id="38">I once had a scallop, white truffle and white chocolate risotto, one of a rather famous chef's signature dishes, which was utterly disgusting.</seg>
<seg id="39">The problem with a lot of today's chefs is they think: 'Cauliflower is white, panna cotta is white so I can use white chocolate.</seg>
<seg id="40">I've got it!</seg>
<seg id="41">I've solved the secret of the culinary universe.'</seg>
<seg id="42">It shows nothing but a paucity of imagination.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the fascination continues, with Claudio Cardoso, executive chef at SushiSamba, who serves salmon anticucho with orange and dark chocolate, affirming: "The dark chocolate complements the savoury flavours of the salmon and the natural sweetness of the orange, creating a new and memorable ingredient profile."</seg>
<seg id="44">Echoing his enthusiasm is Larry Jayasekara, executive chef at The Manor at Weston-on-the-Green, Oxfordshire: "Game is a really strongly flavoured protein, which I mellow using bitter chocolate in the sauce, as in roast grouse with a bitter chocolate salt crust."</seg>
<seg id="45">Barry Macmillan, head chef of London's New Street Grill, says: "I first used chocolate in chilli to take away some of its excessive heat.</seg>
<seg id="46">Now I use 55 per cent Valrhona instead of butter to enrich a sauce for venison.</seg>

<seg id="2">Indonesia's accusations unsettling: Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Marty Natalegawa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Suggestions that Australian intelligence services had spied on Indonesian politicians were "not cricket" and Jakarta wanted an explanation, Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Marty Natalegawa said in Perth on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, the Indonesian government demanded clarification of any suggestion Australia's embassy in Jakarta was used to tap into the phone conversations of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono or other high-ranking officials.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australia's ambassador to Jakarta, Greg Moriarty, was summoned to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry to explain.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fairfax Media this week revealed Australian embassies, including in Jakarta, and high commissions across Asia were being used to secretly intercept phone calls and data as part of a US-led global spying network.</seg>
<seg id="7">Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop, who was also in Perth hosting a regional meeting attended by her Indonesian counterpart, confirmed that Dr Natalegawa had raised his concerns with her and that she was taking them seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">But some Asian diplomats in Canberra privately expressed concerns that Australia might be spying on their governments at the request of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This is not the mark of a good friend or a leader in this region," said one high-ranking diplomat who asked not to be named.</seg>
<seg id="10">Australia should be above that.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another Asian diplomat in Canberra warned that Australia would be "treated with a degree of suspicion" if it was found to be spying on its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="12">Another senior diplomat said the issue, if not resolved quickly, could "strain relations" between Australia and other nations in the Asia-Pacific region.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry says US spying has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedented admission</seg>
<seg id="2">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has "reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."</seg>
<seg id="6">He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="8">And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: "We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."</seg>
<seg id="12">There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said the itinerary is still being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some "tough love" will also be dispensed.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying," Murphy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Would-be pot producers run into obstacles in Washington state</seg>
<seg id="2">SEATTLE - When Washington state voters legalized recreational marijuana a year ago, Jeff Stewart saw an opportunity: After all, he figured, it's the rare industry that's born overnight with proven demand and little competition.</seg>
<seg id="3">But then the 37-year-old tech worker tried to find a warehouse where he could grow about 10,000 square feet of pot plants.</seg>
<seg id="4">What he found was that some cities in the Evergreen State had imposed moratoriums to keep out recreational pot while the foundation is being laid for the new industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">Others have banned marijuana outright, although "dry" regions are prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="6">The result?</seg>
<seg id="7">A lawsuit in the making, one that could pit local control against sweeping social change.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lesson No.</seg>
<seg id="9">1 for prospective pot entrepreneurs like Stewart: it is not enough to get a license from the Washington State Liquor Control Board, in itself an arduous process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Washington is one of only two states that legalized recreational marijuana last year with ballot measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the state cobbles together its new marketplace, there is a scramble to take advantage of a chance to produce, process and sell the previously prohibited substance.</seg>
<seg id="12">But some are running into obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="13">After four months of searching, Stewart and his partners have a line on a landlord who may be willing to rent in a city that will allow recreational pot production.</seg>
<seg id="14">He will not give the location, because he does not want others to poach the prospective property.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has yet to sign a lease, and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="16">The one-month window for state marijuana business license applications begins Nov.</seg>
<seg id="17">At least a tentative address is required.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We talked to 15 cities," Stewart said.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Six had moratoriums" to keep recreational pot out of their boundaries for six to eight months - long after the first state application period ends.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows when a possible second application period might occur.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Woodinville was a flat 'No,'" Stewart said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Located in the heart of the Seattle-area wine country, Woodinville is familiar with mood-altering substances.</seg>
<seg id="23">Its nearly 100 wineries - and nearby breweries and distilleries - draw about 300,000 visitors a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">But all of that liquid relaxation does not mean the smokable sort is welcome along the Sammamish River.</seg>
<seg id="25">In February 2012, the City Council voted to ban collective gardens and dispensaries for medical marijuana, which has been legal statewide since 1998.</seg>
<seg id="26">City officials say every precinct in the affluent town of about 11,000 people voted in favor of Initiative 502, which legalized party pot in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">But in early October, the Woodinville council ordered the city attorney to draft an ordinance prohibiting recreational marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="28">The measure will be considered at an upcoming meeting.</seg>
<seg id="29">The council's heated discussion encompassed "the message to our youth," the effects of marijuana on the brain, the benefits of pot tourism and the need to create a "walkable city" so inebriates of any stripe stay out of their cars.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We're only five square miles in Woodinville," said Deputy Mayor Liz Aspen during the Oct.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 meeting.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm not sure why we would need an outlet for any kind of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="33">I'm happy to let them go to Redmond or Kirkland or Bothell to get their fix.</seg>
<seg id="34">The same night Woodinville officials were debating the merits of a recreational pot ban, the Liquor Control Board was holding a hearing on rules to regulate the marijuana market, which is expected to kick off early next year.</seg>
<seg id="35">All pot operations must be licensed and at least 1,000 feet from schools, child-care centers, libraries and parks.</seg>
<seg id="36">Pot must be sold in child-proof containers and tested for strength and purity.</seg>
<seg id="37">The board will license 334 retail outlets, apportioned by population and geography.</seg>
<seg id="38">Woodinville was not selected as a retail site, but someone could still apply for an "at large" license there or seek permission to grow or process pot in the city's industrial zones.</seg>
<seg id="39">Stewart, who lives in North Seattle, was one of several who complained during the long and angry meeting, only to be told that local government hurdles were prohibited under I-502.</seg>
<seg id="40">The circular discussion seemed to appease no one.</seg>

<seg id="7">Regarding the subject of traffic, which was not on the agenda for this Friday, the SPD substantiated its opposition to a car toll charge promoted by the CSU.</seg>
<seg id="8">A toll road sticker would amount to a "flat rate fee for frequent drivers and would thus be environmentally counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for issues relating to traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his parliamentary group.</seg>
<seg id="9">There would be a threat of diverted traffic on country roads, which are already accident hotspots.</seg>
<seg id="10">The introduction of a toll for cars would also only be a first step, in Pronold's eyes.</seg>
<seg id="11">"There is the risk that the compensation for Germans would be abolished at a later point in time," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Glasgow praised for its Commonwealth Games readiness</seg>
<seg id="2">The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has praised Glasgow 2014 organisers for demonstrating "a clear understanding of all aspects of Games delivery."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federation has been in Glasgow for a week to assess its preparations for hosting the event next summer.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We see an increasingly integrated effort with a total focus on delivering the best Commonwealth Games ever," said Bruce Robertson of the CGF.</seg>
<seg id="5">Glasgow 2014 chief executive David Grevemberg welcomed the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">Responding to the favourable findings of the CGF's Coordination Commission (CoCom), he said: "There's still a lot of work to be done and no sense of complacency on our part.</seg>
<seg id="7">We remain very focused, up for the challenge and we look forward to sharing the final stage of a journey towards delivering an outstanding Games of which the CGF, Scotland and Glasgow can be proud.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are getting ready to welcome the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">This visit was the Coordination Commission's fifth meeting in Glasgow to check on progress ahead of the Games that will run from 23 July to 3 August.</seg>
<seg id="10">In particular, it focused on reviews of transport, security, control and communications, capital works on venues, branding and operations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our focus with the organising committee, Glasgow City Council and Scottish Government is now to put the icing on the cake</seg>
<seg id="12">Mike Hooper Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive</seg>
<seg id="13">It heard reports from the organising committee, Glasgow City Council, Police Scotland and the Scottish Government and described the partnership between those bodies as "excellent."</seg>
<seg id="14">Robertson, Coordination Commission chairman said Games organisers had shown "a clear understanding of all aspects of Games delivery, with detailed plans to meet the needs of athletes, spectators, volunteers and other stakeholder groups."</seg>
<seg id="15">He added: "Based on our reviews and the comprehensive information provided we are very impressed with progress made since our last Coordination Commission review in earlier in April this year.</seg>
<seg id="16">With the Games now just eight months away, the excitement in Glasgow and across the Commonwealth is building.</seg>
<seg id="17">The launch of the Queen's Baton Relay has been extremely well received and today the baton is in the Gold Coast - our next Games host in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="18">When the baton returns to Scotland on 14 June we know it will start a wave of community celebration, and will reinforce the image of Scotland all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The response from the Scottish people to the opportunity of carrying the baton, buying tickets and volunteering has been outstanding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Already we know, based on this public response and the response of the corporate community, with 33 commercial partnerships now concluded, that the Games are going to be an outstanding success.</seg>
<seg id="21">CGF chief executive Mike Hooper acknowledged that Glasgow still had "much to do" in time for the athletes' village opening in mid-July but said that "none of this is unexpected and plans exist to achieve everything needed and to do so in a fiscally responsible manner."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Our focus with the organising committee, Glasgow City Council and Scottish Government is now to put the icing on the cake," said Hooper.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Games promise to be a unique Glaswegian and Scottish experience.</seg>
<seg id="24">These Games will enhance the brand of the Commonwealth Games, and feedback from our discussions with our top athletes in the Commonwealth reinforce that these will be very, very special Games.</seg>

<seg id="1">UK to fly 45 delegates to climate conference despite no deal being expected</seg>
<seg id="2">The Government shelled out £280,000 to send 46 representatives to last year's conference in Doha, Qatar, with £49,000 spent on flights, £126,000 on hotels and £103,000 on "other expenses."</seg>

<seg id="4">Discussions in Warsaw will focus on ensuring developed countries deliver on a previous pledge to spend $100 billion (£62 billion) a year by 2020 helping poor countries adapt to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking to The Times, a Whitehall official said: "This is not going to be a big breakthrough CoP."</seg>
<seg id="6">We are in a process leading up to the CoP in Paris in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is just another step.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said there would be discussions "about how to crystallise real action next year or going forward."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are also concerns over the host Poland's commitment to the deal due to its high reliance on coal-fired power, which produces 90 per cent of its electricity, and its opposition to a European Union plan to establish stricter limits on carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="10">Poland's lignite-burning plant in Belchatów has the highest emissions of any power station in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Germany to seek details from Snowden about NSA spying</seg>
<seg id="2">BERLIN Germany's top security official said Friday he will try and find a way for Edward Snowden to speak to German officials if the former National Security Agency contractor is willing to provide details about the NSA's activities including the alleged surveillance of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone.</seg>
<seg id="3">The comments by Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich came after a German opposition lawmaker traveled to Moscow and met NSA leaker Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawmaker, Hans-Christian Stroebele, returned to Berlin with a letter he said Snowden had written, which he released Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">NSA director: European allies shared phone records</seg>
<seg id="6">Chorus of foreign protest over NSA spying grows louder</seg>
<seg id="7">In the letter Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the U.S., indicated that he will not speak with German officials until the United States stops its prosecution of leakers like him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalize political speech with felony charges that provide no defense. ...</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behavior," Snowden wrote in the letter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved, and thank you for your efforts in upholding the international laws that protect us all," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stroebele is a prominent critic of the NSA's alleged activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The release of the letter came after Friedrich said that "if the message is that Mr. Snowden wants to give us information, then we will be glad to accept that."</seg>
<seg id="13">"We will find a way to make a conversation possible if Mr. Snowden is prepared to talk to German officials," Friedrich said, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.</seg>
<seg id="14">Friedrich's spokesman Jens Teschke confirmed the comments, saying "we want clarification and we want further information."</seg>
<seg id="15">He added, however, that he understood Friedrich to be referring primarily to the possibility of officials speaking to Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="16">Germany is seeking answers from U.S. authorities to allegations Merkel's cellphone was monitored, which prompted the German chancellor to complain to Obama last week.</seg>
<seg id="17">Merkel's foreign policy adviser and intelligence coordinator held talks on the issue in Washington on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="18">Germany's government, along with many others, rejected an asylum request from Snowden earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Teschke said Friday that, if Snowden now wanted asylum in Germany, he would have to come to the country and then apply for it -- but noted that Germany has an extradition treaty with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">German federal prosecutors are looking into whether there are grounds to investigate the allegations regarding Merkel's cellphone, but it is unclear when they might decide.</seg>
<seg id="21">Germany's parliament is expected to discuss the NSA's alleged activities Nov.</seg>
<seg id="22">18 and lawmakers may decide to set up a commission of inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thomas Oppermann, a lawmaker who heads a parliamentary panel that oversees German intelligence, said on Twitter that if there's an opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness without endangering him and without "completely ruining" German-U.S. relations, it should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="24">Oppermann is a member of the center-left Social Democrats, who are negotiating with Merkel's conservatives to form a new German government after September elections.</seg>
<seg id="25">Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after being stuck at a Moscow airport for more than a month following his arrival there from Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="26">The 30-year-old faces espionage charges in the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="27">Text of letter from Edward Snowden</seg>
<seg id="28">To whom it may concern:</seg>
<seg id="29">I have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="30">I am Edward Joseph Snowden, formerly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the United States National Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, and Defense Intelligence Agency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the course of my service to these organizations, I believe I witnessed systemic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result of reporting these concerns, I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution that forced me from my family and home.</seg>
<seg id="33">I am currently living in exile under a grant of temporary asylum in the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.</seg>
<seg id="34">I am heartened by the response to my act of political expression, in both the United States and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="35">Citizens around the world as well as high officials -- including in the United States -- have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
<seg id="36">These spying revelations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust.</seg>
<seg id="37">The benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time claimed risks are being shown to have been mitigated.</seg>
<seg id="38">Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalize political speech with felony charges that provide no defense.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, speaking truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="40">I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behavior.</seg>
<seg id="41">I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact regarding reports in the media, particularly in regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law.</seg>
<seg id="42">I look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved, and thank you for your efforts in upholding the international laws that protect us all.</seg>
<seg id="43">With my best regards,</seg>
<seg id="44">Edward Snowden</seg>

<seg id="8">The defender said the Hawks are happy with their first month.</seg>
<seg id="9">"To be 4-1 after five games with the draw we've had is a pretty good result," Birchall said.</seg>

<seg id="11">We just try to get the wins each week and keep on backing up leading up until the back end of the season.</seg>

<seg id="6">Police have been warned the latest outlaw motorcycle gang to move in on the Gold Coast says they would rather kill officers than be arrested and face the government's new laws.</seg>
<seg id="7">An internal notice sent to Queensland police officers warns the Mongols are stockpiling automatic weapons including M16 and AK47 guns.</seg>
<seg id="8">""A member of the Black Uhlans CMG [criminal motorcycle gang] was previously confirmed to have sought to obtain automatic firearms (M16 and AK47) on behalf of the Mongols and Finks CMG,"" the ""Officer Safety Bolo"" [Be on the Lookout] alert reads.</seg>
<seg id="9">The US-based Mongols now have a presence in Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="10">Photo: Simon Alekna</seg>
<seg id="11">""This anticipation of escalating violence is said to be a result of legislation mandating automatic custodial sentences of up to 15 years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="12">""The Mongols are said to believe killing a police officer to evade arrest is worth the risk to escape the lengthy custodial sentence.""</seg>
<seg id="13">The alert states the threats are non-specific in nature and do not target any specific officers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The warning issued to Queensland police officers.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also includes guidelines of how best to deal with outlaw criminal motorcycle gangs, including ""do not make derogatory remarks about the CMG or its members"" and ""advise the member if you intend to touch or search their colours"."</seg>
<seg id="16">Police have refused to elaborate on the intelligence, saying the ""unconfirmed information was the subject of investigation"."</seg>
<seg id="17">""All information that relates to officer safety is communicated in a timely manner,"" police said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="18">""The QPS regularly advises officers to be aware of and to take steps to ensure, their personal security at all times."</seg>
<seg id="19">""For operational reasons it would be inappropriate to comment further.""</seg>
<seg id="20">In light of the threat, the Queensland Police Union wants officers to be issued with powerful Remington R4 carbine .223 guns with scopes, shotguns and personal body armour tailored to individual officers.</seg>
<seg id="21">The weapons are available to specialist units and police in isolated areas but the high-powered guns have not been allocated in the southeast region.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commissioner Ian Stewart said he was considering the request but was cautious not to make police appear too threatening.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Southern California-based Mongols is the latest club to move in on the Gold Coast.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is understood the Mongols brokered a deal with the Finks, whereby Finks members ""patched over"" to join to a new ""mega club"."</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been reported up to 90 per cent of the Finks" members could ""patch over"" to circumvent moves by authorities to have the Finks declared a criminal organisation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fairfax Media understands a Mongols member from the France chapter, who also has ties to Germany, negotiated the club's expansion to the Gold Coast.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Mongols have existing chapters in Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney's North Shore and the New South Wales central coast.</seg>

<seg id="3">A PASSENGER jet was moments away from crashing into a "UFO" flying over Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="4">A report by Britain's Airprox Board found the Airbus, with more than 200 people on board, was less than 10 seconds from smashing into the mystery object 3500ft above the suburbs of Scotland's biggest city, British media report.</seg>
<seg id="5">But investigators have been unable to explain the unidentified threat, which did not appear on radar.</seg>
<seg id="6">The scare happened as the Airbus 320 came to land at Glasgow in sunny weather when both pilots saw an "object loom ahead at a range of 100metres."</seg>
<seg id="7">The "blue and yellow object" whizzed under the plane without giving the crew any time to react.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shocked pilot radioed Glasgow Airport control tower: "We just had something pass underneath us quite close."</seg>
<seg id="9">Have you got anything on in our area?</seg>
<seg id="10">The tower replied: "Negative."</seg>
<seg id="11">We've got nothing on radar and we're not talking to any traffic either.</seg>
<seg id="12">Both pilots gave the same description of the object which was blue and yellow, "bigger than a balloon" and with a small frontal area.</seg>
<seg id="13">After landing at Glasgow the chief pilot reported there had been a "high" risk of a collision with his jet.</seg>
<seg id="14">The pilots suggested the object may have been a glider or microlight, but investigators rejected this.</seg>

<seg id="1">Has the Loch Ness Monster left Scotland for Down Under?</seg>
<seg id="2">Nessie-like creature spotted off Australia's Magnetic Island</seg>
<seg id="3">The Loch Ness Monster has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to the world's attention in 1933.</seg>
<seg id="4">Scientists have widely written off the idea as a modern-day myth and continued sightings as set ups and wishful thinking.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet it has remained a contested phenomenon for almost 80 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">The great faker: Marmaduke Wetherell (seated) is pictured studying a chart of the Loch Ness in their search for the Loch Ness Monster.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was said to have faked the most famous picture in revenge for bad publicity</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps the most famous picture of Nessie was taken by Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London gynaecologist (pictured left).</seg>
<seg id="9">It was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934.</seg>
<seg id="10">The picture showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from Woolworths with a head and neck made of wood in an elaborate hoax by big-game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his hapless search for the beast.</seg>
<seg id="12">The earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of Loch Ness appears in the Life of St Columba by Adomnán, written in the 7th century.</seg>
<seg id="13">St Columba, an Irish monk, had sent a disciple into the loch to prove there was nothing there.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the monster rose and chased the man snapping at his heels.</seg>
<seg id="15">But it fled in terror 'as if pulled back by ropes' when St Columba made the sign of the cross and commanded: 'Go no further.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do not touch the man.</seg>
<seg id="17">Go back at once.</seg>
<seg id="18">In November 1933, Hugh Gray was the first to picture something splashing in the water.</seg>
<seg id="19">Questions: This is the sonar image that revived belief that there's something unexplained out there, taken by skipper Marcus Atkinson in February</seg>
<seg id="20">Four stumpy-looking objects on the bottom of the creature's body appeared to look like appendages, such as flippers.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was later suggested the creature was a dog, possibly holding a stick.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 1938, G. E. Taylor, a South African tourist, filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16 mm colour film.</seg>
<seg id="23">His picture was declared 'positive evidence' by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1960, aeronautical engineer Tim Dinsdale filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake.</seg>
<seg id="25">Dinsdale allegedly spotted the animal on his last day hunting for it, and described the object as reddish with a blotch on its side.</seg>
<seg id="26">In May 2007, Gordon Holmes, a 55-year-old lab technician, captured video of what he said was 'this jet black thing, about 45 feet long, moving fairly fast in the water'.</seg>
<seg id="27">The film, though, has been cast into doubt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Berisha tips off Roar for Heart clash</seg>
<seg id="2">Extrovert Brisbane Roar striker Besart Berisha still hopes to make an impact on Sunday's A-League clash with Melbourne Heart despite being sidelined with injury.</seg>
<seg id="3">Roar coach Mike Mulvey said Berisha (hamstring) had provided Kwame Yeboah tips on how to dismantle the Heart defence as the youngster prepared to fill the colourful Albanian's boots for a second week.</seg>
<seg id="4">And Mulvey believed Berisha's body language was also encouraging after speculation emerged Sydney FC had already begun circling the off-contract star.</seg>
<seg id="5">Berisha has been in Yeboah's ear ahead of the weekend clash as ladder leaders Brisbane look to recapture their goal scoring mojo following last round's 1-0 loss.</seg>
<seg id="6">The mind boggles what advice was passed on by a man who is known for his assertive approach - most notably when he challenged Sydney FC's Pascal Bosschaart to a fight in the tunnel last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Mulvey was certain Berisha's tips would only have a positive effect on Yeboah as Roar carried on with life without their superstar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bes is a character.</seg>
<seg id="9">He loves playing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course we are going to miss him," Mulvey said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's not easy to replace someone who brings so much to the game.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Bes has given him a little pep talk in terms of what to expect from defenders in the A-League.</seg>
<seg id="13">The information he gains from that will put him in good stead and also give Bes a purpose while he is out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mulvey said it that kind of behaviour that made him confident Berisha would remain in Brisbane despite Sydney FC reportedly swooping on the Albanian international.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are in negotiations with Besart and his agent.</seg>
<seg id="16">We understand that Besart is a prized asset," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He loves it here, the players and fans love him here.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I expect him to be here.</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't want to deal in hypotheticals but I do know that Besart does feel love here in Brisbane by the fans, people and players</seg>
<seg id="20">Some teams have been mentioned, that's fine.</seg>
<seg id="21">People covet quality players but it won't destabilise us.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am sure our talks with him will come to a happy conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="23">Berisha is on an injury list that only got longer on Friday after ex-Socceroo defender Shane Stefanutto (hamstring) was ruled out for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="24">Irish import Liam Miller (calf, two weeks), George Lambadaridis (knee, season) and Kofi Danning (knee, December) are also sidelined.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's a great shame, he has been inspirational," Mulvey said of Stefanutto.</seg>
<seg id="26">He came back so fired up to start the season.</seg>
<seg id="27">He has been our most consistently good player.</seg>
<seg id="28">The issue of depth is always going to be a question people will pose but I am very confident in the group here.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">But mice who had not been given the vaccine "chilled out," say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Models roam the floor of last week's Global Gaming Expo Asia in Macau, where Melco Crown Entertainment is to build a $2.3bn resort.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: AP Source: The Australian</seg>
<seg id="4">JAMES Packer's Macau casino joint venture plans to build a $US2.5 billion ($2.3bn) casino resort -- the group's third in the Chinese territory -- as it seeks to capitalise on booming gaming revenues in the region.</seg>
<seg id="5">Melco Crown Entertainment yesterday signed a $US360 million deal to gain control of the Macau Studio City project, an integrated resort project on hold since the global financial crisis and in planning for more than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company's chief executive, Lawrence Ho, said the property's theme and demographic focus would be differentiated from the company's existing Macau properties, the City of Dreams and the Altira Macau.</seg>
<seg id="7">Construction is scheduled to start early next year and it is understood the partners have no plans for an equity issue to fund the project.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We believe Macau Studio City's existing land grant and previously completed site work will allow us to significantly expedite its construction timetable," Mr Ho said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will be Melco Crown's second project on Macau's Cotai strip, a vast stretch of reclaimed land between the islands of Taipa and Coloane that casino developers in Macau, such as Mr Ho and Mr Packer, are promoting as Asia's answer to the Las Vegas strip.</seg>
<seg id="10">City of Dreams is in Cotai.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, Mr Ho said Melco Crown was prepared to build more casino resort developments in Macau and elsewhere in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Packer's Crown holds a 33.4 per cent stake in Melco Crown.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Studio City site is one of the last quality sites available in Macau for development.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is strategically located at the Lotus Bridge immigration point, making it the very first resort that tourists encounter on entering Cotai.</seg>
<seg id="15">Before the financial crash, Melco Crown had a management arrangement with Studio City's owners to run the casino at the site, but decided to take control of the project after it became difficult for the owners to properly fund it within the prior structure.</seg>
<seg id="16">Melco Crown is believed to have codenamed the deal Project Eagle.</seg>
<seg id="17">The deal ends three years of delays caused by legal disputes between the Hong Kong and US investors.</seg>
<seg id="18">Studio City was previously owned by a joint venture between Hong Kong-listed entertainment company eSun Holdings and New Cotai Holdings, an entity controlled by funds managed by US firms Silver Point Capital and Oaktree Capital Management.</seg>
<seg id="19">New Cotai Holdings will hold a 40 per cent stake.</seg>
<seg id="20">Melco Crown will pay New Cotai $US100m in three instalments over two years.</seg>
<seg id="21">Before the financial crash, the development was to have included a specially designed 4000-seat arena, a 2300-seat theatre, Asia's first Playboy Mansion and four new hotels -- a Ritz-Carlton, a W Hotel, a Marriott and the world's first Tang Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="22">Last month, Macau gaming revenues rose 42.4 per cent to a record $US3.03bn.</seg>
<seg id="23">They were boosted by the opening of Galaxy Entertainment Group's $US2bn resort development at Cotai, which is close to the City of Dreams.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We remain bullish on Macau's prospects and believe high-quality new supply, such as Macau Studio City, will continue to drive incremental demand," Mr Ho said.</seg>

<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- New York's "Topless Paparazzo" won a $40,000 settlement from the city after she was repeatedly arrested while being topless in public.</seg>
<seg id="3">Holly Van Voast filed a lawsuit against the city in May, alleging she had been wrongfully arrested or detained at least 10 times since 2011 while out in public shirtless with a painted-on mustache and a blond wig as Harvey Van Toast, the Topless Paparazzo, the New York Daily News reported Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">I can only call it abuse ...</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was punished for being a creative New Yorker, for what people think New York is," Van Voast said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The city settled with Van Voast for $40,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I think the amount is very low, considering what happened to me," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city agreed to pay Van Voast's $37,250 legal bill.</seg>
<seg id="9">The city had solid defenses in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Settlement for this amount for 10 incidents was merely a business decision," a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gina Rinehart's main company Hancock Prospecting will own 70 per cent of the Roy Hill project.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shareholders in Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill project have tipped in a further $624 million over recent months, in a bid to keep the project going until debt funding can be secured.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ms Rinehart's main company Hancock Prospecting will own 70 per cent of the project.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Roy Hill debt package is expected to include $US3 billion from commercial banks, and the organisation does much of its banking with NAB.</seg>
<seg id="6">A further $US4 is expected to be supplied by the Export Credit Agencies of nations like South Korea, the US and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">In its results, Roy Hill reiterated that securing the debt package was central to the project taking the next step.</seg>
<seg id="8">""The Group intends to continue its principal activities as set out above during the year, with any change dependent (amongst other factors) on the progress of the debt capital raising,"" the company said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debt is planned to be finalised before Christmas, and first ore is planned to be shipped before the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="10">JPMorgan recently predicted that Roy Hill would go ahead, but with a minimum six-month delay.</seg>
<seg id="11">""In our view, a debt package of that order of magnitude may be difficult to secure without a further potential sell-down of the project,"" it said in a research note.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy Hill will be a hive of activity over the next two months, with a number of important developments taking place.</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt swears in first freely elected president</seg>
<seg id="2">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre," his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.</seg>
<seg id="14">Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was greeted with chants of, "The army and the people are one hand," from the hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture room.</seg>
<seg id="16">Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="2">World</seg>
<seg id="3">November 1, 2013 - 10:59AM</seg>
<seg id="4">Munich: German Green Party lawmaker Hans-Christian Stroebele met Edward Snowden in Moscow on Thursday to discuss the possibility of the US fugitive testifying in Germany as new revelations of spying by the National Security Agency strained relations between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Snowden handed Mr Stroebele a letter to the German government, the parliament and the federal attorney general, details of which the lawmaker will reveal at a press conference in Berlin on Friday, Mr Stroebele said on his website.</seg>
<seg id="6">The NSA leaker indicated his willingness in principle to help the German probe, he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">The visit took place a day after Chancellor Angela Merkel dispatched a team to the White House to seek a new intelligence pact with the US following leaks that her mobile phone may have been tapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Stroebele travelled with two German reporters for the three-hour meeting, in which he proposed the possibility of safe passage to Berlin as well as the possibility of Snowden testifying in Moscow, broadcaster ARD reported.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He clearly indicated that he knows very much, and that he's prepared to travel to Germany to testify as long as the NSA and its head, Keith Alexander, block clarification," Mr Stroebele said on ARD television.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the circumstances must be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms Merkel's top foreign-policy adviser, Christoph Heusgen, and her intelligence coordinator, Guenter Heiss, met with US officials including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and National Security Adviser Susan Rice to try to "rebuild trust," the chancellery said on October 30.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sides failed to resolve their differences as the US defended its intelligence-gathering as similar to practices applied by other countries.</seg>

<seg id="2">Canberra are set to offer an incredible $1 million a season to stop teenage star Anthony Milford joining the Brisbane Broncos.</seg>
<seg id="3">CANBERRA are set to make a staggering $1 million a season bid to prevent rising teenage superstar Anthony Milford joining the Brisbane Broncos.</seg>
<seg id="4">The deal will skyrocket the talented Milford into the game's top earning bracket, putting him alongside the likes of Cameron Smith, Greg Inglis and Johnathan Thurston.</seg>
<seg id="5">The deal is being put together as a last-minute pitch to keep him at the club.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many insiders already believe Milford has signed with Brisbane for 2015 and is still a strong possibility of linking with the club next season.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, incoming Raiders coach Ricky Stuart understands Milford's importance to the club's future and hatched the audacious plan to keep him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Anthony Milford for the Raiders.</seg>
<seg id="9">Picture: Gregg Porteous</seg>
<seg id="10">"If the Broncos want to play these games I just hope they are offering the same money that we have got for him," ­Stuart said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully he'll go on the cap for the same amount of money we're offering him.</seg>
<seg id="12">The offer will make Milford, 19, the first $1 million a season player in the Raiders" history.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was the Raiders" player of the year in his rookie season and is desperately trying to get out of the final season of his Canberra deal to join the Broncos next year.</seg>
<seg id="14">He and manager Sam Ayoub have put off negotiations until Milford returns from the Rugby League World Cup, where he is playing for Samoa.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yet Stuart has refused to give up on him, confirming the Raiders are preparing to table the massive offer to take the rising star through to the end of the 2017 season.</seg>
<seg id="16">Yet there is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="17">So far Milford has declined any approaches from the club to extend his contract.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Broncos have tabled a $600,000 a year offer, including a massive deal if he is able to get out of next season's Canberra contract and join early.</seg>
<seg id="19">If Milford leaves, it will be another devastating blow for a club that has lost, in recent seasons and for a variety of reasons, the likes of Todd Carney, Josh Dugan, Blake Ferguson and Joel Monaghan.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm sick of seeing our kids developed and taught how to play the game in Canberra and then poached by people who can't develop," Stuart said.</seg>
<seg id="21">What affect the deal has on Milford's plans remains to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Monday, News Limited reported that Milford had told his cousin Francis Molo, a Broncos under-20s player, that he would be joining Brisbane next season.</seg>
<seg id="23">Milford is seeking a release on compassionate grounds, with his father Halo sick.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has a get out clause in his contract allowing him to leave the club because of his father's illness.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Canberra chief executive Don Furner has engaged the NRL in the hope Milford will remain at the Raiders next season.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have already sent details to the NRL and we hope they will back us in the contract," Furner said.</seg>
<seg id="27">We just want to make sure that it is a valid contract for 2014.</seg>

<seg id="3">Pic: Gary Cranitch Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="4">SCIENTISTS have discovered three new species of marsupial antechinus, one of which is living right on Brisbane's doorstep.</seg>
<seg id="5">One has been found at Samford, just northwest of Brisbane, one on the Tweed Volcano in the Scenic Rim to the city's southwest and a third at Kroombit Tops southwest of Gladstone.</seg>
<seg id="6">They were uncovered during research for the first field guide of Australian mammals.</seg>
<seg id="7">Antechinus - an animal a little bit bigger than a mouse - are renowned for their frenzied sex lives in which the male dies after mating with as many ladies as he can manage.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's not much better for the mums who have to carry up to 14 joeys in the pouch, just 2-3mm long.</seg>
<seg id="9">The discoveries bring the known number of antechinus to 13 and Queensland University of Technology mammalogist Andrew Baker will make that 15 soon, with two further finds in Tasmania.</seg>
<seg id="10">Buff-footed Antechinus found in Samford region.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pic: Gary Cranitch</seg>
<seg id="12">Antechinus are under pressure due to people clearing undergrowth and impacts from domestic cats and feral foxes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some have even been killed by people thinking they are mice.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dr Baker said he expected some of the new species would be listed as endangered or threatened once the extent of their habitat and numbers was determined.</seg>
<seg id="15">He, with Queensland Museum senior curator Steve Van Dyck and Environment Department senior conservation officer Ian Gynther, have written the field guide over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dr Baker said he expected more mammals were waiting to be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="17">``If you think about a place like Kroombit Tops that has been geographically isolated and you find a terrestrial thing like an antechinus, then why not other animals that have been trapped there as well?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tweed Volcano Antechinus from Springbrook NP and Border Ranges.</seg>
<seg id="19">``Animals there likely evolved in different directions and I think this is what happened with this antechinus.</seg>
<seg id="20">``It's a very exciting time to be a mammalogist.</seg>
<seg id="21">Dr Baker said two thirds of Australia's fauna was found in Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="22">``There are currently over 360 species of mammals in Australia and almost half of them are marsupials," Dr Baker said.</seg>
<seg id="23">``A further two dozen species have become extinct since European settlement but there are likely many other species waiting to be discovered - while the majority may be out in the bush, some could be within close reach.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last week James Cook University scientist Conrad Hoskin announced that he had found three vertebrate species new to science and isolated on Cape York for millions of years - a leaf-tail gecko, a skink and a frog.</seg>
<seg id="25">Dr Baker said he wanted families to turn off the television, take a torch and camera and head into local bushland to see what they could find.</seg>
<seg id="26">The field guide is on sale at the museum for $45.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pimp must go to prison</seg>
<seg id="2">The District Court of Constance has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, pimping, issuing threats and grievous bodily harm.</seg>
<seg id="3">The former German soldier who, following two tours in Afghanistan, had worked as a doorman, made a confession within the context of a plea-bargaining procedure.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the confession, on five occasions he got to know women via Internet or telephone contacts, who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="5">He broke any resistance by means of violence and the issuing of threats.</seg>
<seg id="6">He kept the income from women, some of whom worked for him for years.</seg>
<seg id="7">He prevented the women from making contact with the outside world by confiscating their mobile phones and SIM cards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Together with an accomplice, who procured the women, he brought them to various brothels in the south-west.</seg>
<seg id="9">There he had them monitored to some extent, in order to control their income.</seg>
<seg id="10">Appearing before the court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explosion.</seg>
<seg id="11">Once a psychiatric expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psychiatric condition, and thus on his limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a full confession.</seg>
<seg id="12">The court did not have to question any more of the female victims.</seg>
<seg id="13">As an official from the Criminal Investigation Department reported, following the first conviction achieved using telephone surveillance measures, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified.</seg>
<seg id="14">The intercepted conversations were characterised by a high level of aggression.</seg>
<seg id="15">In subsequent hearings, the victims confirmed their ordeal.</seg>
<seg id="16">A further witness, whereby one of the woman had suffered blue bruises all over her body, is yet to make a statement.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a case of a "completely broken personality", that views the violence and exploitation in this field as normal.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yesterday the accused expressed regret for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I have removed myself from these circles and hope to lead a completely normal life following my imprisonment," he stated.</seg>

<seg id="6">Known as the Crooked Cottage, this mysterious, rural Hertfordshire home still has a made-up double bed, full jars of gooseberries and a calendar - dating back to December 1956.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is said to have been lived in by a married couple.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the husband died, his wife remained there until being taken into care.</seg>
<seg id="9">Known as the Crooked Cottage, this rural Hertfordshire home is believed to have been untouched since its owners, said to be a married couple, departed</seg>
<seg id="10">Photographer Toby Batchelor, who discovered the inside of the house, was fascinated to discover a calendar dating back to December 1956</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple's double bed is still made up with sheets despite appearing not to have been slept in for more than half a century</seg>
<seg id="12">Left-over household items - including a women's bicycle, an old-style oven and family portraits - suggest no one has been in the house for years.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inside of the home was discovered by Toby Batchelor, an urban explorer photographer.</seg>
<seg id="14">'In the field of urban exploration it doesn't get better than something like this,' the Derby man said.</seg>
<seg id="15">An old-fashioned women's bicycle was found among other items in the Hertfordshire home</seg>
<seg id="16">These old jars were found in the Crooked Cottage alongside an empty bottle of ale</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Batchelor was surprised to discover old-fashioned clothes hanging out of drawers on the inside of the house</seg>
<seg id="18">'What we see is someone's life story, left to rot in this old, run-down cottage.</seg>
<seg id="19">There were lots of trinkets, family photos, furniture and items left behind which tell a story.</seg>
<seg id="20">The house is undisturbed, with clothes hanging out of old drawers, pickled fruit jars on kitchen surfaces and records waiting to be played on the vinyl player.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even family photographs, in good condition, were found in the long-abandoned home</seg>
<seg id="22">The foundations of the house appear to have eroded, leading to it being called the Crooked Cottage</seg>
<seg id="23">According to legend, when the man who lived in this house died, his wife remained until she was taken into care because of her poor health</seg>
<seg id="24">There are also portraits that look even older, including of two young girls with work aprons on.</seg>
<seg id="25">The foundations of the house have eroded, leading to the home being called the Crooked Cottage.</seg>
<seg id="26">'The building itself was so tiny, like something out of a film,' Mr Batchelor said.</seg>
<seg id="27">It had only one upstairs room and the whole building had began to be reclaimed by the elements.</seg>
<seg id="28">'Locations like these don't come up regularly and this one was kept secret for a long time.'</seg>
<seg id="29">Found inside the house was this book, The Uninvited, by Dorothea Fairbridge, which was written in 1926</seg>
<seg id="30">This organ was also found in the Crooked Cottage, which was photographed by Mr Batchelor, from Derby</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Batchelor said: 'In the field of urban exploration it doesn't get better than something like this'</seg>
<seg id="32">Enthusiast Mr Batchelor said: 'What we see is someone's life story, left to rot in this old, run-down cottage'</seg>

<seg id="1">Australia exploring use of electronics in flight</seg>
<seg id="2">Aviation</seg>
<seg id="3">November 1, 2013 - 1:13PM</seg>
<seg id="4">Possible changes: Australian airlines are looking at the use of electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Photo: Wayne Taylor</seg>
<seg id="6">The ability to read electronic books, watch videos on a tablet and even stream in-flight entertainment or use onboard wi-fi during the take-off or landing phase on planes is edging ever-closer - and passengers on US carriers are expected to be able to do so by the end of the year, writes The Australian Financial Review.</seg>
<seg id="7">The US Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of electronic devices, excluding cellular communications, even when a plane is at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, provided airlines conduct testing to prove such uses are safe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mobile phones can be used when in flight mode.</seg>
<seg id="9">The timeline for a similar change to occur in Australia, where all airlines restrict the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases, remains less clear.</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on Friday said the agency was examining the FAA decision, but in the meantime the current restrictions remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Qantas spokesman on Friday said the airline was assessing the FAA ruling.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>

<seg id="1">For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing from the heart, telling of the hardships of his childhood and youth.</seg>
<seg id="2">The catastrophes of his Catholic village upbringing - the speechlessness, his tendency towards brute force and dulled sexuality, the confinement and lack of joy - all of this has been described many times by the Kaernten-born poet.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Büchner prizewinner is known primarily as a writer of prose, with theatre texts something of a rarity for him.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a collage of prose texts For his performance piece, "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze" (Summer lightning on the tip of your tongue), which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz, Gerhard Fresacher ,creates a collage of prose texts.</seg>
<seg id="5">The theatre producer has thus combined elements from the autobiographically inspired novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) [The Bondsman] featuring prose miniatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003) [Corpse, stalking his family].</seg>
<seg id="6">On the predominantly empty stage - with one important requirement: a crumpled sofa, on which cast members allude to copulating and masturbating - the eight-person ensemble work their way through the text material.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Director Fresacher seems to have little trust in the text.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 70-minute performance glosses over the script with a host of director's additions, well-known from the repertoire of post-dramatic theatrical styles.</seg>
<seg id="9">In particular, the actresses play a major role in the sometimes rather dubious staging.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are manhandled, their heads held under water, tacked to the wall by their evening gowns.</seg>
<seg id="11">Wrapped in cellophane or in girdles, they stumble on dangerously high heels across the set, either delivering monologues at the top of their voices or lying completely silent on the stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the source text makes barely any reference to this intense delivery.</seg>
<seg id="13">The best moments of the evening is when the singing starts - tracks range from Deep Purple to traditional folk songs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down, and we see flashes of Winkler's somewhat absurd sense of humour.</seg>

<seg id="1">Headlines follow career of dedicated cop in a rough town</seg>
<seg id="2">Bedtime comes early to Vintage Cerritos, an assisted living facility on the edge of Los Angeles County.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Thursday hoedown has ended, the lobby is quiet.</seg>
<seg id="4">Felix Vera stood in the doorway of his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="5">He recently moved here, and the simple décor says more about what he's lost than what he owns.</seg>
<seg id="6">He handed me a water-stained envelope filled with news clippings from his days with the Los Angeles Police Department.</seg>
<seg id="7">I promised to take good care of it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The stories aren't the exact truth," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Having caught a glimpse of their tabloid extravagance, I was inclined to believe him.</seg>
<seg id="10">I first heard about Vera last year, when he was awarded a Purple Heart under a new LAPD program to bestow the honor on its officers.</seg>
<seg id="11">At 88, he lives with memories I wanted to learn about.</seg>
<seg id="12">When I opened the envelope later that night, it was like stepping into a James Ellroy novel.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was post-World War II Los Angeles, an era when it wasn't hard for a cop to get in the news.</seg>
<seg id="14">The city had five major papers, each upping the ante with ever-more sensational coverage.</seg>
<seg id="15">If fear boosted support for the police, it also sold papers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Vera filled these accounts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Assigned to the vice squad and the Hollenbeck gang unit, he pushed through the front door of a gambling house, stumbled upon the body of a murdered cabbie, struggled with suspects at the booking desk, disarmed a suicidal man and caught a trio of robbers.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We were told at the academy that most cops go through their 20 years, never pulling their gun from their holsters," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">That wasn't the case for me.</seg>
<seg id="20">The accounts painted a picture of a city lurching toward its future, a rendezvous darkened by war and filled with uncertainty over the atomic present, Police Chief William H. Parker presiding.</seg>
<seg id="21">Like many LAPD recruits, Vera had returned from Europe, where life and death often depended on where you stood.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a medic, he had ferried the wounded from the front and remembers once hearing the whoosh and whomp of an unexploded shell landing nearby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Back home, he got a job as a crane operator - until the promise of $400 a month and an LAPD pension seemed like a better deal.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was sworn in on Jan.</seg>
<seg id="25">In an early photo, he was not above smiling for the camera.</seg>
<seg id="26">A year later, he was in a shootout that could have ended his career.</seg>
<seg id="27">On a foggy night, Vera and his partner were on plain-clothes detail in Silver Lake when they heard shots.</seg>
<seg id="28">A man was running toward them.</seg>
<seg id="29">Vera drew his .38 and heard an explosion.</seg>
<seg id="30">The gun jumped from his grip.</seg>
<seg id="31">He had been shot in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="32">He said it felt like he'd been kicked by a mule.</seg>
<seg id="33">He scrambled for his weapon and was able to empty the pistol.</seg>
<seg id="34">But the man took off, hiding in the backyard of a nearby home.</seg>
<seg id="35">Soon surrounded by police, he was killed resisting arrest.</seg>
<seg id="36">One paper called him "a mad desperado," implicated in an attack on two police officers in Napa.</seg>
<seg id="37">That night he had propositioned a minor, who notified the police.</seg>
<seg id="38">Officers caught up with the man, who crashed his car and took off running - only to meet Vera and his partner</seg>
<seg id="39">Sixty-three years later, the LAPD honored Vera, citing "his extreme bravery and heroism and for sustaining a traumatic injury during a tactical situation."</seg>
<seg id="40">The son of Mexican immigrants, Vera grew up in East L.A., his childhood home razed for the San Bernardino Freeway.</seg>
<seg id="41">His father worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad, and to support his family, Vera dropped out of high school and got a job in a nursery.</seg>

<seg id="1">Optimism, and Caution, as Spain Attracts Investment</seg>
<seg id="2">Juan Medina/Reuters</seg>
<seg id="3">Spanish banks have been able to sell assets and reduce their exposure to troubled real estate loans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Above, a Bankia branch in Madrid.</seg>
<seg id="5">MADRID - Like other Spanish builders, Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas, or FCC, had struggled to convince investors that it could extract itself from Spain's housing market quagmire.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last six months, the management of FCC was on an almost continual investor road show in the world's financial capitals.</seg>
<seg id="7">The campaign finally yielded fruit Oct.</seg>
<seg id="8">21, when the company announced the sale of 6 percent of its equity to Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, for 113.5 million euros, or $154 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two days after Mr. Gates's purchase, as it happens, the Bank of Spain said the country had pulled out of recession and returned to growth of 0.1 percent in the third quarter after nine consecutive quarters of contraction.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both announcements appeared to confirm what many Spanish executives and the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had been asserting for months: that Spain deserved its place back in the sunshine.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are, of course, plenty of clouds still hanging over Madrid - so many that on Wednesday the Spanish economy minister, Luis de Guindos, warned against triumphalism, telling members of the Spanish Senate that, at a time of near-record joblessness of 26.6 percent, nobody should claim that "all is well."</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall growth is expected to remain anemic for several years.</seg>
<seg id="13">Still, the speed of the turnaround in investor sentiment has been striking.</seg>
<seg id="14">"What is truly remarkable is that Spain is suddenly flavor of the month, when until recently investors smelled a rat here," said Gonzalo Díaz-Rato, who advises international funds on buying Spanish assets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Three weeks ago on a visit to New York, Emilio Botín, the chairman of Banco Santander, told reporters that Spain was in "a fantastic moment."</seg>
<seg id="16">He added: "Money is arriving from everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="17">Although Mr. Botín's optimism raised eyebrows back home, especially among ordinary Spaniards struggling with austerity budgets and joblessness, most indicators add credence to his assessment.</seg>
<seg id="18">Foreign direct investment doubled in the first eight months of this year to €19.4 billion, according to Mr. de Guindos, the economy minister.</seg>
<seg id="19">That was thanks in part to Ford and other carmakers that have been expanding production here.</seg>
<seg id="20">For all of 2012, foreign direct investment had fallen to €21 billion from €30 billion in 2010, when Spain briefly returned to growth.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spanish banks, whose loan defaults forced Spain to negotiate a European bailout last year, have since then been able to sell assets and reduce by three-fourths the level of exposure to troubled real estate loans they had before the rescue.</seg>
<seg id="22">Last month the main Spanish stock market index climbed to its highest level since July 2011, although it has since slipped back a bit.</seg>
<seg id="23">And Friday, the credit rating agency Fitch upgraded Spain's outlook to "stable" from "negative."</seg>
<seg id="24">How far can this Spanish recovery continue?</seg>
<seg id="25">"Very" is the answer that Arcano, a Spanish wealth advisory and asset management firm, provided in a report published in October.</seg>
<seg id="26">The analysis compared the situation of Spain with that of Germany a decade ago, when Berlin managed to turn around its current account deficit - a broad measure of a country's trade performance - and embark on an export surge that has more recently allowed Germany to weather the financial crisis better than most other European nations.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Spain is now in a position to achieve that kind of German recovery," said Ignacio de la Torre, a partner at Arcano.</seg>
<seg id="28">Aiming to ride this wave of optimism, the government has revived a privatization program that was shelved two years ago because of Spain's downturn.</seg>
<seg id="29">In coming months, it is expected to sell as much as 60 percent of Aena, the national airport management company.</seg>
<seg id="30">Analysts value Aena at about €15 billion, but that includes a debt of €12 billion.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the fact that Spain has been in and out of recession since the start of the crisis - briefly returning to growth in 2010 before sinking into its banking crisis - has also left some economists skeptical about the staying power of the latest recovery.</seg>

<seg id="1">Haslach: Scepticism visibly gives way to confidence</seg>
<seg id="2">The 2015 Parish Council elections will bring about fundamental change, for example in the Haslach Pastoral Care Unit (Seelsorgeeinheit Haslach, SE).</seg>
<seg id="3">There will then only be one joint Parish Council for all six parishes.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is because there are no further changes to be made to the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the Parish Councils to implement these in as satisfactory a manner possible.</seg>
<seg id="6">During the course of the day one thing became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new system is reluctantly yet visibly giving way to confidence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full-time members of the pastoral care team addressed topics ranging from perceptions and expectations regarding the 2015 reforms, to concrete proposals regarding the future composition and size of the Parish Council.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly drawn-up guidelines for pastoral care units in the arch-diocese of Freiburg with the help of  a presentation.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the guidelines, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will be a corporation under public law, which shall assume the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities.</seg>
<seg id="10">There will then only be one joint Parish Council and a Foundation Council, in which the rector will be represented by virtue of his office.</seg>
<seg id="11">From each parish, at least two elected members are to be represented, with so-called church community teams set up on-site in the six parishes.</seg>
<seg id="12">In future their task will be to promote church life on a local basis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Regarding the issue of the finances of the individual parishes, the need for extensive discussion became evident.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reforms plan for the accumulated assets in the parishes to be retained for a specified purpose.</seg>
<seg id="15">Accounts payable, on the other hand, will be passed over to the "church community" as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="16">In particular, planned major investments, the debts from which thus affect all parishes, were cause for great concern.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In the past, investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes by themselves," said Haslach's Parish Council Chairman Bruno Prinzbach.</seg>
<seg id="18">Barbar Ritter, Chair of the Committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit, has practical experience of a joint committee for five parishes.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2006 she set herself the task, "Become one, remain five" and came to realise that the task is really not that simple.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Committees of the Haslach pastoral care unit set out to answer questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint Parish Council, and the practical work of the church community teams.</seg>
<seg id="21">The specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the end, Parish Counsellor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was agreed on by a clear majority.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in "airplane" mode.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
<seg id="15">For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes," the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.</seg>
<seg id="19">The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Chara, Iginla Rally Bruins Past Ducks 3-2 in SO</seg>
<seg id="2">Zdeno Chara scored the tying goal on a power play with under 3 minutes remaining in regulation and Jarome Iginla had the lone goal in a shootout to rally the Boston Bruins past the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="3">Carl Soderberg scored his first NHL goal and Tuukka Rask made 21 saves for the Bruins, who mustered only one shot on goal in the first period.</seg>
<seg id="4">They never sustained much of an offensive attack but still managed to snap a two-game skid.</seg>
<seg id="5">Devante Smith-Pelly scored less than 2 minutes into the game, Mathieu Perreault had a goal and an assist and Jonas Hiller stopped 21 shots for the Ducks.</seg>
<seg id="6">But they went 0 for 4 on the power play, dropping the league's worst unit to 7.3 percent (4 for 55).</seg>
<seg id="7">Bruins players came out for warmups wearing World Series caps, and the crowd cheered midway through the second period when highlights of the Boston Red Sox clinching win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Wednesday night at Fenway Park were shown on the JumboTron.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bruins team President Cam Neely and Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino then came onto the ice and held the World Series trophy high above their heads.</seg>
<seg id="9">But despite all the excitement in the building, the Bruins got off to a slow start.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ducks were on the verge of their fourth straight victory until Patrick Maroon's tripping penalty with 2:58 left in the third period gave Boston late life.</seg>
<seg id="11">It didn't take long for the Bruins to capitalize.</seg>
<seg id="12">David Krejci scooped up a loose puck just outside the crease and slid a pass through the legs of defenseman Cam Fowler that Chara easily slipped past Hiller with 2:50 to go, setting off a wild celebration in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="13">Iginla put Boston ahead in the shootout with his wrist shot over Hiller's glove.</seg>
<seg id="14">After Rask turned aside two weak attempts by the Ducks, Ryan Getzlaf hit the crossbar to end the game.</seg>
<seg id="15">A slap shot by Chara more than 18 minutes into the game was Boston's lone shot of the first period.</seg>
<seg id="16">Anaheim had five shots, but needed only one to score.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ducks struck 1:52 into the game on Smith-Pelly's first goal of the season.</seg>
<seg id="18">After Anaheim won the puck in front of the Bruins' bench and barely maintained the zone, Perreault dropped a short pass in the slot to Smith-Pelly, who lifted a wrister past Rask's left shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Bruins evened the score with 7:15 to play in the second when Soderberg broke in alone on Hiller and slipped the puck between his legs.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Perreault's fifth goal put the Ducks back on top with 20.9 seconds remaining in the period.</seg>
<seg id="21">After winning a faceoff in the Bruins zone, Perreault corralled a pass inside the circle just seconds later, spun to his right and slid a shot by Rask's right leg.</seg>
<seg id="22">NOTES: The Bruins recalled C Ryan Spooner from Providence of the AHL and he got his first NHL point when he assisted on Soderberg's goal.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also missed the first shot of the shootout .</seg>
<seg id="24">The Ducks played without forward Teemu Selanne, who is expected to miss two weeks after losing four teeth and receiving 40 stitches in his mouth following a high stick in a victory over Philadelphia on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="25">The 43-year-old ranks second on the active career scoring list with 1,437 points and plans to retire following the season. .</seg>
<seg id="26">Boston's one shot in the first was its fewest in a period since getting just one in the third period of a win over New Jersey on Jan.</seg>

<seg id="1">Goalkeeper Hart still sweating on City place</seg>
<seg id="2">Fri Nov 1, 2013 10:18am EDT</seg>
<seg id="3">(Reuters) - Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has refused to be drawn on whether under-fire goalkeeper Joe Hart will be dropped for the visit of Norwich City on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The England stopper has been under the microscope after a series of recent errors, the latest being a mix-up with defender Matija Nastasic that allowed Fernando Torres to score Chelsea's winner in a 2-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hart sat out the 2-0 League Cup victory over Newcastle United on Wednesday, although that was expected as understudy Costel Pantilimon is a regular in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pellegrini would not say whether the tall Romanian, who has yet to appear in the Premier League, would be wearing the gloves in place of Hart for Saturday's home clash.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Tomorrow you will know the XI that starts," the Chilean told a news conference on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a decision I have to take every week.</seg>
<seg id="9">City captain Vincent Kompany is still sidelined and not expected to be fit until after the international break later this month, meaning he will also miss next week's trip to Sunderland.</seg>
<seg id="10">The talismanic Belgium international has not played since aggravating a thigh injury against Everton on October 5, having initially hurt it on the opening day of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Vincent is progressing, I think after the international break he will be back, but not before," Pellegrini said.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very important player, but we have a strong squad and the other players can play.</seg>
<seg id="13">Defensive midfielder Javi Garcia and Montenegro striker Stevan Jovetic are also out after picking up knocks during the extra-time victory over Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="14">Robert Snodgrass and Nathan Redmond are injury doubts for struggling Norwich, who lie third from bottom with eight points from nine matches.</seg>
<seg id="15">City have won all four of their league games at the Etihad Stadium this season but Pellegrini still expected a tough battle.</seg>
<seg id="16">Norwich are a very good team.</seg>
<seg id="17">If we think we are playing at home, so we will win easy, I think it is a very big mistake.</seg>

<seg id="1">5 kitchen tools you cannot break</seg>
<seg id="2">A kitchen, by default, is a pretty dangerous place, and the Bon Appétit test kitchen is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="3">The atmosphere may not be quite as intense as a professional restaurant one, but there's still fire and knives everywhere you look.</seg>
<seg id="4">And let's not forget about the pointy corners and hard surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="5">Things can be pretty touch-and-go at times, especially for cookware.</seg>
<seg id="6">These five kitchen tools, however, have nothing to worry about.</seg>
<seg id="7">Our editors have tried many forms of culinary abuse on these five tools - applying triple-digit temperatures, dropping them, burning foods in them - but they've managed to survive intact.</seg>
<seg id="8">They're definitely a little banged up and scorched-looking or whatever, but they still work, which is all we really care about anyway.</seg>
<seg id="9">1Pyrex Measuring Cups</seg>
<seg id="10">worldkitchen.com</seg>
<seg id="11">Senior food editor Dawn Perry had one fall from her cabinet and actually bounce on the ground without shattering.</seg>
<seg id="12">Is Pyrex secretly lacing its glass with crushed diamonds?</seg>
<seg id="13">Uh, no.</seg>
<seg id="14">But for now relish in the fact that you won't have to buy new ones over and over again if you're a klutz in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="15">2Le Creuset cast iron cookware</seg>
<seg id="16">Le Creuset, Williams Sonoma</seg>
<seg id="17">The enamel coating on Le Creuset's cast iron pots and pans may be relatively brittle, but underneath that colorful paint job lies an indestructible and potentially magical piece of space metal with some serious history.</seg>
<seg id="18">Here's what we mean: In its purest form, iron is extraterrestrial.</seg>
<seg id="19">Did you know all of Earth's pure iron got here by piggybacking on meteorites (yes, from space!)?</seg>
<seg id="20">But let's get back to cast iron.</seg>
<seg id="21">This product of molten, molded iron alloy has withstood the test of time; it was used to forge weapons back in ancient China, and later on to construct buildings during the Industrial Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="22">Le Creuset cookware is also likely to have supernatural properties.</seg>
<seg id="23">The name translates to "the Cauldron," and if we were to make an etymological connection, we'd say that cauldrons remind us of witches, sorcery, and other magical things that don't break.</seg>
<seg id="24">From a culinary standpoint, it does somehow manage to distribute heat super evenly while easily transitioning from stove to oven - something we'll admit is pretty bewitching to watch.</seg>
<seg id="25">3All-Clad stainless steel pans</seg>
<seg id="26">All-Clad, Williams Sonoma</seg>
<seg id="27">To quote Dawn Perry, "You can burn the shit out of an All-Clad pan, but it won't break."</seg>
<seg id="28">If you really wanted to try, though, you could perhaps throw it from the top of the world's tallest building, the 2,722-foot-high Burj Khalifa, and seeing what happens.</seg>
<seg id="29">But you might hit someone on the head if you do, which isn't good, so it's probably smarter to just cook with it.</seg>
<seg id="30">4Silicone spatula</seg>

<seg id="32">People of science developed very bendy, funny-smelling silicone to be a substance that is durable above all else.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's kind of plastic, kind of rubber, and in some circumstances can even be self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to making spatulas, silicone rubber is put in products that do things like seal cracks in houses.</seg>
<seg id="35">Generally they are just really resistant to anything that might be destructive, like extreme heat or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="36">And if you really, really want a silicone spatula destroyed, you have to seriously commit: Try throwing it into the fires of Mount Doom or shooting it with the Death Star's superlaser.</seg>

<seg id="38">Norpro</seg>
<seg id="39">The Giant Hunk of Metal theory applies here, which says that things made from one big piece of metal are generally pretty impossible to break.</seg>
<seg id="40">So unless the head and handle of your tenderizer aren't one solid piece (because then at least you could unscrew it, though technically it still wouldn't be broken), your time would be better spent using it as, say, a replacement for a missing hammer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It'd probably even be more useful to consider how you'd use it as a melee weapon if a zombie apocalypse were to spontaneously occur.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court blocks ruling against NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy</seg>
<seg id="2">A three-judge appeal panel finds a lower court judge "ran afoul of the Code of Conduct"</seg>
<seg id="3">A new lower court judge is to be assigned to the case</seg>
<seg id="4">NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy continues during appeals</seg>
<seg id="5">New York (CNN) -- A federal appeals court Thursday blocked a previous ruling that deemed the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy unconstitutional, and removed the judge from the case, while other appeals in the case are heard.</seg>
<seg id="6">The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the lower court judge "ran afoul of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges" that requires judges to avoid impropriety and the appearance of it.</seg>
<seg id="7">About the judge, Shira A. Scheindlin, the appeals court said "that the appearance of partiality surrounding this litigation was compromised by the District Judge's improper application of the Court's 'related case rule,' ... and by a series of media interviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the District Court."</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the ruling, Scheindlin, in a related 2007 proceeding, said, "[I]f you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good constitutional case, why don't you bring a lawsuit?"</seg>
<seg id="9">"You can certainly mark it as related," adding, "I am sure I am going to get in trouble for saying it, for $65 you can bring that lawsuit."</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling also points to interviews with the New York Law Journal, The Associated Press and the New Yorker in which the judge spoke about her personal beliefs on the issue, and defended her decision against criticisms by the city.</seg>
<seg id="11">The appeals panel ordered the case to be assigned to a different judge, who will implement the appeals court's "mandate staying all proceedings and otherwise await further action by the Court of Appeals on the merits of the ongoing appeals," the ruling said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-frisk policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they deem suspicious, even if they've committed no crime -- has been one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent time, fueled by clashes between civil rights and civil liberties groups challenging the practice as racist and illegal, and law enforcement and other proponents saying the practice works to reduce crime.</seg>
<seg id="13">In August, Scheindlin ordered that the stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it is unconstitutional in part by unlawfully targeting blacks and Latinos.</seg>
<seg id="14">City officials had bristled at the contention that police racially profile suspects, and appealed the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="15">Scheindlin, ruled that the policy violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="16">She also found evidence of racial profiling, violating plaintiffs' 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection.</seg>
<seg id="17">The panel did not rule on whether Scheindlin's decision reached the correct conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In taking these actions, we intimate no view on the substance or merits of the pending appeals," the ruling said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael A. Cardozo, counsel for the New York City Law Office, applauded the appeals court's ruling.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We could not be more pleased with the Court's findings," he said, because the ruling puts off a decision on the constitutionality of the policy until another judge can weigh in on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">The non-profit legal advocacy organization litigating against the city on behalf of the plaintiffs in the case against the policy, criticized the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We are dismayed that the Court of Appeals saw fit to delay the long-overdue process to remedy the NYPD's unconstitutional stop-and-frisk practices, and we are shocked that they cast aspersions on the professional conduct of one of the most respected members of the federal judiciary and reassigned the case," said the Center for Constitutional Rights in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are shocked that they cast aspersions on the professional conduct of one of the most respected members of the federal judiciary and reassigned the case.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thursday's ruling effectively stalls changes mandated by Scheindlin, who said stops should be based on reasonable suspicion and in a racially neutral manner.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her ruling called for the appointment of a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan to develop and oversee reforms of the NYPD's policies and training and a pilot project in which NYPD patrol officers in five precincts -- one in each borough with the most stops in 2012 -- must wear video cameras.</seg>
<seg id="26">Outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg is an outspoken proponent of the policy, saying it saves lives and lowers crime.</seg>
<seg id="27">NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, was forced to cancel a speech at Brown University on Tuesday after protesters shouted at him on stage about stop-and-frisk policies and racism claims.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thursday, Kelly said he has been "concerned about the partiality of Judge Scheindlin and we look forward to the examination of this case."</seg>
<seg id="29">The controversy about the policy extended into the mayoral race.</seg>
<seg id="30">Democratic nominee Bill de Blasio, who is heavily favored to win the election on November 5, has made his opposition to stop-and-frisk a major issue of his campaign.</seg>
<seg id="31">I'm extremely disappointed in today's decision.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We shouldn't have to wait for reforms that both keep our communities safe and obey the Constitution," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="33">Republican nominee Joe Lhota said, "Bravo!"</seg>
<seg id="34">As I have said all along, Judge Scheindlin's biased conduct corrupted the case and her decision was not based on the facts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ghost stories: There was something about our new home...</seg>
<seg id="2">This may sound like nothing, but I cannot tell you the uncanny monotony of its nightly repetitions.</seg>
<seg id="3">We refused to recognise it, of course, being sane, a family of atheists and, above all, British.</seg>
<seg id="4">One night, my furious doctor father, up book-writing in the early hours, bellowed: "Whoever's charging up and down the stairs, will they stop?"</seg>
<seg id="5">His wife and children rallied indignant: "Well, it's not bloody us."</seg>
<seg id="6">One night, emboldened by drink, I roared: "Shut the ---- up" and it did, briefly, before recommencing with still more emphatic zeal.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was a silver lining to this episode: my little sister, then nine, recently alluded to my big-sister bravery with the line: "Hannah shouts at ghosts."</seg>
<seg id="8">READ: Ghost stories: The Wolf Man</seg>
<seg id="9">Back then, we didn't use the G-word.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, we strove not to use any word at all - not to acknowledge our summer haunting, certainly not to discuss it.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so the house tried harder, with what, I imagine, would be referred to as classic poltergeist activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">We would return home to find the taps turned on full-force, requiring wrenching back into inaction.</seg>
<seg id="13">An oven, on the third floor, would have its rings switched to red hot, making the house's already airless attics crackle dangerously with heat.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the second time it happened, we had it disconnected.</seg>
<seg id="15">It happened again.</seg>
<seg id="16">And, believe me, as I write this, I too think it is mad.</seg>
<seg id="17">Matters became worse.</seg>
<seg id="18">One night, the boarded-over fireplace in my room ripped open with a clamour.</seg>
<seg id="19">I wrenched my pillow over my ears, telling myself it must be a trapped bird.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the daylight, I investigated.</seg>
<seg id="21">Behind the fireplace, crammed up the chimney, were Victorian newspapers recording the house's murder.</seg>
<seg id="22">I couldn't read them.</seg>
<seg id="23">My mother started behaving oddly - pensive, distracted.</seg>
<seg id="24">We eldest and Nanny Williams, our beloved summer-holiday addition, interrogated her.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, she cracked.</seg>
<seg id="26">Waking in the night, she had seen a dead child.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is how she described it - not a ghost, but a dead child dressed in Victorian clothing, visible from the knees up.</seg>
<seg id="28">It had a certain logic: a child appearing to a mother.</seg>
<seg id="29">I became determined not to see any such thing.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sounds could be denied; but sights would be too appalling.</seg>
<seg id="31">But my mother was not the only person to be so affected.</seg>
<seg id="32">The house's most oppressive room, overlooking the garden, we still do not venture into.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is colder than the rest of the house, now a repository for our old toys, which adds a certain Gothic element.</seg>
<seg id="34">Back then, however, my four-year-old brother occupied it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Like all youngest offspring, he was a golden child: charming, vivacious.</seg>
<seg id="36">That summer he changed: rendered quiet, hollow-eyed, with the air of a tiny old man.</seg>
<seg id="37">Asked why he was so exhausted as he sat yawning one morning, he answered: "Every night, it's the same: the lady with the big bottom [a bustle?"</seg>
<seg id="38">I wonder] and the two men fighting over my bed, then one man hurts the other and the lady screams.</seg>
<seg id="39">From then on, he slept in my mother's room.</seg>
<seg id="40">My grandmother bedded down there next, innocent of that summer's events, then refused to ever again.</seg>
<seg id="41">My mother braved it to prove her wrong.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next morning, the room was locked.</seg>
<seg id="43">When we quizzed her, she refused to divulge what had happened, saying only that it was "something to do with time."</seg>
<seg id="44">Somehow this was - and remains - the most horrifying thing I had ever heard.</seg>
<seg id="45">READ: Ghost stories: A night in England's most haunted bedroom</seg>
<seg id="46">Still, the part of the narrative that brings most fear to the few friends in whom I've confided it is this.</seg>
<seg id="47">One bright August day, drinking tea in the kitchen, we elders - me, my sister, Nanny and mother - finally admitted that something was happening.</seg>
<seg id="48">We laughed and teased each other but, my God, it was a relief.</seg>
<seg id="49">Suddenly, a mirror sprang off the wall and shattered.</seg>
<seg id="50">On the back of its glass, in an old-fashioned script, the numbers 666 were repeatedly etched, along with the message: "I'm going to ------- kill you all."</seg>
<seg id="51">I know you won't believe this - I don't believe it.</seg>

<seg id="55">Over time, a year or two, events gradually petered out.</seg>
<seg id="56">Again, I am told that this is standard form: ghosts (I can barely type the word) act up with newcomers, then they - and you - adjust.</seg>

<seg id="2">LOOTING has broken out near Bolivia's presidential palace as junior members of the police force, angry over low wages, joined a nationwide mutiny.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crowd of some 200 officers, wearing civilian clothes and covering their faces, on Friday attacked the National Intelligence Directorate, smashing windows and pulling out furniture, documents, computers and even setting flags on fire.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Directorate, which also houses the police disciplinary board, is located one block from the main square in La Paz, where the presidential palace is located.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Mutiny, police mutiny!" chanted the protesters as they ransacked the office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some 20 police stations in the country's ten main cities, including La Paz and Cochabamba, have joined the uprising.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Thursday, protesters took over the headquarters of the country's riot police, as well as eight other police stations.</seg>
<seg id="8">In an upscale La Paz neighbourhood, roughly 300 protesters hurled rocks and shattered windows at national police headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police on duty outside the building offered no resistance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The protesters, some of whom marched with their wives, also demanded the resignation of national police chief, Colonel Victor Maldonado.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are demanding to negotiate directly with President Evo Morales, who was in the presidential palace under heavy military protection.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interior Minister Carlos Romero, however, said in a statement that the government was willing to raise pay and engage in a "dialogue to find solutions."</seg>

<seg id="1">Yet another report on AFL knee injuries</seg>
<seg id="2">The AFL received an extremely good paper on knee injuries more than a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Wayne Ludbey.</seg>
<seg id="4">The "knee epidemic" has created an opportunity for an academic to make the chance to make a heap of money from the AFL today.</seg>
<seg id="5">When 14 AFL players - seven from the pre-season - have had surgery to reconstruct knees before April is off the desk calendar, a red flag will be raised at AFL House where the mantra is about protecting player safety.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mark Evans is the new AFL football chief with this brief.</seg>
<seg id="7">As with all his predecessors, the instant reaction is to commission a study paper.</seg>
<seg id="8">And there is nothing wrong with seeking more information.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the game has been here before.</seg>
<seg id="10">An extremely good paper was handed to the AFL more than a decade ago when serious knee injuries were unfolding at a more alarming rate than today when Adelaide is counting the loss of Taylor Walker, Fremantle with Kepler Bradley and Collingwood with Alan Toovey.</seg>
<seg id="11">It concluded:</seg>
<seg id="12">GRASS - in particular tightknit couch grass - contributes to knee injuries by catching feet.</seg>
<seg id="13">So the AFL ordered groundsmen to plant loose-strand rye grasses to offer more give to players as they dodged and weaved.</seg>
<seg id="14">HARD grounds are dangerous - as former Port Adelaide ruckman Matthew Primus can testify from the cricket square at the Gabba.</seg>
<seg id="15">So the AFL had the pitches removed from the MCG and demanded the same at the new Adelaide Oval.</seg>
<seg id="16">It also sought the hardness of AFL venues be regularly monitored and adjusted if there was a threat to player safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">KNOCKING of knees in ruck contests had contributed to a rise in posterior cruciate ligament damage.</seg>
<seg id="18">So the AFL changed ruck rules, demanding ruckmen stay in the centre circle for centre ruck duels rather than go on a Dennis Lillee-style run-up.</seg>
<seg id="19">But for all these changes, the knee curse is back.</seg>
<seg id="20">There will be new theories, such as the higher speed of the game and the bigger bodies increasing the threat.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even fatigue from a more demanding game will be put up as a cause.</seg>
<seg id="22">But none of speed or fatigue could be attributed to the Walker injury.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was in the first term.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was from an awkward landing on a ground that has been reconditioned to protect knees.</seg>
<seg id="25">And the Walker moment brought back a reminder of a very simple piece of reality the Crows accepted in 1997 after losing star forward Tony Modra to a knee injury in the 1997 preliminary final.</seg>
<seg id="26">The knee was not designed for Australian football, a game that works the body in every direction.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is no common link to the season-ending knee injuries to Walker, Toovey and Bradley at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="28">Walker hyper-extended his knee on a landing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Toovey's gave way as he ran.</seg>
<seg id="30">Bradley had a Richmond opponent fall across his right knee.</seg>
<seg id="31">The AFL will meet the challenge of minimising knee injuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Evans is certain to commission a new report.</seg>
<seg id="33">But as long as the game demands more of the knee than the joint was designed to do, knee surgeons will not go out of business.</seg>

<seg id="1">Maldives to create biggest marine reserve</seg>
<seg id="2">THE Maldives has announced at the Rio+20 summit it will create the world's biggest marine reserve to protect its fisheries and biodiversity.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I would like to announce today Maldives will become the first country to become a marine reserve," President Mohamed Waheed said overnight.</seg>
<seg id="4">It will become the single largest marine reserve in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">This policy will allow only sustainable and eco-friendly fishing.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It will exclude deep-sea, purse-seining and other destructive (trawling) techniques," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was referring to a fishing technique in which a seine in the shape of a bag is used to ensnare fish and other catch.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Waheed said: "Already, Maldives is a sanctuary for sharks, turtles and many species of fish in the Indian Ocean."</seg>
<seg id="9">Trade in these products is now illegal in the Maldives.</seg>
<seg id="10">He did not spell out how big the reserve would be, but said: "We can do it in a short time."</seg>
<seg id="11">I hope we can do it in five years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Maldives initiative comes just days after federal Environment Minister Tony Burke announced Australia's plan to set up the world's largest network of marine parks.</seg>
<seg id="13">The network will cover 3.1 million square kilometres, or a third of Australian waters, including the Coral Sea and the southwest coast of Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="14">It will limit fishing and some oil and gas exploration.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is the biggest step forward the globe has ever seen," Environment Minister Tony Burke said in Sydney last week, adding Australia would be a world leader in ocean protection.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Burke was prevented from attending the Rio+20 conference after the Opposition refused to grant him a pair in parliament, saying they wanted the opportunity to quiz him about the marine parks.</seg>
<seg id="17">The environment minister said he was forced to cancel bilateral meetings because he would not have arrived at the conference in time.</seg>

<seg id="1">President Obama Considered Dropping VP Biden, Adding Hillary Clinton for 2012 Election</seg>
<seg id="2">And the revelation that the obama campaign secretly considered bypassing joe biden as president obama's running mate in the 2012 election, in favor of hillary clinton.</seg>
<seg id="3">Jon karl has that from washington.</seg>
<seg id="4">Good morning, jon.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reporter: Good morning, robin.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of replacing joe biden with hillary clinton was the subject of endless political speculation in the early days of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="7">And this soon-to-be released book, says some of the top advisers actually talked about doing it.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's the dream team many democrats started wishing for, even before barack obama won the nomination in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Obama chose joe biden instead and did just fine.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as the president was gearing up for re-election, a sluggish economy and bad poll numbers had at least some of his top advisers thinking it might be time to play the hillary card.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to "double down" a new book by mark halperin and john heilman, some of obama's advisers secretly discussed replacing joe biden with hillary clinton.</seg>
<seg id="12">And even conducted focus groups to see how hillary would do as a vice presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the polling showed the switch wouldn't help much and the idea was scrapped.</seg>
<seg id="14">Biden had dodged the bullet he never saw coming and would never know anything about.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bill daley who was obama's chief of staff at the time, confirmed the account.</seg>
<seg id="16">But david plouffe said obama himself never considered the idea.</seg>
<seg id="17">Never ever, any consideration of v.P./Hrc switch.</seg>
<seg id="18">The book delves into the president's sometimes strained relationship with bill clinton.</seg>
<seg id="19">And says when the two were brought together for a round of golf in 2011, they couldn't even get through all 18 holes.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the president said to an aide after they played, I like him, in doses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Congolese Army Takes Rebel Stronghold</seg>
<seg id="2">James Akena/Reuters</seg>
<seg id="3">People displaced by fighting between the Congolese Army and M23 rebels in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo made their way home on Thursday, a day after troops seized the rebel stronghold of Bunagana on the Ugandan border.</seg>
<seg id="4">BUNAGANA, Congo - The Congolese army retook one of the last remaining strongholds of the M23 rebels Wednesday, with fighters running for the hills as the military sought to extinguish the 18-month-old insurrection, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the army retook the town of Bunagana, leaving the M23 with a small sliver of territory, the civilian leader of the rebel movement fled Congo, crossing the border into Uganda and prompting calls for his extradition.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recapture of Bunagana comes just days after the U.N. special representative said: "We are witnessing the military end of the M23."</seg>
<seg id="7">In an address to the nation late Wednesday, Congolese President Joseph Kabila warned the remaining members of the M23 to turn themselves in, saying: "I reiterate my call to the members of this armed group who have just been flushed out of our territory ... to demobilize themselves voluntarily," Kabila said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Failure to do so will leave us with no option but to force them to do by force.</seg>
<seg id="9">An Associated Press reporter who accompanied the Congolese troops as they took Bunagana saw the soldiers fan out as they entered the town in order to do house-to-house searches.</seg>
<seg id="10">M23 fighters could be seen running away up a hill.</seg>
<seg id="11">Small skirmishes, however, continued and the government finally secured control of the town by midday, army spokesman Lt. Col. Olivier Hamuli said by telephone to The Associated Press.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We are now securing the city after the rebels fled," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have found a lot of weapons that they abandoned here.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their political leaders have crossed the border and about 40 fighters are headed toward Runyonyi and we are tracking them down.</seg>
<seg id="15">M23 political head Bertrand Bisimwa was among those who crossed into Uganda and headed toward the capital of Kampala, officials in both countries said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Congo called for him to be returned home amid reports he left the country in vehicles that stolen during M23's siege of Goma one year ago, the provincial capital of eastern Congo whose fall to the rebels marked one of the most humiliating defeats for the Congolese military, whose soldiers were seen running away from the front line.</seg>
<seg id="17">The events of the last few days mark a stunning turnaround for the Congolese troops, who have long been plagued by indiscipline and corruption among their ranks, making them no match for groups like M23, which until recently was allegedly backed by neighboring Rwanda.</seg>
<seg id="18">M23 launched its movement in April 2012, becoming the latest reincarnation of an ethnic Tutsi rebel group dissatisfied with the Congolese government.</seg>
<seg id="19">Neighboring Rwanda, whose president is also an ethnic Tutsi, provided weapons, recruits and training to the M23, according to a report by U.N experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rwanda's government denies the allegations, saying Congo's government has failed to police its territory.</seg>
<seg id="21">The group has been substantially weakened in the past year by internal divisions and waning Rwandan support, according to the U.N. Defections from the M23 are up this month, totaling 80 in October.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thirty-three surrendered alone on Tuesday, according to chief U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Congolese military has capitalized on these rebel setbacks by pushing ahead with new offensives beginning in August that have been supported by a specially created United Nations Intervention Brigade.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the last week, Congo has scored a series of successes and taken back half a dozen towns from rebel control to the cheers of local residents waving palm leaves and running alongside their vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="25">The unrest, though, also has prompted a mass exodus of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is only the latest unrest to prompt displacement in eastern Congo, which has now been mired in conflict for nearly two decades.</seg>
<seg id="27">Ethnic Hutu militias blamed for taking part in Rwanda's 1994 genocide fled across the border to eastern Congo, prompting Rwanda to invade twice in an attempt to crush them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The fighting has exposed civilians to unspeakable atrocities as groups have carried out massacres and burned down villages in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rebels including the M23 are accused of carrying out mass rapes and conscripting children as armed fighters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Associated Press writers Rodney Muhumuza in Kampala, Uganda; Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal; and Peter James Spielmann at the United Nations contributed to this report.</seg>

<seg id="10">It was like listening to God.</seg>
<seg id="11">It may come as a surprise to television viewers to learn that Patinkin, who won an Emmy for his role as Dr Jeffrey Geiger in Chicago Hope and played an FBI profiler in Criminal Minds before entering the paranoid world of Homeland, is a tenor singer and noted interpreter of Sondheim.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has released several recordings, including an album sung in Yiddish and a collection of children's songs for adults called Kidults.</seg>
<seg id="13">Patinkin's cinematic career includes being part of a love triangle with Barbra Streisand in the 1983 film Yentl and playing a swashbuckling Spanish fencer in The Princess Bride, who famously utters: "Hello.</seg>
<seg id="14">My name is Inigo Montoya.</seg>
<seg id="15">You killed my father.</seg>
<seg id="16">Prepare to die.</seg>
<seg id="17">But live performance remains the abiding passion of the 60-year-old actor, who won a Tony Award, musical theatre's version of the Oscars, for playing Che Guevara in the original Broadway production of Evita in 1979.</seg>
<seg id="18">Patinkin and the voice of God won strong reviews when they performed together in Chicago last year.</seg>
<seg id="19">The unlikely pair will tour An Evening with Mandy Patinkin and Nathan Gunn to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane this month, performing an eclectic song list that includes Broadway standards by Sondheim, Irving Berlin and Rodgers and Hammerstein, Tom Waits' Innocent When You Dream, Over the Rainbow and songs sung in Yiddish.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm lyric driven, words are what move me," Patinkin says.</seg>
<seg id="21">I look for connections through stories and ideas.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some of those stories, such as The Gettysburg Address and Shenandoah, seem quintessentially American, but Patinkin says they contain universal themes that are hardly alien to Australian audiences.</seg>
<seg id="23">You don't need to be Jewish to enjoy Yiddish songs.</seg>
<seg id="24">I sing Arabic songs, American songs and Hebrew songs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nathan sings French songs.</seg>
<seg id="26">Music is universal no matter what language it's sung in.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patinkin has performed in Australia before but he says the short tour with Gunn is a minor miracle of programming: "It's a little tricky in terms of booking because in the opera world they're booked about five years ahead of time and my world is a little screwy too between the different stuff I'm doing."</seg>
<seg id="28">Gunn's wife, Julie Jordan Gunn, and Patinkin's long-time accompanist, Paul Ford, will also appear on stage.</seg>
<seg id="29">Patinkin likens his relationship with Ford to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.</seg>
<seg id="30">"He's a dance partner," he says.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's a marriage.</seg>
<seg id="32">You get to know each other so well.</seg>
<seg id="33">He has known Ford since the two worked together on Sondheim's 1984 musical Sunday in the Park with George, which earned the actor a Tony Award nomination.</seg>
<seg id="34">As an avid consumer of the news, he says it informs his interpretations as much as the events in his personal life: "The meanings of songs change for us and Paul sometimes knows the change before I'm even thinking it."</seg>
<seg id="35">Patinkin is soon reciting the lyrics of Over the Rainbow, which he has previously said is one of his favourite songs, before declaring: "So many of these songs have this nature to them, they are like prayers."</seg>
<seg id="36">Raised in an orthodox Jewish family in Chicago, Patinkin describes himself as an "American Disneyland Jew informed as much by literature and the theatre as religion," according to The Los Angeles Times.</seg>
<seg id="37">His pre-performance routine for television, as well as the stage, includes a hodge-podge of Hebrew prayers, Shakespeare and Sondheim.</seg>
<seg id="38">He has also referred to himself as a "JewBu" for his mix of Jewish and Buddhist beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="39">Patinkin peppers his conversation with religious references, which is perhaps not unusual for an American but is a surprise to less devout ears.</seg>
<seg id="40">He also frequently refers to family, whether speaking about Ford, his wife, Kathryn Grody, and two sons, Gideon, 27, and Isaac, 31, or indeed his Homeland co-star Claire Danes.</seg>
<seg id="41">Family is of the utmost importance to Patinkin and it was his absence from Grody and his sons that led him to relinquish his role in Chicago Hope.</seg>
<seg id="42">He also walked away from Criminal Minds, objecting to the show's violent content.</seg>
<seg id="43">"I cannot tell you how many times I was warned about his checkered past in television," Alex Gansa, the co-creator of Homeland recently told The New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="44">But [the] role was written for him.</seg>
<seg id="45">I've been his biggest fan since Sunday in the Park; that performance was indelible.</seg>
<seg id="46">And I was convinced that the creative environment we try to foster would allow him to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mandy is a tremendously generous, compassionate, soulful guy and the message of Criminal Minds was not commensurate with his worldview.</seg>
<seg id="48">Patinkin speaks about his sons with a reverence that is endearing if unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="49">Gideon joined his father on stage for several songs at one of his Chicago shows last year, an experience Patinkin says deeply touched him.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Nothing could have made me happier," he says.</seg>
<seg id="51">I had to pinch myself when my son came up.</seg>
<seg id="52">There was nothing better.</seg>
<seg id="53">His other son, Isaac, lives in Alaska and works with children at risk of addiction and going to jail.</seg>
<seg id="54">Patinkin is a proud father, trumpeting his sons' achievements and how "they have managed to cut out a path to walk without following the herd."</seg>
<seg id="55">"To say the least, and not to be corny, they have truly become their parents' parents and their teachers," he says.</seg>
<seg id="56">Patinkin's personal life has not been free of drama; he has grappled with depression, underwent two corneal transplants to treat the degenerative keratoconus disease and suffered prostate cancer at the age of 52.</seg>
<seg id="57">Organ donation and men's health are two of the many causes he supports.</seg>
<seg id="58">He is also a passionate advocate for peace in the Middle East, gun control and the environment.</seg>
<seg id="59">Patinkin credits the actor and advocate Martin Sheen with raising his political consciousness during a conversation more than three decades ago, in which Sheen told him: "The air you breathe is political."</seg>
<seg id="60">Patinkin says his list of political concerns "right now is endless."</seg>
<seg id="61">He is speaking by telephone from New York, while on a short break from filming Homeland in Charlotte, North Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="62">The shutdown of the US government has just commenced, which Patinkin blames on "our inability to listen to each other."</seg>
<seg id="63">"We are one of the parents of the world, the US government," he says.</seg>
<seg id="64">If the parents are screaming at each other at the dinner table, what sort of behaviour are the children of the world expected to do?</seg>
<seg id="65">The lack of universal healthcare in the US is another great crime, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="66">Patinkin is at home with the script for the final two episodes of the third season of Homeland, filling in time before watching his actor wife perform in Donald Margulies' The Model Apartment at New York's 59E59 Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="67">He will jet off to his home town of Chicago to perform with Patti LuPone and travel to New York to appear on The Colbert Report, before returning to Charlotte to film the final episodes of Homeland.</seg>
<seg id="68">Based on the Israeli series Hatufim, the award-winning show became a hit thanks to a complex plot centred on Claire Danes' CIA officer with bipolar disorder, Carrie Mathison, and Nicholas Brody, played by Damian Lewis, a soldier Mathison suspected of being a terrorist after being held captive by al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="69">Patinkin's character, Saul Berenson, is Carrie's mentor and erstwhile protector at the CIA.</seg>
<seg id="70">He has been elevated to acting director of the spy agency in the third series, which follows the aftermath of a terrorist attack.</seg>
<seg id="71">He knew the pedigree of Homeland's writers and cast was impeccable when he joined.</seg>
<seg id="72">But he adds: "One never knows what the chemistry will be.</seg>
<seg id="73">Everyone can do wonderful work but you never know how the audience will find it.</seg>
<seg id="74">I use this analogy.</seg>
<seg id="75">It's like taking the love of your life to meet your family.</seg>
<seg id="76">That's what it has been like.</seg>
<seg id="77">Homeland's second series had its critics but as Fairfax Media television critic Paul Kalina observed: "As the uneven second season taught us, the viewer dismisses this fabulously brainy and brawny show at his or her own peril."</seg>
<seg id="78">Homeland's success in exploiting America's fears of an enemy within has not diminished, with the show renewed for a fourth series after its audience increased by more than a quarter in its third season, reported UK's The Telegraph.</seg>
<seg id="79">Patinkin was nominated for best supporting actor at this year's Emmy Awards, losing to Bobby Cannavale.</seg>
<seg id="80">He says he was disappointed for about 30 seconds, but could not be happier for the actor who plays Gyp Rosetti in HBO's Boardwalk Empire.</seg>
<seg id="81">"You're a liar if you say you don't want to win," he says.</seg>
<seg id="82">There's confusion about awards and whether actors should compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="83">But competition can be healthy if it motivates the swimmer to swim faster, the footballer to kick faster, the actor to listen more.</seg>
<seg id="84">It pushes you when someone is better than you.</seg>
<seg id="85">Patinkin says he has felt overwhelmed at times by the quality of the material provided by the show's writers.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If anything I was concerned it was too good and people wouldn't like it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="87">Sometimes they seem to like things that are not good.</seg>
<seg id="88">It's perhaps fortunate that Patinkin continues to enjoy the tangle of conspiracies produced by the show, where he says he spends up to 17 hours on set.</seg>
<seg id="89">I live it.</seg>
<seg id="90">I love it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="91">I never want it to end.</seg>
<seg id="92">It feeds the soul every day.</seg>
<seg id="93">But the gruelling schedule is emotionally exhausting, he admits.</seg>
<seg id="94">That's where the music comes in.</seg>
<seg id="95">Music is my balance and the hiking.</seg>
<seg id="96">Television has brought Patinkin fame but it will never supplant his love of live performance.</seg>
<seg id="97">"To be with an audience and in the moment, nothing on earth can replace that," he says.</seg>
<seg id="98">An Evening with Mandy Patinkin and Nathan Gunn is at the Sydney Opera House on November 26.</seg>

<seg id="1">As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough.</seg>
<seg id="2">But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="5">Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great double act."</seg>
<seg id="10">They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.</seg>
<seg id="12">Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="13">The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mrs Howells said: "The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping."</seg>
<seg id="15">He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after.</seg>
<seg id="17">The way he has started he'll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I'm sure he'll do well.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony."</seg>
<seg id="19">They are a great team together.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring.</seg>
<seg id="21">They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm sure Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part.</seg>

<seg id="2">Israeli aircraft bombed what the military described as a "terror tunnel" used by Hamas in Gaza and the militant Palestinian group said three of its fighters were killed in the strike early Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The military said it carried out the strike after five of its soldiers were wounded as they tried to demolish another tunnel used by Gaza's Hamas rulers.</seg>
<seg id="4">That incident drew Israeli fire that killed one Hamas militant.</seg>
<seg id="5">The soldiers were blowing up the infrastructure of a recently discovered tunnel dug in Gaza that stretched into Israel when an explosive device was detonated late Thursday, wounding the troops and drawing Israeli fire, the military said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Kidra said one Palestinian was killed by the Israeli tank fire and Hamas confirmed the man belonged to the militant group.</seg>
<seg id="7">"During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device at the forces, wounding five Israeli soldiers," said a military statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The soldiers were evacuated to an Israeli hospital.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an immediate response the soldiers opened fire and directly hit a terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="10">The military announced last month that it had discovered the concrete-lined, mile-long tunnel dug from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip into Israel.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The defensive operation was aimed at preventing future terror attacks, utilizing the existing infrastructure leading to Israel," the military said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The opening of the tunnel was discovered near Israeli civilian communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hamas has dug tunnels into Israel in the past.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri "blessed" the latest attacks saying his group "gave a painful lesson" to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Gaza will be the land of hell" for Israel, he said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel and Hamas are bitter enemies.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hamas does not recognize Israel's right to exist, and since it took power in the Gaza Strip, thousands of rockets have been fired at Israeli communities.</seg>
<seg id="18">Israel carried out major military operations in 2009 and last year in Gaza in response to the rocket fire.</seg>
<seg id="19">While various militant groups operate in Gaza, Israel says it holds Hamas responsible.</seg>
<seg id="20">The sides largely have observed a cease-fire since last November.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hamas has ruled Gaza since 2007 after ousting the rival secular Palestinian Fatah group in bloody street fighting.</seg>
<seg id="22">Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, now govern part of the West Bank only.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the Hamas takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the coastal territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">Israel has eased the blockade in recent years, but still restricts the imports of some goods into Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer, Egypt's military has tried to destroy or seal off most of the smuggling tunnels under its side of the border with Gaza, and accused Hamas of fomenting unrest in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The move followed the popularly-backed coup that ousted Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi, from the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group, a parent organization of Hamas.</seg>

<seg id="1">David Cameron expected to announce Wales powers deal</seg>
<seg id="2">31 October 2013 Last updated at 19:21</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Cameron said he and deputy PM Nick Clegg would be outlining major changes for funding in Wales</seg>
<seg id="4">Prime Minister David Cameron has revealed a major announcement about the tax and borrowing powers of the Welsh government will be made on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Cameron said he and deputy PM Nick Clegg would be outlining major changes for funding in Wales.</seg>
<seg id="6">An announcement about an M4 relief road is also expected.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prime minister also announced the 2014 Nato summit is to be held in Wales at Newport's Celtic Manor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg's announcement is expected to be the UK government's response to a review by the Silk Commission on the tax and borrowing powers for Wales.</seg>
<seg id="9">The UK government was due to give its response to the Silk report in the spring after it was published last November in which it said the Welsh government should be able to borrow money and have some powers to vary taxes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Believe in devolution</seg>
<seg id="11">The review's recommendations included:</seg>
<seg id="12">The Welsh government having the ability to vary the rate of income tax in Wales</seg>
<seg id="13">Business rates being fully devolved</seg>
<seg id="14">Stamp duty and land tax being devolved to Wales</seg>
<seg id="15">That Wales get borrowing powers "at least proportionate to that in Scotland "</seg>
<seg id="16">Delays in the UK government responding to the reviews has led to criticism from Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones who is due to meet Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="17">The UK government's response was initially expected in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="18">But speaking on BBC Wales Today, Mr Cameron denied there had been a delay in responding to Silk, saying: "It takes time to get these things right."</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Cameron said he agreed with the principle that "you get better government if the government is responsible for some of the money that it spends."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said: "I believe in devolution.</seg>
<seg id="21">I believe it's right to give people in Wales more power and control over their future and their government.</seg>
<seg id="22">Important issues</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Cameron also spoke about the importance of transport links in Wales.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I know we need these infrastructure investments in Wales," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's this government that's putting the money into the electrification of the railway line all the way up to Swansea and, of course, the Valley lines.</seg>
<seg id="26">I know we need to fix the M4 issue as well so we'll be making announcements about these important issues tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Cameron told BBC Wales the first Nato summit in the UK since 1990 will take place at the Celtic Manor, Newport in autumn 2014.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Nato meeting is expected to be attended by US President Barack Obama on his first visit to Wales.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr Cameron said it was "Wales' turn for one of these big events."</seg>
<seg id="30">Reflect future</seg>
<seg id="31">We look forward to being able to hold a reception on behalf of people of Wales to welcome world leader</seg>
<seg id="32">End Quote Carwyn Jones First Minister</seg>
<seg id="33">He told BBC Wales: "It's a great opportunity to showcase the modern successful Wales.</seg>
<seg id="34">It will be a wonderful opportunity for Wales and south Wales.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is an important Nato summit.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's the end of Afghan mission and important to reflect on the future of Nato.</seg>
<seg id="37">The last time Britain hosted the Nato summit was 23 years ago in London when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="38">But next year it will be the first time the summit has come to Wales with the Celtic Manor, which hosted golf's 2010 Ryder Cup, chosen as the venue.</seg>
<seg id="39">It will also mark the 65th anniversary of Nato and David Cameron said it will be an important event as it will mark the end of Nato's mission to Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="40">First Minister Carwyn Jones tweeted: "I welcome the news that the Nato Summit is to be held here and the opportunity it offers to showcase Wales.</seg>
<seg id="41">We look forward to being able to hold a reception on behalf of people of Wales to welcome world leaders to our country as happened in NI.</seg>
<seg id="42">Emma Watkins, CBI Wales director, said: "The CBI applauds the UK government's decision to choose Newport as the host city for Britain's first NATO summit in a generation.</seg>
<seg id="43">The choice of a Welsh city is a major opportunity, not just for the people and businesses of Newport but the whole of Wales to showcase the very best the nation has to offer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mali facing past justice issues, Human Rights Watch says</seg>
<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- Justices in Mali are commended for taking action against members of a security force suspected of abducting soldiers tied to the 2012 coup, a rights group said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three members of a Malian security forces were ordered into custody by Malian judges last week.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than a dozen others were called in for questioning for their alleged role in the enforced disappearances of at least 20 soldiers tied to a coup in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The courageous work of Malian authorities investigating this prominent case is a significant and encouraging advance for justice in Mali," Corinne Dufka, a researcher on West Africa at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">At least 20 soldiers taking part in an April 2012 coup disappeared after they were taken into custody by soldiers supporting a political upheaval the month prior.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mali descended into chaos following the competing coups.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says</seg>
<seg id="2">Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country's north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.</seg>
<seg id="21">A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."</seg>
<seg id="22">It added that, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."</seg>
<seg id="23">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I salute the fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," the watchdog's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="31">The cause of the blast was not known, he said.</seg>

<seg id="8">The log must be thrown vertically, somersault once and then finish lying straight.</seg>
<seg id="9">This scores maximum points.</seg>
<seg id="10">In tossing the horseshoe, it all comes down to accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Horseshoes are thrown onto a peg from a distance of eight metres.</seg>
<seg id="12">Participants must then prove their skill and strength by carrying a bucket of water 50 metres.</seg>
<seg id="13">Time is recorded and water quantity measured in a vat at the end.</seg>
<seg id="14">Two members of each "clan" or team can then take part in the individual competition.</seg>
<seg id="15">The winners of the team and individual contests receive prizes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Teams can practice from 10:00 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suitable clothing is desirable - for example competitors can wear kilts.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, Swabian traditional clothing is also permitted.</seg>
<seg id="19">The judging panel will also award a few bonus points for "outfits".</seg>
<seg id="20">Registration is open until a few hours prior to the beginning of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="21">With the Scottish-Swabian Highland Games and the tractor pulling contest, which will begin half an hour beforehand, there promises to be a great deal of action at the event grounds on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the evening, fans of brass band music will be in for a treat of their own.</seg>
<seg id="23">At 19:00, the "biraböhmische" (a play on words alluding to the regions pear trees, Bohemia, and perhaps their love of beer as well!) wind music group from Schömberg, provide a great evening of entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The band plays lively polkas and marches.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, their repertoire also includes emotive waltzes and a full big band sound.</seg>
<seg id="26">Heinz Koch from Weilen unter den Rinnen will also be there, better known as the 'singing inn keeper and black sausage baron".</seg>
<seg id="27">In the past, he has appeared at the Christmas market in Dornhan and the Narrenzunft (Fool's Guild event).</seg>
<seg id="28">On Sunday, the Leinstetten Music Society will entertain audiences with a morning session, with the Böffingen Farmer's Band as guests from 2:00 p.m., and then the "Oldies" will bring the celebrations to a close.</seg>
<seg id="29">The celebrations will get under way on Friday, with the "Stoppelacker" (Stubble Field) party featuring DJ Ralf.</seg>
<seg id="30">Other items in the itinerary on Saturday and Sunday include the vintage car and tractor meet and exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.</seg>
<seg id="31">Further attractions on Sunday are the corn maze, the craft market and sheep shearing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Specially for children, there is a petting zoo, "straw bouncy castle", tractor driving (under supervision) and tractor surfing.</seg>
<seg id="33">The event is organised by the community hall association, the ski club and the "Zündkapsele" (blasting caps) tractor enthusiasts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Office Depot-OfficeMax deal gets U.S. antitrust nod</seg>
<seg id="2">NEW YORK (Reuters) - A deal to combine No.</seg>
<seg id="3">2 U.S. office supply retailer Office Depot Inc (ODP.N) with smaller rival OfficeMax Inc (OMX.N) has won approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the companies said in a joint statement on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The news, which boosted shares of both companies, came more than eight months after Boca Raton, Florida-based Office Depot proposed to buy Naperville, Illinois-based OfficeMax.</seg>
<seg id="5">They expect the $976 million all-stock deal to cut costs, consolidate stores, boost clout with suppliers and improve chances of fighting market leader Staples Inc (SPLS.O) and online and discount competitors.</seg>
<seg id="6">The companies expect the transaction to close on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The deal raised the ghost of a famous antitrust case involving an agreement to merge Staples with Office Depot.</seg>
<seg id="8">The FTC challenged the proposed combination in court in 1997, and it was scrapped after a judge ruled that it would lead to higher prices for shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="9">But some antitrust experts and many on Wall Street had said the FTC's concerns from 1997 did not apply this time around.</seg>
<seg id="10">The retail landscape has changed markedly in 16 years, they said, especially due to the rise of online sales.</seg>
<seg id="11">Office supply stores are fighting a battle for relevance, with shoppers increasingly buying their paper, toner and technology online from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), drugstores or at mass merchants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).</seg>
<seg id="12">Analysts covering office supply retailers have long called for consolidation in what they see as a cluttered sector whose sales crumbled during the last recession.</seg>
<seg id="13">On its website, the FTC said the decision to approve the deal was unanimous and that the proposed merger was "unlikely to substantially lessen competition."</seg>
<seg id="14">The companies said they would each report quarterly earnings after Monday's market close, but they canceled their previously announced conference calls scheduled for Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">The combined company would have had revenue of about $17 billion for the 12 months ended June 29.</seg>
<seg id="16">Office Depot and Office Max have not yet disclosed the combined entity's name, headquarters or chief executive officer.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Friday, officials at OfficeMax and Office Depot declined to comment on those details.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The next major milestone is the appointment of a CEO, which we believe will be announced shortly, providing color into the direction of the merged company," Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said.</seg>
<seg id="19">OfficeMax shares were up 4 percent at $15.59 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading, while Office Depot rose 3.6 percent to $5.79.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another independence scare story.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, a non-story, then.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the "independence means passport controls" canard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.</seg>
<seg id="31">Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where does this leave Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="2">SAN FRANCISCO - Australia's Peter Senior shot an 8-under 63 on Thursday to take a one-stroke lead in the Champions Tour's season-ending Charles Schwab Cup Championship.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 54-year-old Senior had nine birdies, an eagle and three bogeys at TPC Harding Park to match the event first-round record set by Jim Thorpe in his 2003 victory at Sonoma Golf Club.</seg>
<seg id="4">"That was probably the best round of golf I've played this year," Senior said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I putted well and hit it well.</seg>
<seg id="6">Senior won the Australian Open last year for his 19th PGA Tour of Australasia victory.</seg>
<seg id="7">He's seeking his first Champions Tour title after finishing second five times - including three playoff losses - in 93 career starts.</seg>
<seg id="8">"That's the only disappointing thing," Senior said.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's such a great tour and I've enjoyed every minute of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a little disappointing I haven't won in four years.</seg>
<seg id="11">You've got to be fortunate at the right times and I haven't done enough down the stretch, going par, par, par when I needed a birdie to make the difference.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hopefully, it might happen.</seg>
<seg id="13">David Frost shot 64, missing a short putt on the 18th hole.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fred Couples was third at 65, and Mark O'Meara had a 66.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bernhard Langer, Steve Elkington and Duffy Waldorf shot 67.</seg>
<seg id="16">Charles Schwab Cup points leader Kenny Perry topped the group at 68.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perry entered the event 612 points ahead of second-place Langer.</seg>
<seg id="18">If Langer wins the tournament, Perry needs only to finish fifth or better take the season title and $1-million annuity.</seg>
<seg id="19">No Canadians managed to qualify for the season-ending event.</seg>
<seg id="20">Senior shot a 6-under 30 on the front nine, culminating with an eagle on the ninth hole.</seg>
<seg id="21">He birdied Nos. 11 and 12 and allowed himself to start thinking big.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I started counting the easy holes that I could possibly birdie," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"As soon as I thought that, I made a bogey." "</seg>
<seg id="24">Frost has two victories season, including his first senior major victory at the Regions Tradition in June.</seg>
<seg id="25">Couples is dealing with neck and back issues.</seg>
<seg id="26">He had a double bogey on the eighth hole.</seg>
<seg id="27">Couples had nine birdies, three immediately before his double bogey and two immediately following.</seg>

<seg id="2">The security officials and eyewitnesses said that an Israeli tank and armoured bulldozer came about 100 metres (yards) inside the strip.</seg>

<seg id="4">An Israeli military spokeswoman would not comment on the fighting other than to tell AFP that "a pinpoint and defensive activity against the terror tunnel is currently taking place."</seg>
<seg id="5">She was referring to a tunnel from the Gaza Strip into Israel uncovered by Israeli security forces last month and allegedly intended as a springboard for attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Quade Cooper's year in quotes: from "toxic environment" to "speechless" for new Wallaby vice-captain</seg>
<seg id="2">Newly appointed Wallabies vice captain Quade Cooper says he's changed his ways after a couple of turbulent years and is reaping the rewards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Quade Cooper has been named Wallabies vice-captain for the clash with England at Twickenham.</seg>
<seg id="4">CONTROVERSIAL playmaker Quade Cooper has capped a remarkable turnaround by going from Wallabies outcast to leader.</seg>
<seg id="5">It all kicked off with his now infamous "toxic environment" comments in September last year, after which he was routinely overlooked for Test duties by then coach Robbie Deans."</seg>
<seg id="6">But with Ewen McKenzie taking over from Deans mid-way through 2013, and an increasingly contrite Cooper mending his outspoken ways, the one-time bad boy has gone from Wallaby sinner to saint - named vice-captain for Australia's Test clash with England at Twickenham.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We chart Cooper's year in quotes, and measure how he has transformed from "toxic" to top pick."</seg>
<seg id="8">The comments that kicked it all off came as Cooper addressed some wayward tweets that criticised the Wallabies' style of play under Deans.</seg>
<seg id="9">""There's a lot of people who are afraid to say what they feel so they just go along with it and nothing is going to change," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="10">That's why I feel so strongly as a player.</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't want to be involved in the toxic environment, and that's how it is at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="12">""It's an environment where things aren't going according to plan and everyone is looking to point the finger.""</seg>
<seg id="13">"Speaking on Fox Sports' The Rugby Club, Cooper revealed that he wouldn't have played against the Springboks in South Africa had he been fit and had he been instructed to run a "defensive" game plan."</seg>
<seg id="14">""Well no because, like I said, the environment there is one I don't feel comfortable with," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="15">""And if I don't feel comfortable and I don't feel I can give 100 per cent for my country and for that yellow jersey then that's a very big problem.""</seg>
<seg id="16">"After copping a $40,000 fine from the ARU over his "toxic environment" comments, Cooper was in an apologetic mood.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I understand that I fell well below par in what it means to be a Wallaby," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="18">""For all the supporters that are out there, my apologies.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I'm just looking forward to the future, hopefully having a big year, with not only my state but the Wallabies.""</seg>
<seg id="20">Quade Cooper in action against the All Blacks earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">Cooper copped his fine but that didn't stop him from fighting - literally.</seg>
<seg id="22">He put his rugby career on hold to focus on boxing.</seg>
<seg id="23">""As it stands now, I'm still contracted (with the ARU) until the end of December," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="24">I don't really have an option to continue with rugby at the moment, so for now I'm just focusing on getting my body right.</seg>
<seg id="25">""I'm still training with the Reds, I'm still contracted with them.</seg>
<seg id="26">I'm just putting my full focus on getting my body right for the upcoming boxing fight.</seg>
<seg id="27">Cooper rejected overseas offers to re-sign with the ARU and said he was "very happy" to remain in rugby union."</seg>
<seg id="28">He also declared that he had no issue with Deans.</seg>
<seg id="29">""He's the coach.</seg>
<seg id="30">It (their relationship) is not something I have to improve," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="31">""His job is to coach and get the best out of the team.</seg>
<seg id="32">My first goal is to get back out there for Queensland and then if I play well the opportunity will arise to play for my country.</seg>
<seg id="33">""It is a big year coming up.""</seg>
<seg id="34">Ahead of the British and Irish Lions series, Cooper was overlooked by Deans for a Wallabies planning camp.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Cooper said plenty of ``water had gone under the bridge" since his ``toxic environment" comments."</seg>
<seg id="36">""Whether that's being held against me, I don't buy into that too much," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">I've spoken to Robbie since then a few times.</seg>
<seg id="38">We've sorted things out.</seg>
<seg id="39">""It's not something that I feel is going to impact on anything, and if it has, then so be it."</seg>
<seg id="40">Following McKenzie's appointment as Wallabies coach, in place of Deans, Cooper said:</seg>
<seg id="41">I don't know if I will talk to Robbie again.</seg>
<seg id="42">But me and him haven't talked much in the past year anyway.</seg>
<seg id="43">``I have no negative feelings at all.</seg>
<seg id="44">I don't regret anything.</seg>
<seg id="45">""Now is just about congratulating Ewen.</seg>
<seg id="46">I'm just really proud he got the job.</seg>
<seg id="47">I know how hard he has worked, he's a great coach and a great person.</seg>
<seg id="48">""Everyone who knows him is so happy for him just from a respect point of view."</seg>
<seg id="49">Quade Cooper and his Wallaby teammates warm up during a training session in London this week.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cooper said he had no regrets about his previous comments and backed his ``honest" approach.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Not at all," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's a trait that is sometimes hard to come by, honest people, and sometimes you can be too honest, but so be it.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you feel a certain way, I encourage people to speak out rather than bottle those feelings, for good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="54">""You see cases in the NRL where guys have bottled things up and they have gone completely off the rails ... it might have been the wrong way that I spoke about things, but it is what it is and I've moved on.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am enjoying rugby and life in general.</seg>
<seg id="56">Cooper admits spending time away from Wallabies teammates helped him to grow as a player and person.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Growing up is an accumulation of things," Cooper said."</seg>
<seg id="58">""If you are too ignorant not to learn from your mistakes, you are never going to improve as a player or a person.</seg>
<seg id="59">I learned a lot from having my time out, from being injured and not being part of the team.</seg>
<seg id="60">I am 25 now, I'm not getting any younger.</seg>
<seg id="61">You have to make the most of it.</seg>
<seg id="62">Cooper is named Wallabies vice-captain for the clash against England, rendering him "a bit speechless.""</seg>
<seg id="63">""I didn't know what to say," Cooper said.</seg>
<seg id="64">There was a great deal of happiness.</seg>
<seg id="65">""To get that vice-captaincy next to my name is something I see as being pretty special but I'm just going to concentrate on doing the best job I can for the team within my role at No.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for a way of life", author says.</seg>
<seg id="2">Tales of Thor could show "brute strength is no match for subtle trickery," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saying many of the myths would be "far too wild, far too scandalous and in some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore already has a part in education," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The newly designed Opschlag stands out with a new cafï¿½.</seg>
<seg id="2">One that invites you to linger a while and to come again.</seg>
<seg id="3">One that wants to get its name out there.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to dictionaries, dï¿½jï¿½ vu is defined as a psychological phenomenon, which expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the case of a visit to the cafï¿½ of the same name at the Opschlag in Kleve County, with a view of the Rhein-Waal University, it doesn't always have to remain a pure dï¿½jï¿½ vu feeling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ultimately, this is precisely the aim of the cafï¿½ with the wonderful name: to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a recurring basis, not just theoretically, but tangibly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because it is fun and simply beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="8">A glance into the internal workings at Opschlag 8 gives the onlooker a positive feeling right from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="9">With its ultra-modern yet cosy cafï¿½ ambience, it looks like a place designed to make you feel good.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team here, with business founders, Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the helm, spoils guests with a wide range of coffees and cocktails.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to this, there are delicious cakes or freshly baked baguettes, filled to order.</seg>
<seg id="12">The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs prior to opening the chic cafï¿½ on the Opschlag: They previously managed the "Art Lounge" in Kranenburg.</seg>
<seg id="13">By moving to Kleve on the Opschlag, the friendly cafï¿½ lovers hope to reach a wider audience.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not least through university customers.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We don't have a specific target group," emphasises Daniel Büttner.</seg>
<seg id="16">In actual fact, here the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age brackets.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of cafï¿½ lovers...</seg>
<seg id="18">The two friendly owners are motivated by their love of coffee.</seg>
<seg id="19">They themselves enjoy the fragrant, hot brew in a variet of formats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Espresso fan</seg>
<seg id="21">Daniel Büttner is more of an espresso fan, while Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.</seg>
<seg id="22">"And a baguette with it - that's my thing," she revealed to the NRZ.</seg>
<seg id="23">There have already been two events held in the brightly lit cafï¿½.</seg>
<seg id="24">Or perhaps more accurately, one.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is because the Hafenfest (harbour festival took) place more outside than in - Cafï¿½ Dï¿½jï¿½Vu did not benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, there was also the Ringelnatz evening.</seg>

<seg id="1">Orange inspires design for new little neighbour of the Opera House</seg>
<seg id="2">Design dilemma: Rachel Neeson contemplates her challenge in the rooftop garden of her Potts Point practice.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you design a building that will sit next to the most famous building in the world?</seg>
<seg id="4">If you're Sydney architect Rachel Neeson, whose small, award-winning practice has quietly won a competition to create a new visitor centre for the Sydney Opera House, you reach for a piece of fruit.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We picked up an orange and thought 'this is where it all unfurls'," Neeson said, echoing Danish architect Jorn Utzon, who once resorted to an orange to help explain the Opera House's structural complexity.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, neither Neeson nor the Opera House were willing to reveal further details of her winning design, which is at the concept stage, with the architect admitting only that it is a "challenging exercise."</seg>
<seg id="7">"It has to be really discreet, but at the same time if it's too shy no one will know it's there," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is the dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="9">Opera House chief executive Louise Herron launched a fund-raising campaign for the centre on Sunday after the 40th anniversary concert on the Opera House forecourt, evoking I.M. Pei's pyramid outside the Louvre as a comparable symbol of institutional renewal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"As well as providing information, the centre will be a place for people to sit and contemplate the building, ask questions and buy tickets to shows and tours," Ms Herron said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim is to build a permanent place for thematic interpretation about the site and its heritage, including, importantly, its Aboriginal heritage.</seg>
<seg id="12">The centre will be near the Macquarie Street roundabout and "sited to minimise disruption to sight lines to the Opera House for visitors."</seg>
<seg id="13">It attracts more than 8.2 million visitors each year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sydney Opera House Trust chairman John Symond started the fund-raising, donating $150,000 towards the project's estimated $1 million to $1.5 million cost.</seg>
<seg id="15">A Federal Government grant, which requires matching funding by the Opera House, will provide a further $500,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Utzon was 38 when he won the Opera House design competition, and the goal of the competition was to offer this significant opportunity to a younger architect as a symbol of Opera House renewal," Ms Herron said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neeson's entry was selected from an undisclosed number of invited entries by a panel of "esteemed" architects, including NSW Government Architect Peter Poulet.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Potts Point practice employs fewer than 10 people and is best known outside architecture circles for the recently opened Prince Alfred Park Pool in Surry Hills.</seg>
<seg id="19">Neeson's husband and practice partner Nick Murcutt died in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="20">She said he would have been thrilled with the commission.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope he's up there popping champagne corks for me.</seg>

<seg id="1">Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum</seg>
<seg id="2">At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday 21 October, in the Neues Museum des Schlosses (New Castle Museum), the focus will be on the topic of "To hell with Hell - Theological reflections on how we now approach the notion of end times".</seg>
<seg id="3">The speaker will be Johanna Rahner.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches in Salem, the Salem Castle and the Lake Constance District Cultural Office.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to address the question of how people today view the "end times" after death.</seg>
<seg id="6">While people in past centuries were overly conscious of it, focusing on the pictures of heaven and hell "that up until now have defined our ideas", contemporary prophetic teaching on the hope of consummation is characterised more by a certain bashfulness, or even speechlessness.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The greater hope has been well and truly cast out of Christians by religious critics," said the speaker.</seg>
<seg id="8">They have "provided us with so many question marks, that we seem to have lost our exclamation marks".</seg>
<seg id="9">Johanna Rahner continued: "However, the crucial challenge to this remains fear of death".</seg>
<seg id="10">Associated with this is the matter of that longing, "that dreams that everything will be good at the end".</seg>
<seg id="11">Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert Ludwig's University in Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 1997 she graduated as a doctor of theology, also in Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="13">A post-doctoral lecturing qualification in fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfalian Wilhelm's University.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has occupied a Chair for Systematic Theology in the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Germany's largest national church has launched a campaign advertising the minister's position.</seg>
<seg id="2">This comes at the same time as a possible shortage of ministers: The Protestant Lutheran Regional Church of Hanover calculates that, as things stand, the current number of around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the young people of today, the career is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Protestant Press Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is attractive to be able to determine your own daily working routine.</seg>
<seg id="5">With Burfien, the regional church has for first time commissioned a minister to work full time, endeavouring to inspire young people to study theology.</seg>
<seg id="6">At present, fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after their Abitur examinations (equivalent to A levels).</seg>
<seg id="7">Burfien puts this down to the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".</seg>
<seg id="8">The job is characterised by great freedom and variety.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am the master of my own schedule and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me.</seg>
<seg id="10">As pastoral workers, ministers can be close to people.</seg>
<seg id="11">They earn as much as teachers and can make a good living.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of course wages are higher within the private sector, but on the other hand, theologians have a secure employer.</seg>
<seg id="13">This would suit the young people of today, as it is not just about your career, but about having a meaningful job as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to information from the Regional Church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors retire every year.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, around 40 theology graduates begin as vicars.</seg>
<seg id="16">In future it may be difficult to fill positions in sparsely populated outlying areas such as Harz, Emsland or Wendland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Among other initiatives, Burfien wants to organise study days for young people, inviting famous faces who have studied theology.</seg>
<seg id="18">Theology courses offer broad training.</seg>

<seg id="1">Daughter of Murder Suspect Believes He Killed Her Brother, Mom</seg>
<seg id="2">As Karl Karlsen awaits his trial for the death of his son, his daughter speaks out for the first time, telling ABC News' "20/20" that she has no doubts that her father is responsible for her deaths of her brother and mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We knew what he had done to our mother," Erin, exclusively told "20/20."</seg>
<seg id="4">And I knew what he did to my brother.</seg>
<seg id="5">Karlsen, 52, is in a jail cell in Romulus, N.Y., facing charges of second-degree murder and insurance fraud in the death of his son and Erin's brother, Levi Karlsen.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2008, Levi Karlsen, 23, was crushed to death when the truck he was working on slipped off its jack and landed on top of him.</seg>
<seg id="7">His death was initially ruled an accident, but Karlsen collected a $700,000 life insurance payout after the incident, raising suspicions.</seg>
<seg id="8">After a family member gave police a tip about the large insurance policy, authorities opened an investigation into Levi's death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="9">Karlsen maintained that his son's death was an accident, and he pleaded not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later that year, authorities in California also opened an investigation into the 1991 California house fire that killed Karlsen's wife and Erin's mother Christina Karlsen, for which investigators said he collected a $200,000 life insurance payout.</seg>
<seg id="11">Karlsen has not been charged with anything related to his wife's death.</seg>
<seg id="12">Erin was just six years old when her younger brother Levi, and their sister Katie, escaped from the house fire that killed their mother.</seg>
<seg id="13">She was screaming, 'Karl, get the kids!'</seg>
<seg id="14">Erin said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Karlsen helped Erin and her siblings make it out of the house safely, where she said they stood and watched the house burn.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the time, I was six years old.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I didn't understand that my mother was behind that wall dying," Erin said.</seg>
<seg id="18">A week after the fire, Karlsen left California for upstate New York with his three children to be near his family.</seg>
<seg id="19">As she got older, Erin said she was able to process what happened and came to believe that her father didn't do enough to help save her mother.</seg>
<seg id="20">"You know, that's not how people are supposed to act when someone they love is trapped and literally burning in front of them," Erin said.</seg>
<seg id="21">It wasn't until Erin and her brother Levi were 11 or 12 when she said they secretly discussed the possibility that their father wasn't being truthful regarding their mother's death.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Between the two of us...we knew, because he didn't try," Erin said.</seg>
<seg id="23">He didn't make an effort to save her.</seg>
<seg id="24">He just stood there.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, when she and Levi confronted their father, Erin said, "his biggest concern was that he wondered what the community would think of his own children accusing him of murdering their mother."</seg>
<seg id="26">While Erin and her sister Katie eventually left the small town where they were raised, Levi, who was divorced with two daughters, remained with their father and his second wife, Cindy Karlsen.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He was basically an indentured servant to my parents," Erin said.</seg>
<seg id="28">They were controlling everything.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted more than anything to just have a close relationship with our father.</seg>
<seg id="30">After she received the news that Levi had died, Erin said she tried to put her suspicions of Karlsen's involvement in Levi's death at bay, but was relieved when she learned about the investigation into her father.</seg>
<seg id="31">"It was never a question for me," Erin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was a matter of fact.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Karlsen was jailed, Erin said she went to visit her father and told him that she knew he was involved in her mother's and Levi's deaths.</seg>
<seg id="34">"He won't ever own up to Levi," Erin said.</seg>
<seg id="35">But he did tell meâ€¦ 'It's been over 20 years, and they still haven't got me yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">What makes you think they're going to get me now?</seg>
<seg id="37">While she said she isn't angry with her father, Erin said she regrets not going to police sooner with her suspicions of her mother's death.</seg>
<seg id="38">What if I had said something earlier?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe he'd still be here for his girls.</seg>
<seg id="40">When Karlsen faces trial in two weeks, a judge ruled that testimony about the California fire and Christina Karlsen's death is off limits.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want him to look me in my eye and tell me exactly what he did," Erin said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Then I want him to go away for the rest of forever.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The building is in good hands," said Winterlingen's Mayor Michael Maier.</seg>
<seg id="3">The local authorities have sold the former Kindergarten on Gartenstraße to a private buyer.</seg>

<seg id="1">The throwaway society does not think</seg>
<seg id="2">The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere good, but at some point everyone has to go home.</seg>
<seg id="3">Except: In the stomachs of those in the passenger and back seats, hunger strikes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, this may be down to the odd cocktail or glass of bubbly!</seg>
<seg id="5">So what could be more natural than to casually pull into the next drive-through to pick yourself up a little treat?</seg>
<seg id="6">I admit, I am right with you with it comes to picking up some fast food late at night, or early in the morning as the case may be.</seg>
<seg id="7">A few chips, a coke, a burger - and then straight home and into bed!</seg>
<seg id="8">However, on the way home the clear differences between me and other hungry clubbers become evident.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window?!</seg>
<seg id="10">At the weekend in particular, discarded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Why is this?" I ask myself.</seg>
<seg id="12">Are the people too stupid to take their bags home or throw them into the nearest rubbish bin?</seg>
<seg id="13">After all, waste paper does more than spoil the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers, thus causing accidents.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the so-called "throwaway society" does not think about such things. They probably do not even know what the term even means.</seg>
<seg id="16">If you are often out and about in the evening, more often than not with several people in the car, you will know what a back seat can look like after having partied through the night: clothes, bottles and other rubbish begin to pile up.</seg>
<seg id="17">A few bags won't make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no-one wants to trample through other peoples' leftover food.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can see the day coming when towns and municipalities will get fed up clearing up - and the fast food chains will have to operate a deposit scheme for their bags.</seg>

<seg id="2">So Diskan, 71, a retired city planner and former Advisory Neighborhood Commission representative, didn't replace her car for months, relying instead on public transportation and her feet to get around.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I got by quite well," Diskan said.</seg>
<seg id="4">I can walk to restaurants, grocery stores, movie theaters, bus stops, a Metro station, department stores, hardware stores and whatever else I could want.</seg>
<seg id="5">I can walk out my front door and be at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York within five hours, using all public transportation.</seg>
<seg id="6">I can get to all the airports using public transportation, too.</seg>
<seg id="7">Really and truly, I have the world at my fingertips.</seg>
<seg id="8">Architectural variety: Diskan moved to Friendship Heights in 1993, into a house less than 2,000 square feet, located less than three blocks from Metro.</seg>
<seg id="9">She was attracted to the location first but said she was also drawn to the varied architecture and the "people-sized houses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I love Cleveland Park's houses, but they're huge," Diskan said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our houses aren't, and I love that.</seg>
<seg id="12">Diskan said she was also drawn to the variety of architectural styles represented in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are detached brick Colonials from the 1930s, farmhouse-style homes from the early 1900s, classic brick rowhouses and recently built condos.</seg>
<seg id="14">Living there: The boundaries of Friendship Heights vary greatly depending on whom you ask.</seg>
<seg id="15">Generally, though, the neighborhood is bordered by Western Avenue to the northwest, 41st Street NW and Fort Reno to the east, Chesapeake Street to the south, and River Road to the southwest.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kimberly A. Cestari, a Long & Foster real estate agent who lives in nearby Chevy Chase, said the architectural variety makes the neighborhood appealing to a wide variety of buyers, from young families to professionals to retirees.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cestari said high demand for walkable neighborhoods with easy access to Metro and other mass transit has made Friendship Heights "a highly desirable location" in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cestari said inventory in Friendship Heights has been low for the past several months, driving that demand even higher.</seg>
<seg id="19">Between October 2012 and October 2013, she said, 33 houses sold, at prices ranging from $639,000 to $1.2 million, as did 12 condominium units ($300,000 to $1.795 million).</seg>
<seg id="20">No homes are currently on the market.</seg>
<seg id="21">Five houses are under contract, with prices from $789,000 to $1.235 million.</seg>
<seg id="22">The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $2,125.</seg>
<seg id="23">From renters to owners: The high demand for homes in Friendship Heights is a relatively new phenomenon, Diskan said.</seg>
<seg id="24">"When I moved in, I was one of only three owner-occupants on my street," Diskan said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Every other house on the street was a rental.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last year, the last rental house was sold, and now, everyone on my block owns the home they live in.</seg>
<seg id="27">Diskan said the increase in owner-occupied houses has helped the neighborhood jell, with multiple happy-hour meetups and other informal social events throughout the community.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We have a happy hour once a month, and that's made all the difference in getting to know people," Diskan said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Crime: Over the past 12 months, there were two robberies, one assault and 11 burglaries in Friendship Heights, according to the D.C. police department.</seg>
<seg id="30">Diskan said the neighborhood sees an occasional car theft or other crime, but vigilant, engaged residents help create a safe atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="31">"When I walk home from Metro at night, I don't feel unsafe," she said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Schools: Janney Elementary, Deal Middle and Wilson High.</seg>
<seg id="33">Not for everyone: Diskan is quick to note that the neighborhood isn't for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Folks who want large, new houses with big yards, for example, will likely be unhappy in Friendship Heights.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The rooms are small, and you're not going to get a modern floor plan unless you buy a house and gut it," Diskan said.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you want a huge yard and no cars on your street, this is not the place for you to live.</seg>
<seg id="37">You're going to have traffic, and you're going to have parking problems.</seg>
<seg id="38">But if you're an urban dweller looking for a place where you can ditch your car and stretch your legs, Diskan said, "this is a great place to live."</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)</seg>
<seg id="2">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win," Glading said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.</seg>
<seg id="26">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
<seg id="38">But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.</seg>
<seg id="41">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>
