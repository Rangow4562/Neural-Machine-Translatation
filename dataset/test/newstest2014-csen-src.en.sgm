<seg id="1">Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.</seg>
<seg id="6">How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.</seg>
<seg id="15">The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.</seg>
<seg id="28">The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="33">Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.</seg>
<seg id="34">While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vodafone shares rise on AT&T takeover talk</seg>
<seg id="2">EE, the UK's biggest mobile operator which runs the Orange and T-Mobile brands, is understood to be another target, although buying EE alone would not give AT&T the scale it craves.</seg>
<seg id="3">EE's owners, France's Orange and Germany's Deutsche Telekom, are looking to float part of the business in the new year.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shares in Vodafone rose 2.5pc on Friday morning following the report, which said that AT&T would be likely to sell off Vodafone's emerging markets assets.</seg>
<seg id="5">Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao has appeared open to a merger in the past.</seg>
<seg id="6">During discussions with Verizon over selling Vodafone's stake in the US mobile business, he repeatedly suggested merging the two companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the company has made big moves into fixed-line services, buying Germany's Kabel Deutschland and investing heavily in infrastructure elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has also recently taken steps to strengthen its existing assets in India and may do the same in Africa, in moves that are seen by some as defending against a takeover.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Stephenson recently told an investor conference in New York: "If there were opportunities that presented a good value, of course we would do it."</seg>
<seg id="10">No approach has been made by AT&T.</seg>
<seg id="11">Analysts at Credit Suisse recently rated the likelihood of a bid at 50-50, valuing a potential bid for Vodafone at 280p per share, against a Friday morning price of 229.5p.</seg>
<seg id="12">Vodafone and AT&T did not comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hybrid notice saver accounts offer higher interest on more flexible terms</seg>
<seg id="2">ONE of the biggest drawbacks to term deposits is the lack of liquidity or access to your money if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Generally banks will let you withdraw part or all of your term deposit in case of emergency but that usually comes at a cost: penalty interest.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, banks have been listening to their customers who want greater flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two banks, AMP and Rabobank, are offering notice saver accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a bit of a hybrid in that it has term deposit and at-call account characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="7">The interest rates on offer are generally higher than at-call accounts but lower than term deposits.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you have a large portion of your portfolio in term deposits and think you may need to access some of your money, then this new product may be a suitable addition to your portfolio.</seg>
<seg id="9">The AMP notice saver account has a simple structure: the bank will accept amounts up to $10 million and has guaranteed to pay at least 100 basis points or 1 per cent above the cash rate, making the present rate 3.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">The required notice period is 31 days, short enough for most thinking about taking advantage of cheap holidays, or if you're a business, paying a large bill.</seg>
<seg id="11">The very high maximum amount also means this account is good for larger corporations.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Rabobank structures are more complex but offer potentially higher rates.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, notice periods can be 31, 60 or 90 days paying 3.85 per cent, 3.95 per cent and 4 per cent respectively for a maximum $250,000.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rates on offer then decline for larger sums.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rabobank makes no promises in regards to paying over the cash rate but the flexibility it offers is better, if you can afford to wait for longer if you need the funds.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is no minimum investment amount for either bank and both offer emergency access to funds as long as investors show proof.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company I work for, FIIG Securities, brokers term deposits, as they are a fixed-income investment.</seg>
<seg id="18">If you have large amounts to invest, using a broker can be advantageous.</seg>
<seg id="19">FIIG has relationships with more than 60 authorised deposit-taking institutions, which means the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has granted the ADIs a licence to take deposits, so each individual or entity is eligible for the commonwealth government guarantee - up to $250,000 with each ADI.</seg>
<seg id="20">As FIIG has so many relationships with ADIs, for those investors in 100 per cent cash we can help divide their investments between institutions to maximise the government guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="21">One example where FIIG was able to benefit the ADI and the investor was when we arranged a term deposit for a mining company direct with a local credit union.</seg>
<seg id="22">The credit union was happy to have a single investor, so offered higher rates, and the mining company was able to invest and have flexibility in accessing the funds.</seg>
<seg id="23">Term deposit rates remain low and market projections for the next three years are that they will stay low.</seg>
<seg id="24">Low-risk, short-term corporate bonds for retail investors, maturing within the next three years, offer yields to maturity of up to 5.09 per cent and remain a good alternative for those looking to increase their term deposit returns.</seg>
<seg id="25">Elizabeth Moran is director of education and research at FIIG fixed-income specialists.</seg>

<seg id="1">Indonesia upset by reports Australian embassy used as a spy base</seg>
<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- Indonesian officials said they'd ask the Australian ambassador about reports alleging Australia used its Jakarta embassy to spy on terrorists and politicians.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The conduct as reported was not at all reflecting the spirit of friendly relations" and such activities would be considered "a serious breach of security, which cannot be accepted," the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said the Australian ambassador, Greg Moriarty, was summoned to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reports, citing an unnamed former intelligence officer, said the embassy in Jakarta and the consulate in Bali were both used to collect intelligence throughout Southeast Asia, The Australian Broadcasting Co. reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">The embassy collected information about terrorists and people-smugglers and also about "political, diplomatic and economic intelligence," a report from Fairfax Media said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Indonesia is Australia's closest neighbor and a strategic ally.</seg>
<seg id="8">If Australia was subject to such an activity, would you consider it to be a friendly act?</seg>
<seg id="9">Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Matalegawa asked reporters after he arrived in Perth Thursday for the Indian Ocean Rim conference," Britain's Guardian newspaper reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">Australian media reported this week that Australian embassies had cooperated in a U.S.-led operation code-named "Stateroom" to spy on Indonesia, Thailand, China, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and East Timor.</seg>

<seg id="2">Five Things You Never Knew About Shania Twain</seg>
<seg id="3">Find Out Why the Country Pop Star Hasn't Released a New Album in 11 Years</seg>
<seg id="4">After staying out of the spotlight for almost a decade, Shania Twain has dominated Las Vegas this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twain has had hit after hit on both pop and country charts.</seg>
<seg id="6">She's now brought that magic to the massive stage of the Caesars Palace Colosseum with a show that comes with seven major costume changes and a lavish hotel suite she calls home.</seg>
<seg id="7">This extravagant lifestyle is a massive change from Twain's life before fame and her very public divorce from then-husband Mutt Lange.</seg>
<seg id="8">While Twain connects with her audience every night she performs on stage, there are a few things she told ABC News' Robin Roberts that her fans may not know about her.</seg>
<seg id="9">Click through to see five facts you probably didn't know about Shania Twain.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shania Facts</seg>
<seg id="11">Her Name's Meaning</seg>
<seg id="12">The true meaning of the name "Shania" isn't clear.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shania is an Ojibwa Indian name.</seg>
<seg id="14">Twain took it as a stage name and as an homage to her stepfather, Jerry Twain, an Ojibwa Indian.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some say it means "On my way," but others say it has no meaning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Her Fears</seg>
<seg id="17">If it were up to her, Shania Twain would never have become a singer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Twain's mother, Sharon Edwards, encouraged and supported Twain's singing career, despite the fact that the family struggled with poverty and hunger.</seg>
<seg id="19">Twain told ABC News' Robin Roberts, "I wouldn't have done it by myself."</seg>
<seg id="20">I would have shied away from it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I would have shied away from my fears.</seg>
<seg id="22">I would have backed off from my fear of being the center of attention, 'cause it's really not something I'm comfortable with.</seg>
<seg id="23">Her Real Father</seg>
<seg id="24">Shania Twain never knew her biological father ... until now</seg>
<seg id="25">Twain revealed to ABC News that she recently reached out to the father she hadn't seen since her parents divorced when she was 2 years old.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to Twain, "That is just somebody that I've just [had] reintroduced back into in my life, and so it's really interesting now."</seg>
<seg id="27">I wanted my son to know his grandfather.</seg>
<seg id="28">When asked whether he was surprised that she'd reached out to him, Twain said, "Yeah ... very very surprised."</seg>
<seg id="29">He's a very humble man, very nice man.</seg>
<seg id="30">Her First Song</seg>
<seg id="31">Shania Twain wrote her first song when she was just 10 years old.</seg>
<seg id="32">Twain's first song, "Mama Won't You Come Out to Play," was a 10-year-old girl's hope for her mother.</seg>
<seg id="33">"My mother was always ... very isolating of herself," Twain said.</seg>
<seg id="34">I don't still really understand why.</seg>
<seg id="35">She's not alive anymore for me to ask her.</seg>
<seg id="36">I wish I could, but she was always that person that was watching life happen from inside through a window.</seg>
<seg id="37">Twain explained further, "My mother was ... sad a lot of the time and really just didn't have the courage to get out and face life, and so that's why I wrote that song ... inviting my own mother to come out and play."</seg>
<seg id="38">Her New Album</seg>
<seg id="39">The real reason Shania Twain hasn't produced another album.</seg>
<seg id="40">It's been 11 years since Twain's last album of all original music.</seg>
<seg id="41">She spent the past decade producing a greatest hits album and raising her now 12-year-old son, Eja.</seg>
<seg id="42">But the true reason she hasn't yet produced a new album is that she hasn't yet found a replacement for the producer of all of her hit albums, her ex-husband Mutt Lange.</seg>
<seg id="43">"I feel a little sensitive," Twain said.</seg>
<seg id="44">I feel a little vulnerable about it, because I've worked with Mutt for so many years.</seg>
<seg id="45">She said it would be difficult for her to share her creative vulnerability with someone new: "It's ... a hump I have to get over."</seg>
<seg id="46">But think positive Shania Twain fans.</seg>
<seg id="47">She did reveal to ABC News that she's currently working on songs for an upcoming album.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two arrested in connection with murder of pizza delivery driver Thavisha Lakindu Peiris</seg>
<seg id="2">Two people have been arrested by police over the murder of a pizza delivery driver who was stabbed to death as he was dropping off his last ever order.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thavisha Lakindu Peiris, 25, was found dead in his car on Sunday night in Southey, Sheffield.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 25-year-old man and a 17-year-old are both in custody after being arrested separately on suspicion of murder.</seg>
<seg id="5">Peiris died in what police are calling an apparently random attack that stopped him from completing his last shift and moving on to start his career as an IT consultant.</seg>
<seg id="6">After Peiris did not deliver his last order on 27 November, a co-worker went to search for him.</seg>
<seg id="7">He found Peiris slumped in a silver Toyota Yaris in Southey Crescent at around 10.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="8">His colleagues and police said that he had felt unwell and planned to go home early, but agreed to deliver one last order.</seg>
<seg id="9">Speaking from their home in Sri Lanka, his family described him as the "most caring and loving son a parent could have."</seg>
<seg id="10">Peiris" father and mother, Sarath Mahinda Peiris and Sudarma Narangoda, said: "We sent our son to the UK to study so he can have a better life."</seg>
<seg id="11">""We urge anyone who knows anything about our son's tragic death to come forward to help bring whoever is responsible to justice.</seg>
<seg id="12">Please help the police stop another father or mother feel the tragic loss that we are feeling," they added.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are more than 50 police staff involved in the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Detective Superintendent Lisa Ray, the officer leading the murder inquiry, said she did not know why Mr Peiris was killed in an apparently random attack.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is understood his family are making plans to travel to South Yorkshire.</seg>

<seg id="7">More than two million people have viewed a letter written by a disgruntled passenger from India.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thousands have shared it on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tens of thousands on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's written by 24-year-old Jay Shah, who was travelling home from New York to Mumbai via Paris last month.</seg>
<seg id="11">He calls his letter One Night in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, so romantic-sounding, but the story he tells is far from it.</seg>
<seg id="13">He recounts in great detail why he feels he and other passengers were poorly treated (the letter runs to nine pages).</seg>
<seg id="14">In summary, his flight was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some passengers - those with the relevant visas - were put up in a hotel overnight.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the rest, most of whom were Indian, were left in the terminal until their replacement flight more than 24 hours later.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some slept on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="18">There weren't enough blankets.</seg>
<seg id="19">He claims the staff were cold-hearted in their response when one man asked to be rescheduled to make it back for his father's funeral.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't think they would have treated people like this if they weren't Indian," Shah told the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's this perceived racism that seems to have struck a chord with many of the thousands of Indians who have shared and commented on his story.</seg>
<seg id="22">"As long as Indians were impoverished, they didn't care about racism," says Indian columnist and international affairs specialist Pushpesh Pant, adding that as India has become richer, they expect to be treated with more respect.</seg>
<seg id="23">Air France strongly rejects the allegation that Shah or any other passengers were unfairly treated because of their nationality, and disputes many of the claims made in his letter.</seg>
<seg id="24">They also stated that it was local transport police and not their company who decided whether passengers could leave the airport.</seg>
<seg id="25">But they told the BBC they could have provided better sleeping arrangements - including a lounge, some fold-out beds, and more blankets.</seg>

<seg id="1">There is no longer any risk of prison for the words "Mugabe is a limping donkey", the court has annulled the law</seg>
<seg id="2">Until now, Zimbabweans had to pay close attention to how to speak in public about 89 year old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the start of the 1980s; since the end of 1987 he has headed it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Under Section 33 of the Criminal Codification a person could be fined $100 or jailed for up to a year for insulting the president's office.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Prosecutors should not be overzealous about charging people who comment about the president in drinking halls and other social places", representatives of the Constitutional Court said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nine judges were unanimous in ruling that the law undermined freedom of expression.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s ruling, reported the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">The law was challenged by several Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president during a row with a policeman in a bar.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an opposition activist ended up in prison for regaling Mugabe in public with the insult "limping donkey".</seg>
<seg id="9">In August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year old man of intending to use a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="10">The court also declared a law restricting media freedom to be unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The state cannot punish people whose statements are later proven to be false," Deputy Chief Justice Luke Malala said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Up until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes untrue information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The existence of an act allowing criminal prosecution of someone for a false statement has a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression," added Malala.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with an iron fist for over 33 years, in March Zimbabwe accepted a new constitution with broader civil liberties based on a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="15">The country started small steps away from the dictatorship of one man in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought in the prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from an economic crisis and until 2008 had the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100 000 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore in 2009 the government completely abolished the national currency.</seg>
<seg id="18">Today only other countries’ currencies are valid in Zimbabwe.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impoverished economy can be attributed to Mugabe’s rash agricultural reform.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2000, he reallocated the land of white farmers amongst his supporters and war veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, the majority of them had no experience with running farms.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Between a great statesman and a nation he called 'The Great Republic." " The famously sentimental Republican wiped tears from his eyes as the crowd listened to a recording of Churchill addressing Congress following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.</seg>
<seg id="7">Afterwards, Roger Daltrey of The Who sang Stand by Me - a tribute, Mr Boehner said, to "the best friend the United States ever had."</seg>
<seg id="8">Americans heard Churchill's war broadcasts - and it's this image of resolution and pluck that stayed with them throughout the Second World War, and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="9">After Germany's defeat, and thrown out of office by Labour's surprise 1945 election victory, Churchill leant moral leadership to the fight with Soviet Communism.</seg>
<seg id="10">On March 5, 1946, he gave a speech before 40,000 at the small town of Fulton, Missouri, in which he declared: "From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent."</seg>
<seg id="11">This was the rhetorical starting gun for the Cold War.</seg>
<seg id="12">The simplest reason why Churchill is so popular in the US is that he was an ally in three global wars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Of course, we must not be seduced by myth; profound differences between the interests of Britain and US remained.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Churchill was returned as prime minister in 1951, he inherited a number of small conflicts between British and American interests in both the South Seas and the Middle East (the latter culminating in the 1956 Suez crisis).</seg>
<seg id="15">What is more, wherever the US helped Britain, it inevitably supplanted its power.</seg>
<seg id="16">The alliance evolved from being a collaboration between brothers to something resembling a master leading its poodle by the leash.</seg>
<seg id="17">Americans can look back with misty eyes on the Churchill era because that's when the US empire took over from the British one.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, there are two big reasons why Americans obsess over Churchill that aren't entirely about the man himself.</seg>
<seg id="19">First, he is a reminder of a time when many Americans felt supremely confident about their role in the world.</seg>
<seg id="20">The 1940s and 1950s mixed economic growth with taking the lead against totalitarianism overseas, creating a conservative Golden Age, when the American Way meant something.</seg>
<seg id="21">I stress that it was a "conservative" Golden Age, because it is notable how much larger Churchill looms in the minds of the Right than he does the Left.</seg>
<seg id="22">I asked John Bolton, George W Bush's ambassador to the UN during the Iraq War, what qualities made Churchill so appealing to Americans and he ranked "strength of conviction" highly.</seg>
<seg id="23">His views on appeasement in the 1930s were unpopular but he stood by them and was vindicated.</seg>
<seg id="24">So we associate him with someone who stood by his views, with the defeat of the Nazis in World War II and being a staunch anti-Communist... It's about his strength of leadership.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's unsurprising that in that "most admired leader" poll of CEOs, the only woman who made it into the Top 10 was Margaret Thatcher - another British leader who is renowned for being a conviction politician.</seg>
<seg id="26">Leading by sheer strength of individual will is unusual in Britain, where, arguably, we have historically preferred consensus and moderation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Churchill and Thatcher appeal more broadly to the American conservative taste for shooting first and asking questions later.</seg>
<seg id="28">All Americans love learning about how to lead.</seg>
<seg id="29">Google "Churchill" and "leadership" and you'll find several books on how to succeed in business the Winston way.</seg>
<seg id="30">Steven F Hayward's Churchill on Leadership: Executive Success in the Face of Adversity carries the blurb, "With wit and insight, Hayward reveals Churchill's secrets for business success from assembling and inspiring a first-rate team to preparing a wise budget, from communicating a vision to structuring effective meetings, from acting decisively to rebounding from a failure."</seg>
<seg id="31">There's nothing unusual in this - you can purchase guides on how to run your laundry firm like Reagan or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="32">What it speaks to is the American Dream's emphasis upon individual success, and the constant search for guidance from great men on how to make friends and influence people - taking lessons from history and using them to make money.</seg>
<seg id="33">The ghost of Churchill is not unlike a motivational speaker or a lifestyle guru.</seg>
<seg id="34">To return to the unveiling of the Churchill bust in the Freedom Foyer, many of the politicians gathered probably fancy themselves as mini-Winstons in the making and have probably studied his life and wisdom in vain hope of becoming just as great.</seg>
<seg id="35">Vain, because it's impossible to replicate an individual's charisma.</seg>
<seg id="36">And vain, also, because Churchill was actually the product of a time and place far removed from the modern America that admires him so - aristocratic and proudly (even eccentrically) English.</seg>
<seg id="37">That said, the famously wet political class of Washington DC wouldn't struggle to match his prowess with drink.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is said that between 1908 and 1965, Churchill drank 42,000 bottles of champagne.</seg>
<seg id="39">That's a record that most US senators could happily match.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hayes: Botched ObamaCare website is 'just the beginning'</seg>
<seg id="2">Weekly Standard writer and Fox News contributor Steve Hayes told viewers Thursday on "Special Report with Bret Baier" that the Obama administration's problematic healthcare website, which has been plagued with glitches since its launch, is just the tip of the iceberg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The website is really just the beginning," Hayes said.</seg>
<seg id="4">'I think you're talking about the potential collapse, not only of ObamaCare as we have understood it, but potentially the insurance industry more broadly.""</seg>
<seg id="5">"The administration, Hayes said, is "clearly blaming the insurance companies" and "decided to make them a villain," which he believes will lead to an ugly fight between the two over the healthcare rollout."</seg>
<seg id="6">Hayes also dismissed the administration's attempt to spin President Obama's previous assertions that if individuals were happy with their current plans, they could keep them - a statement that turned out to be false since not all plans met the health act's requirements - by saying that only five percent of the country would lose their policies.</seg>
<seg id="7">'If you're talking about 15 million as the 'just five percent' - the original goal was to cover an additional 30 (million people).</seg>
<seg id="8">"So you're talking about half of the population of the uninsured that was the reason for the entire plan in the first place," Hayes said.</seg>
<seg id="9">So it's a little disingenuous for them to minimize that many people.</seg>

<seg id="1">Crows stars accept blame for loss to Carlton</seg>
<seg id="2">Crows Ben Rutten and Bernie Vince warm up at training yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="3">LEADING Adelaide players have apologised to coach Brenton Sanderson after last week's loss to Carlton.</seg>
<seg id="4">In reviewing the match and the club's patchy form, players have been embarrassed by some of their work around the contests.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Sanderson believes the frank self-assessment is the recipe for a quick turnaround, with players prepared to put their hand up rather than enter a mode of self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="6">I've had a lot of one-on-one meetings this week with some of our best players who have just come in with their head down, saying `I'm letting you down at the minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm letting the team down'," Sanderson said.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's a good sign when you know that a player is aware he's out of form.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sometimes when you're going through a bit of a form slump players start blaming everything but themselves but our guys have put their hands up.</seg>
<seg id="10">I've put my hand up as a coach - I can coach better as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's our challenge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the edits that we've showed, some of the passages of play, they are quite embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="13">They just sort of shake their heads.</seg>
<seg id="14">We're not trying to embarrass players - it's a teaching mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="15">So we show the edits, we go out and train it, we look for ways to get better and ways to improve.</seg>
<seg id="16">We're still a very young side.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have six or seven players under 15 games experience on the weekend, so you're going to get some growing pains along the way.</seg>
<seg id="18">But I'm still really excited by what's ahead for us short-term and also long-term.</seg>
<seg id="19">I'll never write us off.</seg>
<seg id="20">The positive energy within the group is still there.</seg>
<seg id="21">The anticipation we're going to be a good side is there.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Crows, who made the preliminary final last season and were tipped as premiership contenders, have been widely written off .</seg>
<seg id="23">It has not discouraged Sanderson, who still sees fire and promise in the Crows.</seg>
<seg id="24">"People are always going to write us off," Sanderson said.</seg>
<seg id="25">But I'm really confident this week against Hawthorn.</seg>
<seg id="26">Whether we're good enough we'll have to wait and see but we've just got to get back to playing that really ruthless style that balances attack and defence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sanderson yesterday spoke of the spirit of Taylor Walker, who suffered a season-ending knee injury last weekend but is already looking for ways to contribute as the Crows' search for form.</seg>
<seg id="28">He will spend time this season as a mentor and opposition analyst and Sanderson predicted he would come back for a long and fruitful career with the club.</seg>
<seg id="29">"He's got another seven or eight really good years ahead of him," Sanderson said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But, yes, it's a setback that a lot of players have had to go through.</seg>
<seg id="31">There's no reason why he can't bounce back and be even better than he was before the injury.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golden Eagle voted Scots" favourite wild animal</seg>
<seg id="2">THE iconic golden eagle has emerged as the clear nation's favourite in a competition run by Scottish Natural Heritage and VisitScotland to vote for Scotland's favourite wild animal.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bird of prey attracted almost twice as many votes as the red squirrel in second place with the red deer, otter and harbour seal taking the other top five places.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thousands of votes were recorded online following the campaign launch in the Spring and voting closed yesterday .</seg>
<seg id="5">Paul Wheelhouse, Scotland's Environment and Climate Change Minister, said: "While we can be enormously proud of all our native wildlife, it is fitting that the magnificent golden eagle has topped this poll of Scotland's "Big 5" species."</seg>
<seg id="6">At present Scotland is home to all of the UK's breeding pairs of golden eagles, and the species has done well to recover after almost being wiped out in the last two centuries.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, recent incidents have shown that the golden eagle is still threatened by illegal persecution in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have a responsibility to protect this wonderful bird so that future generations can continue to enjoy its presence in our skies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ian Jardine, the SNH chief executive said: "The response to the campaign has been brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of people have voted for their favourite from Scotland's Big 5 list.</seg>
<seg id="11">There have been several alternative lists put forward for seabirds, game animals, trees and plants, and support for rarer species like the pine marten and wildcat.</seg>
<seg id="12">It has got people thinking about and talking about wildlife, and showing how much affection and pride people have, not just for the five species on the list, but for Scottish wildlife generally.</seg>
<seg id="13">An SNH spokesman explained: "Through the partnership with SNH, VisitScotland promoted the campaign to millions of potential visitors and where best to see them in their natural environments."</seg>
<seg id="14">This saw all of Scotland's Big 5 championed through a series of billboard advertisements in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh.</seg>
<seg id="15">Alongside this, TV personality Neil Oliver lent his voice to an extensive radio campaign, with written press and online content specially developed throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, added: "We've been absolutely delighted with the response that Scotland's Big 5 campaign has received, and it has been a cornerstone of our celebrations for the Year of Natural Scotland 2013."</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the key pillars of the year was to get as many people here at home out seeing parts of Scotland that they may not have been to before, and the Big 5 campaign has given us a fantastic opportunity to promote even the most remote areas of our wonderful country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Final vote</seg>

<seg id="2">Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road crash</seg>
<seg id="3">She was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry</seg>
<seg id="4">Firefighters abseil down cliff face to pluck the dog from certain death</seg>
<seg id="5">A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="11">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom.</seg>
<seg id="13">She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid.</seg>
<seg id="14">But she is fine now.</seg>
<seg id="15">She was eating biscuits afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was a very unusual call-out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a very lucky escape."</seg>
<seg id="19">The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="21">Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was terrifying."</seg>
<seg id="22">I could not believe that she was up there in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was amazing to get her back in our arms.</seg>
<seg id="24">The vet said that if she became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The firefighters were amazing.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was really daring what they did.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.</seg>
<seg id="16">While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Double Down" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Possibly," Martin replied.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stormy Halloween in central U.S. leaves three people dead</seg>
<seg id="2">By Kevin Murphy</seg>
<seg id="3">Kansas City, Missouri (Reuters) - A violent Halloween storm from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the eastern Great Lakes killed at least three people, two in Texas and one in Tennessee, and contributed to the overturning of a school bus in a rain-swollen creek in Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Strong winds and heavy rains swept through the region and wind gusts of up to 50 miles per hour were still forecast for Friday afternoon in some regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The National Weather Service said it received 230 reports of high winds across 12 states from Louisiana to Pennsylvania, and reports of tornadoes in Louisiana, Texas, Kentucky and Illinois, although none did major damage.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Nashville, a 9-year-old boy was electrocuted by a downed power line, according to Metro Nashville Police.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It has not been determined exactly how he contacted the wire, which was knocked down by a large tree limb during high winds," police said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">Local television stations reported he was on his bike when he made contact with the wire.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fallen power lines littered Tennessee in the wake of 40 to 50 mph winds, said Scott Unger of the National Weather Service in Nashville.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands lost power, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another death in Tennessee was not related to the weather.</seg>
<seg id="12">A 4-year-old boy in White Pine, Tennessee, was killed by the family van while out trick-or-treating, according to local media reports.</seg>
<seg id="13">He apparently jumped from the open side door of the van and was run over by a back wheel.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many towns and cities in the path of the storm had postponed trick-or-treating.</seg>
<seg id="15">Two people died in Texas from the storm, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="16">One man's body was found in a swollen creek in southeast Austin, said Travis County Sheriff's spokesman Roger Wade.</seg>
<seg id="17">Another man in the more rural nearby Caldwell County died after being caught in high water in his car, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have crews out searching for a couple of missing persons - a 32-year-old woman and her 8-month-old child, but we haven't found them yet," Wade said early Friday.</seg>
<seg id="19">In rural south central Kansas, a school bus slid off a road and into a creek and flipped on its side, requiring the rescue of ten children and the driver, said Chris Davis, 911 director for Butler County.</seg>
<seg id="20">Water from the creek was over the low-lying road after heavy rain earlier Thursday, Davis said Friday.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ten elementary school-age children climbed out the windows onto the side of the bus and were rescued by boats in fast-moving water, Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="22">One child was taken to the hospital with minor injures while the driver was hospitalized after suffering a back injury and hypothermia, Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The water was about halfway up the side of the bus," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Winds moving through the Ohio Valley brought gust up to 50 mph in some areas overnight, felling power line and toppling trees.</seg>
<seg id="25">More than 25,000 residents in Cincinnati, Columbus and other Ohio communities lost power.</seg>
<seg id="26">By midmorning on Friday, FirstEnergy, a major power provider in the region, reported 3,900 customers out in Ohio, 27,000 out in Pennsylvania, 10,000 in New Jersey and 12,000 out in West Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2">Adam Elmasri is selling his childhood home in Elwood.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chris Scott Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="4">MELBOURNE'S auction market is even hotter than reported with research revealing eight out of 10 properties are selling under the hammer or shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="5">The RP Data Auction Plus research - exclusive to the Herald Sun - reveals the auction clearance rate, trending at 71 per cent, is 13 per cent higher when properties sold within 30 days after auction are included.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Auction Plus looks at the success rate of the auction process rather than the auction result on the day," said RP Data analyst Cameron Kusher.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if property is not successful at the auction - although most are currently - they are gathering quite a lot of attention and negotiations in the majority of cases are resulting in a quick sale afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="8">The traditional increase in listings for spring has not slowed sales.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Kusher said the number of new listings on the market nationally is 4.3 per cent higher this year.</seg>
<seg id="10">But strong buyer demand means listings in Melbourne are 10 per cent lower than last year as older stock also sells.</seg>
<seg id="11">The average time on market has also fallen from 55 days at this time last year to 44 days at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Despite a clearance rate of 72 per cent hundreds of properties were passed in as a record 1614 properties went under the hammer last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among them was Adam Elmasri's childhood home in Elwood, though he and sales agent Martin Fox, from Wilson Real Estate, are confident it will sell quickly.</seg>
<seg id="14">"You never know what will happen on the day, but it's a great property," Mr Elmasri said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Fox is now targeting buyers who missed out at auction last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It does depend on the property, a larger property like this can take a month," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Andrew James, an auctioneer with Hocking Stuart, which accounted for more than 10 per cent of Melbourne's record event last weekend, said the spring market was ripe for auctions.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In the market just recently it has been about a week (after auction) that we have been able to secure the sale," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The boy, dressed up for court with his unruly blond hair slicked down, whispered with his lawyer but showed no reaction when a judge decreed that he be confined to a juvenile lockdown facility for murdering his neo-Nazi father when he was 10.</seg>
<seg id="3">He is 13 now, but the case is still a source of anguish for those involved.</seg>
<seg id="4">The murder of an American Nazi</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's hard not to get attached to him," said Deputy District Attorney Michael Soccio, the veteran prosecutor who argued that a secure facility was preferable to a residential treatment center.</seg>
<seg id="6">He's so peculiar and yet charming and a lost soul.</seg>
<seg id="7">Following Thursday's decision, Soccio said he plans to visit the boy and try to help him to be "as undamaged as possible" when he gets out and faces life as an adult.</seg>
<seg id="8">The teen, neatly dressed in a vest and white shirt, peered at the judge's seven-page written ruling through thick eye glasses but his lawyer said he did not really comprehend it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the boy had anger issues well before his father become involved in white supremacist causes.</seg>
<seg id="10">At age 5 he stabbed a teacher with a pencil during his first day in kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also tried to strangle a teacher with a phone cord.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He was born with a very troubled spirit, a lot of anger," said Soccio.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was unable to control his anger from the time he was tiny.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBS station KCBS reports the boy had been living in the county's juvenile hall since the killing.</seg>
<seg id="15">He spent about three months at a state youth detention center, where he was evaluated to see whether a placement there could serve his needs.</seg>
<seg id="16">He attends class, gets regular therapy and has made progress in controlling the violent outbursts that got him kicked out of almost every school he attended.</seg>
<seg id="17">He has even, with time, won the affection of the prosecutor who got him convicted.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I enjoy watching him grow and change," Soccio told KCBS, "but I am convinced he has done better in a quasi-military penal environment."</seg>
<seg id="19">He seems to like it, he knows what the rules are and what is expected and he is treated with dignity.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judge who found him guilty of second-degree murder in January said she thought long and hard about the appropriate placement for him.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is an individual with exceptional needs," Judge Jean R. Leonard said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The boy shot his father, Jeffrey Hall, 32, at point-blank range as he slept off a night of drinking on a sofa in their home on May 1, 2011.</seg>

<seg id="26">The youth told police he was afraid he would have to choose between living with his father or stepmother if the couple divorced.</seg>
<seg id="27">The boy would have been sentenced to 40 years to life in prison had he been convicted as an adult, the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="28">The longest he can be held as a juvenile is until age 23, and he will become eligible for parole in seven years or less depending on good behavior.</seg>
<seg id="29">Defense attorney Punam Grewal, who fought for a less harsh confinement, said afterward: "This is a complete miscarriage of justice."</seg>
<seg id="30">She planned to appeal.</seg>
<seg id="31">She said the boy, whose name is not being used by The Associated Press because of his age, will be the youngest prisoner In the juvenile system and will have no opportunity for education because there is no middle school tutoring available.</seg>
<seg id="32">The boy has been held in state and county juvenile lockups since his arrest but he has felt unsafe there because of his age, his attorneys have said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Grewal said the boy called her two days earlier and asked: "Are things going to get better?'"</seg>
<seg id="34">"They will, but not right now," she replied.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."</seg>
<seg id="6">But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders are sceptical about this.</seg>
<seg id="17">Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.</seg>
<seg id="24">A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction."</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has always taken place.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.</seg>
<seg id="33">For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.</seg>
<seg id="35">Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="42">A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."</seg>
<seg id="43">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies."</seg>

<seg id="1">Analysis: In removing stop-and-frisk judge, U.S. court enters rare territory</seg>
<seg id="2">By Joseph Ax and Julia Edwards</seg>
<seg id="3">NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a series of interviews in May, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said federal judges are too cautious in exercising their creativity and independence.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Thursday, her own efforts to avoid that pitfall landed her in trouble with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which removed her from a high-profile case involving the New York City Police Department's controversial stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her actions had compromised the appearance of impartiality, the court said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Such a move is rarely seen from a federal appeals court and signaled that the three judges who wrote the decision were deeply troubled by her actions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But ethics experts said they did not expect Scheindlin to face any formal discipline.</seg>
<seg id="8">In August, Scheindlin ruled that the stop-and-frisk tactic, in which patrolling officers stop suspicious individuals and search them, had an unconstitutional and disproportionate impact on minorities.</seg>
<seg id="9">She ordered a federal monitor to supervise broad reforms of the department's practices.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a brief order, the panel found that Scheindlin had "run afoul" of the judicial code of conduct for giving media interviews.</seg>
<seg id="11">The code says judges should not comment on the merits of pending cases.</seg>
<seg id="12">The court also chastised Scheindlin for encouraging the plaintiffs in the stop-and-frisk case to file a lawsuit and mark it as "related" to another case before her, thus ensuring that she would preside over the case.</seg>
<seg id="13">Scheindlin's actions ensured that her objectivity could reasonably be questioned, the court concluded.</seg>
<seg id="14">In a statement, Scheindlin rejected the 2nd Circuit's reasoning, saying she simply instructed the plaintiffs in the case that bringing a "related lawsuit" was the appropriate procedural action.</seg>
<seg id="15">She also denied that she ever discussed the case in any interview.</seg>
<seg id="16">"All of the interviews identified by the Second Circuit were conducted under the express condition that I would not comment on the Floyd case," she said.</seg>
<seg id="17">A careful reading of each interview will reveal that no such comments were made.</seg>
<seg id="18">Medical student David Floyd was one of the plantiffs in a lawsuit brought by four black and Hispanic men who claimed police improperly targeted them because of their races.</seg>
<seg id="19">There have been a handful of other instances in which appellate courts have cited a judge's conduct in reassigning a case.</seg>
<seg id="20">Last year, for example, the 3rd Circuit removed U.S. District Judge William Martini in Newark from a pair of criminal cases, including a murder case against former prosecutor Paul Bergrin.</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisions, which came on the same day but were written by different appeals court panels, found that Martini had wrongly limited the government's prosecution in the Bergrin case and had improperly accused the government of misconduct in a separate case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ethics experts said it is extremely rare for judges to face discipline in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is hard enough to discipline a state judge here in New York, but it is rarely used in a federal context," said Ronald Minkoff, a partner at Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz and an adjunct professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.</seg>
<seg id="24">Under federal rules, the chief judge of the 2nd Circuit would initiate any investigation into an allegation that a judge had engaged in misconduct, whether a formal complaint has been filed or not.</seg>
<seg id="25">The chief judge then has the discretion to dismiss the claims, conclude that corrective actions have been taken, conclude that intervening events have made a review unnecessary or refer it to a special committee for recommendations, which are then sent to a panel of judges for final determination.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thursday's order by the 2nd Circuit gave no indication that any such inquiry was in the works.</seg>
<seg id="27">The 2nd Circuit has not admonished a judge since 2004, when Circuit Judge Guido Calabresi apologized for making comments comparing President George W. Bush's election to the rise of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.</seg>
<seg id="28">The chief judge at the time, John Walker, accepted the mea culpa, and in light of the apology a review panel dismissed five complaints against Calabresi.</seg>
<seg id="29">Scheindlin has clashed with the 2nd Circuit on occasion in other high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2003, the appeals court overturned her finding that the United States detention of a militant suspect, Osama Awadallah, was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="31">A jury eventually acquitted Awadallah in 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">No, global warming can mean less fires, not more</seg>
<seg id="2">Professor Bjorn Lomborg fact-checks the fire alarmists:</seg>
<seg id="3">UN climate change chief Christiana Figueres told CNN that global warming and bushfires were "absolutely" connected, and former US vice-president Al Gore made it even clearer on the ABC: "When the temperature goes up and when the vegetation and soils dry out, then wildfires become more pervasive and more dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="4">That's not me saying it, that's what the scientific community says.</seg>
<seg id="5">The problem is, that is simply not what the science says.</seg>
<seg id="6">The latest peer-reviewed study on global fire, run with a record 16 climate models, tells us that sometimes heat and dryness lead to more fire, but sometimes lead to less fire.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is because with less precipitation the biomass burns more easily, but with less precipitation there is also less growth and hence less biomass to burn.</seg>
<seg id="8">For Mediterranean-type ecosystems, such as southwest and south Australia, it turns out that more than half the time, future drying means less fire....</seg>
<seg id="9">Even Figueres accepts that.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The World Meteorological Organisation has not established the direct link between this wildfire and climate change," she said, though she optimistically added a prophesying "yet" to her sentence....</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, global fire activity is estimated to have declined 10 per cent from its maximum around 1950.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the past 60 years we have seen less global fire activity, despite rising temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even with global warming, the fire activity decline will likely continue until about 2025 and only then start going up.</seg>

<seg id="1">$325m rescue package for Tassie health</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state," Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.</seg>
<seg id="7">An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.</seg>
<seg id="8">There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little "unless it's followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing."</seg>
<seg id="14">He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list," Mr Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Relativity Media / Turkey's Films, LLC.</seg>
<seg id="3">The great cartoon fowls - Daffy Duck above all, of course, but also Donald and Daisy and Foghorn Leghorn and Henery Hawk - were capering capons safe from human predation.</seg>
<seg id="4">They lived in homes, not slaughter houses; they spoke, rather than clucking or quacking.</seg>
<seg id="5">And because these creatures bore only the vaguest resemblance to actual poultry, American kids didn't go to KFC and fret over devouring Foghorn's cousins.</seg>

<seg id="7">This Thanksgiving, though, if your young ones freak out when Father places the roast beast on the family dinner table, blame Free Birds.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the new animated feature from Jimmy Hayward, director of Horton Hears a Who!, Reggie (voiced by Owen Wilson), a brighter-than-average turkey who realizes that the life of his species is one brief conveyor-belt ride to decapitation, teams with a militant meleagris named Jake (Woody Harrelson) to go "back in time to the first Thanksgiving to get turkeys off the menu."</seg>

<seg id="13">With the help of Jake, and a convenient space ship, Reggie lands in 1621 in the Plymouth Colony, where the governor is a fat oaf and Myles Standish a blackguard with guillotine cheekbones.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rest of the settlers are undifferentiated villains - no sympathy here for the 4 percent of their colony who died the previous winter - while the Indians, the Pilgrims" guests at that Thanksgiving chow-down, are portrayed as the good guys, when they show up at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">The film implies that Indians kept turkeys as pets, not as animals to be killed and eaten.</seg>
<seg id="16">A movie of modest artistic or graphic ambitions - and only the second best time-travel story of the weekend (after About Time) - Free Birds might provide an anodyne entertainment for the kids if not for its political weirdness: it transfers the hardships, indeed the tragedy, of the Native American people to native American birds.</seg>

<seg id="2">England's chief Ashes destroyer in the last series, Ian Bell, says playing a warn-up game at the WACA is perfect prefect preparation for the series.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ian Bell leaves the WACA unbeaten after day two of the Tour match.</seg>
<seg id="4">ENGLAND'S Ian Bell showed he will once again be a force to be reckoned with in the upcoming Ashes series after continuing his fine form with the bat against a WA Chairman's XI in Perth.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bell took full advantage of a lifeless second-day track at the WACA Ground to finish the day unbeaten on 77 in what is shaping as a fine individual tune-up ahead of the First Test at the Gabba beginning November 21.</seg>
<seg id="6">He found a willing partner in Jonathan Trott, who became the ninth batsman to pass the half-century mark in the match en route to an unbeaten 64 at stumps.</seg>
<seg id="7">The pair batted the entire final session and have put on 133 for the third wicket.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bell dominated the Ashes series in England earlier this year, scoring 562 runs at an average of 62.44 to help seal a 3-0 triumph.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 31-year-old was at it again today, taking full advantage of a WA attack missing injured seamer Burt Cockley to make an early statement of intent on tour.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bell crafted 11 fours and smashed two crisp sixes straight down the ground to put him within striking range of a well-deserved ton.</seg>
<seg id="11">England opener Joe Root holds the unfortunate distinction of being the only player dismissed for less than 50 through the opening two days of the match, trapped in front by medium-pacer Jim Allenby for 36.</seg>

<seg id="13">Reserve batsman Michael Carberry appeared to be on his way to securing a century before steering a short and wide ball to Allenby at backward point on 78 to gift young all-rounder Ashton Turner his maiden first-class wicket.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cockley was sent for precautionary scans on his left knee after breaking down midway through his third over, while WA keeper Tom Triffitt was also in the wars, spending two stints off the field for after wearing a rearing ball from Michael Beer that required six stitches below his right eye.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tourists are likely to have another stint in the field later tomorrow after failing to find much joy with the ball in the opening 90 minutes this morning as the WA side declared at 5-451.</seg>
<seg id="16">At 33 years of age, Michael Carberry will be looking to grasp what is likely to be his last chance at Ashes cricket if an opportunity arises on the current Australian tour.</seg>

<seg id="2">Carole King performing in Perth earlier this month: Thomas Davidson Source: PerthNow</seg>
<seg id="3">CAROLE King fans at the Adelaide Festival Centre last night certainly felt the earth move under their feet as the powerhouse vocalist delivered a flawless show crammed with hits, passion and emotion.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 71 year old was ageless as she took to the modestly adorned stage to belt out her back catalogue of hits that spanned from 1960 through to present day.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was clear to see why King has enjoyed the career longevity she currently boasts - she gives her all on stage and is pure talent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Opening with Home Again, King then led the capacity crowd through her hits as well as some songs she and ex-husband Gerry Goffin penned for other successful artists.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conveying a warmth, wit and credibility that is immediately endearing it's easy to see why so many artists clamored to work with King and, now, tour with her.</seg>
<seg id="8">Her on-stage cohorts were nothing short of spectacular - King allowed her two very talented back-up singers to shine in their own right on several occasions and her guitarist's solos perfectly complemented King's unique vocal.</seg>
<seg id="9">But it was her hits from 1971's Tapestry that got the biggest cheers of the night, among them I Feel the Earth Move, It's Too Late, Will You Love Me Tomorrow? and Way Over Yonder.</seg>
<seg id="10">However the diminutive singer - who really does use her effortless vocal as the ultimate instrument - truly left the best for last, wrapping the show with a three song encore showcasing that iconic album's biggest hits - So Far Away, (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman and You've Got A Friend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Unsurprisingly King left the Festival Centre stage to a rousing standing ovation and many hoping her return to our shores won't be so far away.</seg>

<seg id="6">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
<seg id="7">After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two gentle old boys, Harry and Jack, meet in a garden and pass the time with wittering chit-chat.</seg>
<seg id="3">They talk in non sequiturs, spouting scattergun tidbits of information they've picked up over the years.</seg>

<seg id="7">They're like two cultural anthropologists swapping field notes; two talking editions of Schott's Miscellany.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, in this intimate fringe revival to mark the playwright's 80th birthday, Jack Shepherd and Paul Copley play the pair with glazed expressions and sunny dispositions.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's curious that Storey specifies fortysomethings, but always gets actors in their sixties.</seg>
<seg id="10">With death hovering somewhere high overhead, you wonder what all this information's good for.</seg>
<seg id="11">These men don't actually communicate; neither really listens.</seg>
<seg id="12">They're like Beckett characters sewn into the real world: absurd, but not absurdly so.</seg>
<seg id="13">All they have is time to kill: "One of the advantages of a late lunch," muses Jack, "is that it leaves a shorter space to tea."</seg>
<seg id="14">Storey reveals, ever so slowly and carefully, that the garden sits in the grounds of a mental institution.</seg>
<seg id="15">The penny should drop as if through treacle, but director Amelia Sears lets go too early, when two women saunter in under an umbrella so moth-eaten it's basically all holes.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shatters the play's delicate ambiguity, its ability to pass for everyday life, and so punctures the potency of its metaphor, which is both broadly existential and directly national.</seg>

<seg id="20">Storey shows Middle England as only too civil, but all too ineffectual.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Sears's production benefits no end from its intimacy, with the audience perched on benches around the patio, itself another gorgeously natural Naomi Dawson design that's well-served by Richard Howell's lazy afternoon lighting.</seg>
<seg id="22">Proximity allows Shepherd and Copley to become ever so unassuming in their child-like chatterings, while making Arkley's lobotomised Alfred all the more imposing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar</seg>
<seg id="2">English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="3">The exam will also feature "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading;</seg>
<seg id="4">A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped.</seg>
<seg id="5">From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will make changes in other core subjects next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.</seg>
<seg id="9">Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a "widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."</seg>
<seg id="10">Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="12">While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.</seg>
<seg id="13">The syllabus will place a greater focus on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Oklahoma gay couple marry under Native American law</seg>
<seg id="2">By Heide Brandes</seg>
<seg id="3">EL RENO, Oklahoma (Reuters) - In a small chapel at historic Fort Reno, a same-sex couple has exchanged wedding vows in Oklahoma, a state where gay marriage is banned.</seg>
<seg id="4">Jason Pickel, 36, and Darren Black Bear, 45, were legally married on Thursday night after obtaining a marriage license through the Cheyenne Arapaho Tribes, a sovereign nation in Oklahoma.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gay marriage is banned in Oklahoma but the marriage laws of the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe do not specify gender and only require that one of the pair be a tribal member.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pickel, who is not a tribal member, and Black Bear said they originally planned to have a small, intimate wedding and did not even plan to send out invitations.</seg>
<seg id="7">But word of their approved marriage license, which they got earlier in October, thrust the pair into the national spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We didn't think we were doing something super historic or brave," Pickel said.</seg>
<seg id="9">We just wanted to get married.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now it's turned into such a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the several dozen media and satellite trucks, the wedding remained a simple affair.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rev. Floyd Black Bear, Black Bear's father and a Methodist minister, officiated.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ceremony was held at Fort Reno, one of the largest frontier forts in Oklahoma and a key post in the nation's westward expansion and settlement.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When you walk the grounds, you always feel that history, that something significant happened there," Pickel said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Today, something significant happened again.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2004, three-quarters of Oklahoma voters supported an amendment to the state constitution defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman.</seg>
<seg id="17">Gay marriage is legal in 14 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Pickel and Black Bear first asked the tribal courts for a marriage license in 2009, they were denied due to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which limited the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman.</seg>
<seg id="19">But in June, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a landmark victory for gay rights by forcing the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The ruling, which has led to challenges in federal and state courts to laws that restrict gay marriage, prompted Pickel and Black Bear to reconsider their options.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are the third same-sex couple to be issued a marriage license by the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, according to a tribal spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not everyone in the Native American community is supportive of the marriage.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ida Hoffman, the Cheyenne Arapaho chief of staff, spoke out against gay marriage last week and said she would work to make it prohibited under tribal law.</seg>
<seg id="24">Tribal leaders issued statements afterward supporting the current law.</seg>
<seg id="25">With Pickel studying for a degree in mortuary science and Black Bear working as a floral supervisor, no honeymoon is planned.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We go back to work on Monday," Pickel said.</seg>
<seg id="27">We're just excited to be married.</seg>

<seg id="1">Young couple take advantage of living with parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations</seg>
<seg id="2">Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot lying on the corner of two streets, where the ground itself is slightly sloping.</seg>
<seg id="3">The request also said that there would be two generations living in the house who wanted to live together but at the same time each should have their own clearly separate space.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young couple also needed a small office.</seg>
<seg id="5">The house stands on the corner of two streets and on slightly sloping land.</seg>
<seg id="6">Architects therefore decided to put each household on one floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In creating the design we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the site."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Three separate functions of the house are connected with several paths through the exterior of the object, so they are all aware of the presence of the others, but they still have their privacy," explain the designers.</seg>
<seg id="9">The parents’ household is on the garden level with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are linked.</seg>
<seg id="10">The separate parts of the house are easily recognisable from outside; they differ with the varied final finish of the façades.</seg>
<seg id="11">While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface was made using panels of planks; the part where the office is, is whitewashed, and the remaining elements remained pure concrete with no further modifications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is strongly connected with the exterior.</seg>
<seg id="13">The parents’ household, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, is surrounded by a small garden with tree, which has great significance for the family.</seg>
<seg id="14">The connection of the interior with the exterior is highlighted with a side wall which starts in the garden and continues all the way to the living room.</seg>
<seg id="15">The kitchen space in the young couple’s household.</seg>
<seg id="16">The young couple enter the house by the main entrance to the hall and from there they go up the stairs to their space.</seg>
<seg id="17">The stairs are actually a dominant feature of the interior of the house.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their construction allows plenty of natural light to fall through them in cascades.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is how the architects tried to differentiate the house from others and impart something unique to it.</seg>
<seg id="20">The household of the young couple is treated as a single open space with a kitchen section, dining room and living room together.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is separated from the terrace by a glass wall with sliding doors.</seg>
<seg id="22">The living zone with the dining room and kitchen section in the household of the young couple.</seg>
<seg id="23">The second floor is composed as one large, open space, which freely goes to the terrace, from which there is a lovely view of Tokyo Bay.</seg>
<seg id="24">The separate office on the top floor is designed in a clean combination of white and black.</seg>
<seg id="25">The staircase is a dominant feature of the house’s interior.</seg>
<seg id="26">The young couple enter the house by the main entrance, find themselves in the entrance hall, and from there climb up the stairs.</seg>

<seg id="9">Rachel Poole, 31, was talking to her husband, Justin Pele Poole on FaceTime Wednesday night when a man identified as 19-year-old Corey Moss broke into their El Paso home and lunged at her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an arrest affidavit obtained by KFOX14, Mrs Poole recognized her assailant as a man who owed her husband money and screamed out his name.</seg>

<seg id="12">The 31-year-old mother-to-be, who is nine months pregnant, was rushed to University Medical Center in critical condition suffering from multiple stab wounds and fractures.</seg>
<seg id="13">Doctors said her unborn baby, who is due in a week, was in good condition.</seg>
<seg id="14">The couple plan to name her Isabella.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to police, the wounded victim was able to call 911 and give the name of the suspect to police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Justin Poele called the 19-year-old's co-workers, who helped apprehend Moss and seized the knife allegedly used in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suspect: Cory Bernard Moss, 19, allegedly admitted to the knife attack, which was reportedly sparked by a money dispute</seg>
<seg id="18">Following his arrest, police said Moss admitted to stabbing Rachel Poole</seg>
<seg id="19">The teenager has been charged with criminal attempted capital murder and was ordered held on $60,000 bond.</seg>
<seg id="20">Neighbors told KFOX14 they that Moss owed the Pooles money for car repairs because he had borrowed a vehicle from them and wrecked it.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to El Paso police, Moss, a soldier attached to Fort Bliss, went to the Pooles' home in the 9400 block of Wichita circle to talk to Rachel about the money he owed her husband.</seg>
<seg id="22">The woman wasn't home, so the 19-year-old allegedly forced his way into the house and lay in ambush, waiting for Mrs Poole to return.</seg>
<seg id="23">When Poole came home, she opened the Apple video chat program FaceTime on her phone and began talking to her husband, who is stationed in southwest Asia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Joy and sorrow: Mr Poole (top right) wrote that their unborn baby girl (bottom right) is doing fine, but his wife (left) had lost an eye</seg>
<seg id="25">A short time later, police say Moss came out of hiding and surprised Rachel Poole from behind, repeatedly stabbing her with a stainless steel knife and beating her.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the affidavit, the victim instantly recognized Moss as her husband's debtor and yelled out his name several times so Justin could hear it over the phone.</seg>
<seg id="27">Following the attack, police say Moss fled and called a co-worker to pick him up and drive him to Fort Bliss.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Justine Pele Poole called Moss' colleagues to tell them about the stabbing and alert the suspect's imminent return to the base.</seg>
<seg id="29">The 19-year-old's co-workers intercepted him and found the knife in the car where he was riding.</seg>

<seg id="1">A stand-off between poverty and power</seg>
<seg id="2">Opposition: "NTPC Go Back" is sprayed on a village in the Karanpura Valley, where plans to mine will displace more than 8000 families.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Ben Doherty</seg>
<seg id="4">In the main street of Pakri Barwadih, the mud-brick homes are daubed with a neat graffito: "NTPC Go Back."</seg>
<seg id="5">NTPC is the government-owned company that wants to mine the rich seam of coal beneath this village in India's second poorest state.</seg>
<seg id="6">The three mines slated for this valley will consume this and 16 other villages, forcing more than 8000 families from their homes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Pakri Barwadih mine in the eastern state of Jharkhand is to be built and run by Thiess, a subsidiary of Australian company Leighton Holdings, in a controversial joint venture with a company owned by the family of India's former coal minister.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Our lives are in this land": Dev Prasad will refuse all offers of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the chai stalls and the village markets, discussion rarely strays from the ore underfoot: who has been charged for resisting the miners; the spectre of armed militants threatening those who protest; and the death of one demonstrator, shot by police, for trying to stop a site office being built in his village.</seg>
<seg id="10">People debate what will become of their land, their livelihoods, and of them.</seg>
<seg id="11">The battle over mining Karanpura Valley, for so long an unhappy undercurrent, has become a roiling rage.</seg>
<seg id="12">In July, as Dr Mithilesh Dangi addressed a community protest in the nearby village of Kushumbha, three men carrying AK47s violently broke up the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="13">They were members of an ultra-left militant gang, the JPC.</seg>
<seg id="14">Founded decades ago as communist insurgencies, the groups, known as Naxals, are politically impotent now, reduced to little more than criminal guns for hire and are common throughout India's lawless eastern "red corridor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"They forced my wife and I, and my colleague Arun into the forest," Dangi said."</seg>
<seg id="16">""They pointed their guns in my face and told me not to interfere with the work of the mining companies."</seg>
<seg id="17">They said they would harm us if we continued to halt the work of Thiess and Deco [a Thiess subcontractor] in the area.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is not known at whose, if anybody's, instruction, the gunmen were acting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But villagers, who ultimately freed Dangi, confirmed the story.</seg>
<seg id="20">The same gunmen had threatened previous protests.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thiess maintains it is uninvolved: "All land access issues are the responsibility of the mine owner."</seg>
<seg id="22">Dev Prasad has known for 10 years that the government wants his land for mining.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thiess's mine will displace 200 families from his village of Kerigada.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prasad will appear in court soon on what he claims is a trumped-up charge of damaging government property, levelled at him for leading protests against the acquisition of his land.</seg>
<seg id="25">He faces fines he can't pay, or jail, but says he can only concern himself with the rice harvest he will bring in in a month.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prasad's land, like others in the lush Karanpura Valley, is unusual in this state.</seg>
<seg id="27">Jharkhand is prone to severe, long-running droughts.</seg>
<seg id="28">About 40 per cent of the state's population lives below the poverty line, and half the children under three are malnourished.</seg>
<seg id="29">But in the Karanpura Valley rains are regular.</seg>
<seg id="30">Prasad's family has worked this land, "my entire ancestry, 15 or 20 generations."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I don't know how long," and he says he will refuse all offers of compensation for it.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact the compensation offered for his acre has been raised (by 50 per cent to $25,000) is evidence, he says, that those offering don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="33">If it was only me, I could take the money and live for the few years at the end of my life.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I have to hand this land on to my children and grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I lose this land they will have nothing.</seg>
<seg id="36">""Our lives are in this land.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without it, who are we?</seg>
<seg id="38">It is not just a house to live in, it is our way of life, our history.</seg>
<seg id="39">I am a farmer.</seg>
<seg id="40">My father passed this land to me and I must pass it to my son.</seg>
<seg id="41">I cannot fail where my ancestors succeeded.""</seg>
<seg id="42">The stand-off in Pakri Barwadih is one being played out across India.</seg>
<seg id="43">The country craves power.</seg>
<seg id="44">Already, demand often outstrips supply by 10 per cent, and more than 400 million Indians live without any electricity at all.</seg>
<seg id="45">Nuclear is slow, costly and controversial.</seg>
<seg id="46">India needs coal.</seg>
<seg id="47">But there is also a growing awareness of the rights of the rural poor and an increasing resistance to the forcible, often uncompensated, land grabs by governments and corporations that have been historically common.</seg>
<seg id="48">India's massive coal reserves are hugely underdeveloped, at enormous cost to its economy, because in a country of 1.2 billion people, the land on top of any potential mine is almost always someone's home.</seg>
<seg id="49">Government-run companies like NTPC, and the private contractors they hire, such as Thiess, are caught in the middle of the struggle between progress and protection.</seg>
<seg id="50">They face intense, often contradictory, pressures.</seg>
<seg id="51">"NTPC was awarded the contract to mine Pakri Barwadih in 2004 but not one tonne of coal has been mined, and the government has threatened to take the licence back, alleging NTPC has "repeatedly failed to keep its promises.""</seg>
<seg id="52">But Development Minister Jairam Ramesh last month warned mining companies against forcing people from their land, saying it fuelled outlaw groups.</seg>
<seg id="53">""This is a sad truth ... that more displacement has been caused by government and public sector projects, particularly in Naxal areas.</seg>
<seg id="54">And this is why Naxalism has grown.</seg>
<seg id="55">Companies must learn to be sensitive, changing aspirations," he said.</seg>
<seg id="56">NTPC will face a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="57">If there is firing in an NTPC project and people get killed in that firing, they cannot acquire the land.</seg>
<seg id="58">Indian companies still believe that they can use government to forcibly acquire land.</seg>
<seg id="59">That era is gone.</seg>
<seg id="60">He was referring to 55-year-old Tarkesh Mahato, who was shot dead in July as he protested against an NTPC mine site office being built in his village of Pagar.</seg>
<seg id="61">Six other men were injured by gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="62">Mahato's protest related to the planned Keredari mine, neighbouring Pakri Barwadih and also run by NTPC.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is no evidence Thiess is contracted to work on that mine.</seg>
<seg id="64">At a village meeting in Pagar attended by Fairfax this week, Tarkesh's widow, Mano Mosuma, said her family faced destitution.</seg>
<seg id="65">"We are facing a hard time, everything is a problem now," she said, weeping.</seg>
<seg id="66">"We want justice," her eldest son, Tilak, said.""</seg>
<seg id="67">Take away the coal block.</seg>
<seg id="68">I will definitely not let them take my land.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fairfax visited Thiess Minecs offices in Barkagaon and Hazaribagh, but was directed to Thiess Australia's Brisbane headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="70">"All issues regarding land access are the responsibility of the mine owner," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="71">Thiess Minecs has not yet commenced mining work at the site and, while land negotiations continue, Thiess Minecs has been working to ensure the welfare of the community.</seg>
<seg id="72">Thiess said it had established a healthcare centre and a training centre for local youth "to help them gain employment at the mine."</seg>
<seg id="73">Once established, the Pakri Barwadih project will provide direct and or indirect employment to thousands of people in one of India's poorest regions.</seg>
<seg id="74">It will have flow-on benefits to the entire community including local schools, training institutes, hospitals and other public infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Young Czechs know they must save.</seg>
<seg id="2">But most of them, do not know what is the interest</seg>
<seg id="3">More and more Czechs are putting money aside.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite this, they will not reach the champion savings level in the region.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most money is put aside by Austrians who save on average 181 euros a month.</seg>
<seg id="6">People in Slovakia save a little more than the Czechs.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is according to a survey carried out by the Erste Group Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also showed that the mood of savers is improving and two thirds of those questioned plan to put more money aside.</seg>
<seg id="9">While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the table of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use only very few savings products.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, according to the survey every other Serb saves money at home "under the pillow."</seg>
<seg id="11">In this country the number of people who save a higher amount each month has risen this year,.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only last year 26 per cent of respondents put aside between 1,000 and 2,500 crowns each month in various types of saving accounts,; this year it is 5 per cent more.</seg>
<seg id="13">However the average monthly deposit in the year-on-year comparison fell slightly to 2078 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="14">The biggest hit amongst saving products is the pension plan.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some 54 per cent of Czechs prefer this, whereas three years ago it was the favourite method for the appreciation of savings for only 36 per cent of people.</seg>
<seg id="16">In contrast, the  popularity of the building savings is decreasing in popularity and compared with last year the interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.</seg>
<seg id="17">These are now used by only 16 per cent of respondents, whereas last year it was almost a quarter of people.</seg>
<seg id="18">The survey also showed that although people consider saving money to be important, the majority of them do not know what the yield is on individual products.</seg>
<seg id="19">Primarily young people up to the age of 30 do not know what interest is paid on their money.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast, the best knowledge of the yield on the money they save has the group of older  respondents – 76 per cent of respondents aged over 50 know that.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the international comparison by Erste Group, Czechs lead in use of online banking, which is used regularly by 44 per cent of people.</seg>
<seg id="22">They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with 12 per cent less.</seg>

<seg id="1">Federal appeals court lifts injunction on Texas abortion law</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Texas can enforce its new restrictive abortion law while it is appealed, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday as it overturned a lower court order.</seg>
<seg id="3">The three-judge panel granted Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott's request to lift an injunction that kept the state from enforcing a requirement that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic, The Dallas Morning News reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel ruled Monday that the requirement was so onerous it would keep many women from having abortions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The American Civil Liberties Union promised the legal fight against the Texas law will continue.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The result of this ruling is not academic," said Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas.</seg>
<seg id="7">Women in many parts of the state will lose access to care they count on because clinics will close.</seg>
<seg id="8">If the State of Texas cares about women's health and safety, as it claims, it should take steps to reduce the need for abortion rather than closing clinics in already underserved parts of the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The appeals court did not deal with another section of the law that Yeakel largely upheld involving the protocol for medically induced abortions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Texas officials argue that the stricter abortion law protects the health of women seeking abortions.</seg>

<seg id="1">First pictures of beautiful baby girl found abandoned inside carrier bag in a park yesterday</seg>
<seg id="2">Newborn has been nick-named 'Baby Jade' by staff treating her in hospital</seg>
<seg id="3">She was named after the dog which found her in a Birmingham park</seg>
<seg id="4">Police are hunting for the girl's mother and carrying out DNA test</seg>
<seg id="5">These are the first pictures of a newborn baby who was found abandoned inside a carrier bag in a park yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The little girl, dubbed 'Baby Jade' after the dog which discovered her crying in the bushes, is believed to be just a day or two old, and still had the umbilical cord attached.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police are urgently hunting for the mother of the child, who is now 'happy and contented' in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="8">Found: This newborn girl, known as 'Baby Jade', was discovered in a Birmingham park</seg>
<seg id="9">Safe: The girl is now recovering in hospital, but police have not yet tracked down her mother</seg>
<seg id="10">As well as several photos of the tiny girl, West Midlands Police have released a heartwarming Instagram video in order to raise the likelihood of someone recognising her.</seg>
<seg id="11">The baby was found by Roger Wilday as he was walking his dog Jade through a community park in the Stechford area of Birmingham yesterday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 68-year-old was led to the newborn by his pet, who refused to leave the child's side until Mr Wilday came to investigate.</seg>
<seg id="13">'Jade has grown up with children around her, she loves babies and when she found the baby in the bushes she wouldn't leave until she knew I had seen it,' the retired engineer said.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a hero dog.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was no-one else in the park at the time and it was very cold.</seg>
<seg id="16">If it wasn't for Jade that baby could have been dead.</seg>
<seg id="17">Newborn: Jade was apparently no more than a day old when she was abandoned in Birmingham</seg>
<seg id="18">I always take her to the park and we were out walking - she was off the lead and headed off towards the bushes.</seg>
<seg id="19">She wouldn't come back when I called her and so I had to go over, and I saw the bag and then I heard a baby cry.</seg>
<seg id="20">I reached down to look at the bag closer and I saw there was a baby inside wrapped in a light blue blanket.</seg>
<seg id="21">I dialled 999 and picked the baby up, and within a minute the police and ambulance were here.</seg>
<seg id="22">'She was a tiny little thing, you could tell she must have been recently born, she was still warm so I don't think she had been there long.'</seg>
<seg id="23">Baby Jade, who weighs around 6lbs, is currently being treated in Birmingham Heartlands Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="24">The towel and carrier bag which she was wrapped in have been sent for forensic testing, while officers hope that DNA tests will help them identify her parents.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hero: This dog, named Jade, found the newborn in a carrier bag hidden in a bush yesterday</seg>
<seg id="26">Hunt: Police are scouring the park in Stechford in an effort to find clues about Baby Jade's origins</seg>
<seg id="27">Officers are continuing to make house-to-house inquiries near the park where the baby was found.</seg>
<seg id="28">Birmingham East Chief Inspector Ian Green said: 'It is fantastic news that baby Jade is recovering well in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="29">'I'm told she's very alert and a contented, happy baby.</seg>
<seg id="30">She's doing well and should make a full recovery over the next couple of days - but of course what she really needs is to be in her mother's arms.</seg>
<seg id="31">'I'd urge Jade's mum to make contact with us on the 101 police number so we can reunite them and get her medical attention and emotional support.'</seg>
<seg id="32">He added: 'Paediatricians have confirmed the baby was lucky to be found when she was as even just a few more hours exposed to the elements could have had fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="33">'Thankfully, we now know she's safe and well - and our priority is very much on finding her mum to ensure her safety and to provide whatever support she needs.</seg>
<seg id="34">'We're still keen to hear from witnesses who were in the park yesterday - especially anyone who saw somebody with a carrier bag from The Entertainer toy shop - or anyone who believes they could have information that will lead us to identify the mother.'</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone with information about the child is urged to contact West Midlands Police as quickly as possible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bats confirmed to carry SARS</seg>
<seg id="2">(UPI) -- New research suggests it's luck -- not prevention -- behind the lack of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome reported since 2004.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2002, SARS killed 750 people and sickened 8,000 more and cost the global economy at least $40 billion.</seg>
<seg id="4">SARS is part of the "coronavirus" family and infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="5">Researchers found that a colony of bats in southern China carry at least seven SARS-like viruses.</seg>
<seg id="6">At least one of those viruses can infect people directly, according to the study, published in Nature.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the strongest evidence yet that SARS may come from bats, especially since the viruses can spread from any sort of contact from the mammals.</seg>
<seg id="8">Past research suggested that people picked up SARS from mongoose-like creatures called civets, a delicacy in southern China, but they may no longer be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because the disease can transmit directly from bats to humans without an intermediary, a SARS outbreak will be much harder to control or prevent.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the civet may have initially introduced SARS to humans, they weren't necessary.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It changes the equation" for public health, lead author Peter Daszak said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thousands chip in to help family adopt</seg>
<seg id="2">The Watkins family, from left: Kristen, Duane and Chaltu.</seg>
<seg id="3">The family dog, Babs, has passed away since this photo was taken.</seg>
<seg id="4">Family turns to crowd-funding for help with adoption</seg>
<seg id="5">Donations pour in from 41 countries</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the donations are in $10 increments</seg>
<seg id="7">Family is stunned, speechless by the overwhelming response</seg>
<seg id="8">(CNN) -- Kristen Watkins had just pulled into a parking spot at her local Target store when the full significance of the previous 24 hours hit her.</seg>
<seg id="9">She remembers one of her favorite songs, "You Love Me Anyway" by the Sidewalk Prophets, playing in the background:</seg>
<seg id="10">But you love me anyway It's like nothing in life that I've ever known Yes you love me anyway Oh Lord how you love me.</seg>
<seg id="11">How you love me.</seg>
<seg id="12">Her husband, Duane, says kindness is too small a word to describe what their family experienced the day Brandon Stanton, who was practically a stranger, agreed to help raise the $26,000 they needed to complete the adoption of their son in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="13">And if it hadn't been for the bad traffic that day in New York City, the whole chain of events might never have happened.</seg>
<seg id="14">Stanton is a bond trader-turned-photographer who launched the website Humans of New York almost three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was recently featured on CNN.com for his book of photographs based on the website, which reached No.</seg>
<seg id="16">1 on the New York Times best-seller list.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although he focused mostly on New Yorkers, Stanton has also featured stories about people from as far away as Iran.</seg>
<seg id="18">His stories have titles like, "The Forbidden Ones," "The Chess Hustler" and "The Happiest Accident."</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to stories, he posts portraits of unique moments in the city, such as one of himself, Col. Chris Hadfield and David Karp, founder and CEO of Tumblr, who is dressed like a slice of bacon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Needless to say, Stanton is an interesting guy.</seg>
<seg id="21">And because he is interesting, Duane Watkins, a television photographer, was part of a crew doing a story about Stanton.</seg>
<seg id="22">Duane was driving the crew and Stanton around New York when Duane remarked how similar traffic in the city was to Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ethiopia?</seg>
<seg id="24">Stanton asked.</seg>
<seg id="25">What story were you working on there?</seg>
<seg id="26">"It wasn't a story," Duane replied.</seg>
<seg id="27">We were picking up our daughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">Stanton blogged most of the conversation between himself and Duane.</seg>
<seg id="29">It revealed some of the most intimate decisions made by couples about adoption.</seg>
<seg id="30">Duane admitted he was initially against adoption, even though Kristen was for it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Time went by, and one day, while watching a show about aid work in Ethiopia, he opened up to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="32">But it was not as easy as they'd hoped.</seg>
<seg id="33">First, they had to abandon the idea of adopting an infant.</seg>
<seg id="34">Then they released the hope of adopting a toddler.</seg>
<seg id="35">Finally, Stanton wrote, they were shown a photo of an unsmiling 7-year-old girl who had been blinded in one eye.</seg>
<seg id="36">"That's our daughter," Duane had said.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's been three years since Chaltu joined the Watkins family.</seg>
<seg id="38">Duane says he loves telling the story because each time he does, he gets to relive it: Relive meeting his daughter for the first time; relive the first awkward conversations; relive bringing her home; relive the expansion of his heart he wasn't sure was possible.</seg>
<seg id="39">And so, after three years, he, Kristen and Chaltu were ready to expand the family.</seg>
<seg id="40">Again they were drawn to Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="41">And again they were challenged to set aside what they thought they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Richard" (not his real name) is an older boy between 8 and 16.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the advice of a social worker, Kristen and Duane are protective of their son's identity, so much so they've asked that even the name of the adoption agency be kept confidential.</seg>
<seg id="44">When Duane met Stanton, they had done what they could in terms of paperwork and paying fees, but now the "big chunk" of money was due, and the family didn't have it.</seg>
<seg id="45">"We held a yard sale last weekend," Duane said.</seg>
<seg id="46">We had an epiphany that all the material things we had were not meaningful and decided to sell everything that wasn't essential.</seg>
<seg id="47">Out went Duane's music equipment.</seg>
<seg id="48">His cameras.</seg>
<seg id="49">Anything they thought might get in the way of bringing Richard home.</seg>
<seg id="50">At the end of the day, it wasn't enough.</seg>
<seg id="51">And then he met Brandon Stanton.</seg>
<seg id="52">On October 29 at roughly 6:30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="53">EST, the "Let's Bring Richard Home" page was launched on the crowd-funding site Indiegogo.</seg>
<seg id="54">What happened next stunned everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">Except perhaps Stanton.</seg>
<seg id="56">Indiegogo is an international crowd-funding platform that has raised millions of dollars for campaigns worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="57">Campaigns range from $35,000 for a skate park to $7,500 to send video games to deployed soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Users are charged either 4% or 9% of funds raised, depending on whether or not they reach their goal.</seg>
<seg id="59">Stanton created the Indiegogo page for the Watkinses then posted it to the Humans of New York Facebook page, which has more than 1.6 million fans.</seg>
<seg id="60">The post was shared more than 12,000 times.</seg>
<seg id="61">A second post, updating fans about the fundraiser's progress, received an additional 3,400 shares and thousands of comments.</seg>
<seg id="62">Are you watching this?</seg>
<seg id="63">Stanton asked Duane over the phone about an hour after the page went live.</seg>
<seg id="64">"No, I'm working," Duane replied.</seg>
<seg id="65">"It was crazy," Kristen said.</seg>
<seg id="66">She was also at work but had access to her iPad.</seg>
<seg id="67">I'm not rendered speechless very often.</seg>
<seg id="68">But I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="69">I couldn't stop hitting 'refresh.'</seg>
<seg id="70">Neither could her mother, who was watching on her own iPad.</seg>
<seg id="71">Judging from the comments on the site and Facebook, they were definitely not alone.</seg>
<seg id="72">In less than 90 minutes, the $26,000 goal had been met.</seg>
<seg id="73">Indiegogo says it was one of the fastest-funded campaigns in its history, raising money from thousands of people from 41 countries.</seg>
<seg id="74">But even after the goal was met, people continued to contribute.</seg>
<seg id="75">And comment.</seg>
<seg id="76">And by the end of the campaign, contributions totaled more than $83,000 to bring Richard home, and for their children's education.</seg>
<seg id="77">The majority were made in $10 increments.</seg>
<seg id="78">"We were just kind of shell-shocked," Duane said.</seg>
<seg id="79">Which brings us back to the parking lot at Target where Kristen sat, crying, when what had happened hit her.</seg>
<seg id="80">All these strangers around the world felt compelled to give us money to help us do this.</seg>
<seg id="81">I just lost it.</seg>
<seg id="82">I just really realized the compassion and the love.</seg>
<seg id="83">We stayed up until 2 a.m. trying to read every comment.</seg>
<seg id="84">What the Watkinses really hope, however, is that this has created a "tipping point" of sorts for anyone considering adoption -- especially adoption of older children.</seg>
<seg id="85">When they explained the fundraiser to Chaltu, she appeared to take it in stride.</seg>
<seg id="86">People helping other people, "It all seemed very normal to her," Kristen said.</seg>
<seg id="87">The Watkinses say they now have many decisions to make, including how much of Richard's journey to share with those who helped make his adoption possible.</seg>
<seg id="88">Advice has ranged from saying nothing at all to posting every update.</seg>
<seg id="89">"It takes compassion to fill another person's loss with something positive," Duane said.</seg>
<seg id="90">The word 'kindness' shortchanges it.</seg>
<seg id="91">It's deeper than that.</seg>
<seg id="92">It became less about money and more about what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="93">People wanted to be a part of a compassionate movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anti-corruption police analyst arrested by inspectorate together with Bárta</seg>
<seg id="2">Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was brought by the server Prvnízpravy.cz.</seg>
<seg id="3">MF DNES soon discovered that the General Inspectorate of the Security Forces (GIBS) was in charge of the case; its people were arresting Bárta in the centre of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="4">It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The inspectorate solves cases where the defendants include police, although the jurisdiction also applies to civilians.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to MF DNES, the detainees include one of the officers of the anti-corruption police – the head of the analytics and informatics division Jan Petržílek.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has previously worked for the Security Intelligence Service (BIS).</seg>
<seg id="8">Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the information, however, adding that the media must in this case contact the GIBS.</seg>
<seg id="9">Radka Sandorová, spokesperson for the inspectorate, did not want to say anything about the case, referring immediately to the Prague Municipal Prosecutor’s Office.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We will not comment on this query with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prosecutor’s Office.</seg>
<seg id="11">From this vague reaction, it can also be deduced that the event took place, but is in a classified regime, which does not allow a spokesperson to say anything specific.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bárta’s lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">He told the media that he is representing Bárta "in this matter as well", but due to the fact it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bárta’s arrest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some media speculated earlier that Bárta’s arrest could be connected to the former chief of police Petr Lessy.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was Bárta and former Public Affairs chairman Radek John, who headed the Ministry of the Interior, who put him in the post.</seg>
<seg id="16">The dispute which erupted because of this between former prime minister Petr Nečas and Public Affairs had to be dealt with by the president at the time, Václav Klaus.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don’t know where this connection to me came from.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nobody contacted me, I wasn’t questioned.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I really know nothing about the matter," Lessy told iDNES.cz.</seg>
<seg id="20">In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.</seg>
<seg id="21">Though officially Radek John pulled the strings to get him there, the true head of the party at the time was Bárta.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bárta was a candidate in the election for the Dawn movement, but he just missed out on a parliamentary mandate – by 175 votes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Dawn’s leader, Tomio Okamura, declared that he had no idea what it was about.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Vít Bárta was one of many candidates from many parties on our list of candidates, and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not and is not a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," said Okamura, distancing himself from Bárta, having said before the election that he gave Bárta space to be a Dawn candidate because he helped him to fix a problem with executors.</seg>
<seg id="25">Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former party colleague from Public Affairs, Jaroslav Škárka.</seg>

<seg id="1">Welcomed With Kisses, Stanford Freshmen Risk the "Kissing Disease"</seg>
<seg id="2">STANFORD, Calif. - It is minutes to midnight.</seg>
<seg id="3">A sultry full moon hangs over Stanford's Memorial Church, bathing the campus's red roofs and adobe-toned walls.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Quad, thousands of students mill around, some bobbing drunkenly, some giggling nervously, most of them wearing clothes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Finally, a male senior saunters over to a group of the youngest-looking women and asks: "Hey!"</seg>
<seg id="6">You freshmen?</seg>
<seg id="7">Can I kiss you?</seg>
<seg id="8">As the Stanford Band plays and a giant screen shows famous movie clutches, the bravest women step forward and receive the traditional welcome to one of the nation's most prestigious universities: a big wet upperclassman smack.</seg>
<seg id="9">Days later, another tradition arrives: flu and mononucleosis, the "kissing disease," sweep the dorms.</seg>
<seg id="10">Full Moon on the Quad - normally celebrated beneath the academic year's first full moon but this year held on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="11">22 because of a conflict with Homecoming Week - is an event unique in American education: an orgy of interclass kissing reluctantly but officially sanctioned by the university.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a domestic example of a new field in public health, "mass-gathering medicine."</seg>
<seg id="13">The best-known example is Saudi Arabia's multimillion-dollar efforts to keep the annual pilgrimage to Mecca as epidemic-free as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">For Stanford, the struggle is: Since officials can't outlaw it (yes, they have tried), how can they make it safer?</seg>
<seg id="15">The first step, said Dr. Ira M. Friedman, director of the Vaden Student Health Center, is to make consent paramount.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We try to create an environment in which they don't feel they must participate in the exchange of oral secretions," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">His center also offers shots against what it can fight: flu and meningococcal meningitis, a rare but sometimes dangerous infection known as "freshman meningitis."</seg>
<seg id="18">To make it safer, the evening is overseen by student sobriety monitors and decorated with hand-drawn signs - of the ilk that usually say "Beat Cal" - but bearing slogans like "Consent is Sexy."</seg>
<seg id="19">But the most crucial role is played by the "peer health educators" who live in each dorm.</seg>
<seg id="20">They meet with freshmen before, and ask any with cold symptoms to feel free to watch, but not to kiss anyone.</seg>
<seg id="21">And they teach safe kissing.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We tell them, "Don't floss beforehand, don't brush, don't do anything that could create microabrasions in your gums for germs to get in," said Michelle Lee Mederos, a former educator who graduated in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="23">And we have tables where we offer mints and little Dixie cups of mouthwash.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mouthwash is the main line of defense.</seg>
<seg id="25">This year there were two tables dotted with paper cups, along with condoms and other sexual health supplies.</seg>
<seg id="26">The educators also have square latex dental dams to offer, "but they're generally made fun of," said Ms. Mederos, who used them in dorm demonstrations of how to safely perform oral sex on a woman.</seg>
<seg id="27">In two years of ordering supplies, I had to order them only once - for those demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="28">Although the conventional wisdom is that mononucleosis spikes after the event, the health center has never compiled that data, Dr. Friedman said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's also flu season," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But we do think the event is a potentiator.</seg>
<seg id="31">The event's origins are lost in the fog of history; legend holds that it began in the late 1800s with senior men presenting freshman women with roses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Later, it waxed and waned, reputedly practiced sometimes by some fraternities.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many graduates over age 40 have never heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1988, several student officers made it formal.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It was folklore," said Julie Lythcott-Haims, one of those officers.</seg>
<seg id="36">We took it off the shelf and dusted it off.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had roses, a string quartet, maybe some champagne.</seg>
<seg id="38">A couple of hundred students showed up.</seg>
<seg id="39">When she returned a decade later as an administrator (she eventually became the beloved "Freshman Dean Julie"), it had "become a thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thousands were showing up.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was crazy, it was wild.</seg>
<seg id="42">There were concerns about alcohol and safety.</seg>
<seg id="43">Starting in 2002, deans debated outlawing it, rejected that as futile and decided to impose order instead.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now the Quad is barricaded.</seg>
<seg id="45">Campus police check student IDs.</seg>
<seg id="46">Paramedics stand by.</seg>
<seg id="47">A concert is held so nonkissers have something to do.</seg>
<seg id="48">It has been canceled only once: in 2009, the "pandemic swine flu" year.</seg>
<seg id="49">After East Coast schools, which open earlier, reported outbreaks, "we decided we couldn't live with the risk," Dr. Friedman said.</seg>
<seg id="50">So we made a very unpopular decision.</seg>
<seg id="51">Francisca Gilmore, a freshman that year, said in an email interview from an internship in Cambodia that she and some classmates braved the odds anyway.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Unofficially, a bunch of overeager freshmen and intoxicated upperclassmen gathered on the Quad and upheld the tradition," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="53">Dr. Friedman conceded that the ban "didn't work 100 percent, but I think it made some difference."</seg>
<seg id="54">Lots of students got flu, "but we weren't as high as national or even regional rates," he said.</seg>
<seg id="55">Since 2002, new traditions have emerged, leaving yesterday's roses looking wilted.</seg>
<seg id="56">One co-op's contingent attends wearing just body paint.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is a "same-sex kissing" area.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry: US Surveillance Went "Too Far" at Times</seg>
<seg id="2">AP photo.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. surveillance has been happening "on automatic pilot" and in some cases have gone "too far inappropriately," Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The president and others have dodged questions on whether Obama was in fact unaware of the programs, particularly reported eavesdropping on foreign leaders.</seg>
<seg id="5">U.S. government officials have been reluctant to discuss "alleged" activities and details reported by various news outlets, including The Guardian, the German magazine Der Spiegel, and The Wall Street Journal.</seg>
<seg id="6">"And yes, in some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately," Kerry said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kerry defended the large-scale surveillance that has come under criticism, asserting that it has prevented terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans," Kerry said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we attempted to look at it in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="7">To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other</seg>
<seg id="10">Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.</seg>

<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not easy," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people can die because they are waiting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.</seg>
<seg id="26">Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="29">And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their luck doesn't always hold out.</seg>
<seg id="33">They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We are receiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="38">They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This will change my future with my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I'm not sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.</seg>
<seg id="54">He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="57">That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.</seg>
<seg id="58">The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="59">But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He's a hero, without a doubt," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="61">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.</seg>
<seg id="62">For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.</seg>
<seg id="63">Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think about my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees what I am doing.</seg>
<seg id="67">To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.</seg>

<seg id="3">"The assessment will be undertaken by Ofgem working closely with the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition and Markets Authority, when it comes into being," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The exact metrics for the review will be a matter for the regulators but I will be asking them to look in depth and across the energy sector at profits and prices, barriers to entry and consumer engagement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Other measures include:</seg>

<seg id="7">A report from Ofgem on the transparency of energy companies' financial accounts.</seg>
<seg id="8">A speeding-up of the process for switching suppliers "with an ambition to move to switching in 24 hours, rather than the current five weeks, without increasing consumer bills"</seg>

<seg id="2">THE Federal Government will inject $325 million into Tasmania's ailing health system, health minister Tanya Plibersek says.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ms Plibersek announced today the Commonwealth was taking "urgent action" to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie and Tasmanian Labor MPs.</seg>

<seg id="6">The funding includes money for extra operations such as orthopedic and cataract surgery, the set up of walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston for minor injuries, better after hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the roll out of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="7">"These investments respond to the ideas that frontline clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Menzies auction in Melbourne last night where Brett Whiteley's My Armchair sold for a record price Picture: Sarah Matray Source: HeraldSun</seg>
<seg id="3">THE art market may not be at the highs of 2007 but that didn't stop Brett Whiteley's serene My Armchair from selling at auction last night for a record price for the late artist.</seg>
<seg id="4">The large blue Lavender Bay interior, painted during what have been called Whiteley's "astral weeks" of 1976, went under the hammer for $3.2 million ($3,927,272 including buyer's premium).</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the second-highest work to sell at auction in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="6">The record sale at the Menzies auction in Melbourne eclipsed Whiteley's The Olgas for Ernest Giles, sold for $2.9m ($3.48m) in 2007 when the market was at its peak.</seg>
<seg id="7">My Armchair went to Melbourne dealer John Playfoot, who believes it is Whiteley's best work.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is confident he will find a buyer at a better price.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This will go, I would think, to a private collection, and we have got two in mind," Playfoot said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Art specialist Tim Abdallah said the record sale positions the late artist as the "centre of gravity" in the art market.</seg>
<seg id="11">Abdallah, head of art at Menzies Art Brands, said My Armchair was sold at a fair price for the artist.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I think it is worth pretty much what it got," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whiteley in my opinion is the centre of gravity in our (art) world, the dominant figure.</seg>
<seg id="14">The demand for his work is justified.</seg>
<seg id="15">None of us are surprised.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Menzies sale of Australian and international fine art and sculpture achieved sales of $8.518m including premiums.</seg>
<seg id="17">The sales result was 73 per cent by volume and 80 per cent by value.</seg>
<seg id="18">There were disappointments, as works by Charles Blackman, Garry Shead, Russell Drysdale and Arthur Boyd were passed in.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sidney Nolan's Ned Kelly and the Mountain Trooper sold for $480,000 ($600,000 including premium), short of the upper estimate of $700,000.</seg>
<seg id="20">The market had not bounced back to the heady days of 2007 but Abdallah said there was renewed interest in "traditional paintings," such as those by Norman Lindsay and Arthur Streeton.</seg>
<seg id="21">A big sale such as the Whiteley, he added, gave encouragement to others in the market.</seg>
<seg id="22">The hammer fell quickly during early lots, and auctioneer Martin Farrah moved on to the headline Whiteley picture.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Here is something I am certain we are not passing on, otherwise I have lost my job," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bids started at $2.7m, rose to $3m and then concluded with Playfoot's winning bid of $3.2m.</seg>
<seg id="25">The price is the second-highest paid for an Australian work at auction; the record is Nolan's First-Class Marksman, which sold in 2010 for $4.5m ($5.4m including premium).</seg>
<seg id="26">My Armchair has been owned by a Melbourne couple since 1976 when they bought it at a show of Whiteley's work.</seg>
<seg id="27">The picture represents several of Whiteley's preoccupations of the time, including Matisse and musician Van Morrison.</seg>
<seg id="28">An inscription in the upper right of the picture refers to Morrison's album Astral Weeks.</seg>

<seg id="1">France, a master at espionage, under few illusions on US spying</seg>
<seg id="2">There is a joke in Paris that the Americans can listen to everything the French are saying, but the way French government works is so complicated they will never understand a thing.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was recounted by a former senior diplomat this week as a way to put into context the ultimately ambivalent reaction by President François Hollande's socialist government to the allegations swirling across the Atlantic of mass electronic spying on European governments and citizens by the US National Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">In public, Mr Hollande adopted a tough stance, calling the revelations "totally unacceptable" and telephoning President Barack Obama to complain.</seg>
<seg id="5">The official spokeswoman for his government, cabinet minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, this week disdainfully dismissed as "implausible" denials of mass surveillance by General Keith Alexander, head of the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="6">But diplomats and officials say this reaction amounted to little more than political theatre.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Hollande delivered the minimum posturing and shadow boxing," said one official.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has not sought to manipulate this for some Anglo-Saxon bashing.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has not joined those seeking to use it to hold up the transatlantic trade talks [about which France is lukewarm].</seg>
<seg id="10">Nor has there been much public outrage in France over the issue, even within the ranks of Mr Hollande's leftist supporters.</seg>
<seg id="11">The French are rather cynical.</seg>
<seg id="12">"They expect these things to be happening," said the official.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nicole Bricq, the trade minister, said there was "no point in whining" about spying allegations - instead France should improve its own intelligence gathering.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Hollande called for a "code of conduct" to be hammered out between the US and European states on intelligence gathering, but specifically ruled out France seeking to have an enhanced relationship with Washington along the lines of the "five eyes" grouping made up of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="15">Much is explained on the French side by a shrewd understanding of US surveillance capabilities, established intelligence sharing with Washington, particularly on terrorism, and by France's own determination to sustain its own considerable intelligence-gathering capacity.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I don't believe anyone in the business had any doubt that if [the Americans] wanted to do it, they could," said the official.</seg>
<seg id="17">A foreign diplomat in Paris said: "The French were probably aware of what had been going on."</seg>
<seg id="18">The ground rules are you use as much of what you have as much as you can and try not to miss any opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="19">That's what all states do.</seg>
<seg id="20">In public at least, there has been no specific allegation that Mr Hollande's mobile phone was tapped, unlike that of German chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="21">But there are no illusions on the French side.</seg>
<seg id="22">A lesson was learnt in 1994 when France lost out on a big aerospace contract for Airbus in Saudi Arabia to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, apparently after a phone call by the then prime minister Edouard Balladur, in which he discussed the terms Airbus had offered, was intercepted by US intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="23">And, according to an NSA document published this week by Le Monde newspaper, France suspected the US agency of being behind a sophisticated hacking attack on the Elysée Palace last year in the latter days of Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have a technical intelligence operation that we began to modernise in the 1980s and which is undoubtedly one of the best in the world</seg>
<seg id="25">Philippe Hayez, former deputy director of DGSE</seg>
<seg id="26">France itself is no slouch at the spying game, played mainly through the DCRI internal intelligence agency, and the DGSE, its external counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="27">Le Monde reported recently that the DGSE itself has a mass telephone, email and internet interception operation.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We have a technical intelligence operation that we began to modernise in the 1980s and which is undoubtedly one of the best in the world." said Philippe Hayez, former deputy director of DGSE, in an interview with the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The DCRI is held in high esteem by the FBI and MI5 [the UK domestic intelligence service]," said the former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="30">I have heard the British say, we open our books to you because your people are very good and very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paris will probably seek to keep intelligence relations with the US on an even keel, in a spirit of mutual recognition that allies have always spied on allies.</seg>
<seg id="32">The episode could even lead to "great mutual understanding over sensitivities and needs," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nonetheless, the sheer scale of the alleged NSA activity may have sown a doubt.</seg>
<seg id="34">The former diplomat said they could prove "a drop of poison" in a relationship that has been undermined by the decline in US strategic interest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="35">"They do seem to be saying, buzz off: we have the technology, it is for your own good, so just shut up," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
<seg id="5">Google is accused of infringing seven patents.</seg>
<seg id="6">The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</seg>
<seg id="7">Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</seg>
<seg id="8">Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="11">After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe," the lawsuit said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.</seg>

<seg id="10">While Hunt is the face of a very public institution, he is reserved and unassuming.</seg>
<seg id="11">Still, rather than duck for cover, Hunt, unbeknown to some of his top advisers, invited several of the most disgruntled season-ticket holders to lunch to hear them out.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I wanted them to understand that I cared and it was hard for me, too," he said before the Chiefs defeated the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year's bleak season turned downright ghastly on Dec.</seg>
<seg id="14">1, when linebacker Jovan Belcher shot his girlfriend and then drove to the Chiefs" training complex and shot himself in front of the team's coach and general manager.</seg>
<seg id="15">The murder-suicide rocked Hunt, who in his father's tradition has tried to cultivate a family feel for the organization.</seg>
<seg id="16">Taking Action, Fast</seg>
<seg id="17">With that legacy frayed, Hunt acted quickly.</seg>
<seg id="18">Days after the Chiefs" season ended, he fired Coach Romeo Crennel and hired Andy Reid, who had been dismissed by the Philadelphia Eagles after a successful run.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hunt then courted John Dorsey, who had worked with Reid in Green Bay, to replace General Manager Scott Pioli, whose tenure was rocky.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hunt vowed to take a more active role in running the team.</seg>
<seg id="21">He rewrote the organizational chart so Reid would report directly to him, not through the general manager, as had been the custom for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">He also publicly apologized.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I am embarrassed by the poor product we gave our fans this season, and I believe we have no choice but to move the franchise in a different direction," Hunt said in a statement after Crennel's firing.</seg>
<seg id="24">The moves quickly paid dividends and have helped Hunt win over skeptics who had accused him of being disengaged.</seg>
<seg id="25">This season, the Chiefs are the last unbeaten team in the N.F.L. at 8-0, their best start in a decade.</seg>
<seg id="26">From 1970 to 2011, teams with a 2-14 record or worse had managed no better than a 5-3 start the next season.</seg>
<seg id="27">These Chiefs have been driven largely by their defense, which has held teams to 17 points or fewer in every game this season.</seg>
<seg id="28">The offense has relied on running back Jamaal Charles and quarterback Alex Smith, who has reignited his career after losing the starting job with San Francisco last season.</seg>
<seg id="29">"For the most part, most people seem to be back in love with Clark Hunt," said Eric Granell, a founder of Save Our Chiefs who recently renamed the group the Chiefs Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="30">It might be the best case of selective amnesia imaginable.</seg>
<seg id="31">But now the organization seems to be on solid footing.</seg>
<seg id="32">The euphoria is spreading.</seg>
<seg id="33">After fans at the Seattle Seahawks" CenturyLink Field broke the Chiefs" record for noisiest stadium, Kansas City fans rallied to take back the title, hitting 137.5 decibels during a game against the Oakland Raiders.</seg>
<seg id="34">To celebrate a recent victory, linebacker Tamba Hali left almost $1,300 as a tip at a steakhouse.</seg>
<seg id="35">Out of a Shadow</seg>
<seg id="36">While Chiefs fans are counting their blessings, questions remain for the team, which plays at Buffalo on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Like their big rivals, the Denver Broncos, the Chiefs have had an easy schedule.</seg>
<seg id="38">And without a flashy offense like Denver's, they could fade against tougher opponents in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="39">Still, the revival has been a milestone of sorts for Hunt, 48, the youngest owner in the league.</seg>
<seg id="40">For decades, he lived in the shadow of his pioneering father, who helped found the American Football League, the N.B.A."s Chicago Bulls, World Championship Tennis and Major League Soccer, at one point owning three M.L.S. clubs.</seg>
<seg id="41">Groomed to succeed his father, Clark Hunt has grown into his role as steward of the family's sports empire.</seg>
<seg id="42">Hunt, the grandson of H. L. Hunt, an oil tycoon, was raised in Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="43">He could have coasted through college at Southern Methodist, his father's alma mater, but instead finished at the top of his class and was a two-time academic all-American in soccer.</seg>

<seg id="1">If Parliament were a business, Harper would be in serious trouble</seg>
<seg id="2">Last week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper repeated over and over that if anyone doubted whether Senators Mike Duffy, Pamela Wallin and Patrick Brazeau should be suspended without pay, they had only to imagine what would happen in a private company.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was a strong sound bite, and lit up his backbench, who at that point were desperate for any kind of vigorous counter-attack, but it may not be the best analogy to stick with.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here are some reasons why.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a private company, if an employee had asked superiors whether they were in compliance with policy and had been reassured that they were, they might at least have an argument that the company was complicit in the wrongful act.</seg>
<seg id="6">If some (very few, up to 13?) company superiors were aware of or conspired in assembling money and concocting falsehoods to obscure unethical behaviour, well...at the very least, the company would want to ensure that justice was not just swift, but fair, and shared among all those who played a role.</seg>
<seg id="7">If any of that sounds like a defence of Mike Duffy, it's not.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Duffy acknowledged participating in acts that were unethical, including lying to Canadians about what he did.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a corporate setting with rules to promote whistle blowing, Mr. Duffy's revelations might well earn him a lighter sanction.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead Mr. Duffy's judge is someone with an obvious conflict of interest, who seems to feel that Mr. Duffy is even more worthy of censure because he revealed uncomfortable facts.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pushing the corporate analogy further, it's a fair bet that if the Prime Minister were the CEO of a major corporation, he would be on the carpet with his board of directors by now.</seg>
<seg id="12">Likely, there would already have been at least one emergency board meeting.</seg>
<seg id="13">At that meeting, board members, living up to their obligations, would be asking probing questions of the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="14">If they received as little, or as inconsistent information as Canadians are getting, I suspect the CEO would be removed, lawyers would be called in to help understand and limit the liability to the company, and someone would have made a public statement apologizing on behalf of the company.</seg>
<seg id="15">But let's imagine the CEO disclosed more to the board, and that the facts were essentially consistent with the story Mr. Harper has most recently laid out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Would board members say thanks for sharing, good by us, see you next quarter?</seg>
<seg id="17">Doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="18">More likely, they would explore how the issue has been managed, discuss the damage that had been done to the reputation of the company, the morale of its employees and its future business prospects.</seg>
<seg id="19">Among the questions that might come up:</seg>
<seg id="20">Why there hadn't been more complete disclosure earlier?</seg>
<seg id="21">What had been done to correct for the culture that had led to several people participating in a deceit that put the company's reputation at such risk?</seg>
<seg id="22">Have all the miscreants been identified and dealt with?</seg>
<seg id="23">If there were people who knew about the scheme and failed to blow the whistle, were they still on the payroll, and if so why?</seg>
<seg id="24">Why should it be considered "normal" to arrange payment of the legal costs of an offending employee's participation in a deceit?</seg>
<seg id="25">When Mr. Harper muses that private sector codes of conduct should be the standard by which his government should proceed, this invites unflattering analysis.</seg>
<seg id="26">As bad as "staff" conduct appears, a diligent board of directors would by now critically examining the judgment exercised by management.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr. Harper is probably fortunate that politics doesn't operate by business management standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because it's far from clear whether a private company would enthusiastically back a leader who had made the choices the Prime Minister has been making for the last six months, in this affair.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the very least, they would demand better going forward.</seg>

<seg id="1">Young Smokers Top NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg's List of Dislikes</seg>
<seg id="2">New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's move to stymie smoking among young New Yorkers moved one step closer to realization Wednesday when the City Council voted overwhelmingly to bump the tobacco-purchasing age from 18 to 21.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We know that tobacco dependence can begin very soon after a young person first tries smoking, so it's critical that we stop young people from smoking before they ever start," Bloomberg said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The mayor has 30 days to sign the bill into law, after which time young smokers will have 180 days to stock up before the ban.</seg>
<seg id="5">The City Council also voted in favor of a $10.50-a-pack minimum price for cigarettes, and for steps to bolster law enforcement on illegal tobacco sales.</seg>
<seg id="6">Smoking isn't the only vice on Bloomberg's list of dislikes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Click through for more.</seg>
<seg id="8">Young Smokers, Colorful Cigarette Cartons</seg>
<seg id="9">City Council's vote Wednesday to raise the tobacco-purchasing age to 21 gives New York the toughest tobacco laws of any major city.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bloomberg has also proposed legislation that would require stores to keep cigarettes out of sight, hidden behind counters or in bins or closets so that children and former smokers would not be tempted to buy them.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Such displays suggest that smoking is a normal activity, and they invite young people to experiment with tobacco," Bloomberg said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Big Gulps</seg>
<seg id="13">Mayor Bloomberg's soda ban, which would have outlawed the sale of sodas larger than 16 ounces, was struck down by the New York Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court ruled that the ban was "arbitrary and capricious," but Bloomberg vowed to continue the fight.</seg>
<seg id="15">Bloomberg touted his health policies after the law was struck down, saying they "helped New Yorkers live longer, healthier lives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Life expectancy in our city is now three years longer than it was in 2001 and more than two years longer than the national average," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cannoli and Cheesecake (Made With Trans-Fats)</seg>
<seg id="18">Cannoli are a bedrock of New York food culture, but their flaky crusts came under scrutiny in 2008, when the city's health-conscious mayor banned trans-fats from any foods prepared and sold in the city.</seg>
<seg id="19">Famous bakeries including Ferrara's and Junior's adjusted their recipes, along with fast-food giants like McDonald's and Burger King.</seg>
<seg id="20">New York City Traffic</seg>
<seg id="21">Mayor Bloomberg has long touted New York's subway system as the best way to get around the city.</seg>
<seg id="22">He even rides the subway to work at City Hall.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2007, the mayor proposed a "congestion charge" in which drivers would have to pay $8 to drive their cars into Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="24">The plan was nixed by state legislators.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hot Cars and Hot Weather</seg>
<seg id="26">When Bloomberg opts for wheels instead of the subway, he is chauffeured around the city in his trademark black SUV, and prefers that the vehicle be kept cool.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rather than run the car's air conditioning system, however, which would require the engine to be on, Bloomberg aides turn the car off and attach a home air conditioner to the car's front window.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is an experiment to be used on extremely hot days like the types we saw last week," spokesman Stu Loeser told the New York Post, which first spotted the strange cooling method.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even with the vehicles parked in the shade, the temperatures inside can quickly rise to more than 100 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="30">Salty Snacks</seg>
<seg id="31">Rather than banning his beloved salty snacks from New York City (the mayor is an admitted Cheez-Its fan), the Bloomberg administration introduced a voluntary salt-reduction plan in 2010 to encourage food producers to cut down on sodium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Campbell's, Heinz, Starbucks, and dozens of other companies have voluntarily complied with the guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="33">Foam Cups and Containers</seg>
<seg id="34">During his 2013 State of the City address in February, Mayor Bloomberg said the next item he would like banned from the city is polystyrene foam, used in take-out containers and to-go cups in businesses throughout the city.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is "something that we know is environmentally destructive," and "is something we can do without," he said during the speech.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will work to adopt a law banning Styrofoam food packaging from our stores and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Calories</seg>
<seg id="38">New Yorkers can no longer ignorantly indulge in the city's fast-food offerings.</seg>
<seg id="39">In 2008, Mayor Bloomberg helped usher in a new law requiring all chain restaurants to post calorie counts showing how many calories are in Big Macs, Subway sandwiches and Dunkin' Donuts' Munchkins, for example.</seg>

<seg id="3">He fell over when he got up to go to the toilet in the middle of the night</seg>
<seg id="4">He was found in the en suite of two-star Hotal Apolo by roommate at 9am</seg>
<seg id="5">Coroner recorded verdict of accidental death and declared it a tragedy</seg>
<seg id="6">By Mia De Graaf</seg>
<seg id="7">Tragedy: Christopher Briggs, 25, got up in the middle of the night to go the toilet but skidded on the marble-like surface, falling flat on his back and head</seg>
<seg id="8">A British holidaymaker was killed after walking across his Ibiza hotel room in socks and slipping and smashing his head on the shiny tiled floor.</seg>
<seg id="9">Christopher Briggs, 25, got up in the middle of the night to go the toilet but skidded on the marble-like surface, falling flat on his back and head, an inquest heard.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was found dead the following morning on the floor of the en suite bathroom by his roommate.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Briggs, a plumber from Blackburn, had been for a night out with seven friends on the Balearic party island during a 'lads' holiday'.</seg>
<seg id="12">The group had been drinking cocktails in a bar before making their way back to the two-star Hostal Apolo in San Antonio.</seg>
<seg id="13">Hotel security cameras from outside the room showed Mr Briggs and roommate Paul Burke return to their room at around 2.44am on Sunday August 4.</seg>
<seg id="14">Blackburn Coroners Court heard the video footage showed Mr Briggs to be 'drunk, as seen by the way he walked' and that he had difficulty opening the door.</seg>
<seg id="15">At 9.24 the following morning, cameras showed Mr Burke dashing out of his room and calling for help from neighbouring rooms before paramedics arrived.</seg>
<seg id="16">A post mortem examination carried out by the Spanish authorities revealed Mr Briggs suffered severe head injuries after falling to the floor, which they said could have been caused by excessive alcohol consumption.</seg>
<seg id="17">Toxicology tests showed he had drunk the equivalent of seven or eight pints of beer.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Michael Singleton ruled there was 'no evidence of crass stupidity', declaring the incident a 'tragedy'.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fall was said to have been 'serious enough to be the sole cause of death'.</seg>
<seg id="20">On holiday: Mr Briggs had been staying at the two-star Hostal Apolo (file picture) in San Antonio, Ibiza</seg>
<seg id="21">Hotel: CCTV footage shows the group arriving back at 2.44am.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr Briggs was found at 9am in the en suite</seg>
<seg id="23">Devastated Mr Burke told the court his friend 'looked alright' when they left the bar to head home.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Burke, 24, a part advisor for Volkswagen said: 'We went out as an eight and then split into two groups of four.</seg>
<seg id="25">I wasn't drunk but I had had a few.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Briggsy looked alright to me but I have seem him many times and it wasn't nothing more than usual to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was drinking cocktails, like what you do on holiday, he had maybe one pint.</seg>
<seg id="28">He added that he hadn't heard anything during the night and only discovered his friend when he got up at around 9am, when he saw Mr Briggs lying on his back with some blood around his nose on the 'marbly and shiny' floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">He said: 'I just saw Briggsy, he had his head out of the door and his body halfway in the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="30">He was laid on the floor on his back, his feet were in the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was very slippy, it was tiled.</seg>
<seg id="32">He was wearing grey or blue socks.</seg>
<seg id="33">You know those marble floors, you can slip across them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Grieving: Paul Burke, the friend who found Mr Briggs on August 4 after a night out, described events to Blackburn Coroner's Court.</seg>
<seg id="35">The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death</seg>
<seg id="36">'Sensible and optimistic': Father Stephen, pictured outside court, paid tribute to his football-loving son</seg>
<seg id="37">The party decided to cut their holiday short and arrived home three days earlier than planned.</seg>
<seg id="38">Coroner Mr Singleton told Mr Briggs" family: 'As a father myself I can't begin to imagine the pain.</seg>
<seg id="39">'The tragedy seems to be amplified by the fact he was in Ibiza a long way from home, I can't begin to imagine the trauma surrounding all that.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a nightmare beyond measure.</seg>
<seg id="41">I also offer my sympathies to Paul Burke and the seven lads who had gone on holiday there couldn't be anything better than with your mates, what could be better than that.</seg>
<seg id="42">Island: The seven friends were staying in San Antonio, famously populated by tourists and party-goers</seg>
<seg id="43">There is no evidence of crass stupidity, he was a regular lad and went for a regular evening out, he simply slips on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="44">I'm sure you have asked "why Christopher?"</seg>
<seg id="45">Why my boy?.</seg>
<seg id="46">In a statement, Mr Briggs' father Stephen, also a plumber, paid tribute to his popular, sensible, and optimistic son, who he says had been looking forward to the Ibiza holiday for a year.</seg>
<seg id="47">He said: "He was an easy-going, nice lad.</seg>
<seg id="48">Chris was an optimist too, to the extent that he had got his season ticket for Blackburn Rovers, thinking they were going to do great things.</seg>
<seg id="49">He was really looking forward to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="50">We worked together for the last time on a bathroom in Manchester and he was really made up about going away.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everybody liked Christopher.</seg>
<seg id="52">He was a wonderful son and what happened was just a horrible thing.</seg>
<seg id="53">You never dream of this happening and it is something you never think you will experience.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is devastating losing your son, but I have also lost the person I worked with every day.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nobody would say anything ill of him.</seg>
<seg id="56">He loved his football and played five-a-side three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="57">He was sensible and quiet, but he liked to have a laugh with all his friends.</seg>
<seg id="58">Everybody will miss him so much.</seg>
<seg id="59">He was very, very popular.</seg>
<seg id="60">All our customers loved him.</seg>
<seg id="61">He just enjoyed life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Samurai descend on Skye for Keanu Reeves" 47 Ronin</seg>
<seg id="2">The Isle of Skye has won a starring role in Keanu Reeves" new film, playing the role of a winter landscape in 18th-century Japan.</seg>
<seg id="3">A trailer for the samurai epic 47 Ronin shows a group of sword-wielding warriors riding across the island on horseback and galloping through a forest.</seg>
<seg id="4">The crew spent a week on the west coast of Skye last October shooting the dramatic scenes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The headland on Skye stands in for what is meant to be a Japanese landscape in the depths of winter.</seg>
<seg id="6">CGI effects have been used to add a massive statue of a warrior figure on to the mountainside.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also filmed in Japan, London and Budapest, the plot revolves around a group of samurai, led by an outcast played by Reeves, who set out to avenge the murder of their master.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Universal Pictures movie is said to have had a budget of more than £140 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">Marcus McAdam, a Skye-based photographer, who worked on the shoot, said six different locations had been used - Neist Point, the Hill of the Red Fox, the Quiraing, Harlosh Point, the Old Man of Storr and Glenbrittle beach.</seg>
<seg id="10">"From what I was told, they got to the editing stage and realised they didn't really have anything suitable to show this really epic journey that the main characters take," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A lot of the filming earlier in the shoot had been carried out in Japan, but as the production was based in London they realised it would be a lot easier for Skye to stand in for it.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was told the re-shoots actually delayed the release of the film.</seg>
<seg id="13">The movie, which is said to combine the fantasy elements of Lord of the Rings with the battle scenes of Gladiator, was first announced more than five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Due to be released in the UK on Boxing Day, it is the latest big-screen starring role for Skye.</seg>
<seg id="15">There have been suggestions the island could stand in for a mountainous planet in the next Star Wars movie, which is to be filmed in the UK and is due for release in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shaz Morton, a location scout based on the island, said: "The great thing about Skye is that it is so adaptable."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is like Scotland in microcosm, with the range of different landscapes and dramatic areas like Trotternish, the Cuillin mountain range and the Quiraing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fact the Skye Bridge is there has made a big difference - it is much easier to get to.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's not just about films, it is regularly used for things like car commercials and fashion shoots.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jon Melville, editor of the Reel Scotland website, said: "The Lord of the Rings effect, whereby locations such as New Zealand see a huge tourism boost off the back of a big budget movie, is on the mind of all tourist boards."</seg>
<seg id="21">Even a few seconds of a stunning Scottish landscape in a trailer can interest film fans around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="22">The bigger effect will be when the film arrives in cinemas and location scouts see the possibilities offered by our countryside.</seg>
<seg id="23">Who would have thought Skye would double as 18th-century Japan?</seg>
<seg id="24">That must put ideas in the heads of film producers everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ali James, location manager on the film, said: "The weather was kind to us and everybody had a great time."</seg>
<seg id="26">Over the sea to a landscape that film makers just can't resist</seg>
<seg id="27">The spectacular landscape on Skye has had brief but notable starring roles in a string of films.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous opening credits of The Wicker Man show Edward Woodward flying over the Old Man of Storr and the Trotternish coastline, before he lands at nearby Plockton.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Old Man of Storr can also be seen, along with the Quiraing, in the final scenes of the 1975 fantasy adventure The Land That Time Forgot, starring Doug McClure and Susan Penhaligon.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the opening scenes of 1980 sci-fi epic Flash Gordon were filmed at Ashaig landing strip, near Broadford, with Robbie Coltrane in one of his earliest screen roles as a baggage handler.</seg>
<seg id="31">Although 1987 fantasy Highlander was filmed largely at Eilean Donan Castle, on Loch Shiel, two locations on Skye were used for dramatic sword-fighting sequences - the Cioch, a rock outcrop from the face of Sron Na Ciche in the Black Cuillin mountain range, and the Table plateau in the Quiraing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Lars Von Trier's 1996 drama Breaking the Waves, with Emily Watson, was filmed at Neist Point and on the Quiraing road, as well as at Mallaig and Lochailort on the mainland.</seg>
<seg id="33">The first ever Gaelic-language feature film, Seachd - The Innaccessible Pinnacle (2007), was produced on Skye by islander Chris Young - who went on to work on The Inbetweeners - and was at the centre of controversy after Bafta refused to put it forward for an Academy Award.</seg>
<seg id="34">The following year, the film adaptation of Neil Gaiman's book Stardust, with Claire Danes, Michelle Pfieffer, Sienna Miller and Robert De Niro, was shot in various locations on Skye, including the Fairy Glen.</seg>
<seg id="35">Director Ridley Scott last year filmed - and set - part of sci-fi thriller Prometheus, his long-awaited Alien prequel, on Skye, using the Old Man of Storr.</seg>
<seg id="36">And the Quiraing was featured again in Snow White and the Huntsman, starring Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron.</seg>
<seg id="37">A few weeks ago, film crews were on the island again as production started on Gaelic soap opera Bannan, which translates as "The Ties That Bind."</seg>
<seg id="38">The BBC Alba series tells the story of Mairi Macdonald, who returns to Skye for a funeral after leaving eight years earlier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Growing older sooner</seg>
<seg id="2">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent</seg>
<seg id="4">There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys</seg>
<seg id="7">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are important, too.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, "suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are varying explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Goodman finds kindred spirits in Coen brothers</seg>
<seg id="2">John Goodman has long been the go-to guy for Joel and Ethan Coen when they need a big man to negotiate long, twisty monologues and blow his stack when necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it inevitably is.</seg>
<seg id="4">In "Raising Arizona," "Barton Fink," "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and, most memorably, as Walter Sobchak, the Vietnam vet who doesn't roll on Shabbos in "The Big Lebowski," Goodman added volatility and a good many decibels to a quartet of Coen brothers movies.</seg>
<seg id="5">He also gave voice to a newsreel announcer in "The Hudsucker Proxy."</seg>
<seg id="6">After his turn as a Bible salesman in 2000's "O Brother," the actor and the Coens took, in the words of Goodman's character in that film, Big Dan Teague, a "conversational hiatus."</seg>
<seg id="7">They did a radio play together and saw each other occasionally, but nothing the Coens wrote in the intervening years quite fit Goodman's skill set.</seg>
<seg id="8">"There's always a twinge of envy whenever they release a movie that I'm not in," Goodman says.</seg>
<seg id="9">I enjoy them all the same, but, geez, I love working with these guys so much.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want it all the time.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Coens' latest, a darkly comic take on the early '60s Greenwich Village folk scene, "Inside Llewyn Davis," provided the opportunity for a reunion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Goodman plays a drug-addled, jazzbo raconteur accompanying the film's title character on a surreal road trip to Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Sometimes you can just hear the actor in the language," Ethan Coen says of Goodman.</seg>
<seg id="14">You write it and you go, 'I could just see John doing this and killing it.'</seg>
<seg id="15">The Coens have entertained that same thought before - writing each of Goodman's roles, save for their first collaboration - specifically with the actor in mind.</seg>
<seg id="16">We caught up with Goodman and the Coens recently, and they shared a few memories of their long-standing partnership.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Raising Arizona" (1987)</seg>
<seg id="18">The role: Gale Snoats, prison escapee intent on robbing a bank with his little brother and a baby in tow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information, man: "Their office was 200 W. 57th St.," Goodman says with remarkable precision.</seg>
<seg id="20">I went there and saw pictures of other actors all over the place and started goofing on the process.</seg>
<seg id="21">We just hit it off.</seg>
<seg id="22">I didn't know these guys, but I felt like I grew up with them.</seg>
<seg id="23">They were like grade-school, Midwestern, Mad magazine-reading wiseacres that I knew in St. Louis.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It was a little bit of a Mutt-and-Jeff team between John and Bill Forsythe," Joel Coen remembers of Goodman and the actor playing his brother, Evelle.</seg>
<seg id="25">John could do comedy, but he was a real actor too.</seg>
<seg id="26">Everything he did was so vivid that we just kept wanting to do more with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Barton Fink" (1991)</seg>
<seg id="28">The role: Charlie Meadows, Barton's hotel neighbor who happens to be a serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="29">Information, man: The film memorably ends with the hotel ablaze and Goodman bellowing to the cops, "I'll show you the life of the mind!"</seg>
<seg id="30">"Not everyone can do that," Ethan Coen says.</seg>
<seg id="31">You need someone you believe is both acquainted with the life of the mind but also, in a deeper sense, isn't having that life.</seg>
<seg id="32">"He may not have had the life of the mind, but he knew what it wasn't and he knew a line of bull when he saw it," Goodman adds.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The Big Lebowski" (1998)</seg>
<seg id="34">The role: Walter Sobchak, the Dude's best friend, Vietnam vet, dabbler in pacifism (not in 'Nam, of course), capable of procuring a toe by 3 in the afternoon, if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="35">Information, man: "People quote it to me all the time," Goodman says.</seg>
<seg id="36">'Shomer Shabbos.'</seg>
<seg id="37">'Shut ... up, Donny.'</seg>
<seg id="38">'World of pain.'</seg>
<seg id="39">'You're out of your element.'</seg>
<seg id="40">Thank God they've refrained from quoting that scene where I'm screaming at Little Larry while I'm busting up the car.</seg>
<seg id="41">'Is this your homework, Larry?'</seg>
<seg id="42">Joel says, chuckling at the line.</seg>
<seg id="43">If forced to choose, that's my favorite scene.</seg>
<seg id="44">Goodman: "I'm out there tearing up a couple of Corvettes with a crowbar, screaming obscenities in the middle of the night in this tidy neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="45">I thought, 'I don't want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="46">But I gotta do it.'</seg>
<seg id="47">Nobody bothered to tell me they paid for the whole block to be unoccupied that night.</seg>
<seg id="48">"O Brother, Where Art Thou" (2000)</seg>
<seg id="49">The role: Big Dan Teague, Bible salesman, frog killer, Cyclops stand-in</seg>
<seg id="50">Information, man: Goodman: "He shows up."</seg>
<seg id="51">He robs them, and then he gets killed.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amphibians mean little or nothing to him.</seg>
<seg id="53">"Some people might have to look far and wide for a Cyclops," Ethan says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Not us.</seg>
<seg id="55">We had John.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zygier's cell was 'intended to kill its resident'</seg>
<seg id="2">Prisoner X: Ben Zygier.</seg>
<seg id="3">An Israeli man jailed over the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has provided a rare glimpse into the cell where Melbourne man Ben Zygier, known as Prisoner X, ended his life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hagay Amir was convicted and served more than 16 years in jail for being an accomplice to his fellow right-wing extremist brother Yigal, who remains in prison for life for Rabin's murder.</seg>
<seg id="5">In his first interview since his release, Hagay Amir said that he was permitted to visit his brother in the purpose-built isolation cell in the maximum security Ayalon Prison in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is the same cell where the Australian-born, alleged Mossad agent Ben Zygier was found dead in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hagay visited his brother on 11 occasions, each time for three hours.</seg>
<seg id="8">Israel has drawn a veil of secrecy over everything regarding Ben Zygier so tight that not only was there a gag order on the existence of "prisoner X," but there was also a gag order that barred journalists from even mentioning the gag order.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the time even his jailers didn't know who he was or what he had done.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was not until Zygier's suicide was exposed by the ABC's Foreign Correspondent program, that his existence came to light.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Yes, they murdered him, it's clear, or drove him to suicide," Amir claims, of Zygier.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hagay takes out a pen and carefully draws a bird's eye view plan of the cell where Zygier was kept: a five by three metres cell with a shower and a toilet hidden by a low partition and an adjoining courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are closed circuit cameras in the ceiling corners and a complex series of doors and corridors.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is a cell that was intended to kill its resident," Amir says.</seg>
<seg id="15">They wanted him to die and he died.</seg>
<seg id="16">They say that he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's all rubbish, all lies.</seg>
<seg id="18">To get to you in an emergency would take over 15 minutes just to unlock the gates.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There are, let's see," he consults his sketch, "one, two, three, four locked gates until you get to your cell."</seg>
<seg id="20">By that time you can be mummified.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you're not infused with faith or an ideal to sustain you, a place like that would be very difficult to live in," he said."</seg>
<seg id="22">""Most people would not stand such isolation."</seg>
<seg id="23">It is cruelty beyond the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="24">A spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service refused to comment on Amir's allegations, on account of their general nature and the fact that they refer to incidents that "supposedly happened in the distant past."</seg>

<seg id="1">To boost social mobility, we need to make education this country's top priority</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the Sutton Trust, "bringing the lowest-performing 10 per cent of teachers in the UK up to the average would in five years bring the UK's rank amongst OECD countries from 21st in Reading to as high as 7th, and from 22nd in Maths to as high as 12th."</seg>
<seg id="3">We need a targeted approach with tough targets, the best heads and the brightest teachers for areas like the Black Country where standards lag stubbornly behind the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">The London Challenge transformed education in the capital and we should be introducing or bringing back similar programmes elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Next, we should expand Lord Baker's brilliant work on University Technical Colleges through the Baker Dearing Trust.</seg>
<seg id="6">These schools, which are partnerships between universities and businesses, enable children in the second half of their secondary education to acquire high-level technical and vocational skills, although this must accompany rigorous maths and English to age 18.</seg>
<seg id="7">We should go further and specialise more at 14 and above, not just in relation to technical subjects such as engineering, electronics or advanced manufacturing as with UTCs, but in straightforward academic subjects too.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sutton Trust research shows that just 7 per cent of pupils attend independent schools, but represent seven out of 10 high court judges, more than half our leading journalists and doctors, and more than a third of MPs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Just five public schools send more pupils to Oxbridge than 2000 state schools, or two-thirds of the entire sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Sutton Trust proposes opening access to the country's leading independent day schools by selecting pupils for all places purely on merit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parents would pay a sliding scale of fees according to means.</seg>
<seg id="12">When piloted at the Belvedere School in Liverpool, this Open Access scheme saw academic standards improve and the social mix of the school become more diverse, with 30 per cent of pupils on free places, 40 per cent paying partial fees and the rest paid full fees.</seg>
<seg id="13">Extending that to 100 or more leading academic day schools, with state funding, would boost mobility and give our best universities and top professions access to Britain's brightest young people irrespective of background.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sharing costs with parents means the cost per head to the state for Open Access would actually be less than the cost of the average state school place.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Trust's figures show that failing to tackle the social mobility crisis will cost the UK economy up to £140 billion a year by 2050, or an additional 4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product.</seg>
<seg id="16">So we shouldn't be committing ourselves to driving up standards and opening up opportunities a few have taken for granted for decades to all our youngsters just as a matter of fairness.</seg>
<seg id="17">We must do so because there is no other way for Britain to succeed in what the Prime Minister calls the global race.</seg>

<seg id="1">Six out of ten firms are preparing for the new Civil Code</seg>
<seg id="2">Six out of ten firms are preparing intensively for the impending new Civil Code and the Act on Business Corporations which come into effect on 1 January 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only eight per cent of business representatives questioned said that they were not tackling matters related to both key codes in their companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is according to a survey by the law office Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech businesses.</seg>
<seg id="5">In relation to the approaching date of effectiveness of both key codes, only now at the last minute many managers are starting to realise the significant impact they may have on the running of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years, in our opinion, are in fact going to affect every citizen and business in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Due to politicians’ manoeuvring, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not the revolutionary changes would eventually happen.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left for the transfer to the new law to take place without any complications for their firms," said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spáčil on the results.</seg>
<seg id="9">Out of 61 per cent of companies dealing intensively with the new codes, 26 per cent said that their firms had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, 35 per cent of companies out of this number plan to take the necessary measures in the next few days.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, every fifth company has not yet dealt with the recodification, but has a definite idea of how to prepare for it.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of 11 per cent has no opinion and cannot judge the issue.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only eight per cent of companies admitted they had not yet addressed the issues related to recodification.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most important legal topic connected to with the new civil code is for the most companies surveyed the signing of new contracts (21 per cent), followed by handling resolving business terms and conditions (16 per cent) and then changes in the Land Registry and in liability for damage (ten per cent each).</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards, contracts, one of the most important new features of the whole recodification is the unification of the form of the contracts only according the new Civil Code.</seg>
<seg id="16">The current parallel amendment of the Civil and Commercial Codes will expire, as a result of which the contract law should become clearer for both citizens and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In the case of businesses, the new amendment offers a lot of new features with emphasis on greater freedom in organising relationships," said Lukáš Poddaný, a lawyer at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.</seg>
<seg id="18">In relation to the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies regard the most important topic to be the issue of increasing responsibility of statutory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is followed by topics concerning changes in convening and running general assembly meetings (15 per cent) and representing the company (14 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="20">The new legislation means the tightening up of obligations and possible impacts for statutory authorities, especially in the situation where a company is in danger of going or goes bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="21">"In practice this means that if members of boards of directors and company secretaries do not act with due diligence and do not avert the threat of the company’s bankruptcy, they could lose the benefit obtained from performing their duty for up to the last two years," added Spáčil.</seg>

<seg id="10">Mr Brodie, 86, was one of six visually impaired people who visited Tamarama beach this week on a trip organised by Guide Dogs NSW/ACT.</seg>
<seg id="11">After feeling their way around the sculptures they took part in a pilot workshop, creating their own sculpture with the help of exhibiting artist Jane Gillings.</seg>
<seg id="12">She said sculpture was a good art form for the vision impaired, being "very hands on."</seg>
<seg id="13">Ying-Wah Wan, an orientation and mobility instructor with Guide Dogs NSW/ACT, said "the added sense of touch gives [the art] a different meaning" for her clients, while creating their own sculpture "has been a great opportunity to demonstrate that vision loss doesn't have to limit your independence or creativity."</seg>
<seg id="14">The group took public transport to the beach, with Mr Brodie saying it helped raise public awareness of white canes.</seg>
<seg id="15">People still don't understand what they are.</seg>
<seg id="16">So often people [say], 'Oh, you're going to play golf, are you?'</seg>
<seg id="17">Their visit was was part of the increasingly popular Sculpture by the Sea Tactile Tours program, giving people with disabilities the chance to enjoy contemporary sculpture.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's a sensory experience," Sculpture by Sea's education manager, Petra Pattinson, said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It engages them; they really get involved in the texture, the shape.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prospal: I want a contract in the NHL.</seg>
<seg id="2">I still have the spirit, desire and enthusiasm</seg>
<seg id="3">Family was always in first place for Prospal, which is why he wants to submit himself to it fully at the age of 38.</seg>
<seg id="4">Either he will get work abroad and continue to extend his career, or he will stop playing hockey for good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I want to fulfil my role of dad and husband."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I can’t wait," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.</seg>
<seg id="7">Despite the fact that he is well-known as a hard worker, who never cheats anything.</seg>
<seg id="8">Despite the fact he always leaves his heart on the ice and can also lead his team-mates.</seg>
<seg id="9">And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus last season.</seg>
<seg id="10">"But the desire to show everyone what I’ve got is still there," he says with determination.</seg>
<seg id="11">Maybe he will live to see it, allegedly New York Rangers are interested in him, they had an unsuccessful start to the season and, in addition, they have two mainstays injured – the attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.</seg>
<seg id="12">How is it with your transfer to Rangers?</seg>
<seg id="13">It’s just speculation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unless I get something on paper, there’s no point to think about it.</seg>
<seg id="15">I know there was an article that came out in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that is all.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was not said anywhere that this really happened..</seg>
<seg id="17">Unfortunately, I would like to say myself that I have a contract, but it just isn’t the case.</seg>
<seg id="18">Has the club not even contacted you?</seg>
<seg id="19">That kind of communication takes place every day in the NHL.</seg>
<seg id="20">There it’s about getting into a situation where the contract really arrives.</seg>
<seg id="21">When a player is injured, say, or someone isn’t doing well and the team is struggling.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are so many different factors that have to come together so I could get that contract.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in New York at the moment the similar circumstances are arising, aren’t they?</seg>
<seg id="24">Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are injured and the team didn't do well at the start of the season, so there is definitely a chance there, don’t you think?</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course, there’s always a chance.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the other thing is that you always need two sides for that.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today I’d take heaps of offers but so far I’ve not had any.</seg>
<seg id="28">That’s the reality, unfortunately, in which I have to live.</seg>
<seg id="29">On Friday you fly to America, are you expecting that something might just work out?</seg>
<seg id="30">I’ve had that expectation since 5 July, when the market with free players opened in the NHL, but there’s still nothing.</seg>
<seg id="31">Are you heading to New York, to remind them?</seg>
<seg id="32">Definitely not, I’m going to Tampa to see my children and wife.</seg>
<seg id="33">I’m looking forward to some sun and and seeing them again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Have you got a programme planned?</seg>
<seg id="35">That’s a given since I’m a father and husband and it all develops from there.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the moment I’m not a hockey player – I have no contract and I don’t play in matches.</seg>
<seg id="37">So I’ll fulfil my role of dad and husband and I'm really looking forward to it.</seg>
<seg id="38">This Sunday Vašík has two hockey matches, this is for me and all my family a holiday when we can go and support our children doing what they want to do.</seg>
<seg id="39">Do you think you could do that "full time"?</seg>
<seg id="40">Of course, you have to think of all sorts of things.</seg>
<seg id="41">That can happen too.</seg>
<seg id="42">I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches due to a knee operation.</seg>
<seg id="43">And I really, really loved it.</seg>
<seg id="44">One day you reach a stage where all the goals, wins and assists won’t replace what you have at home.</seg>
<seg id="45">Because family and children, that’s the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="46">Whatever work you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="47">I had the most beautiful work I could possibly have besides my family.</seg>
<seg id="48">You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it’s the NHL or because of your family that you want to be in America?</seg>
<seg id="49">Since I’m a hockey player, so the first thing is – except for family – the sporting success.</seg>
<seg id="50">The NHL is the best competition in the world.</seg>
<seg id="51">And family life is dependent on that.</seg>
<seg id="52">My children, sorry, our children – mine and my wife’s – grew up in the States, they started school there and so on.</seg>
<seg id="53">And we would be really happy if they continued this trend.</seg>
<seg id="54">Because we won’t delude ourselves, in America the possibilities are completely somewhere else..</seg>
<seg id="55">We should offer them that chance.</seg>
<seg id="56">So do you plan to stay in America permanently?</seg>
<seg id="57">We’ll do what we have done so far.</seg>
<seg id="58">That means that in summer we’ll be in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and near České Budějovice.</seg>
<seg id="59">And in winter back in Tampa or wherever we end up.</seg>
<seg id="60">That’s absolutely ideal, to be always somewhere where it's warm.</seg>
<seg id="61">I’ve had a huge amount of luck in my life.</seg>
<seg id="62">It can be said that I went for it, it took a lot of strength and sacrifice and it took a lot of things away from me that I missed.</seg>
<seg id="63">But hockey offered me a lot of chances in return and this is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="64">That my wife and I can choose where we will live.</seg>
<seg id="65">There are many of people in this world who yearn for that, to be able to choose what they will do and how they will live.</seg>
<seg id="66">How long will you have the will to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?</seg>
<seg id="67">Well, that’s a question I can’t answer.</seg>
<seg id="68">I still have it in me now, the spirit, the desire, the enthusiasm, and the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to show people that you can still be good enough the NHL, that I’m still better than someone else.</seg>
<seg id="69">But I can’t say for how long it will stay like that.</seg>
<seg id="70">You can’t plan that.</seg>
<seg id="71">So it can be said that you’ll wait this season to see how it works out and then you’ll decide what to do next?</seg>
<seg id="72">I’m at the stage where I go from day to day.</seg>

<seg id="2">An indigenous teacher who human rights groups say was unjustly imprisoned for 13 years received a promised pardon Thursday from President Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alberto Patishtan Gomez was the first person pardoned by Pena Nieto under a recent change in Mexico's penal code that broadened a president's grounds for granting pardons.</seg>
<seg id="4">The president had announced late Tuesday that he would free Patishtan, and Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said Thursday that Pena Nieto ordered the teacher be released from prison immediately.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We identified evidence of consistent human rights violations, particularly during the legal process," Osorio Chong said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Patishtan was detained in June 2000 and charged with participating in the ambush and killing of seven police officers in the southern state of Chiapas, home to the Zapatista rebel uprising.</seg>
<seg id="7">The newly approved law published Wednesday allows the president to pardon prisoners "when there are consistent indications of grave human rights violations" against them.</seg>
<seg id="8">The code already allowed some other kinds of limited presidential pardons.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shortly after being released, Patishtan maintained his innocence.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They wanted to finish me, but I'm innocent before God and in my own eyes," he said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now 43, Patishtan was being held at the National Institute of Neurology, where he was transferred from prison to undergo treatment for a brain tumor.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was serving a 60-year sentence for charges associated with the ambush, including murder.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said he was simply participating in protests in a state marked by the emergence of the Zapatista rebel movement.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said that it was the mayor of a Chiapas town who incriminated him unfairly and that he did not have the resources to defend himself against the charges.</seg>
<seg id="15">Amnesty International and other rights groups have said the case against Patishtan was plagued with irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mexican courts refused to overturn the conviction and sentence, saying defense lawyers didn't provide sufficient evidence.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mexico's Supreme Court refused to hear the case.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed</seg>
<seg id="2">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough</seg>
<seg id="3">The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="4">Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
<seg id="5">A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.</seg>
<seg id="7">The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="14">Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.</seg>
<seg id="18">Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.</seg>
<seg id="20">The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.</seg>
<seg id="32">He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will find you and put you before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.</seg>
<seg id="43">On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hezbollah sends thousands of fighters to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2">A decisive battle awaits.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous region of Qalamoun.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to reports which are still being clarified, Israel destroyed missiles intended for Hezbollah in Wednesday’s raids on two sites in western Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Lebanese Shiite organisation is fighting in Syria on the side of its army.</seg>
<seg id="6">Its programme is also the fight against Israel, which is not interfering in the Syrian conflict, but has clearly said that it will prevent the transport of weapons to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports on Wednesday’s Israeli strikes on weapons stores in western Syria are still being clarified.</seg>
<seg id="8">Israel has not commented on the attack, but it has been confirmed by American sources.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the Syrian website Dampress.com missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea area hit a Syrian missile base at Snubar Jableh south of Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="10">News channel al-Arabiya says that two stores were hit, in which there were missiles prepared for transport to Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to their sources, they were Russian manufactured SA-8 missiles.</seg>
<seg id="12">Israel refused to comment on the news, but military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai said that Syria is constantly trying to arm Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah to operate the missiles.</seg>
<seg id="13">The SA-8 is an outdated missile the Syrian Army has had since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are placed on a moving chassis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although they are quite primitive, thanks to their mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.</seg>
<seg id="16">They are equipped with a radar which switches off after the missile is fired, so it is hard to aim them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Latakia is situated in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has in the past taken part in battles in western Syria.</seg>
<seg id="19">They say they are helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now reportedly 15,000 of their fighters are prepared to help the army recapture Qalamoun.</seg>
<seg id="21">Together with Hezbollah there, the Syrian Army is also reinforcing its troops.</seg>
<seg id="22">Qalamoun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country, Homs.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to an al-Arabiya source, the battle is meant to be a revenge for the recent attack of the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Abu al-Abbas Brigade in the Shiite part of Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">This year, Hezbollah has helped the Syrian Army recapture the city of Qusayr near the Lebanese border.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many rebels from Qusayr left for Qalamoun.</seg>

<seg id="1">US-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found</seg>
<seg id="2">One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.</seg>
<seg id="3">US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.</seg>
<seg id="5">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="9">They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We don't want to charge that," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.</seg>
<seg id="30">It will still give away water.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israeli Warplanes Strike Inside Syria</seg>
<seg id="2">Israeli warplanes conducted an airstrike early today on a Syrian military facility near the northern Syrian port city of Latakia along the Mediterranean coast, a U.S. official confirms to ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="3">The attack is believed to be the fifth airstrike conducted by Israel inside Syria this year.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like the earlier airstrikes, the official said the latest attack presumably targeted advanced Russian missile weapons systems headed to the extremist group Hezbollah based in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="5">An Israeli source also confirmed the attack to ABC News which like the four previous attacks this year has not been acknowledged by the Israeli government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The air strike was first reported in Israeli newspapers which cited explosions at a missile storage facility near Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The accounts differed as to what types of air defense missile systems may have been targeted by Israeli warplanes.</seg>
<seg id="8">U.S. official say that the Israeli warplanes conducting the airstrikes usually launch missiles at targets inside Syria from inside Lebanese airspace so they are not exposed to Syria's advanced air defense systems.</seg>
<seg id="9">The official Lebanese news agency reported that Israeli planes were spotted flying for several hours over various parts of Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Lebanese Army press release said "the enemy planes circled above the various Lebanese regions" before leaving Lebanese airspace.</seg>
<seg id="11">The most recent Israeli airstrike inside Syria took place on July 5 and also occurred near Latakia, targeting a warehouse that was believed to house advanced Yakhont long-range anti-ship missiles.</seg>
<seg id="12">The three earlier Israeli air strikes inside Syria all targeted Russian weapons systems that Syria was believed to be funneling to Hezbollah in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="13">Syria has been a long-time arms provider to the militant Lebanese organization.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first strike near Damascus in late January targeted a convoy carrying anti-aircraft missiles that may have been on the move to Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="15">In early May, Israel conducted two separate airstrikes, also near Damascus, that a U.S. official told ABC News targeted as many as a dozen medium range Fateh-110 missiles intended for Hezbollah.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cronulla captain Paul Gallen and former NRL coach Brian Smith engage in Twitter battle</seg>
<seg id="2">Sharks captain Paul Gallen wants nothing to do with Brian Smith after being drawn into a nasty Twitter spat with the former NRL coach.</seg>
<seg id="3">UPDATE: SHARKS captain Paul Gallen has declared he wants nothing to do with Brian Smith after being drawn into a nasty Twitter spat with the former NRL coach.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the hours after Gallen was man of the match in a 32-22 upset of competition leader the Roosters, his Twitter account was abuzz with fiery reactions to a sledge from Smith, one of rugby league's most experienced coaches.</seg>
<seg id="5">Smith accused Gallen of avoiding Roosters rival Dylan Napa, after the young forward hit him with a bell-ringer, and his next comment touched on illegal peptides that were allegedly given to Cronulla players.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gallen today declared his father Garry was the author of a string of angry responses on @PaulGallen13.</seg>
<seg id="7">A sizzling first half performance from Cronulla sets up victory against an outgunned Sydney Roosters, despite a late fightback from Trent Robinson's team.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I warned him what it would do but he came down from Queensland for his 59th birthday yesterday, so I let him jump on and he went a bit mad," Gallen told Sky Sports Radio.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gallen, who was rejected as an Eels junior when Smith was in charge of Parramatta,had a blunt message today for the coach who has infamously never won a premiership after overseeing more than 600 NRL games.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I won't be going back and forth with Brian Smith to give his life any significance," Gallen said.</seg>
<seg id="11">He can have his time in the sun for the next 24 hours and that's about all he's good for.</seg>
<seg id="12">I won't be getting involved with him anymore.</seg>
<seg id="13">Paul Gallen makes another hit-up against the Roosters.</seg>
<seg id="14">Obviously he didn't like me at Parramatta when I was a kid.</seg>
<seg id="15">I had a meeting with him about 2003-04 to go back there and (since then) I've had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't know where it's come from but he's entitled to his opinion and I'll just deal with it today as it comes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The exchange ignited when Smith accused Gallen, who ran more than 200m in the game, of dodging Napa.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former NRL coach Brian Smith.</seg>
<seg id="19">Radio broadcaster Triple M tweeted a Gallen post-match quote: "I ran at him (Napa) three times and he got me once, so I'm up!"</seg>
<seg id="20">Smith replied with his @coachbsmithy account: "He ran at him once and got smashed next two times he ran away from him to avoid further embarrassment."</seg>
<seg id="21">A follower then tweeted: "Peptides may increase a lot of things but heart isn't one if them."</seg>
<seg id="22">Smith replied: "What is heart Use all physical resources? peps give unfair advantage in avlbl phys resources used illegally."</seg>
<seg id="23">Shark's Paul Gallen tackled by Rooster's Mitch Aubusson and Daniel Mortimer during the Cronulla Sharks vs Sydney Roosters game at Remondis Stadium, Cronulla.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gallen's account then fired back: "Looking forward to the time I run into u Brian u couldn't play couldn't coach your just a sad..."</seg>
<seg id="25">Smith replied: "Nice to hear from you Paul."</seg>
<seg id="26">Another tweet sent by Gallen's dad also had a shot at Smith: "Smith won an under 23s comp once and been sacked a lot.</seg>
<seg id="27">Guess this is my last time on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="28">Gallen's account also tweeted a string of angry shots at "keyboard warriors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ha ha you people are so sad u have no meaning in life so u follow mine LOOSER (sic)," his timeline ran, by then past midnight.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is Paul's father in response to all of his critics.</seg>

<seg id="36">Shark's Paul Gallen has words with Rooster's Frank-Paul Nuuausala during the Cronulla Sharks vs Sydney Roosters game at Remondis Stadium, Cronulla.</seg>
<seg id="37">A fan tweeted a pointed remark about peptides and the response read: "Man of the match what did you do last night LOSER?</seg>
<seg id="38">Garry Gallen.</seg>
<seg id="39">Full stop the end.</seg>
<seg id="40">Gallen's account updated this morning: "Wow what a response.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks for all u supporters have a great day.</seg>
<seg id="42">Smith was infamous for relentlessly sending players text messages during his coaching career, which stalled when he was shown the door by the Roosters at the end of last season.</seg>
<seg id="43">His relationship had by then worn thin with a number of key players, including halfback Mitchell Pearce.</seg>
<seg id="44">Smith has lost four grand finals, most notably with a record-breaking Eels team in 2001, in a 30-24 loss to Newcastle that read 24-0 to the Knights at half-time.</seg>
<seg id="45">He also lost a decider to the Dragons - the club he took to defeats in 1992 and 1993 - with the Roosters in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1">Boy to go to juvenile facility for 7 years for killing neo-Nazi dad</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- A Riverside, Calif., judge Thursday ruled a 13-year-old boy who killed his neo-Nazi father should be sent to a state-run facility for juveniles for seven years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jean P. Leonard accepted prosecution arguments that the boy, whose name was not reported, needs to be in a structured environment, rather than a private residential treatment facility, as defense lawyers had argued for, the Los Angeles Times reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The boy, who has a history of violent behavior apart from the May 1, 2011, slaying of his father, will be eligible for a parole hearing when he turns 20 but could be released earlier if he is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="5">His lawyers argued that in the event of rehabilitation, the boy will require services a state facility cannot provide.</seg>
<seg id="6">The boy was 10 when he shot his father, Jeffrey Hall, in the head as Hall slept on a couch in the family's home.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was convicted in January of second-degree murder and using a gun while committing a felony, which normally carries a sentence of 40 years to life in prison for adult offenders,</seg>
<seg id="8">The defense argued during the trial that Hall -- a regional leader in the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement -- routinely beat his son and had threatened to set fire to the house with his wife and children in it, the Los Angeles Times reported.</seg>
<seg id="9">Witnesses at the trial said the boy had engaged in violent behavior long before his father became an active member of the NSM, The (Riverside) Press-Enterprise reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.</seg>
<seg id="6">We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."</seg>
<seg id="12">Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.</seg>
<seg id="14">Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.</seg>

<seg id="3">Picture: Calum Robertson Source: The Advertiser</seg>
<seg id="4">ONE of media manager Andrew Rutter's final assignments at the Port Adelaide Football Club was to bring to the traditional media's attention a thoughtful campaign in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">A Vietnam veteran - originally from Norwood High - was returning from three decades in Hong Kong to not only join the wave of fans rekindling their passion for the Power, but to remind Port Adelaide of a fallen soldier who had worn the club's colours.</seg>
<seg id="6">Denis Way's campaign to honour former Magpies rover Peter Chant - who died on Valentine's Day, 1969, after an ambush in South Vietnam - proved the power of the new media and why AFL clubs now need sharper media departments to carry their message in a crowded sporting landscape.</seg>
<seg id="7">Way and his Charlie Company colleagues, John England, Mick Mummery and Laurie Lewis, made it their mission this Anzac Day to remind a football club and its community of Chant and give credence to the Anzac ethos, "Lest We Forget."</seg>
<seg id="8">Way was back in the blogosphere after the Anzac march - in which he carried Chant's Australian flag - to pay tribute to Port.</seg>
<seg id="9">This should be most directed to Rutter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This (memory of Chant) would not have happened if not for the Port Adelaide Football Club in its wholly pragmatic One Club format," wrote Way.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was the club that picked this up from (the blogosphere) and did the rest.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the media has not given PAFC due credit as yet, then I'm doing it for them now.</seg>
<seg id="13">Way left AAMI Stadium on Saturday night - after the Power achieved another remarkable comeback to beat West Coast by five points - saying: "In my head I can see Peter's smile."</seg>
<seg id="14">There are many smiling as several good things continue to unfold at Alberton today, not only on the field and in the front office.</seg>
<seg id="15">The club that was supposedly hurting the image of SA football is making an extraordinary recovery.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dean Obeidallah: Obama in a tough stretch, facing policy debacles, low poll numbers</seg>
<seg id="3">If it were a movie, his character would be surrounded -- but he can change outcome, he says</seg>
<seg id="4">He says he must aggressively press agenda and also aim for Democrats to retake House</seg>
<seg id="5">Obeidallah: GOP dictating narrative, but he must take control before term runs out</seg>
<seg id="6">Editor's note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is a political comedian and frequent commentator on various TV networks including CNN.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is the co-director of the new comedy documentary "The Muslims Are Coming!"</seg>
<seg id="8">It was released recently.</seg>
<seg id="9">Follow him on Twitter @deanofcomedy.</seg>
<seg id="10">(CNN) -- Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama.</seg>
<seg id="11">There's the Obamacare website fiasco.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ongoing allegations of National Security Agency spying on European leaders.</seg>
<seg id="13">There was the government shutdown that damaged the economy on his watch.</seg>
<seg id="14">And a new poll released this week finds Obama with his lowest approval rating -- and his highest disapproval rating -- ever.</seg>
<seg id="15">If this were a movie, we would be at the part where the hero finds himself surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has no escape routes and he's outgunned.</seg>
<seg id="17">What will happen next: Will our hero prevail like John McClane in "Die Hard," or will he fail like William Wallace in "Braveheart"?</seg>
<seg id="18">Well, the good news for Obama is that the script for the final scenes of his presidency have not been written yet.</seg>
<seg id="19">The bad news is that he may not be the one writing it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Dean Obeidallah</seg>
<seg id="21">Simply put: Obama is not the protagonist driving his own story.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, his storyline is being dictated by others.</seg>
<seg id="23">No question, he has long had trouble controlling the narrative, with a GOP bent on denying him, basically, everything he wants.</seg>
<seg id="24">But now he's heading toward the end of his final term -- and the clock is ticking on his agenda.</seg>
<seg id="25">Obama's main antagonist, of course, is the hyper-partisan Congress that refuses to agree on the most basic issues, such as raising the debt ceiling, which Congress has done more than 40 times since 1980.</seg>
<seg id="26">And unless something changes, it's looking bad for immigration reform, universal background checks for gun purchases, income tax reform or any of the other proposals he outlined in his State of the Union nine months ago.</seg>
<seg id="27">Perhaps the worst thing about the problems with the Obamacare website is that they occurred at a time when things were finally looking politically brighter for Obama.</seg>
<seg id="28">Though the government shutdown had been an unwelcome setback, polls showed after it ended that Americans blamed the Republicans in Congress for it much more than they blamed him.</seg>
<seg id="29">It looked as if Obama had righted his ship and would be able to refocus Americans on his priorities.</seg>
<seg id="30">It was as if Obama had become George Clooney as the captain of the fishing boat in "The Perfect Storm."</seg>
<seg id="31">The rain has stopped, the ocean is turning calm and there is even a glimmer of sunlight; he's beaten the storm.</seg>
<seg id="32">But then moments later, the sky darkens and there is a deluge of rain.</seg>
<seg id="33">The choppy waters (in this case, the Obamacare website debacle) soon consume the ship.</seg>
<seg id="34">Is this Obama's metaphoric fate?</seg>
<seg id="35">He can accept another plotline -- let's say of "Gravity," with Obama as a character like Sandra Bullock's, hit with one harrowing challenge after another.</seg>
<seg id="36">This may be exciting to watch, but not great for the character, who has no idea what will happen next.</seg>
<seg id="37">I'd recommend a different story line.</seg>
<seg id="38">I'd use the ending of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" as inspiration and metaphorically go out with guns blazing.</seg>
<seg id="39">Why not set some lofty goals that will frame the agenda anew going forward?</seg>
<seg id="40">First, Obama should announce that retaking control of the House in 2014 is a top priority.</seg>
<seg id="41">Yes, many districts have been gerrymandered to all but ensure re-election for Republican House members.</seg>
<seg id="42">But he should take the fight to his adversaries anyway.</seg>
<seg id="43">Unseating some tea party House members has become newly possible after the shutdown mess.</seg>
<seg id="44">Their approval ratings are just below toe fungus.</seg>
<seg id="45">Can the President maneuver through this new landscape and turn it to his advantage?</seg>
<seg id="46">Even getting more moderate Republicans into the House could be a step toward sanity.</seg>
<seg id="47">Sometimes you have to improvise to make a story line work.</seg>
<seg id="48">Obama should also use executive orders to the extent legally possible to attain his policy objectives.</seg>
<seg id="49">He did this very thing in 2011 when he ordered that many children of parents illegally in the United States would no longer be deported.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the upside is that the debate will be about the issues the President has chosen.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's denouement time for Obama as we enter the final act of his presidency.</seg>
<seg id="53">Will the President's agenda continue to be dictated by others, making him nothing more than a lame duck, caretaker President?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or will he use every means at his discretion to write his own story?</seg>
<seg id="55">Obama is the star of this movie.</seg>
<seg id="56">The only question is: How is it going to end?</seg>
<seg id="57">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.</seg>

<seg id="1">Do you wash your hands?</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have discovered that washing your hands can ALSO CHANGE YOUR MOOD.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some 98 people, split into three groups, took part in the experiment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first two had to solve an impossible task.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, neither succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the group that washed their hands after their failure acted far more optimistically than the one where participants did not wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, the group "with washed hands" performed better in another test than the other.</seg>
<seg id="8">Despite that, those who had washed their hands got worse results in other tests than those who had not washed their hands.</seg>
<seg id="9">The results of those "washed" were on the level of the third group, whose participants had not recorded any previous failure.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to psychologists, the test results show that bodily cleanliness removes actual negative feelings after failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, at the same time motivation falls, in further tests the test subjects must concentrate much more.</seg>
<seg id="12">If we transferred the research results to Czechs, we would be the most optimistic after coming back from the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only one per cent of Czech women and men do not wash their hands after using the toilet, but after travelling on public transport, it is already one fifth.</seg>
<seg id="14">They also take special care to be hygienic after work in the garden or a workshop, when 85 per cent of people wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="15">Stroking a pet motivates 78.7 per cent of people to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="16">A recent survey revealed that a difference exists in the perceptions of Czechs and Slovaks about how necessary it is to wash your hands after shaking hands with a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="17">In this situation, 28.8 per cent of Czechs and 40.3 per cent of Slovaks wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="18">The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Although it would be right, I’m afraid the reality is different and people try to make themselves seem a little better," commented dermatologist Klaudie Komárková on the results of the survey.</seg>

<seg id="5">An SSPCA spokeswoman explained: "The bird was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was collected by Animal Rescue Officer Karen Hogg."</seg>
<seg id="6">The water rail was then transported to the Scottish SPCA's National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa, before being released on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Colin Seddon, the centre's manager, said: "This water rail was likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea."</seg>
<seg id="8">It seems the bird became exhausted and managed to find refuge on the oil rig.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was unable to fly off again so we were contacted for help.</seg>
<seg id="10">He continued: "The water rail was fit and well by the time it was released at Loch Gelly in Fife."</seg>
<seg id="11">This was an ideal spot as the loch is surrounded by reedbeds, with no fishing and very little disturbance.</seg>

<seg id="2">A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image, leading to an acquittal.</seg>

<seg id="2">Things we know: People like to use their laptops to look at photos, videos and GIFs of cats.</seg>
<seg id="3">They don't, however, like it when their computers smell like cat urine or a cat litter box.</seg>
<seg id="4">Or at least that's what we now know from a series of posts on Dell's site.</seg>
<seg id="5">A number of people who bought Dell's latest Latitude 6430u ultrabook opened the box to find that the laptop, and primarily the keyboard, had an odd odor that resembled cat pee.</seg>
<seg id="6">The machine is great, but it smells as if it was assembled near a tomcat's litter box.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is truly awful!</seg>
<seg id="8">"It seems to be coming from the keyboard," one user posted in June.</seg>
<seg id="9">More recently, on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="10">23, Kate M wrote, "I received the Latitude 6430u for work about two months ago, and I had the same horrendous smell!"</seg>
<seg id="11">This forum was very helpful in convincing my IT department that it wasn't just me being crazy, the computer legitimately smelled horrible.</seg>
<seg id="12">The thread, which is absolutely worth a read, can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="13">And, no, this isn't Dell's way of celebrating National Cat Day, which was earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="14">In a statement released on Wednesday, the company assured the public that "the odor was not related to biological contamination nor did it present a health hazard."</seg>
<seg id="15">It added that the "manufacturing process has subsequently been amended and newly purchased Latitude 6430us are not affected by the issue."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't say specifically what causes the odor, but in the past, electronic odors have been related to adhesives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dell, which became a private company on Wednesday, also said that it has been replacing laptops with the cat-pee smell since the problem was first reported a few months ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">Within the thread, Dell support has responded to user complaints.</seg>
<seg id="19">One very witty commenter thanks Dell for its "purrfect attentiveness" and suggested it rename the model the "Catitude 6430u."</seg>

<seg id="5">GEELONG great Joel Corey could backflip on his retirement plans and join Josh Hunt at Greater Western Sydney next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Corey, 31, is considering an offer from the Giants to fulfil the same player-assistant coaching role Luke Power performed two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">The deal is not yet over the line as Corey is also weighing up other coaching opportunities in his home state of Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="8">A dual All-Australian, he could continue the trend of cast-off Cats defying Geelong's notion their AFL playing days were done.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fellow premiership hero Paul Champan has joined Essendon after being delisted, while Hunt (GWS) and James Podsiadly (Adelaide) also found suitors after being let go.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is understood West Coast is also keen to secure the highly respected Corey in a coaching position.</seg>
<seg id="11">The two-time best-and- fairest winner and clearance specialist has made it clear he wants to stay in football after finishing up at Geelong after 276 games in 14 seasons.</seg>
<seg id="12">He played a significant role in the Cats' onball group this year, finishing with an average of 21 disposals, three clearances and five tackles a game.</seg>
<seg id="13">Corey has won universal respect across the AFL for his selfless playing style and character which helped guide Geelong through one of the most successful periods of all time.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Giants have recognised the experience, leadership and hardness he would add to a young team that has only won three games in their first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="15">His strong handle on stoppage strategies would also be highly valuable to new Giants coach Leon Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="16">GWS signed Corey's former Geelong teammate Hunt on a one-year deal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Public health policies, practices may negatively affect marginalized populations</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 - Despite the best intentions of those working in public health, some policies and practices inadvertently further disadvantage marginalized populations, according to a commentary by a researcher at St. Michael's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dr. Diego S. Silva, a scientist in the hospital's Centre for Research on Inner City Health, said there's an emphasis toward social justice in public health, particularly when it comes to people who are marginalized, disadvantaged or vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="4">"For example, despite evidence suggesting that people who are homeless are at greater risk of being infected with influenza and suffer greater morbidity than the general population, many pandemic influenza plans provide impracticable advice or otherwise fail to address their specific needs," said Dr. Silva.</seg>
<seg id="5">The commentary appears online today in the Canadian Journal of Public Health.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the commentary, Dr. Silva and his colleagues refer to two public health policies case studies that "are intentionally problematic and don't have an easy solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">In one example, a public health advisory issued by the State Department of Health in Indiana suggests that people who are homeless should be dissuaded from using shelters during flu outbreaks and should instead be treated on the street.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, "given the cold winters of Indiana, it seems untenable that persons who use shelters will be able to, or ought to, stay away from them without placing themselves in danger of other perils, such as freezing to death," Dr. Silva said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dr. Silva said that while it is good advice to urge people to stay home when they are sick, the policy can take on different meanings for various populations.</seg>
<seg id="10">"What does it mean to 'stay home' if you're homeless?" said Dr. Silva, who has a PhD in public health.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the second case study, some mental health centres maintain indoor smoking bans on the grounds they reduce the harm associated with second-hand smoke.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, some studies suggest that smoking may have neurological and social benefits for people with schizophrenia.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Thus even seemingly uncontroversial and commonplace public health programs, like those of tobacco cessation, may have the effect of disproportionately disadvantaging those who are already disadvantaged," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Dr. Silva, a greater emphasis on teaching ethics and the philosophy of science is also needed in graduate schools or departments of public health.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dr. Silva said there needs to be a greater emphasis on teaching ethics and the philosophy of science in graduate schools or departments of public health.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said those in public health schools need to ask more question about ethics and look at what they use as evidence when they make public health policies.</seg>
<seg id="17">"This is particularly important when thinking about and questioning what constitutes the good and the right in public health, and may help guard against simplistic applications of ethics theories or principles (whether utilitarian or others)," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Dr. Silva said it is important for public health officials to speak to the actual populations that will be affected by a public health policy or program.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In the public health community, we are intimately aware of people who are marginalized," said Dr. Silva.</seg>
<seg id="20">The more that we are explicit about the values of public health and its intentions, the more that we will create policies and programs that will better serve marginalized populations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall</seg>
<seg id="2">Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.</seg>
<seg id="5">Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
<seg id="12">But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.</seg>
<seg id="15">Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.</seg>
<seg id="19">That will happen all through the flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15," said Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="25">Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.</seg>
<seg id="30">The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="35">The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with the HIV virus.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the start of monitoring in 1986 to the end of the third quarter this year, tests have confirmed infection in a total of 1005 people from the capital.</seg>
<seg id="4">The information comes from statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS at the National Institute for Public Health.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the statistics there have been 2063 people infected so far in the whole of the Czech Republic,.</seg>

<seg id="9">In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121 of them.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2009, an investigation revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 there were 180.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law</seg>
<seg id="2">"It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government "a stranglehold over the media," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "dealt a major blow" and lambasted the bill as "draconian."</seg>
<seg id="7">The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.</seg>
<seg id="10">Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."</seg>
<seg id="13">It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."</seg>
<seg id="14">By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Cook said: "Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system."</seg>
<seg id="5">"But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of the Khmer Rouge and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the government of the Khmer Rouge, which in the years from 1975 to 1979 was based on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, more than three million Cambodians lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and executions, at least a quarter of the population at the time.</seg>

<seg id="7">"It’s easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and intervened and fixed the situation," said Khieu Samphan on Thursday before the court.</seg>

<seg id="2">Roma became the first team to win the opening 10 matches of a Serie A season when they beat Chievo 1-0 on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Striker Marco Borriello's first goal of the campaign gave the Italian league leaders a slender home victory over the bottom-of-the-table team.</seg>
<seg id="4">Roma, who have scored 24 goals and conceded just one this campaign, lead second-placed Napoli by five points.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's a nice satisfaction, we've made history, but now we have to look ahead to our trip to Torino," said Borriello.</seg>
<seg id="6">We're also playing very well away from home, but our objective is (to qualify for) Europe.</seg>
<seg id="7">25 Aug: Livorno (away) 2-0</seg>
<seg id="8">01 Sep: Verona (home) 3-0</seg>
<seg id="9">16 Sep: Parma (away) 3-1</seg>
<seg id="10">22 Sep: Lazio (home) 2-0</seg>

<seg id="15">27 Oct: Udinese (away) 1-0</seg>
<seg id="16">31 Oct: Chievo (home) 1-0</seg>
<seg id="17">Rudi Garcia's side equalled Juventus's record of nine opening wins in last weekend thanks to a late 1-0 win away to Udinese.</seg>
<seg id="18">Juve achieved the feat during the 2005-2006 season, when the Turin giants were stripped of the title and any other related honours for match-fixing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Despite missing captain Francesco Totti and Gervinho through injury and with defender Douglas Maicon suspended, Roma dominated but struggled to break down Chievo before the break.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the second half wore on, Marquinho was replaced with striker Alessandro Florenzi and the hosts broke the deadlock several minutes later.</seg>
<seg id="21">Miralem Pjanic's pass found Florenzi deep on the left and the forward's inviting cross was headed home by Borriello from six yards.</seg>
<seg id="22">Luca Rigoni went close for the visitors late on before Adem Ljajic's free-kick was tipped away by goalkeeper Christian Puggioni to prevent a second.</seg>

<seg id="1">New dental school deferred, public services to be tendered out as South Australia Government cuts funding</seg>
<seg id="2">Bundoora Dental Group have donated their time free to the underprivileged.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dr Jonathan Kwok and Nikki Milwian Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="4">PLANS to build a new School of Dentistry at the new Royal Adelaide Hospital site have been dumped and the Adelaide Dental Hospital will be wound down, with its services put out to tender.</seg>
<seg id="5">The moves, triggered by the State Government's search for savings in the Health Department, have prompted dual warnings of cuts to community care as well as a shortage of dental students.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dentists are furious at the decision by the University of Adelaide not to move the School of Dentistry from Frome Rd to the new Royal Adelaide Hospital site with the Schools of Medicine and Nursing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Australian Dental Association SA branch president Dr Jack Gaffey said the decision would leave the future of the School of Dentistry in limbo.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dr Gaffey said he was assured earlier this year by the University's Executive Dean, Professor Justin Beilby, that the School of Dentistry would also be moved to the new West End campus.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the backflip would jeopardise the future of dental education in South Australia.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The ADASA is surprised at the favouritism shown by the University of Adelaide's Faculty of Health Sciences to the Schools of Medicine and Nursing in comparison to its shabby treatment of Dentistry," Dr Gaffey said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are very concerned that the effects of isolation of the Dental School will impact on the future of dental education and research in South Australia.</seg>
<seg id="12">This disastrous and uncertain move could result in the Dental School not taking in new students in future years.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dr Gaffey met Health Minister Jack Snelling on Thursday about the issue but the State Government refused to commit any funding for a new Dental School.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prof Beilby said the University had planned to build a new Adelaide Dental Hospital as part of the Dental School in the new medical precinct.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, it was recently told the State Government would not fund it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"That means we must adjust our plans accordingly," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The University has now deferred plans for new facilities for its Dental School until next year and resolved to start construction in the West End for Medicine and Nursing education only.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prof Beilby said SA Health has also advised that, from 2015, it would downsize the existing Adelaide Dental Hospital on Frome Rd from 150 dental chairs to about 30.</seg>
<seg id="19">It would also tender out the public dental service.</seg>
<seg id="20">"University of Adelaide staff and students currently provide over 60 per cent of the public dental services in South Australia," Prof Beilby said.</seg>
<seg id="21">This decision may prevent the University from continuing to offer much-needed care to the community while also restricting essential student clinical training opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Comment is being sought from the State Government.</seg>

<seg id="1">We want to show that Plzen still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a bit of a paradox.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whilst his team has mainly failed recently with its results, defender and midfielder of Viktoria Plzen, Frantisek Rajtoral, has been on form which has earned him a return to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is also successful shooting, he is full of energy; after a tackle on him in the Teplice game, a penalty kick was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="5">Viktoria was reaching for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice, but in the end it only took one point from these two duels.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frantisek Rajtoral believes that his team will break this unpleasant series in the game with Jablonec.</seg>
<seg id="7">We want to show that we can win.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I believe that we will beat Jablonec at home," promises Frantisek Rajtoral.</seg>
<seg id="9">The team is preparing carefully for the difficult match with the North Bohemians, who play attacking football.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is focussed on the game with Jablonec, the coach is preparing us well, and as always we’re getting a lot from the game analysis video of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I believe that it will be an excellent match on Friday evening," says the Czech international to attract fans to the stands of the Doosan Arena.</seg>
<seg id="12">Plzen’s last matches have not gone the way they wanted, but the Viktoria defender rejects the word crisis.</seg>
<seg id="13">That’s the way it goes in football, sometimes you’re on good form and sometimes it’s worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">But I wouldn’t call it a crisis in any case.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," says the West Bohemian defender.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Viktoria team will again rely on the support of its fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are playing on Friday evening and I’d like to take this opportunity to invite our great fans."</seg>
<seg id="18">"I believe that we’ll reward them with a win," adds Rajtoral.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mansfield Couple Murder Probe: Two Arrested</seg>
<seg id="2">A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of murdering a couple in 1998.</seg>
<seg id="3">It follows the discovery of human remains buried in the back garden of a house in Blenheim Close, Mansfield, on October 9.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nottinghamshire Police said that while formal identification has yet to be confirmed, officers believe the remains are that of elderly couple William and Patricia Wycherley, who lived at the house in the 1990s and, according to neighbours, disappeared in 1998.</seg>
<seg id="5">The arrested 57-year-old man and 55-year-old woman remain in police custody in Nottinghamshire for questioning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Officers have said Mrs Wycherley is believed to have been born in Fulham, west London, and would now have been 79.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police said bone analysis had shed further light on the remains found at the semi-detached house.</seg>
<seg id="8">One of the bodies is believed by experts to be that of an elderly white man who was older than 60, well-built and around 5ft 8in.</seg>
<seg id="9">The second set of remains is likely to be that of a well-built white woman, who was 40 or older and around 5ft 6in.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the cause of death has yet to be determined in both cases, the female remains are said to have a "distinctive feature in their anatomy."</seg>
<seg id="11">Detective Chief Inspector Rob Griffin, who is leading the inquiry, previously said the findings support the theory that the remains are those of the Wycherleys.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said: "Bill and Pat, who would be 100 and 79 respectively if they were to still be alive today, were known to be quite reclusive.</seg>
<seg id="13">But with help from relatives and old friends we are starting to build a picture of their lives and, more importantly, their movements in 1998, when neighbours say they simply disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings powers back to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels" regulatory approach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two fans go head to head ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool's crunch match in the Premier League</seg>
<seg id="2">ARSENAL host Liverpool in a mouth-watering Premier League contest on Sunday, 4.25am (EDT) on Fox Sports 1 HD.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's a battle between two teams desperate to sustain their start to the season, and to prove their worth in big matches like these.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's one of the great match-ups on the football calendar, and we've headed to the terraces for a different point of view on the contest.</seg>
<seg id="5">At home, in Arsene Wenger's corner, is Tony Harper, News Corp Australia/Fox Sports National Digital Editor.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vouching for Brendan Rodgers's boys is Brenton Speed, Fox Sports football commentator.</seg>
<seg id="7">We're looking to use football Super Fans to be a part of our big game debates, and to contribute via videos from A-League matches.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you want to be a part of it, email tony.harper@foxsports.com.au (and tell us which team you support).</seg>
<seg id="9">HARPER: I don't think we will.</seg>
<seg id="10">The wear and tear is starting to show - this will be Arsenal's 16th game of the season to Liverpool's 11th with a squad built for pretty, fair weather football, not a blood and thunder battle.</seg>
<seg id="11">If Arsenal can learn from their naivete against Dortmund, a fighting draw would be a good start to a defining November stretch.</seg>
<seg id="12">SPEED: We were 2-nil up at the Emirates in January, with Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge too hot to handle, and now those two return much higher in confidence, plus Philippe Coutinho is ready to go after injury, so good luck containing that trio.</seg>
<seg id="13">If they score 2 we'll score 3.</seg>
<seg id="14">Arsenal and Liverpool go head-to-head this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="15">HARPER: No question - even Arsene Wenger tried to buy Suarez to replace, or complement if you're being kind, Giroud.</seg>
<seg id="16">That said Giroud has been great this season, giving central defenders a fight, scoring some clinical goals and providing some sweet assists - none better than the final pass in the Wilshere stunner against Norwich.</seg>
<seg id="17">Swap them?</seg>
<seg id="18">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="19">But you'd rather have both!</seg>
<seg id="20">SPEED: A lot to like about Giroud's form this season - must be happy in the knowledge he'll definitely never have to share an attacking third with Chamakh again!</seg>
<seg id="21">But Suarez is a cut above, coming off a hat-trick against the Baggies against the notoriously loose and tardy Arsenal back 4... look out!!</seg>
<seg id="22">HARPER: Wenger wins the beauty contest against all but a few teams - Barca, Dortmund, Bayern?</seg>
<seg id="23">Does that matter though?</seg>
<seg id="24">Failing to win anything in eight years is one thing but if they did it playing like Stoke under Tony Pulis it would be a helluva lot harder to get up at 1am on a Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="25">Albert Camus (a goalkeeper, mind you) reckons, "Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time."</seg>
<seg id="26">But if beauty is unbearable, what the hell is Ryan Shawcross?</seg>
<seg id="27">SPEED: Arsene has taken a decade and a half to finally produce that goal he craves with Wilshere the other week, while less than a year-and-a-half into his spell at Anfield, Rodgers has the Reds purring along already.</seg>
<seg id="28">Winner!</seg>
<seg id="29">HARPER: We'll know a lot more in a month.</seg>
<seg id="30">Liverpool, Man United, and then Southampton in the league, with Dortmund soaking up our energy in the Champions league.</seg>
<seg id="31">We don't need to win them all but we can't lose them all.</seg>
<seg id="32">If we're intact with 4-5 points from that run we'll have hope.</seg>
<seg id="33">My fear - as with any Arsenal fan - is that we have gone in light on squad players.</seg>
<seg id="34">SPEED: As long as we keep Joe Allen in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="35">Told everyone who'd listen last year the Welshman was costing us crucial points at this stage of the season, and now after his 11 combined minutes in the new campaign we are flying high.</seg>
<seg id="36">If Suarez and Sturridge can start atleast another 20-25 games this season as a combination we'll be there when the whips are cracking.</seg>
<seg id="37">HARPER: Ian Wright, Wright, Wright.</seg>
<seg id="38">I was an Arsenal fan before my first trip to the North Bank, Highbury in 1993 but Ian Wright burst through against Everton juggled once, juggled two and then looped Cupid's arrow over Neville Southall.</seg>
<seg id="39">From flirtation to love affair right there.</seg>
<seg id="40">SPEED: Let's put it this way, the moment I love does not involve Arshavin... the moment I love to reflect on is 2001 FA Cup final!!</seg>
<seg id="41">The look on Michael Owen's face after his second goal in the last 10 minutes is pure gold, and for mine encapsulates what it must feel like to live out a boyhood dream and score the winner in a Cup final.</seg>
<seg id="42">HARPER: I saw some great wins, a gut wrenching defeat or two but my favourite is unlikely to be shared by anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="43">A rubbish game, a 1-0 win over Wolves decided by a 94th minute Nick Bendtner goal, and at Emirates not Highbury.</seg>
<seg id="44">But it was the first time and only times I've seen the Arsenal with my sons.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's not always about beautiful football.</seg>
<seg id="46">SPEED: The first taste I got live was the Carling Cup final in Cardiff in 2003 when we beat Man U, so that will live on forever, but nothing beats being in Istanbul in 2005 for the UEFA Champions League final against AC Milan!</seg>
<seg id="47">I took a video from the stands of Xabi Alonso's penalty to bring it back to 3-3 - it actually which sums it all up.</seg>
<seg id="48">Best 600 quid I ever spent in my time in London to get return charter flight to Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1">By Sir Michael Caine</seg>
<seg id="2">Mel Smith died three months ago with a dream unfulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was preparing to portray in a TV film the rumbustious London restaurateur Peter Langan, whose signature dish was insults.</seg>
<seg id="4">Night after night, Langan would lurch towards tables occupied by the rich, the famous and the royal in his fashionable brasserie just off Piccadilly and behave outrageously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Smith had been fascinated for years by the stories of Irish-born Langan's almost comic notoriety, and enjoyed it when people remarked on his physical resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Man of the moment: Peter Langan, owned and ran Langan's Brasserie in London's Mayfair and was infamous for his drunken outbursts and outrageous behavior</seg>
<seg id="7">So he was thrilled when he was sent a script for a biopic to mark the 25th anniversary of Langan's bizarre death.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Smith's own death from a heart attack has put the TV film on hold.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, Langan's legend lives on.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, Sir Michael Caine who was his business partner, recalls how, in spite of Peter's excesses, Langan's became such a success:</seg>
<seg id="11">I was having a nice dinner at my usual window table in Langan's with my wife Shakira, our daughter and my mother when Peter Langan decided to join us.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was his style.</seg>
<seg id="13">He would plonk himself down at diners" tables, uninvited - usually unwelcome, sometimes entertaining, but never sober.</seg>
<seg id="14">I could see that Peter was the worse for wear.</seg>
<seg id="15">He and I were partners, but we hadn't been getting on very well lately, and he began making a nuisance of himself.</seg>
<seg id="16">Telling his story: Sir Michael Caine speaks - mostly - fond words of his friend Peter Langan</seg>
<seg id="17">I called over our other partner, the chef Richard Shepherd.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Tell Peter to leave my bloody table," I pleaded.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then my mum told me off for swearing!</seg>
<seg id="20">Richard tried to persuade him to come to the bar, but Peter refused.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I ain't going anywhere, kid," he replied.</seg>
<seg id="22">Tell Michael Caine to f*** off.</seg>
<seg id="23">Impasse.</seg>
<seg id="24">I said: "I can go anywhere I want."</seg>
<seg id="25">I don't have to come to Langan's to be insulted.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unless you leave my table, I am leaving.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Then f***ing leave," replied Peter.</seg>
<seg id="28">So I did.</seg>
<seg id="29">That was typical Peter.</seg>
<seg id="30">When in those moods, he insisted on addressing me by my real name, Maurice Micklewhite.</seg>
<seg id="31">He had this idea I was from a lower social order, and when he wanted to be insulting he described me as a "mediocrity with halitosis who has a council house mind."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'd retaliate by saying: "Peter stumbles around in a cloud of his own vomit and is a complete social embarrassment."</seg>
<seg id="33">You would have a more interesting conversation with a cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="34">But he did make me laugh, even if the other diners didn't always find him so funny.</seg>
<seg id="35">Princess Margaret and her young lover Roddy Llewellyn had enjoyed an intimate meal and were just at the coffee stage when Peter stumbled over.</seg>
<seg id="36">Mumbling incoherently, he took off his jacket and hung it on the back of Margaret's chair.</seg>
<seg id="37">Then he climbed on to the table - knocking cups and jugs of milk everywhere - and promptly fell asleep.</seg>
<seg id="38">Margaret was not amused.</seg>
<seg id="39">She and Roddy left, never to return.</seg>
<seg id="40">It wasn't his only brush with royalty.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Is it true you're a f***ing poof?" he once asked Prince Albert of Monaco.</seg>
<seg id="42">I always used to say that we could never bar anyone from Langan's because we'd have to start with Peter.</seg>
<seg id="43">Even so, he tried.</seg>
<seg id="44">He once barred Rudolf Nureyev "for being himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">He failed to recognise Marlon Brando, explaining: "The only thing I knew about him was that he is even fatter than me."</seg>
<seg id="46">And when Peter demanded to know why the restaurant had sent Ronnie Corbett a case of champagne, a furious Richard told him the truth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Because you insulted him, Peter.</seg>
<seg id="48">He might be small, but there was no need to tell him he's a f****** midget.</seg>
<seg id="49">When Peter was around, you had to be careful about having him meet your friends.</seg>
<seg id="50">Like the time I introduced him to Orson Welles.</seg>
<seg id="51">Was Peter impressed with one of cinema's greats?</seg>
<seg id="52">Not a bit.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I think you're a stupid fat ****," said Peter.</seg>
<seg id="54">A waiter grabbed him and hustled him away.</seg>
<seg id="55">That was the last time I introduced Peter to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="56">Just occasionally, some of our celebrity diners were made to feel welcome by Peter.</seg>
<seg id="57">Like the time he tried to carry Billy Connolly on a joyful lap of honour round the restaurant after the Big Yin had opened in the play The Beastly Beatitudes Of Balthazar B.</seg>
<seg id="58">Langan's Brasseries was opened in 1976 by Michael Caine and then unknown chef Peter Langan</seg>
<seg id="59">You'd wonder sometimes why some diners ever came back.</seg>
<seg id="60">Fuelled by a daily intake of a dozen bottles of champagne, as he liked to boast, he'd crawl under tables and bite women's ankles, sometimes going even further than that.</seg>
<seg id="61">Janet Street-Porter and the actress Maria Aitken were particular victims.</seg>
<seg id="62">It was possible to call his bluff, though.</seg>
<seg id="63">He'd go up to women and say "Show us your t*ts."</seg>
<seg id="64">One woman did just that - and a very surprised Peter ran away.</seg>
<seg id="65">Sometimes he was all bluster.</seg>
<seg id="66">I'd eat with Peter as often as I could, if only to keep him distracted from upsetting the customers.</seg>
<seg id="67">When he got up to leave from lunch one day, I noticed he was limping - and there were car tyre tracks across his shoes.</seg>
<seg id="68">What happened to your feet?</seg>
<seg id="69">I asked.</seg>
<seg id="70">"A car ran over them," he said.</seg>
<seg id="71">How the car had hit his feet and missed his very prominent stomach, I don't know - but I found it funny, even though his feet hurt terribly.</seg>
<seg id="72">As I say, we didn't always get on - Peter was an irascible man - but our partnership started with great promise.</seg>
<seg id="73">In 1973, I was making a movie called The Wilby Conspiracy with Sidney Poitier.</seg>
<seg id="74">We'd been on location in Africa but were finishing the picture in London.</seg>
<seg id="75">Sidney and I used to take turns entertaining each other to dinner.</seg>
<seg id="76">While I would take him and his wife Joanna to a variety of restaurants, he would always take me and my wife Shakira to the same place.</seg>
<seg id="77">It was Odin's, a small brasserie in Marylebone.</seg>
<seg id="78">The chef there, an unknown Peter Langan, made the best mushroom pate, spinach and seafood salads and crème brulee I ever had, anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="79">Ready to fill his shoes: Mel Smith died before portraying Peter Langan</seg>
<seg id="80">I used to tell Sidney that there was plenty of scope in London for a really big Parisian-style brasserie, but alas there wasn't one.</seg>
<seg id="81">We were on set one day and Sidney said: "You know the chef in that restaurant where I take you?"</seg>
<seg id="82">He'd like to open a great big brasserie but he needs someone to back him.</seg>
<seg id="83">I said I'd like to talk to him about it.</seg>
<seg id="84">So one night in Odin's, Sidney brought Peter over to our table and he asked me if it was true that I was interested in opening a French brasserie-style place, the biggest in London.</seg>
<seg id="85">I said I was.</seg>
<seg id="86">Peter asked if I had any money.</seg>
<seg id="87">"Yeah," I told him.</seg>
<seg id="88">"So let's do it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="89">Peter had found a huge site: the former home of the old Coq d'Or restaurant in Piccadilly.</seg>
<seg id="90">I put up some money.</seg>
<seg id="91">Richard Shepherd, one of London's top chefs, came on board and we three partners had a wonderful time.</seg>
<seg id="92">Peter was an inspired restaurateur.</seg>
<seg id="93">He would tell me: "The walls must talk."</seg>
<seg id="94">So the whole place was covered in pictures by his up-and-coming artist friends - people like David Hockney and Patrick Procktor, who had paid for their meals at Odin's by giving him their paintings.</seg>
<seg id="95">I had complete faith in Peter.</seg>
<seg id="96">He taught me a lot of things about running a restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="97">"Everybody in the restaurant must be able to see everybody else at all times," he told me.</seg>
<seg id="98">I asked Peter why.</seg>
<seg id="99">Because you are not coming to our restaurant on the way to the show or after the show: you are the show.</seg>
<seg id="100">When you walk in, you are the star.</seg>
<seg id="101">When you sit down, you are the audience.</seg>
<seg id="102">When he wanted to site the bar right inside the front door, I said it would be too crowded there.</seg>
<seg id="103">He said: "You want a restaurant that looks busy."</seg>
<seg id="104">You don't want to walk into an empty room.</seg>
<seg id="105">After a shaky start (we were being robbed blind by some of our staff), the restaurant became incredibly successful from a social point of view, and it was full of stars.</seg>
<seg id="106">I brought my friends from the movie business.</seg>
<seg id="107">I wanted them to be there because it was my restaurant, as well.</seg>
<seg id="108">But a lot of people came to see Peter at his best (or worst!), and I could always see disappointment on their faces on the nights he wasn't there.</seg>
<seg id="109">Peter always liked a drink.</seg>
<seg id="110">He was a very bright man, but people only saw him drunk - and when people are drunk they seem stupid.</seg>
<seg id="111">But Peter was far from that.</seg>
<seg id="112">In those early days, he was very professional and often only pretending to be drunk.</seg>
<seg id="113">Richard remembers arriving at the door of the restaurant with Peter, who was stone-cold sober.</seg>
<seg id="114">He turned to Richard and said, "Showtime," then fell through the doors on to the floor, where he remained for half an hour.</seg>
<seg id="115">It was all for show then - but near the end, it was no act.</seg>
<seg id="116">He'd wanted to open a Langan's in Los Angeles, but I didn't want to be part of it.</seg>
<seg id="117">Peter was so enraged that he retaliated by removing my window table from the London restaurant!</seg>
<seg id="118">It ended in tragedy in 1988, when Peter was only 47.</seg>
<seg id="119">With his lifestyle perhaps it was inevitable; but it was sad, and terrible, nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="120">Depressed at the collapse of his marriage to his wife, Susan, he tried to set fire to her, and himself, in the bedroom of their Essex home.</seg>
<seg id="121">She escaped by jumping into the garden from the first-floor balcony, but Peter suffered burns and smoke inhalation and died six weeks later.</seg>
<seg id="122">I sold my share of Langan's to Richard Shepherd in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="123">I'd done very well out of my investment, and the restaurant continues to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="124">As for making a film about those wild days: well, his life will make a great movie.</seg>
<seg id="125">But I don't know who will portray Peter now that Mel has gone.</seg>
<seg id="126">But I'd be happy to play myself.</seg>
<seg id="127">I'm rather good at that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Post-election goulash rather than post-election tenderloin</seg>
<seg id="2">The October election brought a bunch of losers rather than a winner.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is not just the parties who did not even get to the Chamber of Deputies (e. g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally even the ČSSD due to its internal rift.</seg>
<seg id="4">Over the weekend, politicians served us a post-election goulash rather than a festive tenderloin.</seg>
<seg id="5">The biggest jump in the election was from Andrej Babiš’s movement, who promised voters they would change the political style of governing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fragmentation of the election results and the rift in the winning party plays up to the political will/despotism of President Miloš Zeman regardless of the wishes of voters, who did not even elect the party publicly supported by President Zeman to the Chamber of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="7">While the president lost his strategic edge over other politicians due to the unpleasant events, he still has several ways of getting it back – for example by selecting the future prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the ČSSD's chances of getting the premiership, in my view, are disappearing, the businessman Andrej Babiš is getting closer.</seg>
<seg id="9">Post-election development may still be far removed from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the Communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to the vocal opposition of ANO to get together with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still a coalition between ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 MPs).</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the rift within ČSSD, which consequently became an unreadable and weak partner in negotiations, the result of coalition talks may be quite depressing for the ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="12">A minority government of the ČSSD made up of anti-Zeman people will probably not pass through at the Castle.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, any government in which the ČSSD participates will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another rift within the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I ask myself: "Are we not going headlong into another early election?"</seg>
<seg id="15">Another election would be more of a referendum on the power of an electoral mandate for the ANO movement.</seg>
<seg id="16">Plans of the ČSSD to introduce sector taxes, a more significant increase in income tax and building of the state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.</seg>
<seg id="17">The ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit (Dawn) parties, in contrast, agree for example on promoting business, a moderate fiscal policy (a government deficit below 3% GDP), supporting employment for the disadvantaged, and reducing the lower rate of VAT for selected goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friction surfaces are most often found in the view of social policy and the size of the state.</seg>
<seg id="19">ANO now has the upper hand, however, so for now the programme of the most probable coalition of ANO, ČSSD and KDU-ČSL would lean more to the right.</seg>
<seg id="20">From my point of view, this is in the end a better result than a left-wing programme with tax on everything that still moves in the economy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Time Warner Cable: house on fire</seg>
<seg id="2">High-speed internet has been a firewall for US cable companies, protecting subscriber numbers as TV customers cut the cord.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Time Warner Cable's third-quarter results reveal a company engulfed in flames.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not only did its TV customers storm the exits (after merely trickling out before), it shed some broadband users too.</seg>
<seg id="5">Either its customers do not want to watch Netflix over the internet or, more likely, are switching to Verizon or another provider.</seg>
<seg id="6">So with a chief executive transition pending, and wheeler-dealer John Malone smacking his chops in anticipation of a tie-up, investors are left to wonder if TWC has no choice but to do a major deal.</seg>
<seg id="7">TV subscriber numbers are grim enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">TWC lost 300,000 cable customers in the third quarter and has already lost more this year than in all of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="9">But while internet users came to the rescue last year, this time round they too are deserting the company (24,000 went elsewhere in the quarter).</seg>
<seg id="10">Making the loss more galling, TWC rival Comcast added nearly 300,000 internet subscribers in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="11">Of course, competition differs across regions of the US.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Time Warner's dispute with CBS could not have helped its already frayed relationship with its customers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Time Warner predicts $2.5bn in free cash flow this year, slightly less than last year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Still, it has managed to deliver a total shareholder return of 27 per cent in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">That has been propped up by the possibility of a deal with John Malone's smaller cable company Charter Communications (TWC's market cap of $34bn is more than 2 times Charter's).</seg>
<seg id="16">The knee-jerk reaction is to assume that TWC will jump into the arms of Mr Malone.</seg>
<seg id="17">But given the sizes of the two companies and the weakened negotiating position of TWC, investors should weigh their position based on the probability of a homegrown turnround.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Forrest leads depleted Queensland Bulls to unlikely first innings points against Adelaide</seg>
<seg id="2">FORGOTTEN Australia batsman Peter Forrest cashed in and South Australia sweated as Queensland secured first innings points against the odds in Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forrest (129) featured in a record, 194-run, fifth-wicket stand for the Bulls against SA with Chris Hartley (89) that stymied the Redbacks attack for 70 long overs.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Bulls were 7/400 at stumps with Nathan Hauritz on 7 and Cameron Boyce 1 - a lead of 13 runs.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a good result for the Bulls who had been decimated by a stomach bug to opener Greg Moller, allrounder</seg>
<seg id="6">Ben Cutting, and Hartley on day one.</seg>
<seg id="7">Skipper James Hopes was sidelined on match morning, too green to front.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Bulls added 92 in the second session and finally passed SA's 387 eight overs before stumps.</seg>
<seg id="9">Forrest's ton was a rare highlight on a tedious day where the early excitement centred on journalists being ejected from a lunch featuring Australian coach Darren Lehmann by officials quoting Cricket Australia instruction at Glenelg.</seg>
<seg id="10">Touted as a potential Test batsman after featuring in Australia's one-day side last year, Forrest could back his case with just 395 first class runs at 19 in 2012-13.</seg>
<seg id="11">The touch returned on a flat track for 27-year-old Forrest yesterday with 17 boundaries and three mammoth sixes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Forrest, who had filled in with the gloves for sick Hartley on Wednesday, attempted a cut off leg-spinner Adam Zampa (2/82) that resulted in an edge to Michael Klinger at slip.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chadd Sayers (1/72) bowled Hartley four overs later but the damage had already been done by the veteran Bulls.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just days after being cleared of an illegal bowling action, SA skipper Johan Botha (4/103) claimed the first four Bulls, including opener Nathan Reardon (67) before lunch.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cutting (8) endured a spicy welome, struck in the groin to cap his gastro woe and busted finger made eight before deceived by Zampa.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson says the Hawks need to improve their clearance numbers.</seg>
<seg id="3">ALASTAIR Clarkson knows his Hawthorn side will confront a different looking Adelaide forward line at AAMI Stadium tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4">But he expects the Crows game plan to remain the same.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kurt Tippett is long gone and the Crows are now coming to terms with the fact Taylor Walker will miss the year with a knee injury.</seg>
<seg id="6">The loss of opposition forwards normally creates an air of unpredictability their line-up.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Clarkson suggested today counterpart Brenton Sanderson showed his hand at the selection table last night by selecting tall forward Shaun McKernan.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It would have been a little bit more unpredictable if just (Jason) Porplyzia came in and they went a bit smaller," Clarkson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">But I'd expect that they'd structure up pretty similarly to what they have in the last little while.</seg>
<seg id="10">We've just got to make sure we defend the way we've defended all year, no matter who the opponent is.</seg>
<seg id="11">Walker is such a huge presence for them, but McKernan is a big boy.</seg>
<seg id="12">He and the big fella (Josh) Jenkins give them a bit more flexibility in what they do with the ruck, too.</seg>
<seg id="13">They can take (Sam) Jacobs forward a little bit more often than they have in the past.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we've just got to be prepared for all those things tomorrow afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Hawks were smashed in the clinches by North Melbourne last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">They lost out in clearances and contested possessions as well as inside-50s but still managed to eek out a three-point win.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clarkson said a similar result in those key areas tomorrow would not augur well for his side.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It says something about our group that we still found a way to win but I'm not too confident that if all the stats are like that this week, that we'll get over the line against the Crows," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">So we've got to make sure we're a bit more competitive in that area of the game.</seg>

<seg id="1">Minister Holcát restores post of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">The Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose numbers in the Czech Republic exceed 100,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I consider it essential that this post is clearly defined and formalised so nurses have their own representative within the official structure – an official to whom they can always turn to if they need to," explains Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="4">I value the work of nurses and I think that the nursing profession deserves to be given sufficient attention by the Ministry as well.</seg>
<seg id="5">In performing this profession, you need not only a high level of professionalism, but also a human touch and personal conviction.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will gladly and with all responsibility try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."</seg>
<seg id="7">"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare system, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients, to perform their job with all the empathy and help us to improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena Šmídová.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová on the occasion of taking office also said that she would like to deal with the various aspects of the job of nurse and plans to also work with professional associations, specialist societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Fundamentally, I do not want to separate the jobs of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary I see them standing side by side, with each of them having their competence, and together with other medical professionals creating a coordinated working team which provides healthcare services to the benefit of the patient."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I myself come across a range of problems that occur in the nursing profession; I see these difficulties and I intend to contribute to resolving them."</seg>
<seg id="11">This include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"From my own experience I know that some administrative tasks are an unnecessary burden for nurses and takes up time they could and should be devoting to patients," says Alena Šmídová.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other areas she intends to focus on include improving working conditions, looking for ways to improve cooperation in teams and with the managements of healthcare providers, revising competencies and also labour and legal issues, such as adhering to the Labour Code and not overloading nurses given their insufficient numbers at a given time and place.</seg>
<seg id="14">We often hear anonymous complaints, which however for fear of possible sanctions, are not documented as a specific case, where there may be a breach of regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If there’s no plaintiff, there’s no judge, so the post of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of retaining anonymity for such complaints and a have a specific case investigated by the relevant authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mgr. Alena Šmídová studied at the Secondary School of Nursing taking the nursing course (she graduated in 1978) and in the Arts Faculty at Charles University in Prague in the programme Nursing – Education (she graduated in 1992).</seg>
<seg id="17">Since 2010, she has been the head of the department for nursing and other non-medical professions and recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science at the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="18">During her professional career, she has worked as a bedside nurse in an internal ward, and has also worked as a teacher at the Secondary School of Nursing, where she was also the statutory representative of the director for 8 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Between 2004 and 2009 she worked as the Chief Nurse for the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="20">She has published several specialist nursing textbooks and articles in professional magazines, and delivered lectures in the field of nursing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme</seg>
<seg id="2">Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters stood to personally benefit from policies.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.</seg>
<seg id="10">Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting?</seg>
<seg id="11">"We need to have a better system," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Why is it that we shouldn't have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night?</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't like it?</seg>
<seg id="15">In this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take "very seriously" his new job.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public office is about public service.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We seek no reward, except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community," he said.</seg>

<seg id="4">By the end of the year, it wants to lay off thousand people.</seg>
<seg id="5">It plans to scale back all the side activities and wants to focus only on its main business, television broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic, and is also active in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around a quarter of people will lose their jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The media group operates television channels in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.</seg>
<seg id="9">CME include the company CET 21, which holds the licence to broadcast the television channels Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.</seg>
<seg id="10">How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs around 650 people, and what this will mean for domestic television channel number one, TV Nova, is not yet clear.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is premature and we really cannot comment," said director of communication at TV Nova, Josef Koukolíček.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to information from MF DNES, significant layoffs will not be avoided in the Czech Republic, but by far the greatest impact should be on staffing levels of CME in Romania and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both new bosses at Nova, Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took over from long-term director Adrian Sarbu, during Wednesday’s conference call with analysts, spoke about how they would like to restrict all activities not directly related to the television business.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is therefore quite probable that they will significantly restrict in particular the costs of producing their own programmes, the film and production activities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police divers resume Leschenault inlet search for deadly explosive TATP</seg>
<seg id="2">Chemical explosives found in WA have been confirmed to be the highly-volatile TATP.</seg>
<seg id="3">POLICE divers today resumed their search of the Leschenault Estuary for the deadly explosive TATP after a second "suspect package" was located by police divers yesterday."</seg>
<seg id="4">And Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan today revealed that one of the officers who handled the deadly explosive suffered a minor chemical burn which required hospital treatment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Army divers headed out onto Leschenault Inlet about 8.15am today and were out on the water about an hour before returning to shore shortly before 9.30am.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police and army divers wearing snorkels appeared to be doing a sweep of the Leschenault jetty, close to where the second suspect package was found yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr O'Callaghan confirmed that one of the police officers who handled the deadly explosive material found in Australind early this week had to be treated in hospital for a minor chemical burn to a finger.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr O'Callaghan and Premier Colin Barnett today sought to reassure the public they were not in any immediate danger following the discovery of the deadly explosive in the state's South West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The pair said every precaution was being taken and that police were treating it as an extremely serious criminal investigation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite a meeting of foreign ministers in Perth today, the national terrorism alert level has not been changed.</seg>
<seg id="11">While federal investigators are involved in the inquiry, it has not been confirmed whether ASIO is involved.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr O'Callaghan said police still did not know what was in the package found yesterday because it remained underwate, but Army bomb experts were treating it as explosive material.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said a decision on when the package would be destroyed would be made by the Australian Defence Force.</seg>
<seg id="14">""We are treating this as a serious crime investigation and there will be detectives down there and a lot of others doing work on this for the next few days," Mr O'Callaghan said."</seg>
<seg id="15">""It will not be a short operation.</seg>
<seg id="16">But what I can tell you is that our priority is to make sure the community is safe.</seg>
<seg id="17">And the ADF will have to provide us with further advice about how they are going to deal with the package in the water.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is being treated as a potentially volatile explosive package.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr O'Callaghan also defended the police procedure following the discovery of the first package saying a presumptive test carried out on the substance indicated that it was "illicit."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The officers concerned treated that substance like any other drug," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">The package was transported as an illicit drug because presumptive tests indicated that it might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">""Bear in mind drugs get cut with all different compounds.</seg>
<seg id="23">The officer followed protocol.</seg>
<seg id="24">Once it was identified of course we dealt with it as a volatile material.""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Premier said he wanted to reassure the local Australind community, as well as the wider public, that there was no immediate danger and that community safety was the number one consideration.</seg>
<seg id="26">""All that is being done is what needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is a significant operation underway involving and being led by WA Police but also involving federal agencies.</seg>
<seg id="28">Several precautionary measures will need to be taken and will be overseen by police.</seg>
<seg id="29">I would simply ask members of the public to co-operate with police.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is no immediate danger to anyone but all precautionary measures need to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="31">Earlier, State Crime Commander Scott Higgins said plans to dispose of the second package found yesterday were still being made.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We're still working through a few things at the moment, we're still clearing that area, navy divers are helping us out with that one, so we're still clearing the area and making plans of what to do at this stage," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Commander Higgins said with the first package, confirmed to be TATP, coming from the Leschenault jetty area and a second suspicious package found yesterday, divers had swept the jetty to make sure there were no items missed.</seg>
<seg id="34">He said it was possible the second package might be detonated in Australind, but that was still to be confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"We've got to look at all the safety issues, we've got to look at all of the environmental issues," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">"But once we've made a decision and get a plan in place we'll make sure everyone that needs to know has time ...we'll make sure that anyone's affected by what we do is safe," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Yesterday a counter-terrorism expert said the discovery of volatile explosives as world leaders met in Perth for the Indian Ocean Rim Association summit was a "nasty coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="38">Curtin University's Alexey Muraviev told PerthNow the discovery raised additional security concerns for the event, which would see Foreign Ministers from countries such as India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia and Sri Lanka meet in Perth today.</seg>
<seg id="39">Dr Muraviev said terrorists wanted symbolic targets and the IORA event could provide such an opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Many of them (member countries) are engaged in counter-terrorism efforts and many countries of the Indian Ocean Rim are affected by ongoing high levels of terrorism activity," he said.</seg>
<seg id="41">He said because Perth was not considered a high-risk terrorism target, there would have also been an added element of surprise in any attack plot.</seg>
<seg id="42">Police today said they were not ruling out any line of inquiry after the second suspicious package was found underwater at the Leschenault estuary in Australind this morning.</seg>
<seg id="43">Army bomb disposal experts were called in to help dispose of explosives after another suspicious package was found in the estuary where a large cache of the volatile chemical compound TATP was discovered on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="44">PerthNow understands the substance found in the water today was located at the end of the jetty, and heavily weighted.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was similar in size to the one found on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="46">It is understood specialist Navy divers and officers from the bomb squad will move the substance a short distance early tomorrow morning and then detonate it on land in a controlled explosion.</seg>
<seg id="47">Earlier this afternoon a forensics police officer spent 15 minutes photographing evidence on the side of Old Coast Road, about 50m from the jetty.</seg>
<seg id="48">It appeared to be a small piece of paper which was eventually bagged and taken away as evidence by the officer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Police say there are no "legitimate" reasons why someone would be in the possession of the highly dangerous chemical other than for criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="50">Following this morning's discovery of what could be more of the highly explosive material, State Crime A/Commander Scott Higgins told a press conference that while police were still trying to establish what it was intended for, the substance was used in terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="51">Earlier police confirmed the material destroyed at Gloucester Park yesterday was TATP, or 'Mother of Satan', the volatile chemical used in the 2005 London bombings.</seg>
<seg id="52">Acting Commander Higgins said police were not ruling out any line of inquiry and confirmed the Major Crime Squad was looking at a list of people but were not close to making an arrest.</seg>
<seg id="53">He also said TATP had previously been found in other locations in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="54">"There's a whole range of different possibilities (for why) from prank to the more sinister and those are the ones we are looking in to," he said.</seg>
<seg id="55">This is not an unknown material and it has been found in other locations on previous occasions.</seg>
<seg id="56">""There's no information to indicate there is cause of concern (regarding threats).</seg>
<seg id="57">One of the things we are trying to work out is exactly what it was intended for and we don't know that yet.</seg>
<seg id="58">And that is the reason we are asking for the public's help.</seg>
<seg id="59">Questioned by the Opposition in State Parliament about the risk to the public during the operation to move the original cache of TATP from the city to Gloucester Park, Mr Barnett said he would not disclose details of confidential briefings.</seg>
<seg id="60">``This is an extremely serious situation.</seg>
<seg id="61">But it is confidential and you are not to use it politically," Mr Barnett said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They absolutely think their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.</seg>
<seg id="8">They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="11">What was the cause of death?</seg>
<seg id="12">Was his death the result of a crime?</seg>
<seg id="13">Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will follow the facts wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="15">My objective is to discovery the truth.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists" for a formal investigation, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."</seg>
<seg id="18">A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.</seg>
<seg id="21">A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="22">A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The teenager's parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died.</seg>

<seg id="1">RCMP allege Senator Pamela Wallin committed fraud, breach of trust</seg>
<seg id="2">The RCMP are investigating Senator Pamela Wallin for allegations of fraud over $5,000 and breach of trust related to her expense claims, new court documents say.</seg>
<seg id="3">The documents, filed in an Ottawa court on Oct.</seg>
<seg id="4">28, allege that Ms. Wallin used "deceit, falsehood, or other fraudulent means" to defraud the Senate of more than $5,000.</seg>
<seg id="5">They also reveal that Senate staff cautioned Ms. Wallin repeatedly about her expenses during the past four years and well before an external audit of her claims was launched.</seg>
<seg id="6">The documents were filed by the RCMP's national division in Ottawa to support their ongoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="7">An external audit of Ms. Wallin's expense claims, released in August, found that the Saskatchewan senator had charged the Senate for a series of personal and business expenses that she was not entitled to claim.</seg>
<seg id="8">She repaid a total of about $152,000 in questionable expenses and interest for claims made over a four-year period beginning in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms. Wallin has said in the past that she may have made mistakes in filing some of her expenses but has also insisted she did not intentionally charge the Senate for unrelated expenses.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Senate's director of finance, Nicole Proulx, told RCMP investigators in September that she and the Clerk of the Senate, Gary O'Brien, warned Ms. Wallin about her claims on several occasions before the formal audit began, according to the documents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2009, Ms. Proulx and Mr. O'Brien told Ms. Wallin that any business she conducted in Toronto "had to comply with Senate policy," an RCMP account of the interview with Ms. Proulx says.</seg>
<seg id="12">The two administrators again raised concerns with Ms. Wallin about her expenses in January 2012, including a high percentage of travel claims that had been filed without a specific purpose listed, a high percentage of stopovers in Toronto for Senate business and the high cost of Ms. Wallin's car services, the court documents say.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms. Proulx told RCMP investigators that, on several occasions in 2010, claims for some of Ms. Wallin's car services were initially rejected by Senate finance officials.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the decisions were later reversed after Ms. Wallin brought the matter to a special Senate committee responsible for Senate finances, according to the RCMP records.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms. Wallin was appointed to the Red Chamber by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and began serving as a senator in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senators Mike Duffy and Patrick Brazeau, and former senator Mac Harb, are also under investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">None of the senators under investigation have been charged.</seg>

<seg id="1">Damková reportedly banned by UEFA from publishing punishments for referees.</seg>
<seg id="2">Dagmar Damková, chairperson of the referees’ committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), has stopped publishing punishments for referees.</seg>
<seg id="3">UEFA regulations ban her from doing so, which she revealed in an interview with the Právo newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="4">Otherwise the FACR could reportedly be penalised.</seg>
<seg id="5">Damková also denied that she is biased in her job towards footballers from Plzen, where she is from.</seg>
<seg id="6">These speculations are absolute nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is true that I live in Plzen, but other committee members are from elsewhere, for example Prague as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">So in the case of voting, I could lose 1-6," said Damková in response to criticism that arose after Plzen had twice as many penalties recently as other league teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although in the last few months FACR has stopped publishing punishments for referees, Damková offers assurance that referees do pay for their mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Trust me, if the committee finds out that an official has made a mistake, his assignments are cut down, whatever the game was," said Damková.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason why punishments are not published is, according to Damková, a ban from the European football union.</seg>
<seg id="12">"UEFA bans the publishing of this sort of information and violations are severely punished."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Here we are very suspicious and we look for something in every mistake."</seg>
<seg id="14">"We did publish restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we didn’t stop we would get heavy penalties," said Damková.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other countries respect the ban.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We were really the exception," she added.</seg>
<seg id="17">If she had continued to publish information, the committee could reportedly lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.</seg>
<seg id="18">"And that is very important for us."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Without that we could not carry out the referees training programme," added Damková.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cabbage bubbling in Kunovice, with no chemicals being added</seg>
<seg id="2">Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which is a part of the food processing group Hamé, wants to produce over one thousand tonnes of sauerkraut in the following months.</seg>
<seg id="3">The season began here in October and will last for around six months.</seg>
<seg id="4">They have been making healthy snacks here since 1925, still using the traditional method of treading directly in large tanks.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the modern industrial age it is a rarity.</seg>
<seg id="6">Our staff tread a route of almost ten kilometres per shift.</seg>
<seg id="7">In each of the ten tanks you can fit fifteen to thirty tonnes of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," says director of the Slovácká Fruta factory David Kladroba.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cabbage is brought to the  factory directly from the company's fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko regions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fruta staff then clean the vegetables, remove the stalks and throw them into the cutting machine.</seg>
<seg id="10">From there, the cut cabbage falls into six-metre deep pools, in which our treaders work tirelessly, dressed in white clothes and boots.</seg>
<seg id="11">This displaces the unwanted air.</seg>
<seg id="12">The last trodden layer of cabbage is covered with a tarpaulin and weighed down with water.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The cut cabbage is then matured for six to eight weeks undergoing spontaneous lactic fermentation with no added substances to support the fermentation," emphasises Kladroba.</seg>
<seg id="14">The natural process matches production process at home, with staff sprinkling salt and caraway seeds on the individual layers.</seg>
<seg id="15">After fermentation, the cabbage goes to the filling line.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is packaged in a sweet and sour pickling liquid in bags or jars and undergoes sterilisation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hamé group supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is also interest registered in several other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prince Harry asked royal aide for help with Sandhurst essay, phone hacking trial told</seg>
<seg id="2">The jury have heard that Goodman and Mulcaire were later convicted of phone hacking.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Mr Goodman, 56, is now facing separate charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office which he denies.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is claimed that the then editor Andy Coulson was also aware of what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Edis said the story was one of a number of articles cited by Mr Goodman as he tried to justify paying Mulcaire a weekly retainer.</seg>
<seg id="6">The jury heard that the Prince, who is now an Army officer, had to write an essay about the SAS siege of the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 as part of his studies.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Edis then showed them a transcript of the message in which Prince Harry said: "Just wondered if you, bizarre question, have you any information at all or you know where to get information from about the siege of the Iranian Embassy because I need to write an essay quite quickly on that."</seg>
<seg id="8">I just need some information.</seg>
<seg id="9">I have got most of the stuff but if you have got any extra information or websites that you know please, please, please email it to me.</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier the jury heard that Mr Goodman admitted that he was breaking the law when he asked Andy Coulson to approve a corrupt payment to a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="11">He emailed the tabloid's editor asking him to approve a £1,000 cash payment to the officer for a royal telephone directory.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he openly acknowledged that he and Mr Coulson would face "criminal charges" if the transaction was discovered, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="13">The jury heard that in an email to Mr Coulson in January 2003 Mr Goodman wrote: "Andy - one of our royal policemen (St James Palace) has obtained the brand new green book, the telephone directory with all the home numbers of the royal family and their household staff."</seg>
<seg id="14">""Incredibly useful and he'll be extremely handy in the [X] affair tale."</seg>
<seg id="15">The standard price is £1,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">""So far so good."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I had a heck of a time getting cash creds signed off by Stuart [Kuttner, the managing editor] earlier this week to pay a Kensington Palace copper for a page lead and an exec [executive] on another paper for a carvery item.</seg>
<seg id="18">""I think that we should have the book and the goodwill that goes with it but I am keen to avoid Round Two with the Man Ed [managing editor]."</seg>
<seg id="19">""I'm not criticising Stuart at all, but these people will not be paid in anything other than cash because if they're discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal charges, as could we."</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Edis said two versions of the email had been discovered, the second of which was missing the final two sentences.</seg>
<seg id="21">He told the jury: "Did Mr Coulson get the whole of that, or did he just get this bit?</seg>
<seg id="22">We would invite you to find that he got the whole of the e-mail, but even if he only got this bit, without its reference to criminal charges at the end, it's quite enough, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Coulson replied to Mr Goodman: "This is fine.</seg>
<seg id="24">Didn't I sign off on purchase of green book quite recently tho?</seg>
<seg id="25">About half an hour later, Mr Goodman wrote a further email to Mr Kuttner, which said: "Stuart - I've left a deliberately cryptic credit payment form in your in tray.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you have a second or two I'll explain the details.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Edis said the payment form had been discovered, and simply described the reason for the money being handed over as "royal research project."</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Coulson, 45, who later became David Cameron's director of communications, denies charges related to phone hacking and to alleged corrupt payments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Berisha's future depends on Brisbane's pull</seg>
<seg id="2">Roar striker Besart Berisha.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brisbane coach Mike Mulvey believes the close ties Besart Berisha has formed with the city of Brisbane could be one of the factors that keeps him in a Roar jersey beyond this campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Albanian is off contract at the end of the season and it's no surprise there has already been rumblings about his future, with Sydney FC one club mentioned as being interested in the services of the marksman.</seg>
<seg id="5">Berisha's high-quality and consistent goal-scoring for the Roar makes him a prized asset and there's also the chance of lucrative offers from overseas clubs, which may prove tempting if he wants to be closer to his family in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mulvey believes Berisha has ties with Brisbane that will be hard to break.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 28-year-old and his young family have made a home in the Queensland capital, where he has been adopted as a cult hero among Roar fans, many of whom will be out to watch Brisbane host the Heart on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is the kind of thing that will happen where people are coming off contract.</seg>
<seg id="9">We're in negotiations with Besart and his agent.</seg>
<seg id="10">He's a prized asset.</seg>
<seg id="11">"But he's Brisbane's prized asset," Mulvey said.</seg>
<seg id="12">He loves it here.</seg>
<seg id="13">Players love him here.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fans love him here.</seg>
<seg id="15">I expect him to be here.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mulvey said discussions with Berisha and his management were already underway and the club was ready for the inevitable conjecture over his future.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don't really want to deal in hypotheticals.</seg>
<seg id="18">What I do know is Besart feels loved here in Brisbane by the fans, the people and the players.</seg>
<seg id="19">"He's got some great relationships," Mulvey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">There's been some teams mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's fine.</seg>
<seg id="22">People covet quality players.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's a great credit to Brisbane Roar.</seg>
<seg id="24">We'll take it in our stride.</seg>
<seg id="25">Roar midfielder Matt McKay, who played in Scotland and China with limited success before returning back to Brisbane, said Berisha was a huge part of the club and the players would love to see him strike a new agreement.</seg>
<seg id="26">Bes is a phenomenal player.</seg>
<seg id="27">He has an exceptional record with us.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We definitely want him to stay," McKay said.</seg>
<seg id="29">He's loved in the changeroom.</seg>
<seg id="30">I feel if the right offer is made he'll be staying in Brisbane.</seg>
<seg id="31">After a flying start to the season, the Roar lost 1-0 to Melbourne Victory last week and host the other Melbourne side at Suncorp on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="32">Berisha (hamstring) will continue his absence while defender Shane Steffanuto will also miss out with a minor hamstring strain that could sideline him for a fortnight.</seg>
<seg id="33">Corey Brown will take his place in defence.</seg>

<seg id="2">Andrew Burton / Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="3">Tyreik Jackson protests outside Barney's flagship store, accusing the store of racial profiling, on October 30, 2013 in New York City.</seg>
<seg id="4">You've got to hand it to Al Sharpton for his way with words.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Shop and Frisk" is the phrase he coined for when black people are detained in stores for doing nothing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cases have recently been reported at Barneys, where a black college student named Trayvon Christian was cuffed after buying a $350 belt and at Macy's, where actor Rob Brown was arrested after buying his mother a $1,350 watch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Shop and Frisk is just one facet of something bigger, something that lends itself to "Black Middle Class Rage" a phenomenon black journalist Ellis Cose famously coined in the nineties.</seg>
<seg id="8">Black Middle Class Rage is the common reaction to a spectrum of experiences that confirm that racism is still a hindrance despite good socioeconomic standing.</seg>
<seg id="9">A black person hears someone saying blacks need to look on the bright side and thinks about the realtor who suddenly claimed not to have any apartments to show upon seeing that they were black.</seg>
<seg id="10">Or the black systems analyst in New York who wonders why cabs pass him by so much.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now, there can be a degree of distortion in these claims.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the wake of the Barneys and Macy's episodes, whites have pointed out that they experience plenty of suspicion and neglect from salespeople too.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be black is to be unable to know what it's like being white.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oprah Winfrey's claim that a Switzerland boutique refused to show her a handbag because it was too expensive appears to have been based on a misunderstanding, for example.</seg>
<seg id="15">There has also been some progress over time.</seg>
<seg id="16">For example, the cab problem is nothing like what it once was.</seg>
<seg id="17">I have been a black man living in New York for twelve years, and not once has a cab passed me by and stopped for someone white down the street, in any neighborhood at any time of day.</seg>
<seg id="18">I suspect that some black men miss that no white person has every single cab stop when they put their hand in the air either.</seg>
<seg id="19">We give in to racism to get melodramatic about it.</seg>
<seg id="20">That said, cases like the ones at Barneys and Macy's aren't about melodrama.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both Trayvon Christian and Rob Brown were stopped after they had already made their purchases because store clerks assumed that there was no way that they could really afford the merchandise and therefore the debit and credit cards used to buy the items must not be theirs.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is naked prejudice leading to outright injustice.</seg>
<seg id="23">As long as black people have experiences like this more than other people, no one has any reason to wonder why in polls black people regularly report racism as more of a problem in America than other groups.</seg>
<seg id="24">That sentiment is, quite simply, about the cops: getting pulled over disproportionately on drug checks, Shop and Frisk episodes, and, yes, getting killed by self-appointed neighborhood patrolmen.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is why what happened to Trayvon Martin was so significant in the black community, and why a few nights ago, when Police Commissioner Ray Kelly who supports New York's out-of-control stop-and-frisk policies, was supposed to make a speech at Brown University, students created a vocal melee and refused to even let him speak.</seg>
<seg id="26">That incident was a tad melodramatic - but hardly based on nothing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now, some say blacks have to get used to special attention from the cops until blacks don't commit crimes disproportionately.</seg>
<seg id="28">But when it comes to Shop and Frisk, the only way that defense will work is if Barneys and Macy's can show us that most of the people they catch actually shoplifting are black.</seg>
<seg id="29">State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has demanded that both stores turn over information about their surveillance policies.</seg>
<seg id="30">This should include proof that there is a concrete reason to concentrate on black people in preventing shoplifting.</seg>
<seg id="31">Short of that, we must assume that the policy at these stores is to look askance at any black person buying something fancy, out of a sense that pretty much all black people in 2013 are poor.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is at best antiquated, and at worst, yes, racist.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fannie Mae sues banks for $800m over Libor</seg>
<seg id="2">31 October 2013 Last updated at 20:06</seg>
<seg id="3">US mortgage giant Fannie Mae is suing nine banks including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) over losses relating to the Libor scandal.</seg>
<seg id="4">The mortgage financer is seeking more than $800m (£499m) in damages.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Fannie Mae filed this action to recover losses it suffered as a result of the defendants' manipulation of Libor," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several banks have already admitted wrongdoing over the scandal, and have settled with regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Libor refers to the London interbank offered rate, which is an interest rate used by many banks, mortgage lenders, and others to set the price of borrowing on trillions of dollars of financial contracts.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several banks have indicated that they colluded to set the rate artificially low, which could have deprived lenders like Fannie Mae of higher profits.</seg>
<seg id="9">The nine banks being sued by Fannie Mae are Barclays, RBS, Rabobank, UBS, Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan Chase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of those, Barclays , RBS, Rabobank and UBS have previously settled with regulators over similar allegations.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sri Lankan authorities have freed Australian media organisers Jacqui Park and Jane Worthington after detaining and interrogating them for two days over alleged visa violations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sri Lanka, which has a poor record of media freedoms, is particularly sensitive to foreign media presence in the country now, with its human rights record under scrutiny ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, to be held in Colombo in a fortnight.</seg>
<seg id="6">Any journalist coming to Sri Lanka has to obtain accreditation and these two had not done that</seg>
<seg id="7">On Tuesday, 10 immigration and defence officials raided a meeting of the Free Media Movement at a Colombo hotel.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sri Lankan Media Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said the Australian women were engaged in "anti-government activism."</seg>
<seg id="9">Photo: www.media.gov.lk</seg>
<seg id="10">Ms Park, the Asia-Pacific Director of the International Federation of Journalists, and Ms Worthington, the Deputy Director, were at the meeting, but were in the country on tourist visas.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sri Lanka's authorities say the pair was running a workshop for journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Free Media Movement says they were invited to the meeting when it was learned they was in the country, and says attending workshops is not prohibited on a tourist visa.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Park and Ms Worthington flew out of Sri Lanka late Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms Park was questioned for more than 15 hours by defence, immigration and central investigation bureau personnel, during which authorities downloaded files from her computer.</seg>
<seg id="15">She had a lawyer present for parts of her interrogation, and an official from the Australian High Commission for some time also.</seg>
<seg id="16">She was not maltreated.</seg>
<seg id="17">Media Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said the pair had been engaged in "anti-government activism."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Any journalist coming to Sri Lanka has to obtain accreditation and these two had not done that," Mr. Rambukwella said.""</seg>
<seg id="19">"""There are clear guidelines and those have not been followed so our authorities have the right to take action."</seg>
<seg id="20">Sri Lanka is rated as one of the worst countries in the world for media freedom.</seg>
<seg id="21">Reporters Without Borders ranks it 162nd of 179 countries on its "Media Freedom Index."</seg>
<seg id="22">Foreign journalists are often blacklisted, and refused visas, sometimes for years.</seg>
<seg id="23">Local journalists who are critical of the government are regularly kidnapped, tortured and killed.</seg>
<seg id="24">News organisations seen to be in opposition to the Rajapakse family-led government are regularly raided by masked gunmen - believed to be paramilitaries working for the government - and have their computers smashed or presses firebombed.</seg>
<seg id="25">In 2009, high-profile editor of The Sunday Leader Lasantha Wickrametunge was shot dead as he drove to work.</seg>
<seg id="26">In an editorial he wrote before he died, and published a few days after his murder, he said he would be targeted because of his criticisms of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="27">When finally I am killed, it will be the government that kills me.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sri Lanka is acutely sensitive to foreign media presence in the country now, as the capital prepares to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in a fortnight.</seg>
<seg id="29">Already, the decision to allow Sri Lanka to host, as its human rights record continues to attract international attention, is proving controversial.</seg>
<seg id="30">Several countries, and the UN, have been critical of the Sri Lankan government's conduct at the end of its 30-year civil war with the separatist terrorist group, the Tamil Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="31">The UN says up to 40,000 civilians were killed by government troops in the war's final weeks.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since the Tigers were defeated, allegations of continued persecution of Sri Lanka's Tamil minority continues to blight its international standing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Canada will boycott CHOGM, and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the leader of the largest democracy in the Commonwealth, is under intense domestic pressure from Tamil party coalition partners to refuse to attend, too.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sri Lanka's human rights record has been criticised in the British House of Common's, by the US State Department, and by Australia at the UN, which told Sri Lanka it needed to "take action to reduce and eliminate all cases of abuse, torture or mistreatment by police and security forces" and "take action to reduce and eliminate all cases of abductions and disappearances."</seg>

<seg id="1">Forget about the neck stiffness that almost postponed Derrick Rose's homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget about all those missed shots, too.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rose made the only play that mattered Thursday night, and it was just like old times for the Chicago Bulls.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rose connected on a baseline floater with 5.7 seconds left to lift Chicago to an 82-81 victory over the New York Knicks in his first home game since he injured his left knee 18 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">"That's what builds your resume," Rose said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Leaves a mark on your legacy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 2011 NBA MVP had 18 points on 7-of-23 shooting and committed four turnovers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rose, who was a game-time decision for Chicago's home opener due to an achy neck, got the ball on the wing, drove to the baseline and lofted a well-placed floater over the 7-foot Chandler and Raymond Felton for the go-ahead basket, drawing a standing ovation from the delirious crowd of 22,022.</seg>
<seg id="9">I was right there.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He just made a big-time play," Chandler said.</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't know if he saw the basket to be honest with you.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anthony then stood with his hands on his hips as the Bulls celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I got the look I wanted," Anthony said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chicago had just two field goals in the final period - both by Rose - and committed six turnovers in the last 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="15">But it still managed to equal a franchise record with its sixth consecutive win in home openers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Luol Deng had 17 points and Carlos Boozer finished with 14 as the Bulls beat the Knicks for the sixth straight time.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's tough when you go into a game and you don't know who you have," coach Tom Thibodeau said.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's all part of it.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="20">As long as we are putting everything into each and every day and strive for improvement, it will work out.</seg>
<seg id="21">New York coach Mike Woodson opted for a bigger look against Chicago, inserting 7-foot Andrea Bargnani into the starting lineup and using guard Pablo Prigioni as a reserve.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the Bulls still enjoyed a 46-24 advantage in points in the paint and a 48-42 rebounding edge, led by Joakim Noah's 15 boards.</seg>
<seg id="23">We competed tonight.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It says a lot for our club," Woodson said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now I just need to do a better job getting us through down the stretch.</seg>
<seg id="26">Amar'e Stoudemire made his season debut for the Knicks and had five points in 11 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The power forward, who turns 31 on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="28">16, is coming off minor knee surgery over the summer and looked as if the years of health problems had robbed him of much of his athleticism.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Very pleased with how I felt tonight, as far as my body," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Just going to continue to keep building and keep getting better.</seg>
<seg id="31">New York trailed 76-66 with 7:53 remaining, but rookie Tim Hardaway Jr. made a 3-pointer to spark a 12-0 run for the Knicks.</seg>
<seg id="32">Felton connected from long range, Iman Shumpert had a dunk and Anthony closed out the spurt with a turnaround jumper that put New York in front with 4:10 remaining.</seg>
<seg id="33">The last part of the game mostly consisted of turnovers and missed shots, but Chicago managed to survive behind Rose.</seg>
<seg id="34">"He showed a lot of toughness," Thibodeau said.</seg>
<seg id="35">It was a struggle early on in the game.</seg>
<seg id="36">He found his way at the start of the third, that got him a little lift.</seg>

<seg id="1">An Obama voter's cry of despair</seg>
<seg id="2">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
<seg id="3">He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism</seg>
<seg id="4">Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.</seg>
<seg id="11">The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.</seg>
<seg id="18">Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was simply nothing I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of "don't ask don't tell," to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.</seg>
<seg id="22">But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.</seg>
<seg id="23">I've reached a point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="27">It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is what troubles me most of all.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.</seg>
<seg id="40">At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We've got to remember who we are.'</seg>
<seg id="43">It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.</seg>
<seg id="44">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

<seg id="1">Review: 'Last Love,' with Michael Caine, lacks any spark</seg>
<seg id="2">A scene from "Last Love."</seg>
<seg id="3">By Inkoo Kang</seg>
<seg id="4">October 31, 2013, 8:30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Last Love" is a game between writer-director Sandra Nettelbeck and the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="6">The implied May-December romance between Matthew (Michael Caine), a hedonic retired professor, and Pauline (Clémence Poésy), a doe-eyed cha-cha teacher, is a treacly premise - and Nettelbeck knows it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, she endeavors to subvert audience expectations while delivering the emotional goods augured by the title.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nettelbeck clinches the former but stumbles with the latter.</seg>
<seg id="9">The late-life drama unfolds methodically, with Matthew first meeting Pauline at a Parisian sandwich shop.</seg>
<seg id="10">He lives alone in a colossal but dark apartment, ironically keeping sane by talking to his dead wife.</seg>
<seg id="11">When he befriends Pauline, who is less a character than female attention incarnate, he finally wonders whether there might be more to widower-hood than stamp collecting.</seg>
<seg id="12">Halfway through the film, Nettelbeck pulls off her first narrative trick by landing Matthew in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">That plot development transfigures the movie from a would-be romance to a family drama as Matthew's adult children, Miles (Justin Kirk) and Karen (Gillian Anderson), rush to his bedside.</seg>
<seg id="14">Well, Miles dutifully does, but Karen breezes past them to the hospital window for a smoke.</seg>
<seg id="15">When the buoyantly callous Karen exits the picture, a crushing gravity takes over, with Miles accusing Pauline of trying to shoehorn her way into his father's will.</seg>
<seg id="16">This somber work about the worthiness of living has little life in it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Last Love.</seg>
<seg id="18">No MPAA rating.</seg>
<seg id="19">Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Playing: At AMC Burbank Town Center 8.</seg>
<seg id="21">Also available on VOD.</seg>

<seg id="1">Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.</seg>
<seg id="2">The reasons cited were corruption, squandering of money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, increased taxes and, last but not least, government scandals.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the election results, it can be concluded that this situation suited the majority of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is, they did not actually mind it and they were actually happy with the situation here (the misappropriation and increasing debt of this state).</seg>
<seg id="5">I cannot otherwise explain that 3 413 497 voters failed to vote, 596 357 voters voted for TOP 09, 384 174 voters voted for ODS – therefore a total of 4 394 028 voters actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all legitimate voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Which is an absolute majority.</seg>
<seg id="7">If I add 1 016 829 ČSSD voters to the above parties, then with the old order (because all the parties mentioned took part in the "misappropriation" and increasing debt of this state), then 64.23% of legitimate voters actually approved of this situation.</seg>
<seg id="8">This way the majority of voters demonstrated that they do not support punishing the guilty for the misappropriation and over-indebtedness of the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">Or do you perhaps think that ČSSD members, who took part in it, will deliver the appropriate laws?</seg>
<seg id="10">Can we be helped at all?</seg>

<seg id="1">Hot, dry October keeps NSW on fire alert</seg>
<seg id="2">Some locations around the Blue Mountains saw their lowest October rainfall in more than 120 years of records, says senior meteoroligst Ben Domensino.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Max Mason Hubers</seg>
<seg id="4">Sydney and most of the rest of NSW posted among their hottest and driest Octobers on record, adding to concerns that the early-season bushfire threat will remain high for coming weeks or longer.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Harbour City's average maximum of 25.7 degrees was 3.6 degrees above the norm for October, placing it only behind a scorcher in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rainfall tallies were boosted by a downpour earlier this week, raising the city's count to 42.2 millimetres, or about half the long-term average for October.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dry October for NSW</seg>
<seg id="8">Conditions were more extreme over some of the fire-hit regions to Sydney's west, with Springwood - where many houses were destroyed by fires in October - recording just 5 per cent of its normal rain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Katoomba, in the Blue Mountains, had its warmest October in terms of average maximums in at least 46 years, while its tally of just 6 millimetres of rain for the month was the town's driest on record, Weatherzone said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Almost all of the state recorded below-average rainfall and above-average daytime temperatures during October, which resulted in elevated fire danger," said Ben Domensino, a senior meteorologist with Weatherzone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Record 12-month heat</seg>
<seg id="12">The bushfires around the Blue Mountains during the middle of the month occurred in a region where some locations saw their lowest October rainfall in more than 120 years of records.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williamtown recorded an average maximum of 27.1 degrees, making it the warmest October since 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grafton collected just 9 millimetres of rain, 70 millimetres below the average, the town's driest October on records going back to 1966, Mr Domensino said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The dry conditions come as temperatures are forecast to climb again over the weekend, with Sydney expecting a top of 28 degrees on Saturday and 34 on Sunday ahead of another gusty change.</seg>
<seg id="16">Penrith should see the mercury reach 34 on both days.</seg>
<seg id="17">A spokesman for the RFS said parts of NSW are likely to face "severe" fire danger ratings on Sunday, such as the north west, Hunter and Sydney regions.</seg>
<seg id="18">As of Friday, about 500 firefighters were still in the field, battling more than 50 fires across the state, 20 of them uncontained.</seg>
<seg id="19">No relief</seg>
<seg id="20">Nationwide, Australia recorded its third-hottest October based on mean temperatures, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.</seg>
<seg id="21">For the third month in a row, Australia broke its 12-month mean temperature record.</seg>
<seg id="22">The year to October's end saw mean temperatures 1.3 degrees above the 1961-90 average, beating the anomaly set in the two previous months of 1.25 degrees and 1.11 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="23">Remarkably, mean temperatures were running 0.22 degrees warmer than any 12- month period prior to 2013, the bureau said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Aaron Coutts-Smith, head of climate monitoring for NSW at the bureau, said about 42 per cent of NSW recorded October rainfall in the lowest 10 per cent of records for the month.</seg>
<seg id="25">The rainfall, when it came, also tended to fall in shorter, sharper bursts that resulted in faster run-off and less soaking.</seg>
<seg id="26">Soil moisture levels are at "record low levels" for much of the state, Dr Coutts-Smith said.</seg>
<seg id="27">A sub-tropical ridge, which would normally be directing more moisture into southern parts of Australia by this time of year, remains further north than usual.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, NSW has been exposed to warm westerly winds that have tended to increase drying and worsen the threat from fires, he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We haven't seen anything that would relieve that risk," Dr Coutts-Smith said.</seg>
<seg id="30">The near-term outlook is for generally dry conditions for the Sydney area for at least the next week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Longer-term, relief is likely to come with the northern monsoon but the timing of its arrival is uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It's not likely to be an early monsoon," Dr Coutts-Smith said, adding that whether or not it will be delayed remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="33">Last year's delay in the monsoon's arrival contributed to January and the summer as a whole being Australia's hottest on record.</seg>
<seg id="34">The abnormal heat has continued, with 2013 well on course to be the hottest in more than a century of records, needing below-average warmth to fall short of setting a new high for a calendar year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Costs of staying the EU outweigh the benefits, warn business leaders as they overwhelmingly back plans for referendum</seg>
<seg id="2">By Tim Shipman</seg>
<seg id="3">The results undermine the conventional wisdom in Westminster that the business community would campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if a vote were held in 2017, as David Cameron has promised</seg>
<seg id="4">Business leaders believe the costs of being in the EU outweigh the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="5">A poll of more than 1,000 bosses, from companies of all sizes and sectors, found overwhelming backing for plans for an in-out referendum on Britain's place in Europe, with 66 per cent in favour.</seg>
<seg id="6">The results dramatically undermine the conventional wisdom in Westminster that the business community would automatically campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if a vote were held in 2017, as David Cameron has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">The YouGov survey, commissioned by the Eurosceptic group Business for Britain, found that 46 per cent of business leaders believe the costs of complying with Single Market red tape outweigh the benefits of being in the EU, compared with 37 per cent who disagree.</seg>
<seg id="8">Seventeen per cent were undecided.</seg>
<seg id="9">A total of 56 per cent feel that "meaningful change" of the UK's relationship with Brussels requires treaty change and a relationship based simply on trade against 23 per cent who don't.</seg>
<seg id="10">The poll found that business leaders would like the Government to repatriate powers in nine separate areas, a more far-reaching renegotiation than even David Cameron has suggested.</seg>
<seg id="11">They want the UK not Brussels to control employment law, environmental regulation and health and safety legislation.</seg>
<seg id="12">They also want national control of monopolies and competition regulation, company taxation and VAT, consumer rights and data protection and consumer rights, product and services regulation, waste regulation and weights and measures.</seg>
<seg id="13">The poll found that business leaders would like the Government to repatriate powers in nine separate areas, a more far-reaching renegotiation than even David Cameron has suggesteD</seg>
<seg id="14">The poll finds that British business is increasingly looking beyond Europe for new trade and would like the Government to do so too.</seg>
<seg id="15">By 58 per cent to 21 per cent British business leaders want to see the Government focus on the emerging economic powers like Brazil, China and India rather than the EU for future trading links.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Confederation of British Industry, the UK's leading business group, is expected to argue the benefits of the EU at its conference next week.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the poll found that even among members of the CBI, 49 per cent to 44 per cent believe that the disadvantages of the Single Market now outweigh the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="18">Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: "It will come as a surprise to many that a nationwide and representative poll of business leaders finds a clear majority support EU treaty change and a return to a trading relationship."</seg>
<seg id="19">The reason is clear - most business leaders think the costs of the Single Market outweigh its benefits.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now that business has spoken, the pressure is on the Government to get a better deal from Brussels and make life easier for Britain's job creators.</seg>
<seg id="21">Alan Halsall, co-chairman of Business for Britain and chairman of Silver Cross Prams, said: "Business has, until now, been poorly represented in the debate on Britain's EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="22">My own experience is one of overregulation combined with protectionism, even within the Single Market, and we have therefore focussed on trading with the fast-growing markets in the Pacific region.</seg>
<seg id="23">I often wonder why there aren't more business people calling on the Government to make fundamental changes to our EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="24">This poll demonstrates that I and hundreds of thousands of other UK business people are not alone in wanting to see a much better deal from Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ed Davey: Only 'smart phone generation' able to get good deals on energy</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr Davey is preparing to unveil plans for annual review of competition and standards in energy sector carried out by regulators</seg>
<seg id="3">Energy companies will be forced to "open up their books" to justify their profits and prices under plans to be set out by ministers on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He will announce plans for an annual review of competition and standards in the energy sector, to be carried out by industry regulators.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some ministers want the review to consider breaking up the big companies, but doing so is said to be highly complex under existing competition laws.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Davey said that his announcement would include measures to increase competition and transparency in the energy market.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's not just the review we're announcing today," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We're announcing efforts to make sure that switching is easier and quicker, as well as extra transparency for the "big six" so they have to justify profits and prices."</seg>
<seg id="9">Competition is actually beginning to show results; we've been very active to pushing competition to make bills simpler, tariffs less confusing so people can really exercise choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">And so the annual assessment will look at what we've done but also suggest ideas for how we can go further, because we're not complacent - we want to make sure markets are working for consumers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fancy a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?</seg>
<seg id="2">A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.</seg>
<seg id="4">He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">So each scoop costs me around £140.</seg>
<seg id="13">It tastes pretty good though.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists</seg>

<seg id="1">Breeders' Cup 2013: Odds are, Joel Rosario will win a race</seg>
<seg id="2">Joel Rosario fits on the back of a racehorse as perfectly as a carrot fits in a snowman's face.</seg>
<seg id="3">He is Nicklaus with a five-iron in his hand, Crenshaw with a putter.</seg>
<seg id="4">If this were hockey, he'd be the Great One.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is fast becoming that in horse racing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rosario will ride 12 horses in this weekend's Breeders' Cup, and even though none of them were given morning-line odds of better than 6-1, gamblers are likely to give his horses more action than their odds may deserve.</seg>
<seg id="7">That's because Rosario will be in the saddle.</seg>
<seg id="8">Horsemen are generous with their praise for the 28-year-old Dominican, who is one of 13 children and the only jockey of international stature from his country.</seg>
<seg id="9">Veteran trainer Barclay Tagg told the Louisville Courier-Journal, "He's as good a jockey as I've seen for coming through the field, making the right move."</seg>
<seg id="10">Shug McGaughey, the trainer for whom Rosario won the Kentucky Derby this year aboard Orb, says, "The biggest thing is, he is patient with the horse."</seg>
<seg id="11">He has something left for the end.</seg>
<seg id="12">Jockey Mike Smith, who has 13 Breeders' Cup rides himself and who rode for several years against Rosario in the Southern California jockey colony until Rosario went east a year ago, says, "He has great rhythm."</seg>
<seg id="13">He is very good at staying clear, and sometimes that's the hardest thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rosario's biggest booster has a financial stake in being so.</seg>
<seg id="15">But agent Ron Anderson also has the credentials to be credible, having spent more than four decades in the sport and, to date, had his riders win 26 Breeders' Cup and 13 Triple Crown races.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Joel is an amazing kid," Anderson says.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's not a prima donna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's appreciative about everything he has.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you listen to most athletes, they talk mainly about themselves.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not Joel.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you praise him for a ride, he will tell you how good his filly was that day.</seg>
<seg id="22">Anderson has carried the book for the likes of Jerry Bailey, Gary Stevens and Garrett Gomez and says the great jockeys have that intangible.</seg>
<seg id="23">"To begin with, they are all athletes," Anderson says.</seg>
<seg id="24">Then, they all have a sixth sense.</seg>
<seg id="25">Joel has that.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rosario's pre-Breeders' Cup story, however, is less about greatness and more about uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">He suffered an injury in late August that makes his presence on 12 horses in the 14 Breeders' Cup races somewhat surprising.</seg>
<seg id="28">And then, in the third race at Santa Anita on Thursday, he was unseated in the backstretch, when Square Dancer clipped heels and went down.</seg>
<seg id="29">Rosario stayed down awhile, then rose and walked to the ambulance and eventually was cleared to ride again in the fifth race, which he won.</seg>
<seg id="30">But his major injury was Aug.</seg>
<seg id="31">23 at Saratoga.</seg>
<seg id="32">He was riding a filly named Casual Elegance in the seventh race.</seg>
<seg id="33">He had a big weekend ahead, with rides scheduled on Orb in the Travers at Saratoga on Saturday and Game On Dude in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was to be a weekend of lots of travel and, most likely, lots of financial reward.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the time, he was already leading the country's jockey standings with 237 wins and nearly $17 million in purses.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then, shortly after crossing the finish line well out of the money after a troubled race, Casual Elegance stumbled and threw Rosario, who landed hard on his left foot.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I was worried right away," Rosario says.</seg>
<seg id="38">It felt bad, and then I couldn't get up.</seg>
<seg id="39">Anderson didn't see it happen.</seg>
<seg id="40">He was near the racing office at Saratoga.</seg>
<seg id="41">"A friend of mine called," Anderson says, "and said my jockey was down and he wasn't getting up."</seg>
<seg id="42">The next morning, Anderson and Rosario went to Albany, where Rosario was seen by Dr. Richard Alfred, a friend of Anderson's and a former training camp physician for the New York Giants.</seg>
<seg id="43">"I figured," Anderson says, "that these athletes, they wrap some tape on the ankle and go out and play."</seg>
<seg id="44">But when they took the ACE bandage off and I saw the swelling, I knew it was bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Investors urged to spurn Paladin share placement</seg>
<seg id="2">Chairman of Paladin Rick Crabb.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Erin Jonasson</seg>
<seg id="4">Paladin Energy shareholders have been urged to reject a controversial share placement that has drastically diluted the value of shares n the uranium miner over the past 11 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite the $88 million placement taking effect in early August, shareholders will be asked to approve it retrospectively at Paladin's annual meeting on November 21.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shareholder approval would allow Paladin to make further share placements later this year, but rejection would prohibit any more raisings, and duly close off one of the company's swiftest methods of raising cash.</seg>
<seg id="7">Proxy adviser ISS has recommended that shareholders vote against the placement on the grounds that most of them were denied the opportunity to participate, with the placement sold mostly to large institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Paladin shares were fetching $1 prior to the placement being announced in early August.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stock immediately slipped to 72¢.</seg>
<seg id="10">The stock has since slipped further, and was trading at 40¢ on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="11">ISS head of research Dr Ulysses Chioatto said shareholders should not ratify the controversial placement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The placement was very dilutive to existing shareholders and, more importantly, they never got a chance to participate, so that was quite discriminatory and definitely not good governance practice," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's really holding the current shareholders with some significant disdain by not allowing them to be involved.</seg>
<seg id="14">While a negative vote will not overturn the placement, he said it could still prove uncomfortable for Paladin executives.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is going to be quite problematic if Paladin does not receive shareholder approval," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a range of different actions that are open to shareholders if they don't approve this placement retrospectively, so there is no clear answer as to what could be done next.</seg>
<seg id="17">Paladin chairman Rick Crabb said he was "surprised" by the recommendation, and said ISS had failed to appreciate the difficult context in which the share placement was made.</seg>
<seg id="18">Paladin is listed in both Australia and Canada, and Mr Crabb said a broader rights issue in a time of falling uranium prices would have been lengthy and complicated, and might have created uncertainty about the company's ability to raise money.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We could have had a downward spiral in price, so it was a properly considered risk-management strategy we followed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other proxy advisers such as CGI Glass Lewis and Ownership Matters are expected to publish their reports on Paladin next week.</seg>

<seg id="3">Chen Maoguo was dubbed the "bird man" for his tree-top sit-in last year in the Chongqing region, staged to protest what he considered inadequate compensation for the razing of his home, the Yunnan Information News said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip</seg>
<seg id="2">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive special adviser," Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say," Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.</seg>
<seg id="9">What about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">Does he know about phone hacking?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says he doesn't, we say "Oh yes, he did".</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projects."</seg>
<seg id="15">During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett.</seg>
<seg id="19">The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Many things have moved, and everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="2">For instance, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, whereas chairman Štěch stirred up discord.</seg>
<seg id="3">I was suspicious of Governor Chovanec as soon as they elected him to the presidency, and that was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chairman Sobotka always was and continues to be a symbol of the misery of ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="5">The other gentlemen have mainly shown their weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="6">Senator Dienstbier is consistent and readable and unusable, Vice-Chairman Zaorálek embarrassed himself most in a television interview.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the basis of this, I see no better option than for ČSSD to nominate as the Premier the Vice-Chairperson of the Senate Gajdůšková; she is the only one without a starting handicap and I think she would deliver a standard performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is such a good solution that hardly anyone in leadership will support it.</seg>
<seg id="9">I should add that this solution is the only option to forget what happened and continue without tearing the party apart.</seg>
<seg id="10">Alena Gajdůšková could easily form a minority government with only a blessing from Chairman Babiš and without the Christian Democrats, but with Christian Democrat Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a faithful Social Democrat.</seg>
<seg id="11">This mini-minority government would have a great stability because it would promote the proper law for a referendum and Chairman of Dawn, Okamura, is also committed to support this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chairman Babiš was eventually reconciled with taxation progression, since he is clever and will see that it is impossible without it.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Christian Democrats would not present problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have and they would not otherwise be in the government.</seg>
<seg id="14">The same applies to ANO, even here a valuable minister could be found, but when they sensibly do not want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, that is also good.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let’s encourage Alena Gajdůšková!</seg>

<seg id="2">General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury," according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.</seg>
<seg id="7">GM's truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="8">GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October.</seg>
<seg id="9">NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="11">In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Review: 'Ender's Game' captures the now in its futuristic tale</seg>
<seg id="2">Orson Scott Card's science fiction novel "Ender's Game" has been a touchstone for adolescent readers for nearly 30 years, and watching this earnest, respectful film version it's easy to understand why.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's not just that the story of the rise of underappreciated misfit Andrew "Ender" Wiggin to a position of power and respect in the adult world is every bullied youngster's dream.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's the added notion that although those wretched adults need you, that won't stop them from being two-faced, devious and deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whoever said it was easy being young?</seg>
<seg id="6">Written and directed by Gavin Hood and starring Harrison Ford and young Asa Butterfield, "Ender's Game" gains a lot from the ability of its story to touch a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="7">A film for young people to which adults can eavesdrop if they are so inclined, it's not any more sophisticated than it needs to be.</seg>
<seg id="8">But its strong special effects make its simulated battles effective and, echoing the book, its story line touches on a number of intriguing issues.</seg>
<seg id="9">PHOTOS: Fall movie sneaks 2013</seg>
<seg id="10">Those battles are simulated because the animating notion of "Ender's Game" is that sometime in the future children who think outside the box can be trained via computer simulations to take the lead in Earth's coming battle to the death with a race of insects from another planet called Formics.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ender's Game" opens 50 years after the last Formic invasion, when the invading insects (known as "buggers" in the book but thankfully not on screen) were barely stopped from taking over Earth.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those in power on the planet, including Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley with Maori tattoos on his face), have placed their hopes on youth in general and on Ender Wiggin in particular.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the hero of the novel ages from 6 to 12, the filmmakers have compressed the book's narrative into one year and convincingly cast 16-year-old Butterfield, last seen as the title character in Martin Scorsese's "Hugo," as a roughly 12-year-old Ender.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the age difference, the intense, skinny actor is believable as the young misfit.</seg>
<seg id="15">Butterfield looks appropriately young and has the ability to convey Ender's awkward nerdiness and ability to empathize with the enemy as well as the Bad Seed moments when his strategically employed but genuine fury gets the best of him.</seg>
<seg id="16">PHOTOS: Hollywood backlot moments</seg>
<seg id="17">The third member of his family to be chosen for warfare preparations, after his always-angry brother Peter (a role much reduced in importance from the book) and his empathetic sister Valentine ("Little Miss Sunshine's" Abigail Breslin), Ender often feels like the runt of the litter.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has a powerful ally, however, in Col. Hyrum Graff, the commander of Battle School, an orbiting space station where serious warrior training takes place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Played by Harrison Ford in the gruff taskmaster mode that feels a bit left over from "42's" Branch Rickey, the Colonel believes Ender is the hoped-for leader and overrides the doubts of his sensitive colleague, Maj. Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis).</seg>
<seg id="20">Convinced that all Ender needs is to be toughened up, the Colonel places him in increasingly difficult situations and monitors the results.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ender, who has no idea any of this is going on, gets sent to Battle School as a "Launchie" or first-year cadet at the Colonel's insistence.</seg>
<seg id="22">A bullying superior named Bonzo Madrid (Moises Arias) makes his life miserable, but Ender also gains the friendship of Petra Arkanian ("True Grit's" Hailee Steinfeld).</seg>
<seg id="23">PHOTOS: Scene from 'Ender's Game,' and director Gavin Hood on battle scenes</seg>
<seg id="24">Much of this is as pro forma as it sounds, but the film adds an interesting wrinkle when it introduces an unnerving video game Ender plays that incorporates elements of his own psyche into the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="25">An eventual meeting with Rackham, the hero of the previous Formic war, leads to the twists that have made the book's reputation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Writer-director Hood, whose films range from the Oscar-winning "Tsotsi" in his native South Africa to the blockbuster "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," tends to make movies that, like this one, do without nuanced emotions.</seg>
<seg id="27">But "Ender's Game" has a few ways to counterbalance that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Unusual in that it is co-produced by major effects house Digital Domain, "Ender's Game" is invariably worth looking at.</seg>
<seg id="29">Production designed by Sean Haworth and Ben Proctor, the film does well at depicting the action in the zero-gravity Battle Room as well as the grander computer warfare simulations that Ender orchestrates (very much like a conductor would lead a symphony) as his training progresses.</seg>
<seg id="30">It also helps that Card's 1985 novel was prescient about issues that still trouble us.</seg>
<seg id="31">Not only are video games considerably more sophisticated today, making the story's key premise that much more plausible, but issues of drone warfare, preemptive strikes and the morality of child soldiers are on society's mind more than ever.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Ender's Game" turns out to be our game as well.</seg>
<seg id="33">'Ender's Game'</seg>
<seg id="34">MPAA rating: PG-13 for some violence, science-fiction action and thematic material</seg>
<seg id="35">Running time: 1 hour, 54 minutes</seg>

<seg id="1">Wild talent steals the scene in Sister</seg>
<seg id="2">Trailer: Sister</seg>
<seg id="3">A drama set at a Swiss ski resort and centered on a boy who supports his older sister by stealing from wealthy guests.</seg>
<seg id="4">PT2M23Shttp://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-2w3w3620349October 24, 2013</seg>
<seg id="5">Ursula Meier is explaining the concept of "un casting sauvage."</seg>
<seg id="6">Sauvage means, as you might imagine, savage, although it probably more usually translates as "wild."</seg>
<seg id="7">Anyway, wild casting sounds just as crazy.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It means you go to a place where there are a lot of children and look for a face and when you like a face, you find the parents and tell them you want to make a casting," she says in her bechamel-thick French accent.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is how she met Kacey Mottet Klein, who played Isabelle Huppert's son in Meier's first feature film, Home.</seg>
<seg id="10">They worked for months before that first shoot, she recalls, not on the character but on the idea of slipping into another world and becoming someone else.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Usually, when the director casts a child it is because the child looks like the character; they are just stealing something from that child," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">And I really don't want that.</seg>
<seg id="13">I really want that he understands what it means, acting, to understand the character.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that intense experience - "you stand at the beginning with him, in a way" - she wrote her new film, Sister specifically for him.</seg>
<seg id="15">Candid camera: Kacey Mottet plays a boy who has virtually brought himself up in Sister.</seg>
<seg id="16">That phrase, savage casting, probably resonates so strongly with me because here Kacey plays a boy who has virtually brought himself up; he is like a wolf-child of the housing projects.</seg>
<seg id="17">Simon, aged 12, lives with his feckless elder sister, Louise (Lea Seydoux).</seg>
<seg id="18">She makes some show of looking after him but is incapable of holding down a job or, for that matter, turning down a man; Simon, by default, has become the family breadwinner.</seg>
<seg id="19">As capable and resolute as Louise is restless and wanton, he has trained himself as a thief.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meier, 41, was born in France near the Swiss border and grew up in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="21">Simon's stamping ground is a ski-field similar to the ones where she spent much of her childhood.</seg>
<seg id="22">Each day he rides the cable car from the drab industrial town in the valley up to the ski-field to pilfer clothes and skis he sells to mates or through bent adults, often for absurdly small sums; to his friends in the dingy apartment block where he lives, he is a kind of Robin Hood.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mont Blanc soars in the distance but Meier and her exceptional photographer, Agnes Godard, avert the camera's gaze.</seg>
<seg id="24">The grandeur of the mountains is not their subject, any more than the glamour of sleek bourgeois families at play appeals to them, except for the purposes of grim comparison.</seg>
<seg id="25">Instead they show us the ski station as a workplace, where foreign cooks turn out meals in slush-bound kitchens and cable-car operators shower in sweaty locker rooms.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We didn't want to show how rich it is, how beautiful," Meier says.</seg>
<seg id="27">We are seeing it from the view of this little worker ant, who is in the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="28">This film, like Home, is preoccupied with space; how spaces are defined and how they define us.</seg>
<seg id="29">In Home, a rural family is effectively besieged when an abandoned highway built next to their house is suddenly opened to traffic; their response is to build a wall and huddle behind it.</seg>
<seg id="30">Godard's camera angles ensure that we never see what is on the other side of the road and that the road appears to continue endlessly in both directions.</seg>
<seg id="31">Our eye swivels back and forth across the horizontal, from which there is no escape.</seg>
<seg id="32">Home is clearly a modern fable, although the original spark for the story was real enough: Meier spotted a family eating in their garden right next to a highway in the middle of France and wondered "How can they live like that?"</seg>
<seg id="33">"It's really a mix between reality and my imagination," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">I wrote the script as an anti-road movie, as a metaphor for people who want to live outside the walls but at the same time need them.</seg>
<seg id="35">Sister, by contrast, is defined by verticality; Simon is constantly on the move between a valley polluted by factory fumes and the crisp air of the mountains that the rich can afford to breathe.</seg>
<seg id="36">Meier shot a film for television in this valley in 2002 and "the setting stayed in my heart," she says.</seg>
<seg id="37">You have this industrial plain and you just have to look up and there is another world with this ski resort.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's very simple: this vertical view tells us a lot of things about our contemporary world, about up and down.</seg>
<seg id="39">Critics have compared Sister with films by Belgian filmmakers the Dardenne brothers, whose intimately naturalistic films give such dignity to characters who are usually downtrodden and sometimes despicable.</seg>
<seg id="40">Meier admires the Dardennes, but sees her work as very different: implicitly political rather than socially observant and too fanciful to be classed as realism.</seg>
<seg id="41">"All my characters in Home and in Sister think that they can live outside of the world with their own law, their own Utopia," she says.</seg>
<seg id="42">For the purposes of storytelling, she lets them do that.</seg>
<seg id="43">In Sister, there is no police, there is no social worker: they're already out of the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">They're very marginal, of course.</seg>
<seg id="45">And at the beginning, this balance works for them.</seg>
<seg id="46">Sister is grounded in a real remembered moment, however, just as Home was.</seg>
<seg id="47">When Meier was learning to ski on the slopes near Geneva, her instructor warned the children against a young boy hanging around on his own who was known to be stealing.</seg>
<seg id="48">"I was very surprised because he didn't look so different from us and to ski, it's expensive and still he stole," she says.</seg>
<seg id="49">My imagination went to work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I thought 'Who is this little boy?</seg>
<seg id="51">Why does he need to steal?</seg>
<seg id="52">In the end, he was banned from the resort.</seg>
<seg id="53">Kacey had difficulties accepting a character who stole, she says; similarly, Seydoux was angry with the idea of a woman who kept running out on a child.</seg>
<seg id="54">The challenge is that we love her in the end, we don't hate her, because she is a terrible mother.</seg>
<seg id="55">She was very angry with the character, but I showed her films of Agnes Varda like Vagabonde; at one moment she had a big leap and understood the character so well she started fighting for her.</seg>
<seg id="56">I was very moved.</seg>
<seg id="57">It was very important for me that the spectator can feel her pain and sense of failure.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is testimony to Meier's mastery that she is able to attract actors of the calibre of Huppert, Seydoux and Gillian Anderson - who plays "The English Lady" in Sister - to play demanding roles in small films.</seg>
<seg id="59">Seydoux, who now seems ubiquitous, was shooting pick-ups for Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol with Tom Cruise in tandem with Sister and had to keep flying to Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="60">Meier found the positive in her absences, which distressed Kacey; she says it was as if, like Louise, Seydoux kept trying to escape her life in the film.</seg>
<seg id="61">"It was difficult to shoot like that," she says.</seg>
<seg id="62">But at the same time it was just like the character, so it was great.</seg>
<seg id="63">■ Sister is in selected release.</seg>

<seg id="1">How creepy-crawlies from Thailand have increased revenue at a Paris bar</seg>
<seg id="2">Maybe you pull faces over the insects without even realising that you eat about half a kilo of them a year quite voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, ground up in flour.</seg>
<seg id="4">If you consume them consciously, then you are definitely trendy: it’s green, nutritious and you have also got a unique experience covered.</seg>
<seg id="5">Elie Daviron, chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu, is the first in Paris to include insect on the menu at the beginning of October.</seg>
<seg id="6">The bar, whose name was inspired by the book Naked Lunch by William Burroughs, can be found in the fashionable 18th arrondissement not far from Montmartre, which is visited by tourists in great numbers.</seg>
<seg id="7">With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail’s eggs, guests can now taste not only various larvae, grasshoppers or water beetles there, they can even try scorpions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (so as not to damage the insects’ wings, distort their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from as far away as Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="9">Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.</seg>
<seg id="10">The owner of the Paris bar with its pioneering menu promptly lists several reasons why to eat insects.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first is the environmental benefit, because production of insects is far less costly on our planet (in relation to finance, space and water consumption) than the traditional meat.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Furthermore, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he just aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.</seg>
<seg id="14">In his opinion, enjoyment, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment make a proper restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I’m not saving the world, I'm just providing a new experience," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is not everyone by far who would be enthusiastic about the idea of eating a beetle garnished with pesto, but the reaction of customers at this Parisian bar to the insects served has been very positive, according to the owner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even sceptics have allegedly tried them, although they start with the smallest mouthful and only in the end do they choose a scorpion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prices for these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals, which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN sustainable development summit that began in Rio de Janeiro overnight.</seg>
<seg id="4">They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit.</seg>

<seg id="7">These SDGs will build on our advances under the millennium development goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.</seg>

<seg id="1">A Bad Ruling on Stop-and-Frisk</seg>
<seg id="2">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was unwise to put a stay on the necessary remedies Judge Shira Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan ordered in August in response to the civil rights violations of New York City's stop-and-frisk policy.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it overreached in taking the extraordinary step of removing Judge Scheindlin from the long-running litigation.</seg>
<seg id="4">The appeals panel said the judge improperly used the assignment process that led to her presiding over three stop-and-frisk cases.</seg>
<seg id="5">It also said that she created the "appearance of impropriety" by granting a series of press interviews while the case was pending before her.</seg>
<seg id="6">In one of the interviews cited in the appellate court order, Judge Scheindlin reasonably defended herself from what she described as "below-the-belt" attacks by the city, which sought to portray her as unfair to the New York Police Department.</seg>
<seg id="7">The city, however, did not raise these issues in its motion for a stay of the remedial measures, which include an independent monitor who would oversee reforms of police training, discipline and other matters - while the case was on appeal.</seg>
<seg id="8">The appeals court went out of its way to take up issues that were not before it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The court did not overturn the August ruling, in which Judge Scheindlin rightly found that the tactics underlying the stop-and-frisk program violated the rights of minority citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">She castigated city officials for being "deliberately indifferent" to police practices that were racially discriminatory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The case turned on statistics showing that about 4.4 million people - mostly young black and Hispanic men - had been stopped between January 2004 and June 2012.</seg>
<seg id="12">About 12 percent led to arrests or summonses.</seg>
<seg id="13">But 88 percent of those cases resulted in no further action, meaning that those detained or frisked were not breaking the law.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Judge Scheindlin noted in her ruling, the population that was stopped was overwhelming innocent, not criminal - which undercut the city's argument that it had justification for focusing on minority citizens.</seg>
<seg id="15">Judge Scheindlin did not strike down the program, which, when properly used, is an important crime-fighting tool.</seg>
<seg id="16">But she sensibly ordered the city to use it in a manner that does not discriminate against minorities and that complied with constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure.</seg>
<seg id="17">Under the Fourth Amendment, police officers can legally detain people on the street when there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition to violating people's rights, the program, as practiced for years in New York, undermined trust in the Police Department in black and Hispanic communities throughout the city.</seg>
<seg id="19">Given all the damage done by this program, the next mayor should end this saga by withdrawing the city's appeal and instituting the cogent reforms laid out by Judge Scheindlin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ron Medich house sells for $11 million</seg>
<seg id="2">42A Wolseley Road, Point Piper.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Point Piper waterfront property at the centre of an outstanding loan dispute between property developer Ron Medich and finance broker Adam Tilley has sold for about $11 million.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the same property that Michael McGurk was accused of firebombing in 2008, but he was murdered the following year outside his Cremorne home before charges could be laid.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Wolseley Road property was listed off-market for much of this year with an asking price of $16 million, but was relaunched again with an October auction date and hopes of $12.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="6">The waterfront property has sold for about $11 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">McGrath's James Dack declined to comment on the sale, but other sources confirm the sale for close to $11 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 828-square-metre property is the former home of beleaguered fashion designer Lisa Ho and ragtrader Philip Smouha, who sold the house to Mr Medich in early 2003 for $7.75 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Medich then sold it to Mr Tilley for $12.5 million in late 2004 with plans for a five-storey apartment block, designed by architects Burley Katon Halliday.</seg>
<seg id="10">When that deal soured, Mr Tilley told Fairfax Media in 2009 he was about to sell the property for $20 million, but no sale took place.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ensuing insolvency arrangement involved Mr Medich as the main creditor, and other creditors are Damien Reed and Mr Tilley's younger brother Ben Tilley.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kenya's Liz: Will her alleged rapists be charged?</seg>
<seg id="2">31 October 2013 Last updated at 20:06 By Anne Soy BBC News, Kenya</seg>
<seg id="3">Liz's mother tells the BBC's Anne Soy: "I want justice to be done"</seg>
<seg id="4">The mother of the 16-year-old Kenyan girl who says she was raped by six men and dumped in a 22-ft (6.7m) deep latrine looked numb with worry.</seg>
<seg id="5">But she told the BBC from the hospital where her daughter is receiving treatment that she is thankful for the support the family has received worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am very grateful to all the people who have supported us through this ordeal," she said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her daughter was attacked and repeatedly raped by six men in June as she returned from her grandfather's funeral in Tingolo village in Busia County, western Kenya.</seg>
<seg id="8">Her unconscious body was thrown into a pit latrine and she is now in a wheelchair.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her case caused an uproar after Kenya's influential Daily Nation newspaper reported that the police in Busia had asked three of the suspects she identified as her rapists to cut grass as punishment and had chosen not to prosecute them.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a BBC interview on Thursday, Police Inspector General David Kimaiyo said an investigation into the girl's allegation had been concluded, but still no decision had been taken on whether it was a rape case.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he was unaware that her alleged attackers were ordered to cut grass and that the case was reported to police only two months after "the incident."</seg>
<seg id="12">No emotion</seg>
<seg id="13">But several hundred activists in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, carrying placards, waving underwear and beating drums marched to the police headquarters, where the inspector general's office is located, and handed over a petition calling for the arrest of the suspects and the officers who allegedly failed to prosecute them.</seg>
<seg id="14">The petition, which was started online, was signed by more than 1,200,000 people from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">Saida Ali, executive director of the Coalition on Violence Against Women (COVAW) rights group, was among the protesters who handed the petition to police on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The response was polite, they promised to take action, so we will wait to see that action," she said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The girl, who is called Liz to protect her identity, is being cared for at the Gynocare Centre in Eldoret, 156km (97 miles) from Busia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Her mother is staying with her at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="19">I briefly saw Liz, who answered my greeting in Swahili, the main language in Kenya, but the rest of the time she just stared, showing no emotion.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were told that this is an improvement and that last week she had refused to look any of her visitors in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Nation Media Group, a Kenya-based media house which first reported the story, has paid the medical bills for Liz amounting to more than $7,000 (£4,300).</seg>
<seg id="22">Their reporter named her Liz and that is how the world now knows her.</seg>
<seg id="23">Her mother said that since the online campaign began some people had even set up an education fund for Liz.</seg>
<seg id="24">But her medical condition is still of concern.</seg>
<seg id="25">She suffered fistula because of the rape - a condition where she lost control of the flow of urine and stool.</seg>
<seg id="26">The programme manager at the hospital, Jared Momanyi, said she had undergone surgery to correct the fistula.</seg>
<seg id="27">"She was also traumatised but has been receiving counselling and she is improving," he added.</seg>
<seg id="28">She also injured her spine when she was thrown down the pit latrine and has been unable to walk for some time.</seg>
<seg id="29">Suspects in hiding</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the matter went public, and viral, the mother says some family members of the suspects have been threatening her.</seg>
<seg id="31">"They said that if their sons are arrested I'll see fire," she said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Earlier her husband had to endure insults from a father of one suspect, who had initially offered to help the family, and then rescinded his decision.</seg>
<seg id="33">I want the suspects to be arrested and justice to be done.</seg>
<seg id="34">Up to now no-one has been arrested.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I hear some have gone into hiding," Liz's mother said.</seg>
<seg id="36">The inspector general of police confirmed that the suspects could not be traced, adding that they had fled into Uganda.</seg>
<seg id="37">Busia - where the incident took place - is near the Kenya-Uganda border.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Director of Public Prosecution, Keriako Tobiko, has ordered their arrests but none has been made so far.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, Mr Tobiko confirmed to the BBC that he had received the investigations file from the police and was going through it.</seg>
<seg id="40">"I will press charges once I find sufficient evidence," he said.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Sexual Offences Act of 2006 spells out tough punitive measures against people convicted of various sexual crimes.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Act empowers the court to issue a sentence of not less than 15 years for a conviction of gang rape, but the court may extend the sentence to imprisonment for life.</seg>
<seg id="43">The police in June released a report showing that reported cases of rape had increased to 383 between January and May this year, from 332 for the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="44">Police stations in Kenya are expected to have a gender desk where such cases are reported.</seg>
<seg id="45">But Liz's mother rarely smiled during her interview - she sounded like she had lost faith in the authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.</seg>
<seg id="4">One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="6">The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.</seg>
<seg id="8">State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.</seg>
<seg id="9">The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kids may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels like there is hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."</seg>

<seg id="2">A large capacity tank was on fire in Prague’s CKD industrial zone, according to fire fighters, it was probably a cooling tower.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fire fighters attended a fire on Thursday before 11 o’clock in the evening; the fire was still being put out this morning," reported Pavlína Adamcová, spokesperson for the Prague fire service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The amount of pollutants in the air in the vicinity have not exceeded the permitted limits according to measurements.</seg>
<seg id="5">The amount of damage and the cause of the fire are not yet known.</seg>
<seg id="6">Around fifty fire fighters attended the site on Kolbenova Street.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is a fire at a large capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," said Adamcová.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The zone does not have a functional hydrant system, so we are extinguishing it using a relay hose from the cisterns," she added.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the tn.cz server, extinguishing the fire has been complicated by the poorly functioning hydrant system, so that fire fighters had to get water from elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The crew commander declared a level two fire alarm.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are four levels in total, with level four being the most serious situations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chemists also attended the site to check the level of dangerous substances which could get into the air during the fire.</seg>
<seg id="13">"However, we have not measured a level of pollutants in the atmosphere which could exceed hygiene standards," said the fire service spokesperson.</seg>

<seg id="1">Taxi drivers protest at Melbourne Airport over the end of short-fare queues</seg>
<seg id="2">Taxi drivers protesting at Melbourne Airport have clashed with police and security staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">WEARY travellers could find themselves fighting for a cab home from Melbourne Airport this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="4">A day of heated protests over a change to the short-fares system led to hundreds of taxi drivers declaring a boycott of the airport.</seg>
<seg id="5">Flyers are circulating urging cabbies to not pick up arriving passengers, and drivers vowed to rally again on Monday morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Victoria Police critical incident response team officers armed with capsicum spray were deployed, as local and federal police and airport security officers struggled to contain more than 300 drivers protesting near the arrivals terminal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities appealed for calm as several scuffles broke out.</seg>
<seg id="8">Police escorted some protesters away.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cabbie Ayush Sethi said Melbourne Airport was exploiting underpaid drivers through its decision to axe short-fare queues.</seg>
<seg id="10">A taxi driver is held by a police officer at the protest at Melbourne Airport.</seg>
<seg id="11">We work for two hours and get an $8 fare, it's not fair.</seg>
<seg id="12">"They treat us like slaves, like dogs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Previously, drivers who waited in the airport's holding yard and picked up a passenger going to a nearby destination were allowed to return to the airport, bypass the yard and head straight to the terminal's taxi rank.</seg>
<seg id="14">Melbourne Airport manager of corporate and public affairs Matt Francis said that arrangement was halted because some drivers, who weren't returning from short-fare trips, were exploiting it.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If the drivers and the industry want to talk to the airport about a better way to handle short fares, (we're) very happy to have that conversation," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">But we need to get a commitment from the industry that all of the drivers will abide by those rules.</seg>
<seg id="17">Up to 300 taxi drivers protested over the axing of short-queue fares at Melbourne Airport.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Francis said the blockade caused minimal disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="19">Extra buses were arranged to transport arriving passengers to Southern Cross station.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If there is another blockade on Monday morning, we will again have contingencies in place to minimise inconvenience for passengers," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Senior Sergeant Andrew Foot said Victorian and Australian Federal Police would be prepared for further action on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr Francis said he didn't anticipate this weekend's boycott would cause further disruptions.</seg>

<seg id="25">Driver Nazar Yousif said protesters had agreed to take passengers to the airport, but were refusing to pick up arriving travellers.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There are plenty of jobs waiting for us out there," Mr Nazar yelled to crowds of chanting drivers at yesterday's blockade.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Victorian Taxi Association CEO David Samuel said the drivers attending the boycott were a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I can understand completely where the drivers are coming from and their concerns, but disruptive behaviour and action is no way to achieve an outcome favourable to them," Mr Samuel said.</seg>
<seg id="29">He said the VTA would try to broker an agreement between the disgruntled drivers and airport authorities next week.</seg>
<seg id="30">The taxi driver is led away by police.</seg>
<seg id="31">Taxi drivers at Sydney Airport have their number plate photographed and those returning within 20 minutes are allowed to head straight to the terminal rank.</seg>
<seg id="32">Cabbies are angry about rank changes, which were implemented on Wednesday after claims of queue jumping.</seg>
<seg id="33">Previously, drivers who waited in the airport's holding yard and picked up a passenger going to a nearby destination, had been allowed to return to the airport, bypass the yard and head straight to the terminal taxi rank.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now all drivers must head to the holding yard.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Sydney Airport solution: Drivers" number plates are photographed.</seg>
<seg id="36">Drivers who return within 20 minutes and are identified as a short fare can rejoin the terminal rank.</seg>
<seg id="37">A receipt/token system: The Victorian Taxi Association is working on a system where drivers who get a short fare collect a receipt or a token.</seg>
<seg id="38">On returning to Melbourne Airport the driver would present that receipt or token and be allowed to head straight to the terminal taxi rank.</seg>

<seg id="1">Review: William Boyd's Bond novel 'Solo' puzzles over its mission</seg>
<seg id="2">There is no big set piece to open "Solo," the new James Bond novel by British author William Boyd.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret agent best known as 007 doesn't launch the story with an extravagant car chase, sky diving stunt or gunfight.</seg>
<seg id="4">The book is populated with attractive women, several of whom Bond escorts to bed, but they don't have sexually fanciful names such as Pussy Galore and Holly Goodhead.</seg>
<seg id="5">And though Q, the master of spyware gadgets whose past inventions include a laser-cutting wristwatch and an ejection seat, still outfits Bond with covert tools for "Solo's" espionage assignment, the most exciting gizmo he has to tender is a knockout potion concealed in after-shave.</seg>
<seg id="6">Boyd's Bond, in other words, shares not that much with Hollywood's version of the Ian Fleming character, which is "Solo's" strongest attribute and ultimately its most evident limitation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Granted the opportunity by the estate of Fleming, who died in 1964, to create an original tale not bound by the constraints of modern Bond fluency, Boyd has written an intriguing novella that, on an absolute scale, is a tidy little 1960s war-for-oil tale.</seg>
<seg id="8">Books: Sign up for our email newsletter</seg>
<seg id="9">"Solo" feels a bit diluted relative to the character's enduring mystique, yet that may be exactly what Boyd is after: given both man and Superman, he's chosen to focus his attentions on the former, a welcome change from Fleming's approach.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boyd has tackled espionage quite competently in "Waiting for Sunrise" and "Restless," novels that covered World War I, World War II, the Cold War, betrayals, double agents - all of the foundations of the genre, elevated with literary flourish.</seg>
<seg id="11">More often than not, Boyd likes to take rather ordinary folks and drop them into nearly impossible situations, and his brilliance as a writer largely rests with how he extracts these characters.</seg>
<seg id="12">And if these fictional people are sympathetic, they are not necessarily laudable: Boyd is fond of antiheroes.</seg>
<seg id="13">That formula, quite obviously, is not well suited to James Bond, whose essence is his superiority over all others; there's no doubt he'll come out on top, and even if you sully him a bit, he's still heroic.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the start of "Solo," Bond is in the midst of a dream or, for him, something of a nightmare - the memory of an early assignment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The year is 1944, moments after the Normandy invasion.</seg>
<seg id="16">A 19-year-old Bond, part of a British commando team charged with capturing Nazi "documents, files and encoding devices," is nearly killed when his gun jams as a German bears down on him.</seg>
<seg id="17">"He had stared death full in the face," Boyd writes of Bond, unaware at that moment that it foretold "the pattern of the life ahead of him."</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet this Bond is uninterested in contemplating whether or not the reverie was a chronicle of a death foretold; he lives in and for the moment, much like the Sean Connery model.</seg>
<seg id="19">When the novel returns to the present, in 1969, the secret agent is celebrating his 45th birthday alone.</seg>
<seg id="20">A newspaper headline reminds us that the Vietnam War is spiraling into chaos, but Bond's assignment takes him to a different part of the world, the fictional West African country of Zanzarim.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former British colony is in the midst of a two year-long civil war, and Bond is instructed to tip the scales in favor of the Zanzarim army by removing from the battlefield (by whatever covert means suitable) their opponent's "African Napoleon," a commander named Brigadier Adeka.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bond will pose as a journalist to get close to the reclusive Adeka, and it is through Bond's eyes that Boyd's understanding of the region and its people comes into focus.</seg>
<seg id="23">Boyd was born in Ghana and spent part of his early life there and in Nigeria, and when he writes about the continent, he does so calculatingly and persuasively.</seg>
<seg id="24">His first novel, "A Good Man in Africa," was set in Africa, as were "An Ice-Cream War" and "Brazzaville Beach."</seg>
<seg id="25">Zanzarim may be the most intriguing thing about "Solo," and Boyd's navigation of its geography, conflict and politics, including 007's complicated encounter with an exotic local contact name Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant, is as forceful as it is short-lived.</seg>
<seg id="26">Just as we grow hungrier for more from and about Zanzarim, it's gone and forgotten, as Bond is compelled to go on an unauthorized, unaccompanied mission - hence the book's title.</seg>
<seg id="27">While his rogue, "Solo" operation is instigated by a rather clever double-cross, the rest of his mission is uninspired.</seg>
<seg id="28">There's an original enough villain, but if Bond's conduct, and the rest of the novel, is going to be shaped in any way by the spy's World War II preamble, Boyd isn't inclined to serve the meal he's set out, which makes his opening flashback feel like little more than literary window dressing.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Fleming estate has handpicked other authors to craft new Bond novels, with Boyd preceded in the pageant by Jeffery Deaver ("Carte Blanche") and Sebastian Faulks ("Devil May Care").</seg>
<seg id="30">While it is to Boyd's credit that he doesn't feel constrained by, and even seems to work against, Bond mythology, "Solo" nevertheless feels like a missed opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="31">In spy terms, Boyd has figured out how to bring the agent over to his side, but once he's enlisted 007, Boyd doesn't seem to know where in the world to send him.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. policy on Syria under fire on Capitol Hill</seg>
<seg id="2">(CBS News) Israel's latest raid into Syria is perhaps another example of how the country's civil war could turn into a regional conflict.</seg>
<seg id="3">Israeli warplanes attacked two bases inside Syria Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The military action comes as U.S. allies in the Middle East warn that the Syrian conflict is spilling over.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Israeli strikes hit two sites -- one near the capitol of Damascus and another around the port city of Latakia, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reported on "CBS This Morning."</seg>
<seg id="6">They targeted missiles reportedly headed to Hezbollah fighters aligned with the Syrian regime.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Israelis vowed to prevent any weapons transfer to the terror group.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is at least the second Israeli military intervention this year.</seg>
<seg id="9">At a hearing in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, got an earful from Republicans about the continuing instability in the country that's led to the Israeli strikes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the Obama administration broke its promise to support the rebels.</seg>
<seg id="11">Do you feel good about what our country is doing with the opposition right now?</seg>
<seg id="12">Corker asked.</seg>
<seg id="13">"There isn't a person on my team that doesn't feel frustrated, frustrated by the Syrian problem in general," Ford said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ford said the rebels were "anguished" by the U.S. decision not to carry out its own missile strikes.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, he argued the U.S. is helping and pointed to a recent delivery of 10 Toyota pickup trucks to the rebels.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said that wouldn't help them win.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Trucks," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's a great thing, trucks.</seg>
<seg id="19">As shiploads of weapons come into the Russian port, as plane load after plane load land and provide all kinds of lethal weapons, and we're proud of the fact that we gave them trucks.</seg>
<seg id="20">As members of both parties criticized the policy, a human rights group reported Thursday that the death toll reached 120,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ford said, "Can I say that our efforts to create a political solution or to contain the civil war are a success?"</seg>
<seg id="22">U.S. inaction has angered a number of U.S. allies in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Secretary of State John Kerry travels there next week to reassure them that the U.S. is trying to stop the killing and is pushing for peace talks to begin this month.</seg>

<seg id="2">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader.</seg>
<seg id="8">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.</seg>
<seg id="12">UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
<seg id="13">At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market.</seg>
<seg id="14">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Banks are scouring through years" worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="16">News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks" increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that "you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices."</seg>
<seg id="19">The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained," Credit Suisse said.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.</seg>
<seg id="2">The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together."</seg>
<seg id="4">Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."</seg>
<seg id="11">We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" back Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch</seg>
<seg id="2">At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there," Mrs Amirthalinga says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.</seg>
<seg id="12">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">People are saying "the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="21">Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs," says Ms Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hagel Blasts States on Same-Sex Benefits Policy</seg>
<seg id="2">Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday sharply criticized U.S. states that are defying the Pentagon by refusing to allow National Guard facilities to issue ID cards that enable same-sex spouses of military members to claim benefits.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This is wrong," Hagel said in a speech in New York.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Not only does this violate the states' obligation under federal law, their actions have created hardship and inequality by forcing couples to travel long distances to federal military bases to obtain the ID cards they're entitled to," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hagel said this is causing division among the military ranks.</seg>
<seg id="6">In his remarks to an Anti-Defamation League centennial dinner speech, Hagel did not name the states that are defying Pentagon policy on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the Pentagon has cited nine: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Pentagon says there are 114 Army and Air National Guard sites in those nine states that are not providing ID cards to eligible same-sex spouses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hagel also used his speech to announce that he has directed the Marine Corps to expedite the manufacture and delivery to Israel of V-22 Osprey aircraft, hybrids that take off and land like a helicopter and cruise like an airplane.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is to be the first overseas sale of the Osprey.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hagel also offered assurances that the Obama administration's interest in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program is a way of testing Iranian intentions for a diplomatic solution to a matter that has been in dispute for years.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If we can find ways to resolve disputes peacefully, we are wise to explore them," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Israel is skeptical of any negotiation with Iran.</seg>
<seg id="14">Convinced Iran is pursuing the development of nuclear weapons to threaten his country, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Iranians are trying to trick the West into easing economic sanctions while still pushing forward with their nuclear program.</seg>
<seg id="15">Iran insists its program is for peaceful purposes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hagel focused much of his dinner speech on the gay rights matter, which was a central issue during the tenure of his predecessor at the Pentagon, Leon Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="17">Panetta, who retired in February, was honored at the dinner for his long career in public service.</seg>
<seg id="18">Under Pentagon policy that took effect Sept.</seg>
<seg id="19">3, same-sex spouses of military members are eligible for the same health care, housing and other benefits enjoyed by opposite-sex spouses.</seg>
<seg id="20">That decision followed the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in June on the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some states, however, have refused to allow issuance of the necessary Pentagon ID cards on National Guard facilities.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Oklahoma, for example, Gov. Mary Fallin ordered her state's National Guard to stop processing requests, making legally married gay couples apply for benefits on federal facilities like Tinker Air Force Base.</seg>
<seg id="23">Oklahoma in 2004 approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting giving benefits of marriage to gay couples.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hagel said these states' policies are unfair.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said he ordered the chief of the National Guard Bureau, Gen. Frank Grass, to "take immediate action to remedy this situation."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear what legal authority Grass has to force the states to change course.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fannie Mae asking for $800 million for Libor manipulation losses</seg>
<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, sued nine banks Thursday for manipulating a key benchmark lending rate.</seg>
<seg id="3">The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan, asks for $800 million in to cover losses and a reward for punitive damages from the nine banks accused of manipulating the Libor, or London inter-bank offered rate, which is an average rate that banks charge each other for loans.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Libor is used to set the rates for trillions of dollars in private and personal loans.</seg>
<seg id="5">To date four banks, all of them named in the Fannie Mae lawsuit, have settled allegations of Libor manipulating with regulators.</seg>
<seg id="6">In each of those cases, the banks have admitted to wrongdoing, The Wall Street Journal reported.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the long run, Libor manipulation can affect trillions in loans.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the short run, however, it can affect specific transactions resulting in quick profits.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored bank that buys mortgage loans from other banks, says in the lawsuit that bank Libor submissions were noticeably askew on days in which it did a lot of business in interest-rate swaps, a derivative it uses to offset risks in mortgage investments.</seg>
<seg id="10">The lawsuit says the banks worked together to manipulate the U.S. dollar Libor.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fannie Mae filed this action to recover losses it suffered as a result of the defendants' manipulation of Libor.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have a responsibility to be good stewards of our resources," a Fannie Mae spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, filed a lawsuit in March that charges more than a dozen banks with finance market manipulations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The four banks that have settled charges of Libor manipulation with regulators include the Royal Bank of Scotland, Rabobank Group, UBS and Barclays.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parramatta Eels bosses refer Roy Spagnolo case to police</seg>
<seg id="2">Spagnolo insists he has been reprimanded over "two administrative errors."</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Simon Alekna</seg>
<seg id="4">The board of the Parramatta Leagues Club has voted to send a report containing allegations of financial impropriety against the former chairman Roy Spagnolo to the NSW government's Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Spagnolo, who was not re-elected at the club elections in May, retained his Eels membership but was being reprimanded and suspended from holding a directorship for two years at a board meeting this week.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is understood that on Thursday night the directors of the board led by premiership-winning forward Steve Sharp then voted to forward the 900-page report compiled by the firm Russell Corporate Advisory to the liquor and gaming regulator.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is believed that the findings of the internal review commissioned by Sharp's board only relate in part to allegations against Spagnolo, with wider conclusions about the practices of the former administration and state of the club forming the remainder of the extensive document that will now be investigated by the OLGR.</seg>
<seg id="8">NSW Hospitality Minister George Souris has already said that matters could be referred from the department to NSW Police.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among more than 30 instances of alleged impropriety, Spagnolo was asked by the Leagues Club board to explain accusations he procured free memberships and travel for family and friends, gave former chief executive Bob Bentley bonuses without approval, including one of $92,998, and improperly claimed money without proper documentation.</seg>
<seg id="10">In one case, he is alleged to have tried to claim back $30,000 for the cost of a Christmas party at his house, penning the invoice in handwriting on the back of a beer coaster.</seg>
<seg id="11">Spagnolo denies all the claims, insisting he has been reprimanded over "two administrative errors," and refuses to vacate the chairman's seat of the Eels' junior body, the Parramatta District Rugby League Club.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also rejects any suggestion of wrongdoing in claims that the club paid Eels forward Fuifui Moimoi $15,000 for his car in November last year when it was said to be worth between $3800 and $5200.</seg>
<seg id="13">That episode is likely to gain the attention of NRL salary cap auditor Ian Schubert in the off-season.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We're at the period of the year where we begin auditing all clubs, and all issues will be reviewed as part of that," an NRL spokesman said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ashes UK view: English press in mixed reaction to side's poor start</seg>
<seg id="2">England is no closer to finding the final member of its pace attack for the first Ashes Test after the three leading candidates failed to fire on the opening day of its tour match against a WACA Chairman's XI side.</seg>
<seg id="3">England paceman Chris Tremlett didn't exactly push his Test claims on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">THE browbeatings delivered by England's cricketers in recent years has been matched in intensity only by the chest-beating of their travelling media contingent.</seg>
<seg id="5">No group has revelled in Australia's Ashes misfortunes quite like the Pommy press over three successive victorious campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="6">But is sentiment finally changing?</seg>
<seg id="7">The triumphant headlines that accompanied England's recent 3-0 defeat of Australia have been replaced with far more cautious musings of late.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the tone of articles emanating from the WACA Ground this week have been distinctly light on jingoism and heavy on pessimism after a lamentable day in the field.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Western Australia Chair XI, comprised of second-tier players from around the country, advanced to 4-369 at stumps.</seg>
<seg id="10">The top four all passed 50, with Queenslander Chris Lynn's dashing 104 from 124 deliveries the highlight.</seg>
<seg id="11">England's armada of towering quicks struggled in Perth.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chris Tremlett, Boyd Rankin and Steve Finn all conceded runs at more than four-per-over and found wickets elusive in the extreme.</seg>
<seg id="13">"No need to panic, they insist, but the start of England's tour had grim parallels with the dark and disastrous days of the 1990s," wrote John Etheridge in The Sun.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Memorably, back in 1998 after England endured a poor day in the opening match of that winter's tour Down Under, assistant-coach Bob Cottam admitted "the wheels have come off."</seg>
<seg id="15">We have not remotely reached that stage - not that anybody in the current management would admit it - but captain Alastair Cook and head coach Andy Flower will demand a sharp improvement in the bowling.</seg>
<seg id="16">No need for panic, yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">Paul Newman, of the Daily Mail, was equally unimpressed with England's first outing of the 2013-14 Ashes tour.</seg>
<seg id="18">England's pace attack has struggled to find its groove on the opening day of its warm-up fixture against a WACA Chairman's XI side, claiming just one scalp in the opening two sessions in Perth.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The the first day of the Ashes tour here in Perth turned into a chastening experience for those looking to prove their worth for Brisbane," Newman wrote.</seg>
<seg id="20">A tour which England hope will culminate in an historic fourth successive Ashes triumph could not have got off to a worse start as a Western Australian XI cobbled together from those not considered good enough for their Sheffield Shield team flogged England to all parts of the WACA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Long day in the field for England.</seg>
<seg id="22">The sentiment was hardly brighter in the Guardian, where Andy Wilson pondered over England's "chastening" start to the tour and wondered aloud whether the tourists had been caught out in fielding three towering quicks on a "slow and even stodgy" WACA Ground pitch.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tall guys or fall guys?</seg>
<seg id="24">Chris Tremlett and Steven Finn may have prospered in Perth during England's last Ashes tour, encouraging the management to include a third giant, Boyd Rankin, in this squad, and to select all three for this opening fixture at the famously fast and bouncy Waca," Wilson wrote.</seg>
<seg id="25">But after a chastening opening day in which Tremlett, Finn and Rankin recorded combined figures of one for 245 from 53 overs on an unexpectedly slow and even stodgy surface, they were warned to expect similar conditions for the Perth date in this series, the third Test in mid-December.</seg>
<seg id="26">WACA deck may be same for Test.</seg>
<seg id="27">Irrespective of the surface Dean Wilson, writing in The Mirror, noted: "England's collection of six foot eight quickies could and should have done better."</seg>
<seg id="28">More expected from pace trio.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simon Calder: At last!</seg>
<seg id="2">A new way to get to Waverley</seg>
<seg id="3">Two-twenty-two in the afternoon of Monday 9 December: where will you be?</seg>
<seg id="4">If you don't yet have plans for that instant, perhaps you would care to join me for some momentary trainspotting at the main station in the city where Danny Boyle's film, Trainspotting, was set.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new weekday railway timetable comes into force that day, and I want to see if the promised balletic perfection is realised at Edinburgh Waverley.</seg>
<seg id="6">At 2.22pm precisely, two trains that started hours earlier from different stations in London are due to converge on the Scottish capital - one from the east, the other from the west, mirroring the two main lines they have taken from stations only a few hundred yards apart in London.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the first time in decades, direct daytime trains from Euston, running on the West Coast Main Line, will serve Waverley - offering, at last, proper competition with the east coast link from King's Cross.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 400 rail miles between the two capitals will be fought over by the two big Anglo-Scottish train operators: Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains will take on East Coast Trains.</seg>
<seg id="9">A pretty penny that's worth paying?</seg>
<seg id="10">While both services have a top running speed of 125mph, the new schedule looks unequal.</seg>
<seg id="11">When Virgin's passengers set off at 8.43am, their East Coast counterparts can remain happily abed, because their train does not depart until 10am.</seg>
<seg id="12">By that stage, Virgin's slow coaches will be approaching Birmingham - having called at three stations already, with a dozen more to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">After giving the other lot a healthy head start, the East Coast express pauses only at York, Darlington, Newcastle and Berwick-upon-Tweed, averaging a healthy 93mph for the entire run.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virgin's average of 71mph barely beats the motorway speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="15">That surely implies lower fares, to lure passengers on board?</seg>
<seg id="16">Not so.</seg>
<seg id="17">The lowest one-way fare on the Virgin train is currently £119, compared with £50 on East Coast Trains.</seg>
<seg id="18">Presumably that is a function of the train being regarded as a peak business service to the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="19">Let's hope Virgin sorts out its fares, because there's another reason to take its train: aesthetics.</seg>
<seg id="20">Slow and expensive it may be, but the west coast is emphatically the prettiest route, as I found on a test run.</seg>
<seg id="21">Going north, the East Coast Main Line doesn't get interesting until County Durham, whereupon it remains lively for the rest of the journey, with fine views from the corrugated north-east shore of England and the curve into the Firth of Forth.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the west coast has great scenery from the off, carving elegantly through Herts, Bucks and Northants.</seg>
<seg id="23">The railside backyards of Coventry, Birmingham and Wolverhampton may be uninspiring, but once into Staffordshire the countryside becomes more lyrical.</seg>
<seg id="24">After Crewe (where, until December, you must change) there are some impressive works of man, as witnessed when you scythe obliquely across the Manchester Ship Canal outside Warrington.</seg>
<seg id="25">Considering it is called the "West Coast" Main Line, the railway's encounter with the shore is as brief as it gets - a 200-metre strip just north of Lancaster.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few minutes later the train hurries through Carnforth, the location for the film Brief Encounter.</seg>
<seg id="27">Next, you take a lofty waft past Kendal, sitting comfortably in the hollow carved by the River Kent with England's highest mountains as the backdrop.</seg>
<seg id="28">The finest scenery is coming up: the folds and fells of eastern Cumbria, where the train outstrips all the traffic on the parallel M6 (apart from an errant white Porsche Cayenne; speeding drivers should note that it is possible to read registration numbers from the train).</seg>
<seg id="29">The missing link</seg>
<seg id="30">Once across the border, the Southern Uplands provide the perfect terrain to test the tiltiness of the Pendolino train, and the power of the engines to ascend Beattock Summit at 1,016ft: "Pulling up Beattock, a steady climb: The gradient's against her, but she's on time," according to W H Auden's epic poem, Night Mail.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a day male, I can confirm my train was punctual too.</seg>
<seg id="32">The trajectory is firmly set north-west for the heart of Glasgow, the main Scottish destination for Virgin Trains.</seg>
<seg id="33">But at Carstairs Junction it swerves around the closest Britain's rail network has to a hairpin bend.</seg>
<seg id="34">The line carves east-north-east to Edinburgh.</seg>
<seg id="35">Here, you could change for the East Coast Main Line and complete the circuit.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or try the third way ...</seg>
<seg id="37">The most beautiful journey between the two capitals is neither the west nor the east, but the straightest possible path.</seg>
<seg id="38">Going north, take the train from the world's loveliest railway terminus, London St Pancras, via Sheffield to Leeds, where you change for the line across the Pennines to Carlisle.</seg>
<seg id="39">Here, you must currently change for the West Coast Main Line north via Carstairs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But work is under way to reopen some of the line through the heart of the Borders that was erased during the systematic destruction of the railways during the 1960s and 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="41">Like Edinburgh's main station, the direct line from Carlisle was named in honour of Sir Walter Scott's novel, Waverley.</seg>
<seg id="42">From 2015, trains should run on the northern third of the line, from Tweedbank to Waverley.</seg>
<seg id="43">The resurrection of the complete line is probably decades away, but meanwhile the two-hour bus ride across the missing link takes you through spectacular scenery that is no less impressive when viewed from the road.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria meets deadline to destroy chemical production facilities</seg>
<seg id="2">Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Thomas Countryman is 'confident' Syria's chemical weapons will be destroyed by June 30 next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Win McNamee/Getty Images/AFP Source: AFP</seg>
<seg id="4">THE US believes Syria's large stock of chemical weapons will be destroyed on schedule by the end of June 2014, US officials say.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am increasingly confident that we will be able to complete this task, the elimination of the Syria's chemical weapons program, within the target date of June 30th of next year," said Thomas Countryman, assistant secretary for international security and non-proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was speaking as the UN's chemical watchdog said Syria's entire declared stockpile had been placed under a seal and all its chemical arms production equipment destroyed in line with a November 1 deadline.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work is being carried out under an ambitious UN resolution, cobbled together by the US and Russia, to eliminate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's entire chemical weapons arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Our target dates are ambitious but they are achievable.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have the support of the international community," Countryman told US lawmakers at a hearing about the conflict in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="10">The US said it wanted to "applaud the OPCW, the United Nations and the Joint Mission staff for their unprecedented work" on eliminating Syria's chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="11">State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki added that "rendering this equipment inoperable is an important step in ensuring that chemical weapons are never used again by the Assad regime against the Syrian people."</seg>
<seg id="12">US ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told lawmakers that "the destruction of the regime's chemical weapons is a huge success if in fact it is carried out fully."</seg>
<seg id="13">"All stocks of chemical weapons and agents have been placed under seals that are impossible to break," Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons spokesman Christian Chartier told AFP, adding the seals were "tamper proof."</seg>
<seg id="14">"These are 1000 tonnes of chemical agents (which can be used to make weapons) and 290 tonnes of chemical weapons," Chartier said in The Hague.</seg>
<seg id="15">OPCW inspectors had until today to visit all of Syria's chemical sites and destroy all production and filling equipment in line with a timeline laid down by The Hague-based OPCW and backed by the UN Security Council resolution passed last month.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Executive Council of the Nobel Peace prize-winning organisation will now meet again on November 5 to decide by November 15 on "destruction milestones" for the stockpile.</seg>
<seg id="17">The UN resolution was agreed by the US and Russia to avert military strikes on Syria after deadly chemical weapons attacks outside Damascus in August, which the West blamed on Assad's regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Ford acknowledged in the Senate committee hearing that opposition rebels had reacted with "anguish" to President Barack Obama's decision not to press ahead with military strikes.</seg>
<seg id="19">They're deeply disappointed, Senator, that we chose not to use military force.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I have heard - just anguish from people that I have talked to over there," Ford said.</seg>
<seg id="21">He added however that the US had delivered ten pick-up trucks to the Syrian opposition military forces, as part of a US commitment to help them in their fight against Assad.</seg>
<seg id="22">More than 350,000 ready-to-eat rations as well as three tons of medical equipment has also been delivered to rebel forces, Psaki said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ford, who was forced to leave Damascus in 2011 because of the fighting, has been working hard behind the scenes to unify the fractured Syrian opposition and bring them to the negotiating table to chart a political transition in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wales offered tax raising powers by UK government</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 10:01</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg addressed assembly members at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay</seg>
<seg id="4">The Welsh government will be offered some control over income tax subject to a referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking in Cardiff Bay, he and deputy PM Nick Clegg announced new financial powers for the devolved administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">They include control of the stamp duty paid by house buyers and powers to finance upgrades on the M4.</seg>
<seg id="7">It follows the publication of a report last year which said the Welsh government should have new tax powers.</seg>
<seg id="8">At present Wales' devolved administration cannot vary taxes or borrow money, and gets its budget in a grant from the Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last November the Silk Commission, set up by the Westminster coalition, said the Welsh government should be responsible for raising some of the money it spends.</seg>
<seg id="10">It included a recommendation to devolve powers to vary a portion of income tax by 2020, following a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="11">Opportunity to decide</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the best ways to raise living standards is to cut peoples' taxes</seg>
<seg id="13">End Quote David Cameron and Nick Clegg</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Cameron said Wales will be given borrowing powers, control of landfill tax and stamp duty, and a House of Commons bill giving permission to hold a referendum on the devolution of income tax.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Today is about a strong and responsible future for Wales," he announced at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today we are announcing more power for the Welsh people and the Welsh government.</seg>
<seg id="17">Power that's about building this country up, power that's about making sure we have real accountable government here in Wales.</seg>
<seg id="18">And power that's about ensuring what I want and what I know what the deputy prime minister wants and the first minister wants, which is a strong Wales inside a strong United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Cameron said the decision will give new borrowing powers to make improvements of the M4 which, is a "foot in the windpipe of the Welsh economy."</seg>
<seg id="20">Land tax and stamp duty will also be devolved.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I think it is good for a government to be responsible for raising some of the money it spends," Mr Cameron said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr Clegg said it was a "significant" moment for Wales and "further conversations" could be had in the future about more devolution powers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is not the end, we look forward to seeing the recommendations in the second part of Silk," he added.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Cameron went on: "We are going to put forward a bill in the House of Commons for a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="25">It will be their (Welsh government) decision whether to trigger the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="26">If they do, it will be for the Welsh people to decide if they want these new powers.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Cameron also announced the Nato summit will be held in Wales in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="28">Showcase modern Wales</seg>
<seg id="29">"There will be as many as 60 heads of state and government coming to this important Nato conference, it will be the first time since 1990 that the United Kingdom has hosted this conference - the most important defence alliance that we have," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I'm delighted we're going to be doing it right here in Wales.</seg>
<seg id="31">I think it will be an excellent opportunity to showcase the best of what modern Wales has to offer the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="32">It'll be good for jobs, it'll be good for investment, it'll be good for business.</seg>
<seg id="33">It'll be a great advertisement for the success that Wales and the Welsh economy is.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr Cameron went on: "Scotland has got the Commonwealth Games, London had the Olympics, Northern Ireland the G8, now it's Wales' turn."</seg>
<seg id="35">First Minister Carwyn Jones, who had previously criticised the delay in the announcement from the UK government, said on Friday: "Today is an important day for Wales.</seg>
<seg id="36">We are now being treated like equals in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="37">We are not in favour of devolution of income tax until the Barnett formula is reformed to provide fairer funding for Wales.</seg>
<seg id="38">We need to be able to borrow to improve our infrastructure, such as the M4 around Newport as well as the A55 in north Wales.</seg>
<seg id="39">This announcement today goes a long way to show devolution works and further strengthens the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">Welsh Secretary David Jones said on Twitter the UK government is committed to giving the Welsh government "tools it needs to renew" its infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="41">"These measures will make the Assembly & the Welsh Government more accountable to the people of Wales who elect them," he added.</seg>
<seg id="42">Following the announcement, Finance Minister Jane Hutt revealed a new Welsh treasury will be established.</seg>
<seg id="43">We've always said we want these powers for a purpose.</seg>
<seg id="44">We now have the tools we need to boost the Welsh economy.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is a step forward for a maturing democracy.</seg>
<seg id="46">We will now press ahead with establishing a Welsh treasury.</seg>
<seg id="47">Powers for a purpose.</seg>
<seg id="48">Borrowing for a purpose.</seg>
<seg id="49">We now need to get on and improve our infrastructure and boost our economy.</seg>
<seg id="50">Writing jointly in the Western Mail on Friday, the prime minister and his deputy said: "Wales will have the opportunity to decide whether some of their income tax should be devolved."</seg>
<seg id="51">This is hugely important - one of the best ways to raise living standards is to cut peoples' taxes.</seg>
<seg id="52">They wrote that the UK government will "provide for a referendum to take place so that people in Wales can decide whether some of their income tax should be devolved, in the same way as it is in Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="53">The Silk Commission reported that a referendum should only happen with the agreement of both the Welsh and UK governments, a two-thirds majority in the Welsh assembly and the agreement of both Houses of Parliament.</seg>

<seg id="2">Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scotland Yard said they had served a "surrender notice" on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fearing Stockholm would pass him on to the US, he sought refuge at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.</seg>
<seg id="6">Scotland Yard has "served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He remains in breach of his bail conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The embassy declined to comment on the serving of the police notice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges, after releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash</seg>
<seg id="2">The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.</seg>
<seg id="3">"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The issue will be resolved this evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.</seg>
<seg id="8">No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.</seg>
<seg id="12">The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Oscar Garcia: The reason why the spirit of Johan Cruyff is alive in Sussex by the sea</seg>
<seg id="2">It is not easy, and Brighton are 16th in the Championship.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Garcia is not short of enthusiasm, and is wholly committed to introducing "the Barcelona way," learned in his years as a player and coach at the Nou Camp, here on the Sussex coast.</seg>
<seg id="4">"You can see that most of the players that [Cruyff] had, when he was our coach, most of us are managers now because we learned a lot," he says when we meet in a coffee shop in Brighton.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are trying to teach our players what he taught us.</seg>
<seg id="6">This does not just mean a specific method of playing football, but a zealous commitment to it, whatever the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="7">"If I have a philosophy," Garcia insists, more than once, "I have a philosophy from the start until the end."</seg>
<seg id="8">So when, at the end of our interview, Garcia recalls the most important advice he has ever received, it is another assertion of unbending faith.</seg>
<seg id="9">To keep your way.</seg>
<seg id="10">Always to keep your way.</seg>
<seg id="11">It doesn't depend on if you win or not.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because the players have to trust you.</seg>
<seg id="13">And if you change when you lose, they might think [differently].</seg>
<seg id="14">This is not good for them.</seg>
<seg id="15">They have to know that the manager has only one way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is Barcelona's approach and Garcia is certainly well-steeped in it.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I grew up with the Barcelona mentality and the Barcelona philosophy," he says, having played there between the ages of nine and 27.</seg>
<seg id="18">After retiring, following spells with Valencia and Espanyol, he returned to Barcelona to coach the Under-19s, ensuring the club's approach was passed down from old to young.</seg>
<seg id="19">Garcia's admiration for Cruyff is obvious, and understandably so, as part of his "Dream Team" of the early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="20">One of the amazing things I remember was before matches when he explained what he thought would happen in the game.</seg>
<seg id="21">The players, we thought it was crazy.</seg>
<seg id="22">But most of the time, it happened.</seg>
<seg id="23">Once when we played at the Bernabeu, he wanted us to leave one Real Madrid player alone, to let him take the ball and dribble until half-way.</seg>
<seg id="24">You will see he will give us the ball.</seg>
<seg id="25">And the first five times he got the ball, it happened.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="27">This unknowing opponent?</seg>
<seg id="28">I cannot say!</seg>
<seg id="29">Because Cruyff said he is not the best technical player.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is no surprise, then, what Garcia wants his Brighton team to do.</seg>
<seg id="31">My philosophy is to keep the ball, to try to have the ball, to pass the ball as many times as possible and to find the correct moment to score.</seg>
<seg id="32">We are trying to get the ball back as soon as possible, and higher up the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="33">Normally we try to do it in five seconds.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is tough, but it is one of the things we are working a lot on in the training sessions, a lot of the drills we are doing is for this, transition as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The best teams in the world, this is one of the things they control.</seg>
<seg id="36">This meant, during pre-season, sitting the players down with videos of Barcelona as well as those of Brighton's recent years, and replicating, as far as possible, the coaching drills he used at La Masia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Garcia knows that the transformation will not be immediate.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is not easy to change it overnight.</seg>
<seg id="39">The season, so far, has been difficult to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="40">Garcia's conversion job is rather harder than Guardiola's, and injuries have shredded the squad.</seg>
<seg id="41">Andrea Orlandi and Liam Bridcutt have started just one game each, Kemy Agustien and Kazenga LuaLua just four each.</seg>
<seg id="42">Craig Mackail-Smith has yet to get on the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="43">So, after Brighton's 1-1 draw with Watford on Monday night, they are 16th in the Championship, with three wins from 12 so far.</seg>
<seg id="44">Garcia, though, is absolutely certain that his approach is right, and that when everyone is fit Brighton will climb up the league.</seg>
<seg id="45">I know that this philosophy can win a lot of games.</seg>
<seg id="46">But we have a problem with injuries.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you see the stats after the game, you will see we have normally 60 per cent possession, a lot of chances, but we have three strikers injured and then it is difficult to score for us.</seg>
<seg id="48">We are proud that we have a different philosophy, a different mentality.</seg>
<seg id="49">For this, we are at the top of the stats in possession, in passing, in passing accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is good to see that we are at the top of these stats.</seg>
<seg id="51">Garcia's faith that his philosophy can flourish in the Football League is very reminiscent of Roberto Martinez, another Catalan coach just three months older than Garcia.</seg>
<seg id="52">Martinez, who started in League One, is now sixth in the Premier League and has an FA Cup winner's medal.</seg>
<seg id="53">Reminiscent of Martinez, Garcia believes that, even without the results, the spectacle is still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="54">Brighton's crowds are as high as ever - averaging 26,643 this season, the biggest in the division - proving to Garcia that his style is attractive.</seg>
<seg id="55">All the games that we play at home, we have full crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">This is the best answer.</seg>
<seg id="57">Because people here want to see our philosophy, they want to see good, attractive, offensive football.</seg>
<seg id="58">And we are not at the top of the table but we are at the top [of the attendance table] with a full crowd.</seg>
<seg id="59">Our crowd is always full.</seg>
<seg id="60">And it is not usually when you are 15th.</seg>
<seg id="61">It is the crowds and stadiums which have always fired Garcia's love for the English game and which now, through this difficult start, reaffirm his own faith.</seg>
<seg id="62">I am proud because our stadium is always full.</seg>
<seg id="63">This makes me feel good, like we are doing something good here.</seg>
<seg id="64">The Oscar goes to...</seg>
<seg id="65">Garcia's travels</seg>
<seg id="66">1973 Born in Sabadell, just outside Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="67">1992 Made his Barcelona debut.</seg>
<seg id="68">Won four titles, two cups and a Cup-Winners' Cup there.</seg>

<seg id="1">No UK cities meet government's superfast broadband target</seg>
<seg id="2">The nation's broadband continues to fall short of government targets with not a single UK town or city meeting the minimum "superfast" download speed of 24Mbps.</seg>
<seg id="3">Independent research from comparison site uSwitch found that Telford in Shropshire came closest to the 24Mbps goal with an average download speed of 23Mbps, whilst Belfast scored the highest for a capital city (20Mbps) and London trailed behind with an average speed of 17Mbps.</seg>
<seg id="4">Disparity in London was particularly pronounced, with almost a fifth of broadband users (19 per cent) hooked up to connections with a speed of less than 3Mbps.</seg>
<seg id="5">At this speed it would take six hours to download a BluRay film.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Urban speeds in the UK are around three times faster than rural speeds, but even download speeds in Britain's 50 biggest cities still aren't super-fast," said Marie-Louise Abretti, telecoms expert at uSwitch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recent research from Ofcom highlighted the fact that superfast broadband is available to almost three quarters of the country (73 per cent) but this new research indicates that faster speeds are being ignored because of lack of awareness and obstructive pricing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The study indicated that only a quarter of consumers (25 per cent) knew about the availability of upgrades, and that only half of these (52 per cent) considered the higher speeds affordable.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The Government's blinkered focus on bringing super-fast connections to 95% of Britain by 2017 is all very well but, if they pull it off, it's only half the battle won," said Abretti.</seg>
<seg id="10">If people don't actually use super-fast broadband because it's too expensive, or they don't know they can get it, then what's the point?</seg>
<seg id="11">The study found that the slowest connection speed for a major city in the UK was Hull, who recorded the lowest urban speeds (10Mbps) and made the least progress compared with tests in previous years.</seg>

<seg id="4">IT'S the month when the mo officially goes from daggy to fine and dandy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Movember starts today with organisers hoping 150,000 men around the country will take part in the hairiest of challenges, growing a moustache to raise money for and awareness of men's health issues.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the facial fuzz begins to sprout we've looked to our favourite celebs for inspiration.</seg>
<seg id="7">And with a little (not so barefaced) cheek we've helped some of them along in the soup-strainer style stakes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Check out the results below.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Australian-born Movember movement, which now operates in 21 countries, sees Mo Bros dump the razor for 30 days to sprout a Tash and collect some cash.</seg>
<seg id="10">In doing so they also become "walking billboards," raising awareness of men's health issues, particularly prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year 1.1 million participants worldwide raised $141.5 million, with 144,159 Aussies contributing $29.1 million to that total, organisers say.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it's hoped more Aussies than ever before will be involved this year and that the conversation of men's health will be heard around the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We are all about growth," says Movember country director Jeremy Macvean.</seg>
<seg id="14">Growth in moustaches, growth in numbers.</seg>

<seg id="2">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Internal Revenue Service warned on Thursday about a growing tax scam in which fraudsters display an IRS phone number on the intended victim's caller ID and demand money.</seg>
<seg id="3">Particularly targeting recent U.S. immigrants, the scammer typically tells the targets over the phone that they owe money to the IRS and demands payment via a pre-loaded debit card or wire transfer, the IRS said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The victim's caller ID displays an IRS toll-free number in a deception known as caller ID spoofing.</seg>
<seg id="5">For added effect, the scammers often add background noise on the call that sounds like an official call center.</seg>
<seg id="6">They may also send follow-up emails from a bogus IRS address.</seg>
<seg id="7">The IRS said there could be hundreds of instances of the scam operating nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="8">"If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and threatens police arrest, deportation or license revocation if you don't pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn't the IRS calling," said IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">We do not and will not ask for credit card numbers over the phone, nor request a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.</seg>
<seg id="10">People who think they have been deceived by a caller ID tax scam should contact the Federal Trade Commission, the IRS said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="3">No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="6">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gender" on their official documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.</seg>
<seg id="25">German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="33">And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">He was given female hormones at age 12.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found out was horrifying.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.</seg>
<seg id="58">Surgery rendered him infertile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigma."</seg>
<seg id="61">"A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'" she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid it will encourage intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law is about assigning it at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'</seg>
<seg id="78">This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.</seg>
<seg id="80">We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.</seg>
<seg id="83">It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears</seg>
<seg id="2">Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had "never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation," the Commission was told.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.</seg>
<seg id="6">He conceded the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management "from myself down" failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.</seg>
<seg id="12">Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.</seg>
<seg id="19">YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">The hearing adjourned until December 20.</seg>

<seg id="1">Michal Horáček presents his new double album, his band and three singers</seg>
<seg id="2">Songwriter Michal Horáček brought into the hall at Kolín’s Municipal Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but primarily in the programme Between Us, the singers Lenka Nová, František Segrado and Ondra Ruml, accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benko Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the opening intro and theatrical presentation about the musician being late, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers on stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of how he last played in Kolín and in the theatre and the whole town there was a power cut.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Otherwise, in Kolín they made two types of cards, which I came into contact with quite a lot," he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="5">Similarly, he mentioned President Zeman, a native.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Perhaps we could do a tour around Zákolany or Dúbravce near Bratislava," he joked about the native places of other presidents.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several times during the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage, and, when he was not talking, sat at a small table with a glass of wine, referred to his new musical act.</seg>
<seg id="8">Josef Mánes made the Calendar too, which put him; but at that time he didn’t know anything about ice hockey, how  we meet in those squares and chant "if you don’t jump you aren’t Czech".</seg>
<seg id="9">That’s the name of one of the songs on Czech Calendar too, but we won’t be playing it here for you today," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, Ondra Ruml sang from this record for him the reportedly very appropriate "Spát ve dne, zpívat po nocích" (Sleep during the day, sing at night), and accompanied himself on guitar.</seg>
<seg id="11">Otherwise, if he was not singing, he played percussion, all three singers were then accompanied by the band consisting of keyboard, cello, guitar and double bass.</seg>
<seg id="12">All three vocalists sang together the old song "Do stráně srdce usedá" (The heart melts into the mountainside), which enlivened the auditorium.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I’m glad you liked the song, which doesn’t surprise me in Kmoch’s town," Michal Horáček responded later.</seg>
<seg id="14">After recalling Peter Hapek, František Segrado played the song "Rozeznávám" (I distinguish), in the original by Richard Müller, and was rewarded with great applause; the song "Táta měl rád Lídu Baarovou" (Dad liked Lída Baarová) brought Hana Hegerová to mind, together with Horáček’s explanation about the Communist ban and replacement of Baarová with the American actress Mae West.</seg>
<seg id="15">The composer Michael Kocáb was recalled by the piece called Sebastian, and then Segrado sang an excellent song Prague, set to music by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zásmuky and a former Kolín resident.</seg>
<seg id="16">That was the end, however, a standing ovation and an encore in the form of the optimistic song "Žijeme v nádherné doběq" (We live in a wonderful time).</seg>
<seg id="17">There was one more encore on the playlist, but the fans did not applaud enough to get it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Almost immediately after the concert, all four sat at the table signing not just the Czech Calendar but also the older CDs, Michal Horáček signed his books and even the cover of the legendary LP and, if anyone wanted to, he had his photo taken with them.</seg>

<seg id="1">She moved from a villa to an apartment building.</seg>
<seg id="2">Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a rented villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful residential areas of Prague in Ořechovka.</seg>
<seg id="3">The original house owners, however, got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with little compensation.</seg>
<seg id="4">So Ivana looked for another accommodation quickly for herself and her already elderly mother.</seg>
<seg id="5">She got a tip from friends for a three room flat with kitchenette in an older apartment building on the other side of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="6">"At first it was a shock, but on the other hand, the view from the fourth flour of the vast forest park and reservoir impressed me," says Ivana, recalling her first impression.</seg>
<seg id="7">At first I told myself it would be a temporary arrangement for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We’ve been here now for over thirteen years and I wouldn’t change it, not just because of the gradual reconstruction," adds the owner.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mother and daughter moved at the time from a 120 m2 home to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and gave away practically all their furnishings.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was not an easy undertaking, the things were stored with friends and the gradual furnishing took almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new flat was in quite a good condition, but they had to carry out necessary repairs, for example varnishing doors and replacing the windows.</seg>
<seg id="12">The previous owner had knocked down the inner walls, but the new owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and excessively large hallway and, in contrast, the small bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="13">Joining the two rooms created a multifunctional living space.</seg>
<seg id="14">To define the separate zones and room divisions, the architects used plasterboard, which allowed repositioning of the lights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first action she decided to take after a couple of years was to remove the partition wall in the living room.</seg>
<seg id="16">This change the layout of the flat to a two-room flat with kitchenette, but it gave her an airy room from which opened up a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Another step to partial improvement of the standard was replacing the PVC flooring with laminate flooring.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ivana did not know what to do with the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="19">For years I was buying home design magazines looking for inspiration.</seg>
<seg id="20">In one of them I recently discovered an interesting completed project.</seg>
<seg id="21">On a recommendation, I approached a young female architect Kamila Douděrová.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was actually the most important step for the future," says Ivana.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was possible to adjust the layout of the hallway.</seg>
<seg id="24">The architect joined the spaces for the WC and the  bathroom and replaced the two hinged doors with one sliding door, which saved space.</seg>
<seg id="25">The bathroom is timeless and is also sufficiently barrier free.</seg>
<seg id="26">Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, and by the toilet there is a bidet.</seg>
<seg id="27">The successful collaboration with Kamila Douděrová continued on.</seg>
<seg id="28">As part of the TV programme Building a Dream, there was a quick but fundamental alteration of the living room, with the architect Martin Čeněk also taking part.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the space formed by joining the two smaller rooms, we had to get three functional areas – dining, living and sleeping – without the help of traditional principles for optical separation, such as semi partition walls and Japanese blinds.</seg>
<seg id="30">"That would in the end disrupt the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was possible to divide the sleeping and living areas in an original way.</seg>
<seg id="32">All it took was to put two sofas back to back and place a made-to-measure duvet cabinet between them.</seg>
<seg id="33">The dining area is defined by the colours of the floor and the walls.</seg>
<seg id="34">On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used high quality marmoleum tiles, and she brightened up the sliding doors with patterned wallpaper.</seg>
<seg id="35">If necessary, the kitchenette can be closed off with the papered sliding panels covered with wallpaper.</seg>
<seg id="36">Compared with the previous laminate floor, the new anti-allergy marmoleum floor has a number of advantages: a softer non-slip surface with no gaps and better sound insulation.</seg>
<seg id="37">The system of alcoves and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted in colour is an example of how you can work with space in an apartment building.</seg>
<seg id="38">I left the colourdesign to the architects, I wanted it to be cheerful.</seg>
<seg id="39">"I like orange colour, I had the same shade in my last flat," says Ivana.</seg>
<seg id="40">The graphic glass tiling with a blossoming magnolia motif is practical and creates a striking aesthetic element.</seg>
<seg id="41">The architects chose white for a warm energetic tone, which highlighted the modern functional style.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the small flat, they managed to store books also in the space under the window ledges.</seg>
<seg id="43">Everything is within reach, lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the altered interior, the contrast between the new and;old works beautifully, for example, the decades old crystal chandelier and the quality works of art which Ivana has been collecting all her life.</seg>
<seg id="45">Last in line came the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="46">The cupboards had previously been placed along both sides and the owner felt as ii she was in a tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="47">The architect reduced their number and rearranged their positioning.</seg>
<seg id="48">The simply designed furniture is custom made, the white surface softened by the slightly nacred finish.</seg>
<seg id="49">Thanks to imaginative design, a washing machine, dryer and dishwasher have been fitted into the small space.</seg>
<seg id="50">The appearance of the small kitchen is enlivened by the all-glass tiling above the work bench.</seg>
<seg id="51">The unique graphic glass with digitally printed motif is attractive and easy to keeps clean.</seg>

<seg id="1">More U.S. small businesses plan for employee health coverage: survey</seg>
<seg id="2">By Lewis Krauskopf</seg>
<seg id="3">Thu Oct 31, 2013 3:46pm EDT</seg>
<seg id="4">(Reuters) - The number of U.S. small businesses planning to start to offer health coverage for their employees next year slightly exceeds the number that expect to drop coverage, even as costs continue to rise, according to a survey released on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade organization, was designed as the first of a three-year look at how small businesses are adapting to President Barack Obama's healthcare law.</seg>
<seg id="6">The survey did not, however, ask respondents if they were being influenced in their plans to start coverage by the new law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many of the Affordable Care Act's important regulations begin next year, although a requirement that employers with at least 50 workers supply health coverage was delayed until 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">If employers follow through on their plans for next year, "the net proportion of them offering (health insurance) would rise, breaking a decade-old trend," said the report, which surveyed 921 businesses, with from two to 100 employees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Businesses reported their healthcare costs increased nearly 12 percent on average for this year, and said they responded by taking less profit and delaying business investment, according to the survey.</seg>
<seg id="10">Health insurance premiums averaged $6,271 a month for small businesses.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sixty-four percent paid more per employee for healthcare than the prior year, with 6 percent reporting a decline and the rest reporting no change.</seg>
<seg id="12">The survey did not ask for reasons behind the cost increases.</seg>
<seg id="13">About two-thirds of employers reported responding to the higher costs by taking lower profits, while 40 percent said they reduced or delayed business investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some also passed the costs onto employees: 37 percent froze or reduced wages and 30 percent raised the employee cost share for healthcare.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, 30 percent raised their selling prices as a response.</seg>
<seg id="16">"They are absorbing a lot of that internally right now, which results in less investment in the kinds of things one would hope would occur to expand the economy," William Dennis, the study's author and a senior fellow at the NFIB Research Foundation, told reporters in a briefing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study also found that 13 percent of businesses plan to cut the hours of part-time workers next year, but that at most half of those cuts related to the healthcare law.</seg>
<seg id="18">The law defines a full-time worker as one who works 30 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="19">Critics have said that businesses would cut hours of workers to avoid regulations.</seg>

<seg id="1">D.C. General: Crown jewel of the city's shameful housing crisis</seg>
<seg id="2">Brilliant party planning?</seg>
<seg id="3">Nope.</seg>
<seg id="4">Harsh reality at one of the nation's largest family homeless shelters.</seg>
<seg id="5">This Halloween bash was at D.C. General, the former hospital in Southeast where the city houses its homeless families.</seg>
<seg id="6">And because the staff members knew the kids couldn't go ringing doorbells at the jail or the STD clinic - the other neighbors in this lovely area - they gave the children their own private party.</seg>
<seg id="7">No one else would see them.</seg>
<seg id="8">And that's part of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">D.C. General is the crown jewel of the city's shameful housing calamity.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have created a small city with its own security force, a $13.8 million annual operating budget, a three-meals-a-day food program and about 150 full-time employees and 80 part-time employees.</seg>
<seg id="11">Population?</seg>
<seg id="12">Almost 300 families.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Nov.</seg>
<seg id="14">1, the number of people crammed into this out-of-site, out-of-mind shelter will start to swell.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's the start of hypothermia season, when the city is legally obligated to house the homeless.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last winter, there were about 600 children living at D.C. General.</seg>
<seg id="17">The problem could be even worse this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The District has projected that more than 500 families will find themselves newly homeless this winter.</seg>
<seg id="19">City officials say that's a 10 percent increase in homeless folks.</seg>
<seg id="20">Conditions are far better at D.C. General than they once were.</seg>
<seg id="21">Four years ago, homeless families were sleeping in the hallways and shivering in rooms with no heat and little bedding.</seg>
<seg id="22">The security guards were trading better rooms for sex.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was like an episode of "The Walking Dead," with fewer zombies.</seg>
<seg id="24">Since then, the sex-trading company has been fired and millions of dollars have gone toward improving the place.</seg>
<seg id="25">The walls are painted with bright colors and murals.</seg>
<seg id="26">There is a free health clinic and healthful meals in the cafeteria.</seg>
<seg id="27">None of this fixes the real problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">Our city is in the midst of a huge economic boom.</seg>
<seg id="29">But hundreds of kids get off the bus after school every day and walk past a jail to get to a cot in a closet-sized room they call home.</seg>
<seg id="30">They are the invisible homeless.</seg>
<seg id="31">For many people who work downtown, addicts panhandling on K Street or mentally ill folks pushing carts and ranting to themselves are the face of homelessness.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the invisible homeless - the kids with their backpacks, their moms serving you Harvest Pumpkin soup at Au Bon Pain or greeting you at their security post inside the lobby of your K Street office - are about the crisis of affordable housing in the District.</seg>
<seg id="33">How is it possible that we don't have the political will to help these families find a decent place to live?</seg>
<seg id="34">"This is what I know: D.C. residents will not tolerate children living in the street," said D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), a mayoral contender whose constituents slapped down a proposal for a small-scale family shelter in their neighborhood a few years ago like NIMBY ninjas.</seg>
<seg id="35">She doesn't want more shelters built, especially not in her Northeast ward, which residents say is super-saturated with group homes and other social services.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
<seg id="9">She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.</seg>
<seg id="11">An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.</seg>

<seg id="1">Indonesia Summons Australian Envoy on Spying Reports</seg>
<seg id="2">JAKARTA, Indonesia - Indonesia's Foreign Ministry summoned Australia's ambassador on Friday to respond to media reports that its embassy in Jakarta was used as part of a United States-led spying effort, saying such actions "were not acceptable" and had harmed its diplomatic relations with both countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Australian ambassador, Greg Moriarty, met with Indonesian officials on Friday morning following reports this week in the German news magazine Der Spiegel and The Sydney Morning Herald that the intelligence collection program was conducted from Australian embassies in China, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and East Timor, and from Australian high commissions - the equivalent of embassies among Commonwealth countries - in Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The purpose of the meeting was to seek clarification on the information about the facilities in the Australian Embassy in Jakarta," said Michael Tene, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman, "as well as to convey the message that if the information is true, such acts are not acceptable to the Indonesian government and run counter to the good relationship that exists between our two countries."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Afterward, Mr. Moriarty said: "From my perspective, it was a good meeting and now I have to go and report directly to my government," The Associated Press reported.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Wednesday, Kristen Bauer, the chargé d'affaires of the United States Embassy in Jakarta, and currently its ranking diplomat, was also summoned.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I can confirm that we have had a meeting with the Foreign Ministry," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said, declining further comment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Australia, a close ally of the United States, used its embassies in Asia to collect intelligence as part of the American National Security Agency's global surveillance efforts, according to a document leaked by the former agency contractor Edward J. Snowden and published in Der Spiegel.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Wednesday, Marty Natalegawa, the Indonesian foreign minister, issued a scathing response to the report, demanding an explanation from the U.S. Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It should be emphasized that if confirmed, such actions are not only a breach of security, but also a serious breach of diplomatic norms and ethics, and certainly not in tune with the spirit of friendly relations between our nations," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Indonesian Foreign Ministry issued a similarly pointed statement on Thursday in response to the report about the alleged involvement of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, calling it "totally unacceptable."</seg>
<seg id="12">The spying allegations come at a time when both Australia and the United States are enjoying close political and security relations with Indonesia, including conducting counterterrorism and military training exercises, and offering support for the Indonesian police.</seg>

<seg id="1">Si Shen: On rebuilding her games firm Papaya Mobile</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 00:03 By Neil Koenig Producer, Start-Up Stories</seg>
<seg id="3">Papaya Mobile's Si Shen talks about rebuilding her business after falling off Apple's platform</seg>
<seg id="4">Does the entrepreneurial spirit run in families?</seg>
<seg id="5">One company founder who thinks it might is Si Shen, of Papaya Mobile, which produces games for mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Si Shen was born and grew up in China.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her mother was a successful lawyer, but she was not satisfied with her lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whilst she was still a child, her family moved to Shenzhen in southern China, an area known as a hot spot of business activity, where her mother started a real estate enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="9">When she was growing up, Ms Shen says that like many other Chinese children she dreamt of becoming a scientist.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as she grew older and thought more deeply about what she wanted to do with her life, she began to have other ideas.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her mother's example influenced her heavily.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms Shen recalls that she read a lot of books, and one that made a big impact on her was The Road Ahead by Microsoft founder Bill Gates.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you believe what you are doing - just be persistent, anything can be overcome</seg>
<seg id="14">End Quote Si Shen Papaya Mobile</seg>
<seg id="15">He had a dream when he was really young, 'I want everybody to be able to have a computer, a personal computer on their desk.'</seg>
<seg id="16">And because of this dream, he changed the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">She remembers thinking: "That's so cool!"</seg>
<seg id="18">I want to do something like that!</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms Shen studied at the prestigious Tshingua University in Beijing, and subsequently at Stanford University in California.</seg>
<seg id="20">By this time she was certain she wanted to start a technology company.</seg>
<seg id="21">At a party she met a fellow graduate of Tshingua who had become a successful entrepreneur.</seg>
<seg id="22">He advised her that before starting something herself, she needed to gain some business experience first.</seg>
<seg id="23">Gaining experience</seg>
<seg id="24">Ms Shen applied for a post at Google but she never lost sight of her ultimate goal.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the interview she was asked what she expected to be doing in five years' time.</seg>
<seg id="26">She replied that she would not still be working for Google, saying "I'm going to be in China and I'm going to be working on my own company."</seg>
<seg id="27">She got the job.</seg>
<seg id="28">After working as a product manager for Google for several years, she left and returned to Beijing where she and a friend launched Papaya in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="29">They decided to concentrate on the mobile phone market.</seg>
<seg id="30">After trying various avenues, they settled on games as being a sector that showed particular promise.</seg>
<seg id="31">At the time in China there was a computer game called Happy Farm that was extraordinarily popular.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its success inspired Ms Shen and her colleagues to try to produce a similar game that could be played on mobile phones, such as Apple's iPhone.</seg>
<seg id="33">The game was called Papaya Farm and it proved to be a turning point.</seg>
<seg id="34">All of a sudden it went really, really popular - and we got millions of users.</seg>
<seg id="35">'I couldn't sleep'</seg>
<seg id="36">Things went well for the business until late 2009, when Ms Shen received a frantic call telling her that all the company's games had suddenly been removed from Apple's App Store.</seg>
<seg id="37">As this happened during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, she could not reach anyone at Apple to find out what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="38">The news could not have come at a worse time, because the start-up was trying to raise funds for expansion.</seg>
<seg id="39">Papaya Mobile</seg>
<seg id="40">Year founded: 2008</seg>
<seg id="41">HQ: Beijing, China</seg>
<seg id="42">Number of employees: 100</seg>
<seg id="43">Ownership: Private</seg>
<seg id="44">Annual sales: Not disclosed</seg>
<seg id="45">Our investors told us, 'If your products don't get back to the App Store, we're not going to give you the money.'</seg>
<seg id="46">"That was a very serious situation," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="47">I couldn't sleep because we have 15 employees.</seg>
<seg id="48">Everybody was looking at me every day.</seg>
<seg id="49">They were like, 'What are we going to do?' and I couldn't give them an answer.</seg>
<seg id="50">She decided to fly to the US, more specifically to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino in California, and spent the day waiting in the reception area.</seg>
<seg id="51">Eventually, she spoke to a company executive, who explained that there were some technical issues with Papaya's games.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Basically if we didn't change the whole infrastructure of our games, there was no way we could go back to iPhone," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="53">She was devastated.</seg>
<seg id="54">Her investors pulled out and she knew she had to do something fast.</seg>
<seg id="55">You have to have back-up</seg>
<seg id="56">She quickly decided to take the risk of moving Papaya's games to a different mobile phone system, Google's Android platform.</seg>
<seg id="57">She took the chance because although Android was just getting established at the time, she knew "it was going to be big."</seg>
<seg id="58">Her bet paid off.</seg>
<seg id="59">Papaya's games proved popular on phones running the Android system.</seg>
<seg id="60">Later, after making some technical changes, the company's games were allowed back on sale through Apple's App Store.</seg>
<seg id="61">Ms Shen says she learnt a lot from the episode, gaining a better understanding of how the business world works and the dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket.</seg>
<seg id="62">As a start-up, you cannot just rely on one platform, because one day if that platform tells you 'no', then you lose everything.</seg>
<seg id="63">You have to have back-up.</seg>
<seg id="64">She has also learned a lot about herself.</seg>
<seg id="65">Until then her whole business experience had been very smooth, and she had not known "the taste of failure."</seg>
<seg id="66">That taught me that no matter what happens, if you believe what you are doing - just be persistent, anything can be overcome.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jana Péťová: A step back.</seg>
<seg id="2">So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it isn’t actually about a step at all, but a big jump – a jump several years back, into memories of my childhood.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a memory of how it was, to have no worries and just come home from school and wash dishes, hoover, and do homework.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though these "chores" were mostly just a theory, my parents’ wishes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The practice was completely different – run home from school, throw my bag in a corner and run outside.</seg>
<seg id="6">Play ball games with other children, and hopscotch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then, during the TV series Helen and the Guys, embroider a festive cloth for grandma’s birthday using chain stitch.</seg>
<seg id="8">And only after several warnings finally wash the dishes, hoover, in winter carry the wood to the tiled stove and do homework under the lamplight once the sun had set (or rely on a classmate and instead of homework write love poetry addressed to your school sweetheart).</seg>
<seg id="9">In the morning eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the sort of jam they sell now, with contents that have not even been anywhere near a strawberry), and wash it down with tea from dried herbs, which we so gladly collected with mum.</seg>
<seg id="10">I also remember those magic evenings, when there was a deathly silence in the little room, when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio on tapes, which turned noisily in an old tape player from mum.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then we rewound those tapes with a pencil and put one song on again and again, our favourite, and drank soda water with it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Or we phoned each other across the table using tins which were tied together with string – and while we’re talking phones, so we could hear each other better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, and at the time our ear cleaners were matches and cotton wool.</seg>
<seg id="13">The minimum wage was over three times lower than it is now and my parents could live on it in such a way that we lacked nothing.</seg>
<seg id="14">We didn’t need any of those iPhones, iPads or even mobile phones and laptops or designer clothing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Clothes were handed down from generation to generation and the best "addition" to the wardrobe was a home-made tie-dyed T-shirt using SAVA dye.</seg>
<seg id="16">For electronics, we were happy with that tape recorder of mum’s and, at the most, a Walkman which I shared with my sister and which, by the way, we only used on the train on a school trip.</seg>
<seg id="17">We thought it was more interesting to play Flying Hats or Ludo with our aunt, or as I said before, "just" go outside.</seg>
<seg id="18">When I was a bit older, we got a video recorder under the Christmas tree, which my parents had clearly saved for for a long time, but unfortunately it did not last long with us.</seg>
<seg id="19">My younger sister stuffed a piece of strudel into it, apparently it eating the tapes so nicely, so she wanted to see if it would eat the strudel too.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately it did eat it, but it was its last mouthful.</seg>
<seg id="21">Well, the poor thing hears this story over and over again from dad to this day.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that when Lenka was little, she stuffed strudel in the video and thought that it would play a recipe and it didn’t play it, so to this day she doesn’t know how to bake it.</seg>
<seg id="23">I remember how we all managed to communicate together, to make arrangements without a mobile or computer.</seg>
<seg id="24">During the holidays at grandma’s, my sister and I agreed with the neighbour’s granddaughter when we would meet again the following year in summer at our grandmas’ houses – and that’s how it was, how it stood.</seg>
<seg id="25">We met.</seg>
<seg id="26">Do you promise to see someone in a year nowadays?</seg>
<seg id="27">I also remember winter, when we ran outside with the whole village, built snowmen, and rode bags stuffed with hay on the snowy hill by the church.</seg>
<seg id="28">Then the whole family ate dinner together and talked about the  last day.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, my sister and I would hear that infamous line before every evening meal: "Go and wash your hands!"</seg>
<seg id="30">Yes, it still applies today, but you definitely don’t have soap tied to the tap in the bathroom in a net for lemons.</seg>
<seg id="31">After dinner, when dad was "working" in the garage, having a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay on the floor with mum, propped our feet against the tiled stove, opened the little doors and looked at the flames, and listened to the crackle of wood, which drifted out of the stove.</seg>
<seg id="32">We were closer – really – we didn’t count the number of friends we had on social networks, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!</seg>
<seg id="33">We communicated together – we spoke – we didn’t write messages every day on various chat programs or text.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nothing like that existed, and despite that we knew far more about each other.</seg>
<seg id="35">And I could carry on like that for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is beautiful to remember, especially if I add to the memories by looking through an album, where there are neatly glued  black and white photos with black corners.</seg>
<seg id="37">And if by any chance I didn’t know how old I was then, the year the picture was taken is always written on the back of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="38">I see that although our pudding bowl haircuts didn’t really suit us, and our trousers were from our little cousin and two sizes too big, nobody used to laugh at us, it was normal like that (not in).</seg>
<seg id="39">And now I’d better return that step forward – to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">To 2013, and I’ll wait and see what the modern age will invent, perhaps one day for my children.</seg>
<seg id="41">What I do know is this, that my memories are now for the young adolescent generation at least "from the Stone Age" and I think they are missing out on a lot, that they won’t experience "the Stone Age" period too.</seg>
<seg id="42">I wish they could!</seg>

<seg id="2">A CURFEW in Nigeria's north has failed to stop days of ongoing violence and almost 100 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="3">A rescue services official says more than 98 people have died since Sunday after a trio of church bombings sparked reprisals in Kaduna state.</seg>
<seg id="4">A radical sect known as Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for attacks on churches in the cities of Zaria and Kaduna, setting off violence that eclipsed the original attacks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reprisals in the Nigerian flashpoint state highlight festering religious tensions in the West African nation of more than 160 million people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kaduna sits at the border between the country's predominantly Muslim north and its mainly Christian south.</seg>
<seg id="7">A history of attacks and counterattacks between the two communities there means that authorities are often cautious about releasing death figures.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officials initially said 21 people were killed in Monday's blasts, but now say the death toll has jumped to 98, including reprisal killings.</seg>
<seg id="9">They refused to give a breakdown clarifying who died in the initial blasts and who was killed in reprisals.</seg>
<seg id="10">As news of the church attacks filtered through the city on Monday, young Christians took to the streets in violent protest.</seg>
<seg id="11">An AP reporter saw smoke billowing over a mosque in a predominantly Christian part of the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">People mounted illegal roadblocks and were seen harassing motorists, while a motorcycle taxi rider lay seriously hurt and bleeding by the road side.</seg>
<seg id="13">Police said about 1,000 Muslims took refuge at police quarters.</seg>
<seg id="14">As soon as the state government relaxed the curfew on Tuesday, Muslims fought back.</seg>
<seg id="15">The violence then spread to both Muslim and Christian neighbourhoods beyond Kaduna to remote parts of the state, and prompting the government to re-impose a round-the-clock curfew.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency spokesman Abubakar Zakari Adamu said overnight that parts of the state continued to riot.</seg>

<seg id="1">Treasury considers tax raid on foreign property owners</seg>
<seg id="2">London's booming high-end property market - fuelled by cash-rich foreign investors - has been targeted by ministers for a new tax raid, as George Osborne tries to fill a £1.2bn hole in the public finances.</seg>
<seg id="3">The chancellor needs cash to fund two party conference spending commitments: the Liberal Democrats" £600m promise to give free school meals to all infants and the Tories" own £600m plan to reward marriage through the tax system.</seg>
<seg id="4">IN UK Politics & Policy</seg>
<seg id="5">Treasury officials are looking at ways to generate more revenue from the property boom in certain parts of London - an idea backed by Nick Clegg, Lib Dem leader, who has long favoured higher taxes on expensive properties.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Osborne's aides described as "speculation" Sky News reports that he may use his autumn statement in December to impose capital gains tax on foreign owners of British property.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain's taxation of foreign property owners is generous by international standards: while UK residents have to pay CGT when reselling all but their main home, non-resident property owners are exempt for all their properties.</seg>
<seg id="8">Treasury officials have long balked at the idea because of the practical complications; however the option is expected to be put to Mr Osborne as he prepares his statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">A UK-based buyer who purchased an investment property or second home for £1m and subsequently sold it for £5m would pay capital gains tax of £1.1m as a result, assuming they were a top-rate taxpayer.</seg>
<seg id="10">Foreign investors, by contrast, are currently exempt from CGT, but under the Treasury's plans would also owe the Exchequer £1.1m if they sold up.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tax advisers said it was unclear what mechanism would enforce payment of CGT by individuals who no longer had any link with the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rosalind Rowe, real estate tax partner at PwC, predicted "a lot of administration and hassle."</seg>
<seg id="13">A simpler option would be for Mr Osborne to increase the rate of stamp duty charged on the sale of expensive properties, which tend to be concentrated in Kensington & Chelsea and parts of Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last year, he increased to 7 per cent the stamp duty charged on the purchase of homes worth more than £2m and closed down loopholes that allowed buyers to avoid stamp duty by putting their homes into corporate "envelopes."</seg>
<seg id="15">David Cameron has vetoed previous attempts by the Lib Dems - supported by Mr Osborne - for an annual levy on the value of homes worth more than £2m, popularly described as a "mansion tax."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't think these measures are necessarily about controlling house prices, as tax is just one of the many reasons why overseas investment is attracted to London.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is much more about equality in the tax treatment of UK and non-UK investors</seg>
<seg id="18">Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills</seg>
<seg id="19">Last year's stamp duty rise has done nothing to subdue the wave of foreign investment in London property, which is increasingly being bought with cash by investors from countries such as China, Hong Kong and Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="20">More than £7bn of international cash was spent on prime London homes last year, figures from estate agent Savills show - a record high.as foreign investors look for safe havens for their assets.</seg>
<seg id="21">Figures from the Nationwide show London prices have risen by 10 per cent year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The capital's property market has received increasing attention from international investors seeking safe havens for their assets.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nearly three-quarters of new-build homes in central London were purchased by international buyers last year, the FT revealed this summer.</seg>
<seg id="24">More than a quarter of these buyers were from China and Hong Kong, outnumbering even the British buyers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The second-largest group of international buyers was from the rest of Asia.</seg>
<seg id="26">The proportion of homes being bought outright with cash hit an all-time high of more than a third of all purchases earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, Treasury officials believe the spike in prices for prime properties in central London is relatively self-contained and not a major driver of price inflation in the rest of the capital's housing market.</seg>
<seg id="28">Higher taxes on foreign buyers would not, according to that calculation, do much to depress house prices for ordinary families.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr Osborne is also being urged by some Tory MPs not to impose punitive taxation on foreign residents who want to own property in London.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Lots of countries would love to have this problem," said one adviser to David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, said: "I don't think these measures are necessarily about controlling house prices, as tax is just one of the many reasons why overseas investment is attracted to London."</seg>
<seg id="32">It is much more about equality in the tax treatment of UK and non-UK investors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said a CGT change would be "a logical move to level the playing field" but said it would have little impact on prices at the top end of the market.</seg>
<seg id="34">Property experts said the only realistic way for the government to take some heat out of the housing market would be to release more land for development.</seg>
<seg id="35">Three ways to get a slice of the property pound:</seg>
<seg id="36">Extend capital gains tax</seg>
<seg id="37">Imposing CGT on foreign buyers when they sell a property would allow the Treasury to tap into the booming London market, but could be complicated to administer.</seg>
<seg id="38">It would be a break from normal principles of taxation, which are based on residence.</seg>
<seg id="39">Raise stamp duty</seg>
<seg id="40">Last year, the chancellor raised the stamp duty rate for houses worth more than £2m to 7 per cent and closed loopholes.</seg>
<seg id="41">He could put up rates further: the new rate is raising big sums for the Treasury and sales show no sign of slowing.</seg>
<seg id="42">Bring in other taxes</seg>
<seg id="43">Labour and Liberal Democrats favour a "mansion tax" levy on homes worth more than £2m.</seg>
<seg id="44">David Cameron has vetoed such a tax, fearing it would hit Tory supporters (and donors).</seg>
<seg id="45">He also opposes a new top council tax band for expensive homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama's Health Care Walk Back</seg>
<seg id="2">Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."</seg>
<seg id="3">With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">Addressing what he called the "flurry in the news" about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You're going to get a better deal," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone "miserably" since October.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am eager to earn your confidence back.</seg>
<seg id="14">An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia, Ukraine halt giant Antarctic marine sanctuary plan: group</seg>
<seg id="2">SYDNEY (Reuters) - Russia and the Ukraine on Friday again scuttled plans to create the world's largest ocean sanctuary in Antarctica, pristine waters rich in energy and species such as whales, penguins and vast stocks of fish, an environmentalist group said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources wound up a week-long meeting in Hobart, Australia, considering proposals for two "marine protected areas" aimed at conserving the ocean wilderness from fishing, drilling for oil and other industrial interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It seems pretty clear that a small group of countries led by Russia wanted to wreck the agreement," Steve Campbell, director of the Antarctic Ocean Alliance which campaigns for protecting the Antarctic seas, said by phone from London.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the sanctuary proposals to pass, they need backing from all 200 delegates from 25 member countries, many of which have conflicting interests.</seg>
<seg id="6">Russia and Ukraine also actively blocked the two proposals in July, with China withdrawing support for one.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a dark day not just for the Antarctic, but for the world's oceans," Andrea Kavanagh, director of the independent Pew Charitable Trusts' Southern Ocean sanctuaries project, said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tony Fleming, director of the Australian Antarctic Division, hoped for a more favorable outcome the next time the proposals are discussed next year.</seg>
<seg id="9">"If we work with members throughout the year, I believe we can bring a proposal back to next year's meeting which will hopefully achieve consensus," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">He did not elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="11">Antarctica is home to more than 10,000 species including most of the world's penguins, whales, seabirds, colossal squid and Antarctic tooth fish.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is considered one of the least altered marine ecosystems and provides a global reference point for assessing the consequences of climate change.</seg>
<seg id="13">"While many other marine ecosystems in other parts of the world have been devastated by development, pollution, mining and over-fishing, many of Antarctica's ocean habitats remain intact with all of their predator species still thriving," the Antarctic Ocean Alliance says on its website.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Do his phone,' Murdoch editor told journalist hunting celebrity scoop</seg>
<seg id="2">By Michael Holden</seg>
<seg id="3">LONDON (Reuters) - Andy Coulson, then editor of Rupert Murdoch's News of the World, instructed a journalist working on a story about a celebrity to "do his phone," a jury trying Coulson and others for phone-hacking was told on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The trial also heard that Murdoch's British newspaper arm, News International, appeared to have given incomplete information to lawyers carrying out an internal inquiry in 2007 which gave the now-defunct paper a "clean bill of health."</seg>
<seg id="5">Coulson and fellow ex-editor Rebekah Brooks are the two most high-profile figures among eight defendants in the dock on various charges related to phone-hacking, illegal payments to officials for stories, and hindering police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="6">They all deny the charges.</seg>
<seg id="7">After leaving the News of the World, Coulson went on to be Prime Minister David Cameron's media chief, while Brooks, a close confidante of Murdoch and a friend of Cameron, rose to be chief executive of News International.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Old Bailey, England's Central Criminal Court, heard that in May 2006, the paper was planning to run an exclusive story about the private life of Calum Best, the son of former Manchester United soccer star George Best.</seg>
<seg id="9">During an email exchange with Ian Edmondson, a former senior journalist who is also on trial, Coulson discussed whether Best might leak the story to others.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Do his phone," Coulson wrote in an email shown to the jury.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the jurors they would have to weigh up what he meant.</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier, the court heard that News of the World phone-hacking targets included England soccer star Wayne Rooney, actors Jude Law and Sienna Miller, and Tom Parker Bowles, the son of Prince Charles's second wife Camilla.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other victims included David Blunkett and Tessa Jowell, both ministers in the then Labour government, and Milly Dowler, a schoolgirl who went missing in 2002 and was later found murdered.</seg>
<seg id="14">The disclosure that Dowler's phone had been hacked while she was still missing caused widespread public disgust in the summer of 2011, prompting Murdoch to close down the 168-year-old paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Phone-hacking first hit the headlines in 2007 when the paper's former royal editor Clive Goodman was convicted of tapping the phones of royal aides.</seg>
<seg id="16">Goodman is now on trial accused with Coulson of making illegal payments to police.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court heard Goodman had emailed Coulson in January 2003 asking him to approve a 1,000-pound ($1,600) cash payment to a royal protection officer for a "Green Book" which contained private numbers of the royal household and was later used to hack some of their phones.</seg>
<seg id="18">"These people will not be paid in anything other than cash because if they're discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal charges, as could we," the email shown to the jury said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Coulson replied: "This is fine."</seg>
<seg id="20">One of the stories which emerged from phone-hacking carried out for Goodman by private investigator and convicted hacker Glenn Mulcaire was the allegation Prince Harry had been helped by an aide with an exam while at the Sandhurst military academy.</seg>
<seg id="21">Goodman justified to bosses his use of cash payments to royal protection officers by saying they had helped with stories about Princes William and Harry and about Kate Middleton, William's then girlfriend who is now his wife.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm not going to put it in writing but any paper or computer trail that leads to them or their families will put them, me, you and the editor in jail," he wrote in an email.</seg>
<seg id="23">Goodman was sacked from the paper after his conviction and he launched a complaint of unfair dismissal which led to News International hiring the Harbottle & Lewis law firm to carry out an internal inquiry to see how far the criminality went.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It seems Harbottle & Lewis did not seem to have the whole truth for whatever reason," prosecutor Edis told the jury.</seg>
<seg id="25">Harbottle & Lewis gave a letter to News International which effectively gave them a clean bill of health.</seg>
<seg id="26">"You might wonder why they did that," Edis told the jury.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, the court heard the dramatic revelation that Brooks and Coulson had been having an affair for six years from 1998 at the time journalists on the News of the World were hacking phones.</seg>
<seg id="28">The prosecution say their close relationship and the fact they were paying Mulcaire large sums when the paper was cutting costs indicated they knew hacking was taking place and was crucial to the pursuit of scoops.</seg>
<seg id="29">The trial is expected to last six months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why We'll Miss Tim McCarver</seg>
<seg id="2">Boston Globe</seg>
<seg id="3">Wednesday night marked the end of a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was the end of a rather dreary baseball season (albeit one capped by a remarkable October).</seg>
<seg id="5">And it was the end of - as Fox would not stop insisting - the Red Sox's 95-year streak of not clinching a World Series victory at Fenway Park.</seg>
<seg id="6">But more meaningfully it was the apparent end of the broadcasting career of Tim McCarver, the once-beloved analyst who forever changed the way we watch and think about the game, but who also happened to spend, oh, the past decade as the biggest internet punchline in baseball broadcasting (non-Joe-Morgan division).</seg>
<seg id="7">Whenever a sports-media luminary who lost his fastball - and, yes, McCarver was a catcher, so please excuse the mixed baseball metaphor - finally calls it quits, there follows a flood of stories about how he was once really quite good, and how it's a shame that he stopped preparing as extensively as he once did, and stopped seeing the game with the keenness he once had.</seg>
<seg id="8">Amazin" Avenue recently dug up some old footage from McCarver's early days on New York Mets broadcasts in the 1980s, and concluded that he was "miles better than the crimes against broadcasting he'd eventually commit for FOX."</seg>
<seg id="9">Had he not wound up in his pure color-commentary-providing sidekick role, the author theorizes, we all might have found him less grating.</seg>
<seg id="10">Audiences eventually tire of any voice, especially one like McCarver's, which had a droning quality to it, his vowels stretching out longer than the late-afternoon shadows in every Saturday Fox game.</seg>
<seg id="11">But his voice was, in the same way Vin Scully's still is, baseball.</seg>
<seg id="12">He came from western Tennessee and had an accordingly plainsy twang that represented the vast middle of the country - neither north nor south, east nor west - from where so many of baseball's heroes emerged.</seg>
<seg id="13">And McCarver, who started at Fox in 1996 when the network first picked up baseball, never stopped working hard.</seg>
<seg id="14">His colleague Ken Rosenthal noted that McCarver would arrive at the ballpark five hours before first pitch to pepper managers, producers and assistants with questions about the relevant teams.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among all the criticism of McCarver over the years, I hardly recall anyone accusing him of cluelessness about a particular ballclub.</seg>
<seg id="16">No, the knock against McCarver was that he had frozen himself in a different era, spouting baseball wisdom uninfluenced by years of new sabermetric knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="17">That criticism was fair.</seg>
<seg id="18">(OK, all of that, and the fact that he loved dopey lines.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here is one of his dopiest, in all its glory.)</seg>
<seg id="20">He was the thinking fan's announcer in the decade before Bill James and Baseball Prospectus redefined what it meant to be a thinking baseball fan.</seg>
<seg id="21">As we learned more about, say, how much a great defensive player could help his team, or about how many runs a leadoff walk would likely yield - which is to say, as outside researchers dynamited the gnosis that once belonged solely to ex-players and managers - McCarver's insights started to seem hollower and hollower.</seg>
<seg id="22">The technocracy had no place for a mystic.</seg>
<seg id="23">Whomever Fox chooses to replace him, he'll be speaking to a shrinking, aging, pickier crowd, one that demands far more insight and wit than baseball announcers have historically provided.</seg>
<seg id="24">Good luck to him, especially on account of the annually increasing length of the games Fox tends to cover.</seg>
<seg id="25">McCarver took a lot of flak for his digressions, for repeating himself, for stating the obvious - but I wonder if all that was his method of refusing to acknowledge the disappointing recent contraction of baseball in American culture.</seg>
<seg id="26">He carried on like there were legions of new or casual fans tuning in, when there weren't.</seg>
<seg id="27">He thought of himself as an ambassador for baseball, a friendly voice to play over the game.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Fairness, accuracy, and honesty have always been my goals, along with teaching you something you may not have known about this great game," he said, in a short send-off after Boston's celebration and all kinds of interviews and press conferences.</seg>
<seg id="29">And despite all the grief McCarver got for his longwindedness, his last word on Fox, after Buck said he loved him and enjoyed working with him, was simply "Ditto."</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks, Tim.</seg>
<seg id="31">May you remain a real man.</seg>

<seg id="1">Driver cited for wearing Google Glass expects to fight ticket</seg>
<seg id="2">LOS ANGELES - An early adopter of Google's Internet-connected eyeglasses plans to fight a citation for wearing the device while driving in San Diego, saying the technology makes navigation easier than smartphones and GPS devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">Driver Cecilia Abadie was pulled over for speeding Tuesday evening, when a California Highway Patrol officer noticed she was wearing Google Glass and tacked on a citation usually given to drivers who may be distracted by a video or TV screen.</seg>
<seg id="4">A challenge to what may be a first-of-its-kind citation could force authorities to re-examine laws and consider how best to regulate evolving gadgetry that will one day become mainstream.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lightweight eyeglasses, which are not yet widely available to the public, feature a hidden computer and a thumbnail-size transparent display screen above the right eye.</seg>
<seg id="6">Users can scan maps for directions -- as well as receive web search results, read email and engage in video chats -- without reaching for a phone.</seg>
<seg id="7">About 10,000 have been distributed so far in the United States to "explorers" like Abadie, and this week Google announced another 30,000 would be available for $1,500 apiece.</seg>
<seg id="8">Abadie, a software developer, got what she describes as the life-changing technology in May.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview Thursday, she said she was not using her Google Glass when she was pulled over for allegedly going about 80 mph in a 65 mph zone on the drive home to Temecula after visiting a friend.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The Glass was on, but I wasn't actively using it" to conserve the battery, she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The device becomes inactive if it's not asked to perform a task.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abadie expressed surprise that wearing the glasses while driving would be illegal and said she's "pretty sure" she will fight the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="13">First, she said, she needs to seek legal counsel.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the flurry of online commentary her traffic stop has generated, several people saying they are attorneys offered their services.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The law is not clear, the laws are very outdated," Abadie said, suggesting that navigating with the device could be less distracting than with a GPS unit or phone because drivers don't have to glance down.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Maybe Glass is more a solution to the cellphone problem than a problem," she said.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's unclear whether a citation for Google Glass has been issued before.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CHP said it is not sure whether an officer within its own ranks has written one, and an agency spokesman pointed out hundreds of law enforcement agencies in California alone can write traffic tickets.</seg>
<seg id="19">What is clear, CHP Officer Marc Hale said, is that drivers should not use Google Glass.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Anything that takes your attention away from the motoring public in front of you is a distraction," Hale said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Though Google Glass users can continue looking ahead, by glancing at the screen they still divert attention from the roadway and that can make the headgear dangerous, according to David Strayer, director of the University of Utah's Center for the Prevention of Distracted Driving.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Your eyes aren't looking where they need to look," said Strayer, who has tried Google Glass (though not behind the wheel).</seg>
<seg id="23">Like Abadie, he noted that the law lags far behind the technology.</seg>
<seg id="24">Legislators in at least three states -- Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia -- have introduced bills that would specifically ban driving with Google Glass.</seg>
<seg id="25">A spokesman for Google did not reply to a request for comment.</seg>
<seg id="26">On its website, Google says this about using the headgear while driving: "Read up and follow the law."</seg>
<seg id="27">Above all, even when you're following the law, don't hurt yourself or others by failing to pay attention to the road.</seg>

<seg id="1">JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the edge</seg>
<seg id="2">It is almost a rule that in key moments of the country, the head of state was not in the right condition to fulfil his duty as head of state.</seg>
<seg id="3">If Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to the end of his presidential term and the events surrounding Munich would have taken place somewhat differently.</seg>
<seg id="4">We probably would not have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could have flown beyond the borders, heavy weapons could have been destroyed and the government could have fled to London immediately and would not have to fight there so hard for its legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="5">And most importantly, the nation would not have a hangover from that surrender until now.</seg>
<seg id="6">Beneš was no statesman and after Munich he was still in a good shape, but during the war he started going downhill and in February 48 he acted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Had he been slightly better, he could have gone into exile for a third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.</seg>
<seg id="8">And where to begin with Hácha?</seg>
<seg id="9">He was chosen with the proviso that "the President will not get into a situation where he would have to make a decision."</seg>

<seg id="11">In the last days of March 1939, intelligence chief František Moravec said everything that needed to be done so that the occupation, which he knew about exactly to the day, would not go so smoothly or with such gain.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid</seg>
<seg id="2">Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.</seg>
<seg id="11">A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy," Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.</seg>
<seg id="13">"No," Mr Tripodi replied.</seg>
<seg id="14">I can't remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn't that.</seg>
<seg id="15">Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid.</seg>

<seg id="2">NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. decision to allow greater use of electronic devices on flights is "another favorable tailwind" for Gogo Inc., the internet provider for 80 percent of the U.S. commercial aircraft fleet, its chief executive told Reuters on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">For some obese people, surgery beats other options</seg>
<seg id="2">By Kathryn Doyle</seg>
<seg id="3">NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Diet, exercise, therapy and drugs can help obese people get healthier.</seg>
<seg id="4">But weight-loss surgery does a better job of getting rid of extra pounds and treating type 2 diabetes, a new review of past studies shows.</seg>
<seg id="5">The studies only followed people for two years.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's possible the results would look different further down the line, the authors write.</seg>
<seg id="7">So-called bariatric surgery, like gastric bypass or gastric banding, reduces the size of the stomach so patients can only eat small amounts of food.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many doctors have noted the dramatic weight loss that often results.</seg>
<seg id="9">But it wasn't obvious how surgery stacks up against traditional diet and exercise strategies.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new review included 11 studies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Each study randomly chose some obese people to have surgery and others to make diet or lifestyle changes instead, for instance.</seg>
<seg id="12">Together those studies included close to 800 people.</seg>
<seg id="13">Participants in the bariatric surgery groups lost an average of 57 more pounds than those in the non-surgery groups.</seg>
<seg id="14">Average weight loss ranged from 45 to 100 pounds among those who had surgery.</seg>
<seg id="15">More people who had type 2 diabetes saw their blood sugar levels fall into the normal range after surgery than after a different intervention.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Although they try to look at a range of medical conditions, in reality the real importance is the effect of weight loss on diabetes and the relative effectiveness of non-surgical versus surgical approaches," said Dr. Paul O'Brien.</seg>
<seg id="17">O'Brien is an obesity specialist who pioneered the Lap-Band procedure in Australia in 1994.</seg>
<seg id="18">He founded the Centre for Obesity Research and Education at Monash University in Melbourne and was not involved in the new review.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The clear and consistent message is the bariatric surgical procedures achieve a much better outcome," O'Brien said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bariatric surgery will certainly help obese people with diabetes better control the disease and may put it into remission entirely, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Given that there are probably in excess of 300 million people across the world with type 2 diabetes and maybe half of these are obese, this opens up huge possibilities for better health," O'Brien told Reuters Health.</seg>
<seg id="22">But two years isn't really enough time to judge the results.</seg>
<seg id="23">And the analysis included small numbers of studies and patients, Viktoria L. Gloy from University Hospital Basel in Switzerland and colleagues note in the journal BMJ.</seg>
<seg id="24">Longer-term studies, cost-effectiveness studies and comparisons between different surgeries are still missing, O'Brien said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The authors did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.</seg>
<seg id="26">Surgery is typically recommended for people with a body mass index - a measure of weight in relation to height - of at least 40, or at least 35 if they also have co-occurring health problems such as diabetes or severe sleep apnea.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I think an important point to consider is that most of the studies suggest that bariatric surgery combined with intensive lifestyle management is superior to lifestyle management alone," said Dr. Richdeep Gill.</seg>
<seg id="28">He is a general surgeon at the University of Alberta in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">Generally people who undergo weight-loss surgery must try lifestyle changes like diet and exercise first before going under the knife.</seg>
<seg id="30">So it may not be an either/or choice for most obese people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Gill, who studies bariatric surgery, was not involved in the review.</seg>
<seg id="32">Patients need to be informed about the risks of surgery, he told Reuters Health.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the National Institutes of Health, gastric bypass surgery carries risks of allergic reactions to anesthesia, blood clots, breathing problems, heart attack, stroke or infection.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the review, 15 percent of people in the surgery groups had anemia from low iron levels post-surgery and 8 percent needed a second operation.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's impossible to say how serious those additional surgeries were.</seg>
<seg id="36">But second surgeries are always more difficult than the first, Gill said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Post-surgery, patients must stick to a special diet for life and often have to avoid some common medications like aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Tackling obesity is a challenging issue, and the patient needs to be committed to their own management strategy," Gill said.</seg>
<seg id="39">Only then, with consultation of a multidisciplinary care team, will surgery be considered as an option.</seg>

<seg id="3">Bagels and coffee?</seg>
<seg id="4">Gwyneth Paltrow, 41, is the epitome of Hollywood royalty and class, and to think of People magazine's Most Beautiful Woman in sweats on Christmas morning is the last image that would come to mind.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in the December issue of Red Magazine, on sale Nov.</seg>
<seg id="6">6, Paltrow tells the magazine that Dec.</seg>
<seg id="7">25 is about as low key as it gets.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We spend all day in pajamas having bagels and coffee and sitting around and then I cook and I change," she revealed.</seg>
<seg id="9">With that said, for Christmas Eve and Christmas night, all bets are off and it's the exact opposite experience.</seg>
<seg id="10">Read: Gwyneth Paltrow on Ups and Downs of Marriage</seg>
<seg id="11">"Christmas Eve is the rehearsal dinner," she said. "I usually make something very different, like I'll do an Italian Christmas Eve with seven fishes and sometimes a custom from another country.</seg>
<seg id="12">We don't do Christmas lunch, we do dinner - like an early 5 p.m. dinner - and I make turkeys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Paltrow added that the morning in PJs is the only casual element of the holiday, as she, husband Chris Martin and the kids - Apple and Moses - all dress up for dinner with only the classiest sound track playing in the background.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We are very into the Frank Sinatra Christmas album," she said. "We had it my whole childhood, we always have that going."</seg>
<seg id="15">That's more like it!</seg>
<seg id="16">She describes the scene of Christmas dinner as covered in tones of white lights and silver bows - like something out of a family movie.</seg>

<seg id="18">"My [mom] has these amazing candle holders from Germany that you clip on and light real candles," she said. "It's beautiful, but quite a fire hazard - we only light them when we are sitting there."</seg>
<seg id="19">And even though Paltrow is moving back to Los Angeles from London to be closer to friends, this Christmas will be a "Brit Christmas," and she added the move back to California will only be for a few years.</seg>
<seg id="20">Especially with Apple and Moses getting close to that double-digit age range.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't want them to be teenagers in LA.</seg>
<seg id="22">"No way," she said. "I'm looking at this like two years, three years tops, then we will go back."</seg>
<seg id="23">Looks like bagels and coffee in London for years to come.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sobotka negotiating for ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="2">Social democracy is crumbling; the Christian Democrats and Babiš’s ANO are holding talks and planning a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="3">If the Social Democrats can pull themselves together in several weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly well coordinated partners, who will bring to the table a completed list of demands including ministerial posts.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ČSSD envoys will then either eat up the sour coalition grapes or give a nod to an unstable minority government.</seg>
<seg id="5">After four days being carried on a wave of sympathy, Bohuslav Sobotka got into hot water for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="6">He failed yesterday to gain control over the political board and most importantly to persuade the confirmed liars to resign.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far he is the only confirmed negotiator for the party; the other members of the team will only be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).</seg>
<seg id="8">I have apologised to members of the board and now to the citizens as well.</seg>
<seg id="9">We shouldn’t lie, in our private lives or in public.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after a meeting of the Social Democrats’ senior leadership.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added that he would not be clinging to the first deputy chairman post.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I’ll announce my decision on 10 November at the Central Executive Committee," said Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="13">Deputy chairman of ČSSD Zdeněk Škromach and head of the parliamentary club Jeroným Tejc said something similar.</seg>
<seg id="14">He did point out, however, that he had only been elected two days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both MPs then declared that they would do everything so that the 50-member ČSSD club would speak in one voice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Michal Hašek crowned this absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of ČSSD for 15 years. I have always been loyal to the brand and respected the decisions of party authorities."</seg>
<seg id="17">In other words, another lie broadcast live.</seg>
<seg id="18">Or perhaps with the call for Sobotka’s resignation and his exclusion from the negotiating team he forgot that the August CEC, with 57 per cent majority, agreed to Bohuslav Sobotka being the party’s candidate for prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="19">The ČSSD head has however made himself a powerful army of enemies by only convening the CEC for the next Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="20">His opponents have ten days to flood with emails the 192 members of this body and the media with a whole load of gossip and rumours, or to remind them of the real mistakes in Sobotka’s political career.</seg>
<seg id="21">Dirty laundry will be washed strongly, with the dark signs of the alliance appearing between the coal baron Zdeňek Bakala and Sobotka’s wing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Disputes will bubble up in the South Moravian and Moravian-Silesian organisation of ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Ostrava mayor and Sobotka's ally Petr Kajnar issued these words of warning: "I've signed Charter 77 so that the country wouldn’t be ruled by idiots."</seg>
<seg id="25">If the CEC were to meet this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice ritually their posts.</seg>
<seg id="26">The traitors will put on their sackcloth and ashes and remain. put</seg>
<seg id="27">And then the currently winning head of ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuing fall in the number of orders and a lack of state interest to address the problem of capital construction since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement of the New Green for Savings programme was a positive sign for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in the individual regions.</seg>

<seg id="2">Study in the journal Sage Open found 40 per cent of sufferers left-handed</seg>
<seg id="3">Other mental illnesses were at just 10 per cent, same as general population</seg>
<seg id="4">Famous lefties include Prince William, Barack Obama and David Cameron</seg>
<seg id="5">By Fiona Macrae, Science Correspondent</seg>
<seg id="6">Left-handed people have a "strikingly higher" chance of suffering from schizophrenia, research suggests.</seg>
<seg id="7">A study revealed left-handers accounted for 40 per cent of those with the mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, only around 10 per cent of the general population is left-handed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Famous left-handers: Prince William, left, and Barack Obama.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is also seen as a sign of greatness</seg>
<seg id="11">It is thought that the changes in the brain that make people left-handed may also contribute to schizophrenia.</seg>
<seg id="12">Famous left-handers include Prince William, Barack Obama, David Cameron, Sir Paul McCartney, Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-handers are more likely to develop psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, than mood disorders, research suggests (posed by model)</seg>
<seg id="14">Several US presidents have also written with their left hand, including George Bush Snr and Bill Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ronald Reagan is said to have been ambidextrous.</seg>
<seg id="16">Four of the five original designers of the Macintosh computer were left-handed, as were one in four Apollo astronauts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researcher Jadon Webb, of Yale University, US, said: "Our results show a strikingly higher prevalence of left-handedness among patients presenting with psychotic disorders."</seg>
<seg id="18">In contrast, just 10 per cent of those being treated for bipolar disorder or depression were left-handed - a figure much more in line with the rate of left-handedness in the general population.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nick Craddock, a psychiatrist at Cardiff University, said: "This link between handedness and psychosis builds on previous work that seeks to understand how the development and connections within the brain help us better understand schizophrenia."</seg>
<seg id="20">That is an important prelude to developing better treatments.</seg>
<seg id="21">The study, published in the journal Sage Open, could also help remove some of the stigma surrounding the illness.</seg>
<seg id="22">Professor Craddock added: "It also serves to highlight that severe psychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia have a very real physical basis in the brain and body and are not just "all in the mind.""</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the link, most schizophrenics are not left-handed - and most people who are left-handed do not develop schizophrenia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Independent minds?</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr Cameron may be left-handed but Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, left, is not</seg>
<seg id="26">Some argue that the dominance of lefties in the top is simply a coincidence and the numbers will even out over time.</seg>
<seg id="27">Others claim left-handedness is associated with greater levels of creativity and skill - a disproportionate number of gifted artists, musicians and sportsmen are left-handed.</seg>
<seg id="28">Or it could simply be that living in a right-handed world means left-handers get used to fighting for their rights from an early age.</seg>
<seg id="29">The proportion of left-handers in Britain as a whole has risen fourfold in the past 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around 13 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women are now left-handed, compared to just 3 per cent of those born before 1910.</seg>
<seg id="31">Experts say the rise can be partly explained by a growing acceptance of left-handedness.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the 18th and 19th centuries it was regarded as a handicap and teachers would try to beat it out of their pupils, or tie their hand behind their back to train them to use their "correct" hand.</seg>

<seg id="2">Roy Harvey House at 157 Ann Street, which was sold by the CBIC for $40 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Glenn Hunt</seg>
<seg id="4">Strategic commercial property investment has been credited with delivering Brisbane's "future fund" a $28.4 million net profit last financial year.</seg>
<seg id="5">The City of Brisbane Investment Corporation report, tabled at this week's council meeting, revealed a solid 14.64 per cent return on the fund's investments, up from a 10 per cent return achieved in the 2011/12 financial year.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the Labor opposition has again decried the fund an underperformer, saying the $6 million in paid dividends was a poor return on a total asset pool of $216 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said CBIC's property portfolio achieved strong growth in both income and capital value.</seg>
<seg id="8">"CBIC outperformed the average total return of other direct property investment funds in Australia, which achieved 9.1 per cent in the same period," Cr Quirk wrote on the report.</seg>
<seg id="9">The benefit of CBIC's return has also provided Brisbane City Council with a $6 million dividend, which was paid at the end of the 2013 financial year.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was used to deliver more services to the residents of Brisbane.</seg>
<seg id="11">Opposition Leader Milton Dick said the annual dividend dropped by 40 per cent on the previous financial year.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The dividend reduced from $10 million to just $6 million this year," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the LNP Administration set up CBIC, they gifted the group with property and cash all paid for by ratepayers of Brisbane.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The CBIC is holding $238 million worth of assets owned by Brisbane's ratepayers; $6 million is a very poor return on such a high value of assets.""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cr Dick also attacked a 15.7 per cent pay rise to CBIC directors, including chairman Mark Brodie, whose son Matt Brodie was an unsuccessful council candidate for Cr Quirk's Liberal National Party team at the last council election.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The only people making money out of CBIC are the directors, whose pay went from $242,000 to $280,000," Cr Dick said."</seg>
<seg id="17">Cr Quirk attributed the rise in part to an existing director vacancy being filled from 2011/12 and to a 4 per cent rise in directors fees and salaries.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fund had performed strongly since 2009, despite volatile economic conditions, the Lord Mayor said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Among the commercial and industrial properties owned by the CBIC are office development Green Square Close in Fortitude Valley, the Rivergate Shipyard in Murarrie, the South Regional Business Centre in Yeerongpilly and industrial properties in Cullen Avenue, Eagle Farm, and Industrial Avenue, Wacol.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the time the report was released, 157 Ann Street, which acted at the Lord Mayor's temporary base while restoration works at City Hall were undertaken, was sold by CBIC for $40 million.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Mr Brodie said the board continued to favour commercial investments in a market where "business sentiment still remains subdued and economic returns for other asset classes has only recently shown signs of recovery.""</seg>
<seg id="22">Cr Quirk said since its inception under the Newman administration in 2009, CBIC had:</seg>
<seg id="23">increased its total assets by over 57 per cent from $137.6 million to over $216.4 million;</seg>
<seg id="24">made a return of over 10 per cent each year it has been in operation;</seg>
<seg id="25">14.64 per cent return in 2012/13;</seg>
<seg id="26">10.04 per cent return in 2011/12;</seg>
<seg id="27">12.48 per cent return in 2010/11;</seg>
<seg id="28">24.76 per cent return in 2009/10; and</seg>
<seg id="29">paid $25 million in dividends back to the council, including $6 million this year.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I look forward to CBIC continuing with its success and its ongoing contribution to the future economic benefit and growth of Brisbane," Cr Quirk said.</seg>

<seg id="1">China blames Tiananmen crash on Muslim Uighur separatists</seg>
<seg id="2">The group that stood behind the scenes inciting it was the East Turkestan Islamic Movement,</seg>
<seg id="3">Many Uighurs call Xinjiang East Turkestan, and the government often blames the frequent outbreaks of violence there on extremists agitating for an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was facing a clear danger from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which she added also operated outside of the country.</seg>
<seg id="5">Members of the organisation have for a long time engaged in terrorist acts in South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia and other regions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It has links to many international extremist terrorist groups," she told a daily news briefing.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is China's most direct and realistic security threat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Police stepped up checks at Beijing's oldest mosque for Friday prayers, searching bags of anyone who looked Uighur, as part of heightened security across the capital.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some experts have expressed scepticism about China's characterisation of the Tiananmen Square incident as a premeditated and coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If it's a deliberate act, it's unsophisticated," said Joanne Smith Finley, a lecturer in Chinese studies at Newcastle University who studies Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="11">It doesn't carry any of the hallmarks that we would expect to see if it was something that was plotted and carefully deliberated with overseas extremists.</seg>
<seg id="12">The United Nations and United States placed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement on lists of terrorist organisations after the September 11, 2001, attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">The group entered the public eye ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when it said it had caused a series of fatal explosions across the country.</seg>
<seg id="14">Police identified the driver of the SUV as Usmen Hasan, whose name suggests he is a Uighur, and said his mother and wife were in the car with him, along with devices filled with gasoline and a flag with "extreme religious content" on it.</seg>
<seg id="15">At least 42 people were wounded.</seg>
<seg id="16">Exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer told Reuters this week that caution should be exercised over the government's account, adding she did not believe any kind of organised extremist Islamic movement was operating in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="17">Xinjiang, a sprawling, desert-like region that borders Central Asian nations that were part of the former Soviet Union as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan, has been beset by violence, blamed by China on Uighur separatists and extremists.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2009, nearly 200 people were killed in the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi, in rioting between Uighurs and the majority Han Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="19">The East Turkestan Islamic Movement has been accused by the United States and China of having ties to al-Qaeda, but there is disagreement among security experts as to the nature of the group and whether ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations really exist.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rights organisations have said there is little concrete evidence that the group has carried out most of the attacks it has been blamed for, and that Beijing uses the group as an excuse to push repressive policies on Uighurs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delany Says Power Conferences Hope to Stay in DI</seg>
<seg id="2">Giving the power conferences more autonomy in a restructured NCAA could help address the "existential threats" that plague college sports at their highest level, Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany said.</seg>
<seg id="3">The five conferences - the Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC and ACC - don't want to leave the NCAA or even form their own division, Delany said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">But they need the power to make decisions that directly affect the financial and educational well-being of their athletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We're not talking about pay for play," Delany said, speaking at the Big Ten's basketball media day.</seg>
<seg id="6">We are talking about the cost of education, kind of scholarship.</seg>
<seg id="7">We're talking about a long-term educational commitment, perhaps beyond the time they're student-athletes.</seg>
<seg id="8">We're talking about managing the at-risk student.</seg>
<seg id="9">We're talking about the time demands.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have to be able to do what we need to do in order to address those issues, and we need the authority to do it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The NCAA has been battered by a series of scandals over the last year, most centering around money.</seg>
<seg id="12">The long and messy investigation at Miami, sparked by a booster, finally wrapped up last week.</seg>
<seg id="13">Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel was suspended for the first half of Texas A&M's season opener for an "inadvertent" violation of NCAA rules involving signing autographs.</seg>
<seg id="14">A Yahoo report last month said a runner for agents provided improper benefits to football players at Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi State.</seg>
<seg id="15">And despite support from the NCAA's board, the full membership has twice rejected a rules change that would have allowed schools to give athletes money for expenses not covered by their scholarships - clothes, travel, meals out with their friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">Houston Texans running back Arian Foster said in a documentary that he accepted money his senior year at Tennessee, in part to pay rent and buy food.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a variety of threats.</seg>
<seg id="18">We don't have control over a lot of it," Delany said.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what you do have control over you should try to grapple with, and I think restructuring gives us the chance to manage the policies that we still have some control over.</seg>
<seg id="20">NCAA leaders appear to agree.</seg>
<seg id="21">After getting input on restructuring from nine groups, including the conference commissioners, the NCAA board said Wednesday that while it believes presidents should still be in charge, some schools should have greater leeway in making decisions affecting their athletes, particularly when it comes to finances and scholarships.</seg>
<seg id="22">The board also said it should focus more on overall strategy and vision and less on day-to-day operational activities.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I thought it was a good step," Delany said.</seg>
<seg id="24">A steering committee, led by NCAA board chair Nathan Hatch, will now craft proposals for restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those will be presented at the NCAA convention in January, and Hatch hopes a final plan will be ready by the spring.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to draw lines and put certain people in and certain people out.</seg>
<seg id="27">We don't want anybody else's money.</seg>
<seg id="28">We don't want to change one of the great events in the world," Delany said, referring to the NCAA basketball tournament.</seg>
<seg id="29">"But right now, the level playing field philosophy is so powerful and the differences among the 351 schools and 32 conferences is something we can't really deal with," Delany said.</seg>
<seg id="30">We're going to have to get the change.</seg>

<seg id="1">Foreign workers on 457 visas could undergo "genuineness" test</seg>
<seg id="2">A "genuineness" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown.</seg>
<seg id="3">The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the "genuineness" criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about "whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."</seg>
<seg id="10">Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">The man's distraught nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comforted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the vessel.</seg>
<seg id="13">Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.</seg>

<seg id="1">Which billionaire you will be talking to on the telephone next year?</seg>
<seg id="2">Kellner, the owner of PPF group, he wants to buy O2.</seg>
<seg id="3">Both firms confirmed the negotiations and, according to a variety of sources, from agencies and behind the scenes, it is reportedly already done and dusted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement of the transaction should be made in November, probably before the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, therefore before 11 November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kellner’s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.</seg>
<seg id="6">This group started auctioning frequencies for LTE networks under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was to everyone’s surprise, the company had not talked about its desire to get into telecommunications until this point.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Sazka is now headed by the old hand Robert Chvátal, who is very experienced in telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id="9">He started as marketing director at Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), eventually becoming director of Slovakia’s T-Mobile and most recently he was the head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sazka is playing several cards at once.</seg>
<seg id="11">It joined the auction and has now admitted that it wants to launch a virtual network with Vodafone.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it makes sense.</seg>
<seg id="13">If successful in the auction, it will then be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its own network.</seg>
<seg id="14">Under normal circumstances, Vodafone would probably not like that but, according to information from the newspaper Hospodářske Noviny, it may be a part of much closer cooperation of the two companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Vodafone is currently suffering because of the agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore Vodafone needs a partner.</seg>
<seg id="17">And this could be Sazka.</seg>
<seg id="18">If it is successful in the tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer it can auction a specially designated range), then Vodafone does not have to start the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning just the specially designated range (there are not enough frequencies for all).</seg>
<seg id="19">Vodafone can actually share the network with Sazka.</seg>
<seg id="20">Vodafone will allow Sazka on its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network with a frequency of 900 MHz) which allows the company to start the network quickly.</seg>
<seg id="21">Meanwhile Sazka will start building the costly LTE network which Vodafone will be also able to use.</seg>
<seg id="22">Both firms can be happy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Vodafone could then spend the money saved on a fixed internet or cable television provider.</seg>
<seg id="24">And Kellner?</seg>
<seg id="25">With the purchase of the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak office is a subsidiary of the Czech company), he would get a fully fledged operator immediately with increasingly good profits and a wide range of services.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the other hand, it is a huge juggernaut that will need restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="27">In auction, Kellner would get the LTE networks for O2 and very probably in collaboration with T-Mobile.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both companies have in fact declared that they will share the networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">The auction could therefore end successfully, but most probably not without the large sums that the state budget is looking forward to.</seg>
<seg id="30">And from the next year, Czech customers could therefore be choosing between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.</seg>
<seg id="31">Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brutal murder of elderly man in the Zlín region to be dealt with again by regional court</seg>
<seg id="2">The regional court dismissed charges against a 25 year old Slovak and a 22 year old Czech due to lack of evidence.</seg>
<seg id="3">The men denied guilt.</seg>
<seg id="4">They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the high court had annulled the regional ruling and returned the case to be heard again.</seg>
<seg id="6">He refused to comment on the reasons which led the judge to this, saying that the ruling had not yet been served on the parties.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the prosecution, the young men attacked the 77 year old man in his home.</seg>
<seg id="8">The elderly man died an agonising death.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the prosecution, they strangled the man, beat and kicked him all over his body, and also, using a metal object, probably a gas pistol, inflicted around thirty blows to the head.</seg>
<seg id="10">The man suffered serious injuries, for example skull fractures, swelling of the brain and bleeding in the brain, causing him to die on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="11">The young men allegedly took around 3,000 crowns from the house, and jewellery worth around 14,000 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the regional court, the only and, moreover, circumstantial evidence against the defendants were scent traces, which an expert assessed as not fully detected in terms of statutory guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Scent traces from the scene of the crime and on other items in more than ten cases matched the defendants, but the police treated them as material traces, not scent traces, at first.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, certain errors handling the traces were found.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the court, the defendants’ guilt was not proven beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the court admitted that the police had very difficult conditions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The dead elderly man with his skull broken was found by relatives who thought he had probably fallen and injured himself.</seg>
<seg id="18">A doctor from the emergency services who was called out did not alert them to the violent death either.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only after several days were detectives contacted by Olomouc doctors, who found signs of a violent death during the autopsy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The police could no longer work with all the traces from the scene of the crime, which had been cleaned up by relatives.</seg>
<seg id="21">None of the defendants’ DNA was found at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="22">The young Slovak lived in the Uherské Hradiště area.</seg>
<seg id="23">He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was definitively confirmed last year by the Olomouc High Court.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the court, the man was the head of an organised group of six young men who were responsible for robbing jewellery shops.</seg>
<seg id="25">The robberies took place in October and November of 2011, shortly after the murder of the old man in Slopné.</seg>
<seg id="26">The younger defendant in the murder of the elderly man lives in Uherské Hradiště.</seg>
<seg id="27">In August, the court released him from prison after 11 months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tension rises on Egypt election delay</seg>
<seg id="2">OFFICIALS have postponed declaring a winner in Egypt's disputed presidential election, sending political tensions soaring.</seg>
<seg id="3">Adding to the confusion are conflicting reports about the health of former president Hosni Mubarak, 84.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last weekend's runoff election has turned into a confrontation between the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood and the entrenched elements of Mubarak's old regime, including the military.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of Muslim Brotherhood supporters along with some secular youth revolutionary groups camped out today in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the birthplace of last year's uprising, and denounced the military, trying to push back against a series of power grabs by the generals last week.</seg>
<seg id="6">The election commission did not say when it would announce the winner of the runoff between the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, Mohammed Morsi, and Mubarak's former prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both candidates claim they won, and the commission was supposed to declare the winner today.</seg>
<seg id="8">The commission's secretary-general, Hatem Begato, told the state newspaper Al-Ahram the winner would be announced on Saturday or Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="9">The commission said the announcement was postponed because a panel of judges must look into about 400 complaints of voting fraud submitted by both campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lawyers for Mr Shafiq had said there was fraud in 14 of Egypt's 27 provinces.</seg>
<seg id="11">They said ballots sent to polling centres were already marked for Mr Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Morsi's lawyers had accused Mr Shafiq of buying votes and being involved in forging lists of registered voters to include soldiers, who are barred from voting, and names of the dead.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign and local election monitors have said the runoff was not marked by enough serious or large-scale irregularities to question its validity.</seg>
<seg id="14">In a series of swift moves last week, the generals cornered for themselves sweeping powers that effectively subordinate the next president and severely limit his capability for independent action.</seg>
<seg id="15">A court order dissolved parliament, which was led by the Brotherhood, and the military issued a constitutional declaration that makes the generals the nation's legislators and gives them control of the budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">They will dominate the security system after reshaping a key National Defence Council to keep it under their control.</seg>
<seg id="17">The generals will also oversee the process of writing Egypt's new constitution.</seg>
<seg id="18">While the Brotherhood and secular revolutionary groups have denounced the military's moves, some Egyptian liberals see the steps as a way to prevent an Islamist takeover, or ensure that its hold on power is difficult and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="19">Adding to the electoral limbo has been murkiness over Mubarak's health.</seg>
<seg id="20">State media said he had suffered a stroke and was on life support.</seg>
<seg id="21">Security officials said he was in a coma but off life support and his heart and other vital organs were functioning.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obituary: Hamish Robertson CB, MBE, colonial administrator</seg>
<seg id="2">Born: 6 April, 1931, in Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="3">Died: 10 September 2013, in Dollar, aged 82</seg>
<seg id="4">Hamish Robertson, who died at his home in Dollar in September, played a critically important role in the early years of Malawi's independence and later enjoyed a successful career as a senior civil servant in the Scottish Office.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hamish was born and spent his early years in Jersey, where his father James worked in the Agricultural Department.</seg>
<seg id="6">He began his education in the parish school in Trinity, where the playground language was Jerriais, and enjoyed the freedom to roam over fields and beaches.</seg>
<seg id="7">All this came to an abrupt end in June 1940 when the family were evacuated on the last boat to leave before the Germans arrived.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hamish vividly remembered seeing Cherbourg blazing under German gunfire as they steamed north.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hamish's mother Elizabeth took Hamish and his four younger siblings back to her family in Huntly, where James soon joined them, being employed by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland to inspect farms and ensure their maximum contribution to the war effort.</seg>
<seg id="10">They found a house in Cairney so that Hamish had to swap his French dialect for the Doric and the rigours of a small Aberdeenshire primary school, shortly followed by the Gordon Schools, Huntly, where he thrived, emerging as Dux.</seg>
<seg id="11">He gained a First Class Honours degree in History at Aberdeen University, gaining the Caithness Prize and sharing the Forbes Medal.</seg>
<seg id="12">After spending national service as an officer in the Royal Artillery he was appointed to the Colonial Service and sent to Cambridge for a year's training.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, through a chance meeting with her brothers at a Scout Jamboree in France, Hamish had met Suzanne Taylor, daughter of the Peterhead GP Dr Gavin Taylor.</seg>
<seg id="14">They married in April 1955 in Kings College Chapel and that July set off together for a new life in the Nyasaland Protectorate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hamish had been posted to Chikwawa on the lower Shire River and was to spend seven satisfying years in district administration; he became fluent in Chinyanja and relished both the opportunity to travel round the more distant parts of the district and his later work on soil conservation.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1962 he was moved to the Finance Ministry, arriving just in time to play a key role in Nyasaland's rapid transition to full independence.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 1962 the Nyasaland Protectorate was still part of the Central African Federation, which was responsible for many of the central functions of government.</seg>
<seg id="18">In February 1963 the UK government gave Nyasaland internal self-government with Dr Hastings Banda as Prime Minister and later decided to dissolve the Federation on 31 December, 1963 and give independence to Nyasaland (renamed Malawi) in July 1964.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many expatriate civil servants left, few local replacements were available and the workload was huge and very challenging.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hamish found himself one of a very small band of competent but inexperienced young colleagues charged with improvising new arrangements for every aspect of government finance including taxation, a tariff regime, a central bank and a system of economic statistics.</seg>
<seg id="21">They also had to establish from scratch new relationships with the UK and South Africa, with major companies (such as Lonrho) and with international bodies such as the UN and GATT.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hamish saw through the transition to full independence in July 1964 and stayed on until 1966.</seg>
<seg id="23">He enjoyed working with the Finance Minister John Tembo and had a good relationship with Dr Banda, whom he would sometimes meet later when the latter was visiting Edinburgh.</seg>
<seg id="24">The experience of successfully carrying through such a huge programme of vitally important work was incredibly exhilarating for a relatively junior (and decidedly underpaid) young man and nothing in his later life would ever be so satisfying; in 1966 he was appointed MBE in recognition of his services.</seg>
<seg id="25">Coming home to Scotland with his young family was certainly quite a jolt.</seg>
<seg id="26">Soon, however, they were settled happily in Dollar and Hamish had secured a Principal post in the Scottish Education Department.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 1970 he was appointed Principal Private Secretary to the Secretary of State, Gordon Campbell.</seg>
<seg id="28">Later work as a division head in the Scottish Office involved school curriculum, tourism and the Highlands and Islands and a notable spell as Finance Officer for the Scottish Home and Health Department.</seg>
<seg id="29">From 1987 until his retirement in 1992 he served as an Under Secretary in the Scottish Education Department, where he was involved in difficult and challenging issues in the aftermath of the teachers" dispute of the mid-80s.</seg>
<seg id="30">He worked closely with Professor John Howie on the committee reviewing the Highers, the report of which sowed the seeds of the idea of a Scottish Baccalaureat.</seg>
<seg id="31">He also worked loyally and assiduously with the education minister Michael Forsyth on the latter's introduction of school boards and on the government's controversial and ultimately unsuccessful efforts to promote opted out schools in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="32">He was appointed CB in 1992.</seg>
<seg id="33">In retirement Hamish was much involved as chairman of the Central Region Crossroads Care Scheme and served as a lay school inspector and on the Carnegie Trust.</seg>
<seg id="34">He enjoyed walking and skiing, tending his garden and above all spending time with his children and grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hamish was a man of total probity, reliability and loyalty who brought a shrewd and accurate mind and a great breadth of intellect to all that he did.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was an engaging (and persistent) raconteur and his stories were always entertaining (a favourite phrase was "ne'er spile a story by considerin" gin it were true").</seg>
<seg id="37">A key characteristic was the pride he took in all the things which had shaped his life - his Jersey origins, the values of his beloved North-east, especially its history (he was to the end a Strathbogie man) and its educational traditions, his time in the Royal Artillery and above all his work in Nyasaland/Malawi and his love of that land and its people.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was a devoted husband to Susie, an intensely proud father of Helen, Barbara, James and Gavin and a loving grandfather and great-grandfather.</seg>

<seg id="2">McDonald's provides discounts for uniformed police, ambulance officers, firefighters and the State Emergency Service.</seg>
<seg id="3">POLICE chief Ken Lay is trying to ditch the popular image of police scoffing burgers on patrol.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Chief Commissioner has written to McDonald's corporate headquarters asking it to no longer offer police discounts and freebies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Uniformed police, ambulance officers, firefighters and the State Emergency Service can get up to half the price of meals discounted at Victoria's McDonald's outlets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some restaurants also offer free food or drink - a practice it is feared could lead to perceptions of bias.</seg>
<seg id="7">Melbourne University corruption expert Professor Leslie Holmes said the move would be in line with the policies of overseas police forces that ban freebies for their officers.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said there was also a perception that fast food restaurants offered the discounts to entice police inside as taxpayer-funded security guards.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I suspect it is mostly harmless, but if people perceive it is wrong, then on one level it is wrong," Prof Holmes said.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is more a matter of principle rather than the cost of the free cup of coffee.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would be much cleaner if they stop offering it.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Police Association secretary Greg Davies said the discount did no harm.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Everyone is trying to be as pure as the driven snow these days but anyone who thinks the police force is going to act on behalf of McDonald's against some other organisation because they get a cheap hamburger from time to time is kidding themselves," Sen-Sgt Davies said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Victoria police spokesman Melissa Seach said the Chief Commissioner had written to the fast food giant asking it to re-examine the policy.</seg>
<seg id="15">"McDonald's have advised the discount is not a set policy and it was up to each outlet to decide whether the discount will be offered; therefore, there will be no change to the policy," Sen-Constable Seach said.</seg>
<seg id="16">McDonald's spokesman Skye Oxenham said individual managers offered the discount in appreciation for local work done by the emergency services.</seg>
<seg id="17">"While there is no formal policy, in many cases our company and franchised restaurants will provide uniformed police officers, ambulance officers, fire and rescue, SES and other emergency service individuals a discount on food and beverages," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heidi Klum has outdone herself once again.</seg>
<seg id="3">The glamorous model and presenter transformed herself into a little old lady for Halloween, with white candy floss hair and crinkled features.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Queen of Halloween (remember her anatomical skin-stripped costume last year?) took her outfit seriously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her long gazelle legs (insured for £1.5million) were painted with blue veins, and knees made crepey with old loose flesh.</seg>
<seg id="6">Crows feet were drawn around her eyes and her brows made to look furrowed with age.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model, who had been retweeting Halloween outfits all day, posted the pictures with the humorous caption "little old me."</seg>
<seg id="8">She then tweeted a picture of her granny self doing later on something looked suspiciously like twerking.</seg>
<seg id="9">Klum (who in reality is only 40 years old) wore the outfit to the Svedka-sponsored fete in New York City.</seg>

<seg id="2">Wyatt's wisdom for Palmer</seg>
<seg id="3">Liberal MP Wyatt Roy advises incoming MP Clive Palmer to ditch the clowning around and focus on delivering for his electorate.</seg>
<seg id="4">PT3M32Shttp://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-2wpsf620349November 1, 2013 - 1:18PM</seg>
<seg id="5">Australia's youngest MP, Wyatt Roy, has offered some harsh advice to Clive Palmer, saying the newly elected member for Fairfax was "clown-like" and should consider changing his attitude.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 23-year-old Liberal, whose seat of Longman is near Mr Palmer's Queensland electorate, told Fairfax Media the people who voted for the billionaire mining magnate did not necessarily expect him to be elected.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clown-like": Clive Palmer.</seg>
<seg id="8">Photo: Michelle Smith</seg>
<seg id="9">"[Mr Palmer] might not turn out to be a great ... local MP," Mr Roy said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Joking that he was like "an old man now" and a "weird political veteran," Mr Roy gave some unsolicited advice to the 59-year-old billionaire, who was announced on Thursday as the MP for Fairfax, winning the seat from the LNP candidate by 53 votes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among his advice to the new MP, Mr Roy suggested Mr Palmer should stop thinking of himself as a "novelty" act and model his parliamentary behaviour on that of the former Australia Democrats leader, Don Chipp.</seg>
<seg id="12">Rather than being "clown-like," Mr Palmer should "adopt a more Don Chipp, sort of very serious, policy sort of approach," Mr Roy said.</seg>
<seg id="13">All I would say to Mr Palmer is that his term in Parliament should be about the results that he can deliver for his electorate.</seg>
<seg id="14">And [Mr Palmer] has to make a decision about whether that's what he wants to do or he wants to pursue his ... almost clown-like approach to politics.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Roy questioned the billionaire's motives for running for Parliament, saying "politics should be about how you change other people's lives for the better, not your own."</seg>
<seg id="16">Clive is an individual who's clearly pretty self-interested.</seg>
<seg id="17">I think there are pretty serious questions about that.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Palmer, who is more than 30 years older than Mr Roy, took umbrage at the advice.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Well poor old Wyatt's still developing his personality," Mr Palmer told Fairfax Media.</seg>
<seg id="20">He's only a young boy that's never had a job in his life.</seg>
<seg id="21">Palmer attacks Newman</seg>
<seg id="22">Mr Palmer used his acceptance speech on Friday, after the Australian Electoral Commission announced him as the winner of the Fairfax recount, to accuse the Campbell Newman government in Queensland of favouring some private companies above others.</seg>
<seg id="23">The leader of the Palmer United Party said on Thursday night he believed there was corruption within the Newman government.</seg>
<seg id="24">When quizzed about the claims on Friday, he said he had ""direct evidence"" the government had been benefiting certain private companies, to the disadvantage of others.</seg>
<seg id="25">""We'll be revealing that information soon so people can see that,"" he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dwight Merriman of MongoDB on Leading by Enthusiasm</seg>
<seg id="2">This interview with Dwight Merriman, chairman and co-founder of MongoDB, an open-source document database, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.</seg>
<seg id="3">Q. Did you have the entrepreneurial itch when you were younger?</seg>
<seg id="4">A. Not much.</seg>
<seg id="5">I was kind of your classic nerd.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most significant thing for me was just the first time I touched a computer.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was my 14th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was immediately obvious to me that, hey, I can do this.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was intuitive.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was pretty clear then that I knew what I wanted to do.</seg>
<seg id="11">I started a business in high school doing programming for small businesses, but I was probably more focused on computers than on any notion of company-building until later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Q. Tell me about your first experience managing people.</seg>
<seg id="13">A. It was at DoubleClick, where I was a co-founder.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were times when the entire engineering organization, probably 300 or 400 people, worked for me.</seg>
<seg id="15">I think managing people is hard, and it's a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think I'm a good manager, but not a great manager.</seg>
<seg id="17">I like doing entrepreneurial things and starting companies and helping build them.</seg>
<seg id="18">I like strategy and marketing and the tech side.</seg>
<seg id="19">Managing people would not be my favorite thing, but you have to do it if you're going to be C.E.O.</seg>
<seg id="20">Q. Any big inflection points in how your leadership style evolved?</seg>
<seg id="21">A. I'm usually pretty excited and enthusiastic about what I'm working on and hopefully that comes across.</seg>
<seg id="22">In some ways it's that simple.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think the one inflection point was just becoming less shy.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a kid I would describe myself as shy.</seg>
<seg id="25">As soon as I entered the work world, I was a lot less shy.</seg>
<seg id="26">Q. I take it you're an introvert.</seg>
<seg id="27">A. I am.</seg>
<seg id="28">Q. You were C.E.O. of MongoDB for five years before becoming chairman, and a big part of that job no doubt required you to spend a lot of time with people and give a lot of talks.</seg>
<seg id="29">How did you handle that?</seg>
<seg id="30">A. I think 95 percent of the time you can get past that with just sheer brute force.</seg>
<seg id="31">I remember public-speaking class in college.</seg>
<seg id="32">I really didn't want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="33">But today, when I give talks to 1,000 people, I'm not nervous at all.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think you get used to it.</seg>
<seg id="35">You just have to force yourself out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="36">And it's a myth that most C.E.O.'s are extroverts.</seg>
<seg id="37">Many are, but probably no more than the general population.</seg>
<seg id="38">I do what works for me, which is being enthusiastic and passionate about what we're doing.</seg>
<seg id="39">You've just got to find what works for you.</seg>
<seg id="40">Q. Tell me more about your leadership style now.</seg>
<seg id="41">A. I think my style is to be pretty plain-spoken and non-hype, and to be transparent.</seg>
<seg id="42">Some people might be sincere but you don't feel that air of transparency because they're too busy selling and everything is pitched with an extra 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="43">I also delegate and I'm not a micromanager.</seg>
<seg id="44">So you need to run with what you own and get it done, even with things that pop up that are obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="45">It might be competitors or even the internal organization - "I need to get this approved by this department, but they're being slow about it."</seg>
<seg id="46">But you've got to make it happen one way or another.</seg>
<seg id="47">Figure it out.</seg>
<seg id="48">Go sit on their desk until they show up three hours later if you have to.</seg>
<seg id="49">But just make it happen.</seg>
<seg id="50">I think that's good advice for anyone in work, because it's going to happen in every company a lot, especially in larger companies.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sometimes you need to get consensus of a certain number of people to do something, and you've got to get a budget for something.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's hard.</seg>
<seg id="53">I think people can get frustrated when their boss wants them to do something and then there are other points in their organization that just make it hard for them to get it done in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="54">Q. A lot of managers struggle to give candid feedback.</seg>
<seg id="55">How do you do it?</seg>
<seg id="56">A. I think one tactic is just to have lots of small conversations so that they don't become elephants in the room.</seg>
<seg id="57">The one thing I find useful, when it's just something small, is to email the person.</seg>
<seg id="58">It could be to say: "You know, I was thinking that in the meeting we had with 12 other people earlier today that you should have said X, Y, Z, and here's why."</seg>
<seg id="59">It's not a big deal but here's a piece of feedback for you.</seg>
<seg id="60">I would not do that if it were something big.</seg>
<seg id="61">But I find that if it was really modest in scope, it's too hard to find time to set up a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="62">You have to be mindful of tone in email, of course, because there is no body language.</seg>
<seg id="63">So you have to be clear and not hyperbolic, because an email could come across the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="64">I'm understated by personality anyway, but I'm more understated in email because it's easier to be misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="65">Q. What are some things you'd like to get better at as a leader?</seg>
<seg id="66">A. I don't give people enough positive feedback and praise.</seg>
<seg id="67">That's an example of how I'm not a natural-born, awesome manager.</seg>
<seg id="68">Even though I might be thinking it, I'll just fail to vocalize it.</seg>
<seg id="69">You get busy and distracted with meetings and running from here to there and it's hard to stay mindful of things like that.</seg>
<seg id="70">It would probably be a good idea to make a list with no more than five things on a Post-it note and stick it in a wallet.</seg>
<seg id="71">Q. How do you hire?</seg>
<seg id="72">How would you interview me, for example?</seg>
<seg id="73">A. It's really hard.</seg>
<seg id="74">I don't have any silver bullets.</seg>
<seg id="75">The No.</seg>
<seg id="76">1 thing I would do to give me an indication of whether it's going to be a great fit is to do some role-playing.</seg>
<seg id="77">And by that I mean let's assume you took the job and you're here.</seg>
<seg id="78">Let's just spend the next hour doing it.</seg>
<seg id="79">Let's go through some things we need to do and what we're going to do about them.</seg>
<seg id="80">I think it's pretty common that someone joins a company, and within one week you know you're not going to be happy for whatever reason.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe they're good but it's just not a good fit and it's the wrong job for them, and it's your mistake.</seg>
<seg id="82">Or maybe they're just bad and you failed to notice this somehow.</seg>
<seg id="83">I think role-playing simulates what it's going to be like when they're here.</seg>

<seg id="2">Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool which will allow banks access to global currencies, whenever they need to.</seg>

<seg id="1">Defend academic freedom, it applies to Zeman and the ODS.</seg>
<seg id="2">In recent months, through open letters, I have repeatedly urged students, educators and heads of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedom against the election campaign carried out at schools by president Miloš Zeman.</seg>
<seg id="3">I met with varying degrees of success.</seg>
<seg id="4">In return, the Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who declined a lecture from the honorary chairman of SPOZ – Zeman’s people in the pre-election period, was not invited to the celebration of the national day of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here is a list of school representatives who were not so brave and allowed Miloš Zeman to visit: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Grammar School in Ostrava, Business School Ostrava, Kolín Business Academy, Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now in Pardubice we are encountering the continuation of promoting the policy at universities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The newly elected ODS MP, dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, is refusing to step down from his academic post and he thinks this is normal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Professor Karamazov, it really is not the same thing as you were staying, for example, in the post of mayor of a small town.</seg>
<seg id="9">Do you want to join the ranks of ČSSD governors who are holding the posts of MP and governor at the same time and just like them degrade both occupations?</seg>
<seg id="10">In this way you are telling people that handling both these challenging posts is a piece of cake.</seg>
<seg id="11">I know, we have the example of Michal Hašek here, who can actually handle several dozen posts at once.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is not exactly the example of a person you should follow, however.</seg>
<seg id="13">We can also find a contrasting and positive example of Doctor Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave her post as MP so she could devote herself fully to leading the city of Pardubice.</seg>
<seg id="14">The main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of dean, however, is that holding the concurrent posts, you are breaching the apolitical nature of the academic environment of the University of Pardubice.</seg>
<seg id="15">The leadership of the Pardubice ODS see your current work in both posts as an advantage for the university.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, you will be able to help "your" school even without remaining dean.</seg>
<seg id="17">I think your students will also have a similar opinion as I have and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consider your resignation therefore again, and save face.</seg>
<seg id="19">Otherwise it may happen that your days will be numbered in the next election.</seg>
<seg id="20">And it might not take that long.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we've not been in that situation before -- it's all completely new.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lisi under the microscope: The police allegations against Ford's friend</seg>
<seg id="2">Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has described Alessandro Lisi as a "friend" and "a good guy."</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Lisi has been seen frequently at the mayor's side - blocking him from reporters during heated exchanges and ferrying him to official events.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr. Ford said he was "surprised" when Mr. Lisi, 35, was arrested on multiple drug charges in early October.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Thursday, Mr. Lisi was arrested again and charged with extortion.</seg>
<seg id="6">A document outlining the police investigation into Mr. Lisi was ordered released on Thursday, shedding light on surveillance that shows meetings and phone calls between Mr. Lisi and the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the affidavit, Detective Constable Nader Khoshbooi concludes: "I believe that Alexander LISI is a drug dealer."</seg>
<seg id="8">I believe that Alexander LISI is a source of marihuana and has been observed meeting people a number of times in circumstances that would provide opportunities for LISI to deliver or make drugs available to them.</seg>
<seg id="9">The allegations in the police affidavit have not been proven in court.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here are two occasions in which Mr. Lisi was observed with Mr. Ford:</seg>
<seg id="11">On July 11, Toronto police placed surveillance on Mr. Lisi.</seg>
<seg id="12">They saw his Range Rover and Mr. Ford's vehicle pull into an Esso gas station, not far from the mayor's home.</seg>
<seg id="13">"LISI was observed to take a manila envelope from the front of his vehicle and walked to the back of the Range Rover where he placed something in the envelope," the affidavit says.</seg>
<seg id="14">LISI then took the envelope and placed it in the passenger side of Mayor FORD's vehicle, while Mayor FORD was inside the gas station kiosk.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's what police saw happening outside, but this is what Esso's closed-circuit television footage revealed, according to the affidavit:</seg>
<seg id="16">At roughly 5:38 p.m., Mr. Ford's Escalade pulls into the station.</seg>
<seg id="17">One minute later, he enters the gas station and "heads straight to the washroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">Not long after, a vehicle, believed to be Mr. Lisi's Range Rover, appears on one of the pump cameras.</seg>
<seg id="19">At about 5:40, Mr. Lisi enters the station, while texting and holding a manila envelope, and picks out a few bottles of Gatorade and a bag of chips.</seg>
<seg id="20">He pays for his purchases and, at about 5:42 p.m., with the mayor still in the washroom, he leaves the station with the envelope and his purchases.</seg>
<seg id="21">The surveillance footage loses Mr. Lisi as he walks west out the door, and when he returns a "short time later," he is no longer holding the plastic bag.</seg>
<seg id="22">Two minutes later, Mr. Lisi walks near the mayor's Escalade, still holding the envelope.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shortly after this image, he walks along the passenger side of the Mayor's Escalade and walks out of frame.</seg>
<seg id="24">At about the same time, Mr. Ford leaves the bathroom, picks out a bottle of Gatorade, chooses a pack of gum and then pays.</seg>
<seg id="25">Two minutes later, he leaves.</seg>
<seg id="26">On June 26, Toronto police used plane and ground surveillance to watch Mr. Lisi - videos and photographs were taken, too.</seg>
<seg id="27">After driving to an auto-detailing shop, where he "stayed for a few minutes, briefly speaking to an employee outside," Mr. Lisi returned home and was seen removing a heavy knapsack from the trunk before entering the house, the affidavit says.</seg>
<seg id="28">He was later observed retrieving a small cooler bag from the garage and putting it into the trunk of a "known red Mustang."</seg>
<seg id="29">He also placed a white plastic bag into the passenger side, and then he and an unknown man drove to a nearby parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mr. Lisi went to a soccer field close by and met with Mr. Ford, while the unknown male stayed with the car.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the document, Mr. Lisi and Mr. Ford spoke for a few minutes, but then Mr. Lisi went back to his vehicle and retrieved from the floor a white plastic bag, which "already contained items in it."</seg>
<seg id="32">He took some cans of Minute Maid from the trunk and added them to the white bag.</seg>
<seg id="33">He walked to Mr. Ford's Escalade, which was parked nearby, and opened the driver door.</seg>
<seg id="34">He put the bag on the centre console and then met up with Mr. Ford, who was now "walking north with a toddler."</seg>
<seg id="35">While the toddler took a seat in the Escalade, Mr. Ford and Mr. Lisi spoke briefly.</seg>
<seg id="36">The pair then parted, with Mr. Lisi leaving on foot and the mayor driving off in his SUV.</seg>
<seg id="37">On May 16 at roughly 8:28 p.m., Gawker.com went live with a story about a video purportedly showing Mr. Ford smoking crack.</seg>
<seg id="38">This is a snapshot of the people in touch with Mr. Lisi in the ensuing 48 hours, according to the Toronto police affidavit that was ordered released Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="39">It outlines the police case against Mr. Lisi, allegations that have not been proven in court.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mayor Rob Ford: Ten minutes before the Gawker story went live, Mr. Ford phoned Mr. Lisi in a call that lasted 40 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="41">The next day, May 17, at 5:26 p.m., five minutes after a staff member contacted Mr. Lisi, Mr. Ford phoned Mr. Lisi in a call that lasted 22 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="42">A minute later, Mr. Ford's residential number called Mr. Lisi's but was forwarded to voicemail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Within seconds, Mr. Ford's cell and residential numbers called Mr. Lisi, and the pair remained in contact for almost four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="44">The pair spoke twice more that day, and then exchanged seven calls on May 18.</seg>
<seg id="45">Unknown contacts: After speaking with Mr. Ford on the evening of May 16, Mr. Lisi texted a number redacted in the affidavit nine times.</seg>
<seg id="46">That contact also called Mr. Lisi four times between 8:23 p.m. and 9:08 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mr. Lisi exchanged calls or texts with several other unknown contacts on May 17.</seg>
<seg id="48">Fabio Basso: At 9:25 p.m. on May 16, Mr. Lisi made an eight-second call to Fabio Basso, who has a criminal past and, according to a neighbour, was "close" to Mr. Ford in high school.</seg>
<seg id="49">On May 17, the pair exchanged several calls, including one from Mr. Lisi six minutes after he called Mohamed Siad, who is thought to have been among those attempting to sell the video.</seg>
<seg id="50">The now-famous photo of Mr. Ford with alleged gang members, which was circulated around the time the video surfaced, was taken in front of the Basso home.</seg>
<seg id="51">Liban Siyad: Minutes after his first call to Mr. Basso on May 16, Mr. Lisi made two calls to Liban Siyad, who faces charges stemming from this summer's Project Traveller drugs and guns raid and who, according to a confidential source cited in the affidavit, has spent time at the Basso home.</seg>
<seg id="52">Mr. Lisi called Mr. Siyad again at 9:45 p.m. on May 18.</seg>
<seg id="53">Mohamed Siad: At 1:17 p.m. and 1:23 p.m. on May 17, Mr. Lisi made two short calls to Mohamed Siad, who also faces charges stemming from Project Traveller.</seg>
<seg id="54">"Siad is believed to have been one of the people trying to sell Mayor FORD crack video," the document says.</seg>
<seg id="55">Before midnight that day, Mr. Lisi made two short calls to Mr. Siad.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the morning of May 18, Mr. Lisi called Mr. Siad 20 minutes before calling the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="57">Thomas Beyer: At 5:21 p.m. on May 17, the number associated with Thomas Beyer, Mr. Ford's executive assistant, called Mr. Lisi.</seg>
<seg id="58">David Price: Contact between Mr. Lisi and David Price - the mayor's director of operations and logistics, and whom The Globe reported participated in the 1980s hashish business of Doug Ford, the mayor's brother - was heavy the day after Gawker published the story.</seg>
<seg id="59">"On May 17th, 2013 LISI and PRICE talked numerous times in between LISI calling persons known to live in or near the Dixon Buildings," where the Project Traveller raids were centred, the affidavit says.</seg>
<seg id="60">These people include, Fabio BASSO and Mohammed SIAD.</seg>
<seg id="61">Between Aug.</seg>
<seg id="62">7 and Sept.</seg>
<seg id="63">19, the mayor and Mr. Lisi contacted one another 349 times by phone, according to the affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="64">Mr. Lisi also was in contact with other players associated with Mr. Ford.</seg>
<seg id="65">Among them:</seg>
<seg id="66">Christopher Fickel: Mr. Lisi and Christopher Fickel, who resigned in June as the mayor's special assistant, spoke several times in April and May.</seg>
<seg id="67">Mr. Fickel, who was among those interviewed by police, and had met Mr. Lisi "on numerous occasions," had phone communication with Mr. Lisi once between Aug.</seg>
<seg id="68">"FICKEL does not know where the Mayor got marihuana from but has heard that "Sandro" [Mr. Lisi's nickname] may be the person who provides the Mayor with marihuana and possibly cocaine," the affidavit says.</seg>
<seg id="69">It also says "FICKEL would call LISI to find the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="70">Payman Aboodowleh: Mr. Lisi came to know the mayor through Payman Aboodowleh, whom Mr. Lisi called seven times between March 18 and June 24, according to the document.</seg>
<seg id="71">LISI met the Mayor through ABOODOWLEH.</seg>
<seg id="72">"ABOODOWLEH also said that he was mad at LISI because he was fueling the Mayor's drug abuse," the affidavit says.</seg>
<seg id="73">Mr. Ford brought Mr. Aboodowleh, who has a history of violent crimes, onboard at Don Bosco as a football coach around 2007.</seg>
<seg id="74">Several sources have told The Globe that Mr. Aboodowleh served as Mr. Lisi's "enforcer."</seg>
<seg id="75">The Toronto Catholic District School Board says it was unaware of Mr. Aboodowleh's criminal past because it was supplied with a false name for the police check.</seg>
<seg id="76">Bruno Bellissimo: In late March, Mayor Ford arrived after hours at the Toronto West Detention centre, and, according to a number of sources, indicated he wanted to meet with Mr. Bellissimo, who was jailed on assault charges after his March 2 arrest and is described in the affidavit as a "self-admitted "crack user.""</seg>
<seg id="77">According to Mr. Bellissimo's mother, the mayor and her son have been friends "since Bruno was small."</seg>
<seg id="78">In the afternoon before the attempted detention centre visit, the mayor and Mr. Lisi spoke three times.</seg>
<seg id="79">Between March 18 and June 14, Mr. Lisi and Mr. Bellissimo made five points of telephone contact, each time originating with Mr. Lisi.</seg>
<seg id="80">Xhejski Hasko: Mr. Lisi and Xhejski Hasko, Mr. Ford's special assistant, had phone contact five times in one day during the 44-day period stretching Aug.</seg>
<seg id="81">7 to Sept.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin promises green Olympics, his plan scuppered by huge, secret landfills</seg>
<seg id="2">Fans of winter sports are already counting down the days to the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, but others are watching their preparation with growing concern.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Russian Olympics, although they do not start until February, are facing another scandal.</seg>
<seg id="4">Apparently the Russians are not managing to fulfil promises that the preparations and holding of the games will in no way disturb nature in the Krasnodar Region at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be heading in four months’ time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had the bar set very high; the Canadian games went down in Olympic history as the most environmentally friendly.</seg>
<seg id="6">It seems, however, that Russian president Vladimir Putin’s commitment to organise games with "zero waste" ended a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">AP reporters last week discovered a giant landfill of construction materials in the village of Akhshtyr, not far from Sochi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Back in August, ecologists found and immediately reported a landfill full of construction materials, tyres, canisters and insulation foam.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Russian authorities apologised and the landfill disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="10">But not for long.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, reporters were presented with a view of a landfill the size of three football pitches.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was not the only one – several such sites have surfaced in the area, according to British newspaper The Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">Russian Railways, a state monopoly, which is building approximately a sixty-kilometre track between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort, is working on the site.</seg>
<seg id="14">The company, which has already swallowed up 280 billion roubles, is headed by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August the railways defended themselves, saying the landfill was started by one of the subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="16">But local residents are desperate.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the residents of Akhshtyr, trucks have been driving around the village filled with waste materials day and night for three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to experts, there is a risk that the waste is contaminating the local river Mzymta, other streams and the Black Sea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Water from here will contaminate Sochi’s water sources for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimayev from the non-profit environmental organisation EWNC told the British paper.</seg>
<seg id="20">Illegal landfills are not the only problem for the Russian organising committee and the government.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most expensive Olympics in history, they are just one long tunnel according to the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="22">To compare: the Sochi games will cost 51 billion dollars, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing came to 43 billion.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last year’s games in London cost just 19 billion and the Vancouver games nine billion.</seg>
<seg id="24">Aside from the corruption scandals, project delays and fear of whether there will eventually be enough snow, reports have also appeared that when working on construction of the sports venues and infrastructure, the human rights have not been observed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut in protest at not being paid for two months.</seg>
<seg id="26">Many people are also concerned about how the Russian organisers will cope with the new law banning the promotion of homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some visitors are planning to support Russian gays at the Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin leaves team after bullying by teammates</seg>
<seg id="2">Updated Nov 1, 2013 11:40 AM ET</seg>
<seg id="3">Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin loves playing football.</seg>
<seg id="4">But what a source told FOX Sports was an abusive environment that developed during Martin's 1 1/2 seasons with the Dolphins led to him taking a personal leave of absence to spend time with his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">Martin left Dolphins headquarters on Monday when finally reaching his limit with the persistent bullying and teasing from some teammates that has plagued him since joining Miami as a 2012 second-round draft choice.</seg>
<seg id="6">As first reported by FOX Sports NFL insider Jay Glazer, the latest taunt - a group of players stood up and left when he tried joining them for lunch - led to Martin getting up himself and walking out the door.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is no timetable for a return, which could lead Miami to ultimately place him on the reserve/non-football injury list.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also raises questions about his future with the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="9">This wasn't an abrupt action by Martin, who is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University.</seg>
<seg id="10">A source said Martin has tried dealing with a slew of indignities that crossed into personal and family insults, including being bestowed with the nickname of "Big Weirdo."</seg>
<seg id="11">Knowing his background, the 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin probably felt that challenging teammates to fistfights wasn't the answer to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin refused to provide any details about Martin's absence when asked by the media earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="13">Miami downgraded Martin from "doubtful" to "out" for Thursday night's home game against Cincinnati after listing him on their injury report as having an illness.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's believed the Dolphins were aware that the cruel actions of some teammates toward Martin went well beyond the customary hazing sometimes given to NFL rookies and youngsters, the source said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin experienced some of that when the Dolphins appeared on the 2012 season of HBO's Hard Knocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Dolphins declined comment to FOX Sports on Thursday night about whether they were aware of the bullying issue allegedly surrounding Martin.</seg>
<seg id="17">Veteran players also apparently failed to help support Martin and draw a line as to where the bullying should end.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result, a Dolphins offensive line that leads the NFL in sacks allowed (32 through seven games) was without one of its best players against a strong Bengals pass rush.</seg>
<seg id="19">The recently-benched Tyson Clabo started at right tackle in place of Martin, who was shifted from left tackle after Miami acquired Bryant McKinnie in a trade with Baltimore.</seg>
<seg id="20">The NFL Players Association is monitoring the situation and has made inquiries into determining what has happened with Martin, a source told FOX Sports.</seg>

<seg id="1">Before U.S. Kidnapping, Surviving Piracy How-To Distributed</seg>
<seg id="2">Before the kidnapping of two American mariners off the coast of Nigeria early Thursday, piracy in the region had become such a "widespread and violent" practice in recent months that the industry issued a stark warning to anyone operating in the dangerous waters -- and told them what to do if pirates take over the ship.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two Americans, Captain and Chief Engineer aboard the oil supply vessel C-Retriever, were taken from the vessel after being separated from the other crew members by their nationality, a Pentagon official told ABC News Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">A spokesperson for the Nigerian Navy said his military has undertaken a search and rescue mission for the Americans, but there has been little news since word of the attack spread.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is unclear where exactly the Americans are now, but the Nigerian Navy spokesperson said they are thought to be held off the Nigerian coast.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security experts told ABC News the FBI, which is leading the investigation into the kidnapping, is working to get in contact with the kidnappers -- a process that former FBI special agent Brad Garrett, an ABC News consultant, said could take days, depending on whether the FBI has had dealings with the kidnappers or known intermediaries in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">But before all this started, just last month the International Maritime Organization sent a letter to all its members reiterating the "gravity of the issue of piracy and armed robbery against ships in the Gulf of Guinea," where the American ship was when it came under attack, "and the extreme violence exhibited" there.</seg>
<seg id="8">Statistics showed that pirate attacks, while down the world over, have sharply jumped in the Gulf of Guinea this year -- assaults allegedly perpetrated by criminal gangs who are looking for cargo ships with commodities or seeking hostages to ransom.</seg>
<seg id="9">The letter discussed kidnappings along with brazen thefts of large ships' cargo, in which vessels are hijacked for several days to facilitate the laborious transfer of cargo onto the pirate's ship.</seg>
<seg id="10">"That sort of criminal activity takes effective planning and coordination, logistical organization, technical knowhow and material support on a scale that strongly argues for something higher than random chance piracy being in play," said a maritime security source at sea near where the Americans were kidnapped.</seg>
<seg id="11">The letter sent by the IMO also called attention to some "interim guidelines" urgently developed by organizations supported by NATO for mariners operating in the Gulf of Guinea, which includes an eerily specific warning about kidnapping, considering the C-Retriever's case:</seg>
<seg id="12">Kidnapping -- generally associated with the offshore oil industry and the political instability of the Niger Delta area.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are several instances of offshore supply vessels and occasionally other ship types being attacked.</seg>
<seg id="14">The guidelines instructed ship owners in low-tech ways to defend against piracy, including everything from keeping radio communications to a minimum to physically blocking potential entry points.</seg>
<seg id="15">The guidelines also suggest turning of the ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS), which can be used by pirates to hone in on the ship's location, but the document emphasizes that the AIS be turned back on "immediately" if the ship is boarded, presumably to aid in a possible rescue.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the time the guidelines were written at the beginning of 2013, they noted that the "pirate business model" in the Gulf of Guinea "does not primarily involve kidnap for ransom, therefore the crew of a ship does not in itself represent the 'value.'"</seg>
<seg id="17">But the guidelines said that pirates in the Gulf of Guinea were more violent than the Somalia-based pirates on the other side of the African continent -- a much more publicized hotbed of piracy -- and instructed crewmembers "not to engage in a fight with the pirates, because this will entail great risk of the crew getting hurt or killed."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Great care needs to be taken if your ship is boarded, as life is little valued by robbers," the guidelines say.</seg>
<seg id="19">Compliance/submission to attackers is essential once a vessel has been taken.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jack Cloonan, a former senior FBI agent now with Clayton Consultants, which specializes in international piracy, kidnapping and extortion, told ABC News Thursday the fact that the attackers reportedly singled out the Americans showed that the kidnappers do attach some value, at least monetary, to those lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If you take the Americans, you get a good price, but at the same time you bring a lot of heat on you too," Cloonan said .</seg>
<seg id="22">The initial demands will probably be ridiculously high and you can infer from that who you are dealing with.</seg>
<seg id="23">Are these people skilled?</seg>
<seg id="24">Do they have professional negotiators?...</seg>
<seg id="25">Do we know who this group is and is their end game actually money?</seg>
<seg id="26">Because if it is, I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="27">I'm pleased and now I know it can be a negotiable end.</seg>
<seg id="28">Neither the victims nor the attackers have been publicly identified.</seg>
<seg id="29">The company that owns the targeted ship, Edison Chouest Offshore, did not respond to comment Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="30">Representatives for both the White House and the State Department said Thursday their respective departments were "closely monitoring" the situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">A black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tea party is aghast.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.</seg>
<seg id="11">This really is a must for our nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is not a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars get many more miles to the gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
<seg id="25">California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People are paying more directly into what they are getting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is looking into one.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="49">The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.</seg>
<seg id="63">An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.</seg>

<seg id="2">Macquarie is getting out while debate continues over a second airport.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Rick Stevens</seg>
<seg id="4">Macquarie Bank will finally walk away from Sydney Airport after deciding to offload its cornerstone stake, ending an 11-year tie that has led to it reaping hundreds of millions of dollars in fees and dividends.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank's decision to hand $1.4 billion of shares in Australia's largest airport to its own shareholders comes at a critical time for the airport's owners, which are trying to play down the need for a second airport in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Abbott government has promised to name a site for a second airport within its first term.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also puts an end to speculation that Macquarie has been trying to engineer a takeover for the airport to enable it to sell its cornerstone stake at a premium.</seg>
<seg id="8">After unveiling a $501 million half-year profit on Friday, Macquarie said it would give its shareholders one share in the airport for each bank share they own.</seg>
<seg id="9">With an 18.6 per cent stake, the bank is the airport's largest shareholder and will book a $377 million gain on the handout of shares.</seg>
<seg id="10">Macquarie's grip on the airport stretches back to 2002, when the Howard government sold a 99-year lease on the monopoly asset to a consortium led by the bank for $5.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bank's satellite airport fund emerged with an 83 per cent stake, and any concerns that it had overpaid for the airport quickly evaporated as the asset was squeezed hard.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Sydney Airport has been a pretty important asset for Macquarie ... [and] it is very clear that they have done very well out of it," Legg Mason research analyst Andrew Chambers said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The handover of shares to Macquarie investors was also seen as being "tax efficient" because a sale of the stake would have incurred capital gains tax.</seg>
<seg id="14">"By handing it over to investors ... [individual Macquarie shareholders] should avoid paying any tax until they decide to exit the investment," Mr Chambers said.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the seven years after the airport was privatised, Macquarie received tens of millions in management fees from its satellite fund, which owned the bulk of the airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2009, the bank was paid a $345 million fee from Macquarie Airports for severing management ties, yet the airport continued to use Macquarie as an adviser.</seg>
<seg id="17">The airport disclosed in August that it would fork out $54 million in advisory fees and stamp duty to simplify its complex structure, but it declined to reveal how much of that was to be paid to Macquarie.</seg>
<seg id="18">While the links are about to be severed, several of the airport's managers are former Macquarie executives, including boss Kerrie Mather.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It will be interesting to see whether Sydney Airport changes the way it does anything," said one analyst.</seg>
<seg id="20">When it comes to appointing managers, will so many of them come from the Macquarie stable?</seg>
<seg id="21">Despite losing the backing of Macquarie, the airport is still well connected in Canberra.</seg>
<seg id="22">Its chairman, Max Moore-Wilton, was a secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under John Howard.</seg>
<seg id="23">The latest deal still needs the approval of Macquarie shareholders next month.</seg>
<seg id="24">Macquarie chief executive Nicholas Moore said on Friday it was a "good time" to distribute airport shares to the bank's shareholders so they could "directly participate in its ownership."</seg>

<seg id="7">Oracle and Red Hat are pitching in as well as Michael Dickerson, an engineer on leave from Google, according to a blog post Thursday by Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Most of us want to see our government operating efficiently and effectively and it is incumbent upon us to help them do that," Ellison said.</seg>

<seg id="11">He is now working directly with QSSI, the general contractor hired to upgrade Healthcare.gov, Bataille said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany over US surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."</seg>
<seg id="9">Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.</seg>
<seg id="14">If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.</seg>
<seg id="16">However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."</seg>
<seg id="17">Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
<seg id="18">The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."</seg>

<seg id="1">Roy Hill partners forced to stump up $624 million</seg>
<seg id="2">Shareholders in Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill project have tipped in a further $624 million over recent months in a bid to keep the project going until debt funding can be secured.</seg>
<seg id="3">The extra payments were described in Roy Hill's annual results, which were published by ASIC over the past 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="4">The big iron ore project, which is being developed by Mrs Rinehart in partnership with Korean steel giant Posco, Japan's Marubeni and China Steel Corporation, had originally hoped to have its $US7-billion debt package secured by March.</seg>
<seg id="5">But that process is still under way, meaning the joint venture partners were asked to pay further instalments on their stakes sooner rather than later.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The directors resolved that further calls on partly paid shares be made sufficient to meet existing current commitments in order to progress project activities," the company said in its full year results.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the quarter ended September 30, 2013, call notices totalling $624,000,000 were made and paid by shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mrs Rinehart's main company, Hancock Prospecting, will own 70 per cent of the project.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Roy Hill debt package is expected to include $US3 billion from commercial banks and the organisation does much of its banking with NAB.</seg>
<seg id="10">A further $US4 billion is expected to be supplied by the export credit agencies of nations such as South Korea, the US and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="11">Roy Hill reiterated that securing the debt package was central to the project taking the next step.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The group intends to continue its principal activities as set out above during the year, with any change dependent [among other factors] on the progress of the debt capital raising," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The debt is planned to be finalised before Christmas and first ore shipped before the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="14">JPMorgan recently predicted that Roy Hill would go ahead, but with a minimum six-month delay.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A debt package of that order of magnitude may be difficult to secure without a further potential sell-down of the project," it said in a research note.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mining companies often record several years of losses before they come into production, and Roy Hill has proved no different, reporting a loss of $315 million for the year to June 30, 2013.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenpeace activists detained in Russia are transported to St Petersburg</seg>
<seg id="2">Environmental activists detained since September in Russia due to a protest against the planned oil production in the Arctic have been airlifted from Murmansk to St Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">The AFP agency reported this today, referring to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also says that the activists’ original charges of piracy have not yet been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Greenpeace International understands from diplomatic sources that the thirty men and women detained by Russia following a peaceful protest against an Arctic oil platform are being moved from a detention centre in Murmansk to a jail in St Petersburg," reported the organisation in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reasons for moving the detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA agency it was a planned move.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authorities initially accused the environmentalists of piracy, for which, in the event of conviction, they would face up to 15 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, last week it was announced that this would be replaced with a more moderate charge of hooliganism, for which they would face a reduced sentence with a maximum sentence of seven years.</seg>
<seg id="9">In today’s statement, however, Greenpeace pointed out that the piracy charge had not yet been withdrawn as promised.</seg>
<seg id="10">Reportedly, this means that the detainees are now accused of two offences.</seg>
<seg id="11">The powerful Investigative Committee last week announced that the piracy charge would be replaced with the hooliganism charge.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when the thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the piracy charge was not dropped.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead each of them was served with the additional charge," said AFP, quoting the Greenpeace statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">In mid-September, Russia detained thirty members of Greenpeace from 18 countries at a Gazprom oil rig.</seg>
<seg id="15">The environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which was sailing under a Dutch flag.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they did file an appeal, but the court rejected them all.</seg>
<seg id="17">The environmentalists have complained about conditions in prison.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to AFP, Greenpeace’s executive director Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St Petersburg would make it easier for the detainees to meet with their families and consular staff.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They could in fact be worse," she warned.</seg>
<seg id="21">Faiza Oulahsen, one of the detained activists, asked Dutch King Willem-Alexander for help.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a handwritten letter, published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to discuss their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court reinstates part of Texas abortion law</seg>
<seg id="2">By Dana Ford, CNN</seg>
<seg id="3">November 1, 2013 -- Updated 0210 GMT (1010 HKT)</seg>
<seg id="4">NEW: Gov. Perry: We will do everything we can to "protect a culture of life" in Texas</seg>
<seg id="5">A judge blocked the law's admitting privileges requirement Monday</seg>
<seg id="6">"This fight is far from over," says a leading abortion-rights activist</seg>
<seg id="7">The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster</seg>
<seg id="8">(CNN) -- A federal appeals court Thursday reinstated a key part of a new Texas abortion law, considered to be among the most restrictive in the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision came three days after a federal judge struck down the provision, which requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services.</seg>
<seg id="10">A day before parts of the law were scheduled to take effect, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel on Monday issued an injunction blocking the law's admitting privileges requirement, arguing that it "places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her."</seg>
<seg id="11">Thursday's decision means the requirement will remain in place while a lawsuit moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="12">The lawsuit -- filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas -- alleged the state's new abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a statement, Planned Parenthood Federation of America said the requirement that doctors have admitting privileges is expected to cause at least one-third of the state's licensed health centers that provide abortion services to stop.</seg>
<seg id="14">"While we acknowledge that Planned Parenthood has also made a strong showing that their interests would be harmed by staying the injunction, given the State's likely success on the merits, this is not enough, standing alone, to outweigh the other factors," read a part of Thursday's 20-page ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</seg>
<seg id="15">The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Gov. Rick Perry then called the Legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="17">This fight is far from over.</seg>
<seg id="18">"This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion statewide," said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood.</seg>
<seg id="19">"If Texans showed America one thing during the historic protests against this law this summer, we demonstrated that Texans value women's health - and that is why we will take every step we can to protect the health of Texas women in the wake of this ruling," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Perry cheered the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="21">Today's decision affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of Texas.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We will continue doing everything we can to protect a culture of life in our state," he said in a statement.</seg>

<seg id="1">California woman who killed pimp as teen is free on parole</seg>
<seg id="2">LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California woman who served nearly two decades in prison for killing her pimp at age 16 was released on parole on Thursday, after becoming the face of a campaign to reform the treatment of young offenders.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sara Kruzan, 35, left the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla before dawn, state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesman Luis Patino said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kruzan was taken to Orange County in Southern California, where she will live, and processed at a parole office, Patino said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Earlier this week, when California Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, upheld her parole, the decision was hailed as a watershed moment by lawmakers and activists who had fought on her behalf for more than five years.</seg>
<seg id="6">State Senator Leland Yee called Kruzan the poster child for a bill that became law this year, allowing offenders sentenced to life without parole for crimes committed before age 18 the chance to petition for a new hearing on their sentence.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kruzan, who advocates say was raised by an abusive, drug-addicted single mother, said in a 2009 Human Rights Watch video that she was sexually assaulted at age 11 by George Howard, the man she would later kill.</seg>
<seg id="8">Within two years, Howard had her working as a child prostitute.</seg>
<seg id="9">In March 1994, then 16-year-old Kruzan shot him to death in a motel room in Riverside, California.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kruzan lost a bid to stand trial as a juvenile and a Riverside County jury found her guilty of first-degree murder.</seg>
<seg id="11">A judge sentenced her to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Human Rights Watch video, in which she expresses remorse for the crime and describes her grim life as a prostitute, drew widespread attention to her case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The year after the video was released, then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, commuted her prison sentence to 25 years to life, which made her eligible to be considered for parole.</seg>
<seg id="14">Earlier this year, the California Board of Parole Hearings found her suitable for release, sending their recommendation to Brown, who notified the board on Monday that he would not intervene to stop her from being released.</seg>

<seg id="3">LIVINGSTON, N.J. - New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie launched his final sprint to Election Day with a bus tour Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">With seven stops at diners and community centers, the tour felt more like a victory lap than the last days of a campaign.</seg>
<seg id="5">Brother, are you coming Tuesday night?</seg>

<seg id="10">It makes it different.</seg>

<seg id="12">The flier displayed the Haitian flag and read, "Haitians for Christie" above a photo of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were two other photos displayed on the flier: President Obama and Senator-elect Cory Booker.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Governor Christie and President Obama care about our interests," the flier reads.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's something sure to make national Republicans shiver, but Christie just thanked and hugged Napoleon while a woman read the flier in Creole to a beaming Christie.</seg>
<seg id="16">"For me, I don't consider him Republican," Napoleon said.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don't care about party.</seg>
<seg id="18">I care about heart.</seg>
<seg id="19">He's got heart.</seg>
<seg id="20">Christie told ABC News at his fourth stop of the day at the Nevada Diner in Bloomfield that his "job is to run as hard as I can, get as many votes as I can."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Run as hard as I can and be as inclusive as I can," Christie said.</seg>
<seg id="22">You want to win as many votes as you can.</seg>
<seg id="23">When asked if that's a message Republicans throughout the country should take note of, Christie turned coy, an adjective not usually applied to the governor.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I think every candidate has to make their own choices about what their message is, and part of the problem is they worry too much," Christie said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Everyone's got to make their own decisions, and what people want is for you to say what you feel from your heart and to be authentic, and so I'm not going to suggest what other people should be saying or doing.</seg>
<seg id="26">I say and do what I'm comfortable with.</seg>
<seg id="27">You know, if it works for other people, good for them, but they've got to believe in it.</seg>
<seg id="28">I believe what I'm talking about.</seg>
<seg id="29">In August, Christie spoke at the Republican National Committee's summer meeting in Boston, and his message to the party was the GOP "needs to win," not just talk, a message he is sure to push if he decides to run for president in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="30">And to win, Republicans will of course need Democrats on board.</seg>
<seg id="31">I don't care what you read in the newspapers about these polls.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Polls are wonderful, and heck, I'm very happy to be ahead in the polls, but that does not mean you are relieved from your duty of going out to vote on Tuesday," Christie told a large group of senior citizens at the Fairlawn Senior Center on his third stop Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="33">Who you vote for matters.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's not necessarily about the party it's about the person, and you need to make a judgment who is going to represent you best, who is going to make you proud, who is going to have your interests at stake.</seg>
<seg id="35">He told the group that he knows not everyone is going to agree with him on everything, saying with a smile, "You know this, you're from here."</seg>
<seg id="36">The only person you agree with all the time is you.</seg>
<seg id="37">You never agree with everybody.</seg>
<seg id="38">That shouldn't be the test.</seg>
<seg id="39">Vicky Kalmus came to see Christie at his first stop with her husband, Michael, and sister, Valerie Kolodin.</seg>
<seg id="40">Kalmus said she too sees Christie as "bipartisan," and her husband said Christie's "plain talk" is something the country needs.</seg>
<seg id="41">Christie's fifth stop was an Indian-American community center and restaurant called Chowpatty in India Square in Iselin.</seg>
<seg id="42">The shops were selling Indian food and elaborate Indian-style dresses, and the corner where Christie's campaign bus would pull up was packed with supporters, almost all Indian-Americans.</seg>
<seg id="43">Viru Patel, the secretary of the Indian Business Association, described himself as a "very staunch Democrat" as he waited for Christie's bus.</seg>
<seg id="44">"But, as far as our governor is concerned, at this time we are going to support Gov. Christie," Patel said.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the aftermath of Sandy he did a really great job. ... I think New Jersey came back.</seg>
<seg id="46">He did an excellent job that way.</seg>
<seg id="47">Patel added, as almost every person ABC News interviewed Wednesday said too: "Really, he says what he thinks."</seg>
<seg id="48">That's what it is.</seg>
<seg id="49">So why are Democrats supporting Christie in such large numbers?</seg>
<seg id="50">John Weingart, the associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said it's not just because people want to be with the winner, although it does factor in.</seg>
<seg id="51">"I think people are seeing him as a leader and that seems to be a desired quality that trumps some policy differences that Democrats may have with him," Weingart said.</seg>
<seg id="52">He gives the impression of someone who is completely in charge of state government and running it well and making decisions. ... People are hungry for that in a politician or in an elected official.</seg>
<seg id="53">Weingart added that it has been the "prevailing wisdom" that Christie would be re-elected.</seg>
<seg id="54">Democratic local officials obviously want to be on the good side of the governor if it can help their constituents and themselves.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Then there is a snowball effect," Weingart said, referring to all the other elected Democrats who jumped on board.</seg>
<seg id="56">The RNC is also helping the Christie campaign with minority outreach in the state, spending more than a half-million dollars on voter outreach to Hispanic and African-American voters.</seg>
<seg id="57">It has two Hispanic outreach offices in both the northern and southern parts of the state, and each office has one staff member.</seg>
<seg id="58">Nationally, they have 16 Hispanic engagement staffers in eight states, including New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="59">Izzy Santa, the RNC's director of Hispanic communications, just got back from a week in the Garden State and said, "We are competing for every vote."</seg>
<seg id="60">The RNC says with the Christie campaign and the state GOP, it has reached out to 30 percent of the state's Hispanic voters.</seg>
<seg id="61">"We are showing up and engaging with the community," Santa said.</seg>
<seg id="62">Christie has done very, very well with the (Hispanic) voting bloc, and he wants to do very well in a week.</seg>
<seg id="63">The RNC has spent $1.5 million in total on behalf of Christie here.</seg>
<seg id="64">Earlier at the Ritz Diner in Livingston, the owner, Marion Feldman, said excitedly that Christie grew up at the restaurant, and the governor's high school friends were camped out at a large table in the back.</seg>
<seg id="65">Jay Isherwood said he "didn't go as far in the political world as (Christie) did," although they met on the same campaign.</seg>
<seg id="66">"I think what surprises me is the amount of national attention that New Jersey gets as a result of Chris Christie," Isherwood said.</seg>
<seg id="67">Politically, I think the Republicans are making a huge mistake by not rallying 100 percent behind Chris Christie. ... They are saying and doing things that are very, very foolish, because he's got the future and if they want to be part of the future they need to straighten themselves out.</seg>
<seg id="68">It's Tom Kean who Christie says is his political mentor, and it's no secret Christie would love to replicate Kean's 1985 gubernatorial win when he beat his opponent by a historic margin: 71 percent to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="69">Weingart said Christie's sway with Democrats was "unusual, but not unprecedented," mentioning Kean.</seg>
<seg id="70">"Tom Kean when he was elected carried all but three municipalities," Weingart said.</seg>
<seg id="71">There are 566 municipalities in New Jersey, so he was able to win places like Newark and Camden, which would normally be inconceivable that they would go to anyone but a Democrat. ... Christie said all along he could never exceed that margin, and we will see.</seg>
<seg id="72">The Democratic Governor's Association spokesman Danny Kanner wouldn't comment on the number of Democrats who have backed Christie but said his record is "defined by economic failure."</seg>
<seg id="73">"Barbara Buono is a strong candidate who understands the struggles of the middle-class and, unlike Christie, lines up with the state on such issues as raising the minimum wage, marriage equality, gun safety and women's health," Kanner said.</seg>
<seg id="74">This will serve Sen. Buono well as voters focus on the issues in the campaign's final days.</seg>

<seg id="4">PORT Adelaide coach Ken Hinkley remains in hospital under observation but the club is confident he will bounce back enough to make a contribution over the phone in the Power's match against North Melbourne in Hobart on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Power director of coaching Alan Richardson will lead the team after Hinkley was admitted to hospital on Wednesday night.</seg>
<seg id="6">Richardson last night said said he would be following Hinkley's game plan to the letter, and expected to be in touch with him throughout the match.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm just the mouthpiece.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It'll certainly be very much still Ken's message," Richardson told Fox Footy.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the game was here in Adelaide, he'd be coaching the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's just the fact that there's a flight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Port chief executive Keith Thomas expects Hinkley to make a full recovery but the club would not take any risks with his health.</seg>
<seg id="12">"He had really severe back pain ... we were thinking it was something like kidney stones," Thomas said.</seg>
<seg id="13">They kept him in overnight.</seg>
<seg id="14">""As it turns out it was a virus, which has caused some inflammation internally.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's nothing to be concerned about.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's pain-free today.</seg>
<seg id="17">They kept him overnight and they're monitoring him but he's well.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thomas predicted Hinkley would be in close contact with his coaching panel up until the first siren.</seg>
<seg id="19">After consultation with our club doctor Damian Newberry it has been advised that Ken should not fly this weekend while he overcomes the effects of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="20">We expect Ken to make a full and speedy recovery.</seg>
<seg id="21">"In fact, if our game was played in Adelaide this week he more than likely would have coached.""</seg>
<seg id="22">Four decisions that triggered Port's resurgence</seg>
<seg id="23">Thomas said Richardson was a logical replacement.</seg>
<seg id="24">""We've often said Ken and Alan are very similar in the way they think about the game and in terms of their philosophies," Thomas said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The club has total confidence that Alan can fill in for Ken this week and lead the team well.</seg>
<seg id="26">He has vast coaching experience in his own right and has worked closely with Ken here at Port Adelaide on game style and structures since day one of preseason.</seg>
<seg id="27">""Most importantly, Alan has the complete respect and confidence of the playing group and coaching staff and we are confident that his transition as senior coach for this week will be seamless."</seg>

<seg id="1">US airline regulator relaxes rules on using gadgets in flight</seg>
<seg id="2">©Dreamstime</seg>
<seg id="3">Smaller devices are likely to become more popular on planes because larger laptops will still have to be stowed during take-off and landing</seg>
<seg id="4">Like passengers who have seen the "fasten seat belts" sign turned off, airlines raced to ditch restrictions on the use of electronics after US regulators relaxed rules that have forced millions of passengers to stow tablets, smartphones and ereaders for take-off.</seg>
<seg id="5">Delta Air Lines said it expected to have clearance as soon as Friday to apply the new rules on 570 of its mainline domestic aircraft, while JetBlue said it would implement changes "immediately" once it received approval.</seg>
<seg id="6">The airlines powered down their old rules after the Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday a report had shown most commercial aircraft could withstand radio interference from personal electronics.</seg>
<seg id="7">Provided airlines could show their aircraft would cope safely, it was safe to use small, handheld devices from "gate to gate" during flights, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, passengers can still expect a stern look from a flight attendant if they try to make a phone call.</seg>
<seg id="9">The FAA gave no consideration to allowing use of gadgets communicating with outside voice or data networks.</seg>
<seg id="10">The signals involved with such use are stronger and more likely to interfere with aircraft systems - and regulation of such networks is beyond the FAA's remit.</seg>
<seg id="11">IN Transport</seg>
<seg id="12">Anthony Foxx, US transportation secretary, said the decision reflected both the US government's commitment to safety and consumers" increasing desire to use their devices during "all phases" of their flights.</seg>
<seg id="13">"These guidelines reflect input from passengers, pilots, manufacturers and flight attendants, and I look forward to seeing airlines implement these much-anticipated guidelines in the near future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless, harassed business travellers are still likely to have some respite from answering the boss's emails.</seg>
<seg id="15">Delta said its aircraft WiFi systems would start working only above 10,000 feet - which is also the current lower limit for use of electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="16">Other airlines are likely to take a similar approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">There would still be rare instances, such as a landing in low visibility, when passengers would be asked to turn off all devices, the FAA warned.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, once an airline had verified its fleet's tolerance of electronic devices, it could generally let passengers use handheld, lightweight electronic devices - such as tablets, ereaders, and smartphones - at all altitudes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rules could push passengers towards iPads and other tablet computers.</seg>
<seg id="20">The FAA said larger computers such as laptops would still need to be stowed for take-off and landing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Global Business Travel Association said business travellers would applaud the FAA's recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="22">"These busy road warriors will take every opportunity to stay connected with their customers and partners - the key to success," it said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two Versions of a Dominican Tale</seg>
<seg id="2">Re "Dominicans of Haitian Descent Cast Into Legal Limbo by Court" (front page, Oct.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unlike the United States, the Dominican Republic does not grant citizenship to all those born within its jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Constitutional Tribunal's ruling this year merely confirms previous court rulings and efforts by the authorities to improve compliance.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Dominican Republic has a legitimate interest in regulating immigration and having clear rules for acquisition of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="6">It should not be pressured by outside actors and other countries to implement measures contrary to its own Constitution and that would be unacceptable to most other nations facing similar immigration pressures.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Dominican government is fully aware of the plight of the children of illegal Haitian migrants born in the country who lack identity documents.</seg>
<seg id="8">This does not, however, render them stateless.</seg>
<seg id="9">As your article says, Haiti's Constitution bestows citizenship on any person born of Haitian parents anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">A key component of the Constitutional Tribunal's ruling was a mandate to provide people affected with temporary residence permits until a regularization plan is in place.</seg>
<seg id="11">These allow them to remain and work in the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Each case will be carefully examined and subject to judicial due process.</seg>
<seg id="13">Speculation about mass deportations that I have heard is therefore baseless.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Dominican Republic and Haiti may have a fractious history.</seg>
<seg id="15">Recent events, including the solidarity shown by Dominican society after the earthquake of 2010, have shown, however, that for the most part the countries are looking to the future, engaged in the hard task of finding joint solutions to common challenges.</seg>
<seg id="16">ANÍBAL DE CASTRO Ambassador of the Dominican Republic Washington, Oct.</seg>
<seg id="17">For any who thought that there was a new Dominican Republic, a modern state leaving behind the abuse and racism of the past, the highest court in the country has taken a huge step backward with Ruling 0168-13.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to this ruling, the Dominicans born to undocumented parents are to have their citizenship revoked.</seg>
<seg id="19">The ruling, retroactive to 1929, affects an estimated 200,000 Dominican people of Haitian descent, including many who have had no personal connection with Haiti for several generations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such appalling racism is a continuation of a history of constant abuse, including the infamous Dominican massacre, under the dictator Rafael Trujillo, of an estimated 20,000 Haitians in five days in October 1937.</seg>
<seg id="21">One of the important lessons of the Holocaust is that the first step to genocide is to strip a people of their right to citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="22">What will happen now to these 200,000 people - stateless with no other country to go to?</seg>
<seg id="23">The ruling will make it challenging for them to study; to work in the formal sector of the economy; to get insurance; to pay into their pension fund; to get married legally; to open bank accounts; and even to leave the country that now rejects them if they cannot obtain or renew their passport.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is an instantly created underclass set up for abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">How should the world react?</seg>
<seg id="26">Haven't we learned after Germany, the Balkans and South Africa that we cannot accept institutionalized racism?</seg>

<seg id="1">How Tipsport (does not) delete personal data.</seg>
<seg id="2">More than a year ago, I registered on the Tipsport.cz website.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, I did not finish it because at the branch there happened to be someone there who did not know how to complete internet registration.</seg>
<seg id="4">And since I didn’t want to travel to another branch, the registration fell through, then I moved and because of that my address and the number of my ID card changed.</seg>
<seg id="5">When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it wasn’t possible because I had a different ID card number and address and that it just wasn’t possible to complete it and that I should ask for my data to be deleted and do a new registration.</seg>
<seg id="6">So I did that and on 24 October 2013 I wrote to the technical support to request they delete all my personal data from the database according to the current personal data protection act.</seg>
<seg id="7">The next day the technical support wrote to tell me that I had to complete my registration at the branch.</seg>
<seg id="8">This started an email marathon with the technical support, where, in the end, after the 4th demand on 25 October they wrote that they had deleted the personal data as per my request.</seg>
<seg id="9">You would therefore think that you could do that new registration but the problems started again,  first I was told that my username was already taken (I understand that it hadn’t been deleted – it's not personal data, but in the end they removed that too).</seg>
<seg id="10">So I used another username and was told that they already have my personal data saved, and that I should complete registration at a branch (how can they have saved something they say they have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.</seg>
<seg id="11">In response to my question of how it was possible, they wrote that they really had deleted the personal data on 25 October and that I should send an email with the error.</seg>
<seg id="12">I did that (yesterday around 3pm) and today they replied that I had registered on that same day (31 October 2013) at 1:22pm and that was why it would not work, because I had used the same name and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="13">What does it matter that I have been in contact with technical support for a week already and I have been trying to sort out with them why it still isn’t working?</seg>
<seg id="14">And what does it matter that if what they say is true (and it isn’t), someone with the same name or date of birth could not register if it is already registered.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the way, at 1:22pm, I did register, with the same name and date of birth, but I used a made-up email and phone number, and lo and behold, a page appeared saying they had sent a link to complete registration to my email.</seg>
<seg id="16">But how is it possible when it isn’t possible to register with the same name and date of birth?</seg>
<seg id="17">Probably because Tipsport ties registration to an email and phone number and the data just has not been removed like they said.</seg>
<seg id="18">So I told technical support this again, that they are just lying (either intentionally or they don’t know what they’re writing), because what they write is not true.</seg>
<seg id="19">I provided evidence with several screenshots that the registration problem existed before 31 October, so the "fake" registration for this simply has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="20">To that, Tipsport replied with a curt sentence – I’m sorry but as you are now re-registered, we cannot investigate your claim.</seg>
<seg id="21">And ended the communication.</seg>
<seg id="22">Or rather, it is repeating the same line over and over, that the registration is tied to the name and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="23">They cannot even accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it did not actually take place.</seg>
<seg id="24">To sum up then, not only Tipsport did not delete data as it claims, but it is lying when it says otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="25">What is worse, it can easily be proven that they are lying and trying to make it look like the error is on the customer’s side.</seg>
<seg id="26">By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got moving a little and an email came from the technical support saying that the matter was being forwarded for investigation and I would be informed about it (after a week of sending reminders and arguing and alerting them to the same error).</seg>

<seg id="2">He said: "By creating such barriers films, we are able to extend lifetime and reliability of electronic devices."</seg>
<seg id="3">Most electronic devices such as mobile phones have films that are sprayed onto electronic components to protect them from water vapour in the air and make them splash resistant.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, these can add bulk to components and tiny imperfections in the way these are created can allow water to get through, meaning they are not totally waterproof.</seg>
<seg id="5">To protect devices such as mobile phones and cameras from water, a separate case needs to be used.</seg>
<seg id="6">Professor Graham, who is presenting his findings to the American Vacuum Society's International Symposium and Exhibition, has developed a technique known as atomic layer deposition to create better barriers against water.</seg>
<seg id="7">By surrounding components with gaseous atoms from a metal like aluminium, they form a layer over the electronics which is then oxidised.</seg>
<seg id="8">This oxide layer, which is only 10 nanometres thick - around 6,000 times thinner than the width of a human hair - is prevents water from getting to the sensitive electronics underneath.</seg>
<seg id="9">In one recent study, Professor submerged electronic sensors in water for 10 days after coating them in the atomic film.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coatings can also be transparent, meaning they can also be used in electronic displays like those found on smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="11">It could mean that ordinary cameras and mobile phones can be used underwater without coming to any harm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Professor Graham believes the new coatings could also be used to help protect implantable biomedical devices such as pace makers and underwater sensors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Homeland Security workers taking home unearned overtime pay</seg>
<seg id="2">1 (UPI) -- Homeland Security workers routinely take home overtime pay even if they haven't earned it, a report from the federal Office of Special Counsel indicates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Workers can add up to 25 percent to their paycheck from what the employees call the "candy bowl," The Washington Post reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The OSC said the money, from Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime, is meant for urgent work often done by law enforcement agents.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Homeland Security has wasted $8.7 million per year with misuse of the funds, the OSC said in its report.</seg>
<seg id="6">These are not border patrol guys chasing bad guys who can't stop what they are doing and fill out paperwork for overtime.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are not questioning that," Carolyn Lerner, OSC special counsel, said.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are employees sitting at their desks, collecting overtime because it's become a culturally acceptable practice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard said authorities have ordered a review of how AUO is used and whether it complies with laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">"DHS takes seriously its responsibility to ensure proper use of taxpayer funds," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">While many frontline officers and agents across the department require work hour flexibility, often through the use of Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO), misuse of these funds is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Safety record mars FMG results</seg>
<seg id="2">WORKERS at Andrew Forrest's iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group are twice as likely to get injured on the job than workers at Rio Tinto's neighbouring iron ore network, with a spate of recent incidents putting new focus on Fortescue's safety culture and procedures as it works to complete a rapid expansion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The death of an electrician in August and the amputation of a truck driver's leg late last month at Fortescue's Christmas Creek iron ore mine have cast a shadow over an otherwise strong recent operating and financial performance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Improving output, falling production costs and persistently healthy iron ore prices have pushed Fortescue shares up by more than 75 per cent since late June.</seg>
<seg id="5">But statistics published by Fortescue in recent weeks put the total recordable injury frequency rate across the company's operations at 7.7 per million hours worked in the September quarter.</seg>
<seg id="6">That compares with Rio Tinto's "all injury frequency rate" -- which includes other lesser injuries and incidents not captured in Fortescue's data -- at its iron ore operations last year of just 3.7 per million hours worked.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fortescue's injury rate was closer to that of BHP Billiton, which posted a total recordable injury frequency rate for its Australasian operations this year of 6.5 per million hours worked.</seg>
<seg id="8">Despite the higher injury rates, Fortescue's director of external relations, Isak Buitendag, said he believed the company was on the right path towards improving its safety record.</seg>
<seg id="9">We recognise we need to keep on improving.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We're very proud of our improvement . . . and we certainly are extremely focused on improving further," Mr Buitendag told The Australian.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are going to keep on that course to deliver the further improvement we know we can make.</seg>
<seg id="12">While Fortescue's total recordable injury rate remains higher than its peers, the 7.7 rate posted in the September quarter compares with the 14.4 recorded by the group in 2011 and 9.2 last year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Compared with BHP and Rio, which have been operating in the Pilbara for decades, Fortescue has a much higher proportion of its workforce devoted to construction.</seg>
<seg id="14">The nature of construction sites and the higher number of workers employed during that phase make construction more dangerous than steady-state operations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The death of electrician Kurt Williams, 24, at a Christmas Creek crushing plant in August was the first fatality in WA's mining sector in almost two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fortescue removed contractor Mineral Resources from the site, with the company believed to be willing to take similar action with other contractors who don't meet expectations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Electrical Trades Union WA secretary Les McLaughlan said the crushing plant where Williams died had long been a source of concern and the union had made repeated warnings to Fortescue about the facility.</seg>
<seg id="18">There had also been incidents of bullying and intimidation between union members and contractors, he said, while Fortescue's two key mines had had poor reputations for safety during their construction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I do know that Christmas Creek and Cloud Break had a very bad name in the first stage and second stage of those projects," Mr McLaughlan said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recent safety incidents at Christmas Creek also prompted a number of online complaints from individuals purporting to be current or ex-employees at the mine.</seg>
<seg id="21">A number of comments on the Mining Australia website described Christmas Creek as a "dangerous" and "cowboy run" operation where production was prioritised over safety.</seg>

<seg id="1">Can Czech Television ever make do without petitions?</seg>
<seg id="2">It stepped into the era of President Zeman with the legendary scene with the ash tray, so it is not hard to hear the complaints it collects with documents favouring the castle entourage.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the past, the impact of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was not documented by anyone in such a way, let alone was it signed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The truth is, the editors stood up for the management.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cases described, however, do not answer the question of where such affection for Zeman’s people on the part of certain journalists comes from – whether it is a reaction to a direct commission or, without using vulgarism, a typical expression of misplaced, empathic helpfulness.</seg>
<seg id="6">And when we are already assuming general corruptness, we cannot resist the question as to whether other, equally unscrupulous power interests, who have not yet had the opportunity, are seeking to change the conditions in the television.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those who say that in developed countries blatant attempts by politicians to intervene in broadcasting do not happen are right.</seg>
<seg id="8">The truth, however, is also that it does not mean that complaints about public media do not exist there.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those complaining do not call into question their independence.</seg>
<seg id="10">In contrast, they mainly criticise what they consider a bias, which is intrinsic to them, which is the fruit of their subculture.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dominican Republic citizenship ruling stirs outcry across Caribbean</seg>
<seg id="2">MEXICO CITY - The recent decision by the highest court in the Dominican Republic to cancel the citizenship of three generations of residents is meeting a firestorm of protest, with human rights advocates warning of a humanitarian nightmare for the entire Caribbean region.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Dominican Constitutional Court, citing the country's 2010 constitution, retroactively stripped the citizenship of people born after 1929 to parents without Dominican ancestry, declaring that they were residing in the country illegally or with temporary permits.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 200,000 people, most of them descendants of Haitians, may in effect be left stateless.</seg>
<seg id="5">Government officials and others could deprive them of a host of basic rights and services, including education and employment, activists say.</seg>
<seg id="6">"To be stateless means you don't have the right to vote, to go to school ... freedom of movement ... [access to] travel documents," Sarnata Reynolds, who handles statelessness issues at Refugees International, said Thursday during a panel discussion in Washington about the Dominican ruling.</seg>
<seg id="7">You're stuck in a legal limbo and in a location where you can't resolve your situation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some fear the Dominican Republic will embark on a mass deportation effort.</seg>
<seg id="9">But to where?</seg>
<seg id="10">Haiti and other Caribbean states would be under no obligation to recognize people who were born in the Dominican Republic as anything but Dominicans.</seg>
<seg id="11">After years of legal dispute and with Dominicans of Haitian descent already feeling prejudice, the court's ruling in late September came in connection with a case involving Juliana Dequis Pierre, born in the Dominican Republic to Haitian parents in 1984.</seg>
<seg id="12">When she attempted to apply for a voting card, authorities seized her birth certificate and told her she was not Dominican, her lawyers say.</seg>
<seg id="13">Her attempts to challenge those actions led to the high court's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is likely one of the most discriminatory decisions ever made by a superior tribunal," said Santiago A. Canton, director of the Partners for Human Rights program at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, which joined Dequis' legal team.</seg>
<seg id="15">The RFK center branded the ruling a case of "massive state-sponsored xenophobia."</seg>
<seg id="16">The court's judgment in September expands the definition of "in transit," a category of foreign-born people allowed to live in the Dominican Republic.</seg>
<seg id="17">It would consider people who have been in the Dominican Republic for decades "in transit" and their Dominican-born children and grandchildren ineligible for citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for Dominican President Danilo Medina said the government, stung by a wave of fierce criticism, would seek a "coherent and humanitarian" solution that attempts to respect people's rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the government also insisted that it had to obey and respect the highest court of the land.</seg>
<seg id="20">Eduardo Jorge Prats, a Dominican attorney and leading constitutional law expert, told The Times from Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, that the high court erred by ignoring judgments from regional bodies, foremost among them the Inter-American Human Rights Court.</seg>
<seg id="21">That body in 2005 told the Dominican Republic that it could not use the nationality of parents as pretext for taking citizenship from their children.</seg>
<seg id="22">The inter-American court's rulings are binding.</seg>
<seg id="23">At a meeting this week of the governing council of the Organization of American States, known normally for vapid diplomatic niceties, comments from Caribbean countries were particularly pointed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Haiti said the Dominican court's action was "truly alarming," and it was joined in the criticism by the 15-member Caribbean Community.</seg>
<seg id="25">La Celia Prince, the representative of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and current spokeswoman for the Caribbean bloc, condemned the ruling because it "strips tens of thousands of people of rights which they have enjoyed from birth and gives them no recourse to appeal."</seg>
<seg id="26">"It directly impacts the lives of fellow human beings, citizens of our hemisphere and more specifically of our diaspora," she said.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dominican Republic's representative reportedly tried to have the meeting canceled.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The neighbors are unhappy," Canton said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Haiti, especially, already a badly dysfunctional country, could not absorb the arrival of tens of thousands of people who don't speak its language, he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although many people inside and outside the Dominican Republic see the measure as racist and xenophobic, it has significant support in some domestic quarters among those who resent a large Haitian presence and what they see as outside interference, Jorge Prats said.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In the legal community, the decision has little support," he said in an email.</seg>
<seg id="32">But there is certain support in the population because conservative, authoritarian elites have promoted an anti-Haitianism since the times of Trujillo.</seg>
<seg id="33">Rafael Leonidas Trujillo was dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961.</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1937, though Haitians had been working the Dominican sugar cane fields for generations, Trujillo sought to drive them out by ordering the so-called Parsley massacre, which killed thousands of Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="35">A century earlier, it was a Haiti newly freed by rebelling slaves that brutally occupied the Dominican Republic.</seg>
<seg id="36">Tension between the two countries that share the Hispaniola island has festered continuously, with Dominicans especially begrudging Haitian immigrants, who have arrived in droves, driven by extreme poverty, political upheaval and, in 2010, one of the deadliest earthquakes on record.</seg>

<seg id="2">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.</seg>
<seg id="5">South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia's export routes through Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="7">Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."</seg>
<seg id="8">Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year's end.</seg>
<seg id="10">The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</seg>

<seg id="1">All you losing NFL teams, don't lose hope</seg>
<seg id="2">Kansas City hasn't lost.</seg>
<seg id="3">Jacksonville and Tampa Bay haven't won.</seg>
<seg id="4">Everybody else in the NFL has done a little of both.</seg>
<seg id="5">Heading into the midway point of the regular season, 19 of 32 teams are at .500 or below.</seg>
<seg id="6">That doesn't necessarily spell curtains for them, though.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since 2000, 32 teams have made the playoffs even though they didn't have a winning record at this point.</seg>
<seg id="8">At least one team has done that in each of the last 12 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">So the season is still wide open, and, as far as the playoff picture is concerned, there's a lot more clarity than parity.</seg>
<seg id="10">And questions persist:</seg>
<seg id="11">What is the season's biggest surprise so far?</seg>
<seg id="12">Kansas City is 8-0, the NFL's lone undefeated team.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Chiefs were a league-worst 2-14 last season, although with several Pro Bowl players on their roster they should have been better than that.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each of the 20 previous teams that started 8-0 in the Super Bowl era wound up making the playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, the toughest times are ahead for the Chiefs.</seg>
<seg id="16">The eight teams they have beaten are a combined 17-39 (.304) - none currently has a winning record - whereas their next eight opponents are 34-24 (.586).</seg>
<seg id="17">Upcoming games include two against Denver, two against San Diego, and what could be a pivotal game against Indianapolis in the second-to-last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most impressive division, top to bottom?</seg>
<seg id="19">Kansas City, Denver, San Diego and Oakland are a combined 22-8 (.733), meaning the group is in the running for the highest winning percentage by a division through the first nine weeks since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="20">The 1984 AFC West was 31-14 (.689) through nine weeks back when that division consisted of the Los Angeles Raiders, Denver, San Diego, Kansas City and Seattle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since realignment in 2003, the highest winning percentage by a division through the first nine weeks - when every team has played at least half its schedule - was 23-11 (.676) by the NFC East in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="22">What blockbuster game is coming soon?</seg>
<seg id="23">Kansas City at Denver in two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="24">If the Chiefs can come away with a victory, they'll have a lot more believers - not that they care.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could the AFC West produce three playoff teams?</seg>
<seg id="26">Don't rule it out.</seg>
<seg id="27">Kansas City, Denver and San Diego would all be playoff teams were the postseason to begin today - admittedly a somewhat silly statistic with so much football to play.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tennessee, Baltimore, Oakland and the New York Jets are best positioned to play their way into the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="29">Which star players are on the mend and on their way back to teams soon?</seg>
<seg id="30">Receiver Percy Harvin felt well enough to start practicing with Seattle last week, and his first appearance with the Seahawks is right around the corner.</seg>
<seg id="31">The 49ers should be getting receiver Michael Crabtree back soon, and All-Pro linebacker Aldon Smith returned to the team from rehab this week, although it's not clear when he'll return to the field.</seg>
<seg id="32">Meanwhile, Chicago is scheduled to have quarterback Jay Cutler back for a stretch run.</seg>
<seg id="33">What's the season's most cringe-worthy statistic?</seg>
<seg id="34">The Dallas Cowboys are the first team to give up four 400-yard passing games in the same season.</seg>
<seg id="35">Nobody else has given up more than one.</seg>
<seg id="36">Coming into the season, the Cowboys had allowed nine 400-yard passers in their first 53 seasons.</seg>

<seg id="2">In A Very English Education, these boys, now middle-aged, reflected blushingly on their teenage selves, and talked about life since.</seg>
<seg id="3">These days they all seemed fairly normal, which was a shame - they were much more entertaining to watch as teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The old footage was priceless.</seg>
<seg id="5">A boy noisily campaigning for, of all things, the Workers" Revolutionary Party (while the other boys jeered and booed); a boy being scolded for driving to school in a car (and, even worse, bringing a girl with him).</seg>
<seg id="6">Also the speech about acquiring "the right habits for life," given by the quietly unnerving headmaster, his voice like the creep of soft shoes on thick carpet.</seg>
<seg id="7">I hope, 30-odd years from now, Channel 4 does a follow-up programme about Educating Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">Partly because it would, like A Very English Education, make a fascinating televisual time capsule.</seg>
<seg id="9">And partly because it would give my children something with which to scare their own children into silence.</seg>
<seg id="10">It would be a valuable public service.</seg>
<seg id="11">A somewhat graver documentary was Bedlam (Thursday, Channel 4).</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first episode of a series about patients at South London and Maudsley psychiatric hospital, originally known as Bethlem or "Bedlam."</seg>
<seg id="13">This week we met patients suffering from various forms of anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="14">One young man spent most of his day on the lavatory, obsessed with the (false) idea that he couldn't control his bowels.</seg>
<seg id="15">A woman was convinced that she kept physically harming people and leaving their bodies in bins.</seg>
<seg id="16">She'd never done anything of the sort.</seg>
<seg id="17">All the patients were perfectly coherent, pleasant and outwardly "normal" - they simply happened to believe things about themselves that were manifestly untrue, and these delusions were ruining their lives and relationships.</seg>
<seg id="18">I want to say I felt nothing but sympathy.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it wouldn't quite be true.</seg>
<seg id="20">I did feel sympathy - the patients" struggles were heartbreaking.</seg>
<seg id="21">But I wonder whether any other viewers also found, somewhere in the recesses of their mind, a tiny, awful part of them that refused to understand, that wanted to shout in frustration, to grab these poor blameless people by the lapels and order them to pull themselves together and stop believing such nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="22">Totally unfair, of course.</seg>
<seg id="23">But hard to block out.</seg>
<seg id="24">Where did it come from, this small, shaming voice?</seg>
<seg id="25">Some lingering atavistic hatred of weakness?</seg>
<seg id="26">I suspect it had more to do with fear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fear that one day we ourselves might become like these patients, that we too have the potential to suffer this kind of nightmare, that beneath the surface, delusion lurks inside us all.</seg>
<seg id="28">And so - as with a repressed homosexual who loudly denounces gay people - fear transmutes into callousness.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's pure denial.</seg>

<seg id="4">They discovered an undersea cable that connected the Soviet Pacific Fleet's headquarters at Vladivostok with a submarine base at Petropavlovsk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sailing deep into Soviet territorial waters in 1971, the US sent a specially modified submarine USS Halibut into the Sea of Okhotsk to examine the cable.</seg>
<seg id="6">Divers found it under 400 feet of water and installed a device that wrapped around the cable to record all communications that passed through it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Once a month divers retrieved the recordings and installed new tapes.</seg>
<seg id="8">It proved so successful that other taps were placed on other Soviet communication lines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">The operation continued until 1981 when a bankrupt NSA agent sold details of the operation to the Soviets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Operation Stopwatch</seg>
<seg id="11">This joint operation between the CIA and the British Secret Intelligence Service was again an attempt to tap into communications by the Soviet Military.</seg>
<seg id="12">On this occasion the target was the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 1953, a time of high tension between the powers controlling east and west Berlin, a warehouse with a deep basement was constructed in the American sector of the divided city.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CIA had heard of a crucial telephone junction close to the border of the American sector where three cables came together.</seg>
<seg id="15">Striking out to reach this small target, which ran just a few inches below a busy street, a 1,500 feet long tunnel was dug from the warehouse basement, running under the most heavily patrolled border at the time.</seg>
<seg id="16">They intersected the cables to tap into the wires, allowing them to listen to the communications between the Soviet headquarters in Berlin and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although they were unable to break the Soviet encryption, a faint electronic echo produced by the Soviet communication equipment allowed them to obtain the information in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Soviets claim to have known about the tunnel all along after being tipped off by a mole in the British intelligence service.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Soviets "discovered" the tunnel in 1956 when soldiers broke into the eastern end</seg>
<seg id="20">The Cambridge spies</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather than relying on modern eavesdropping, this operation used old fashioned infiltration.</seg>
<seg id="22">Recruited while at Cambridge University by Russian spy Arnold Deutsch, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt rose to become a ring of highly placed spies in the British establishment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Philby joined MI6, MacLean worked at the Foreign Office, Burgess at the BBC and later MI6 and Blunt worked for MI5.</seg>
<seg id="24">They all passed information to the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Philby is perhaps the most notorious, having risen to be chief British intelligence representative in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="26">He helped alert MacLean and Burgess that they had been exposed, allowing them to escape to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="27">Philby himself later defected.</seg>
<seg id="28">A fifth spy John Cairncross, who worked at the Foreign Office, has also been claimed as being a member of the Cambridge spy ring.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Gunman Project</seg>
<seg id="30">During 1976, the KGB managed to install miniaturised eavesdropping equipment and transmitters inside 16 IBM Selectric Typewriters used by staff at the US embassy in Moscow and consulate in Leningrad.</seg>
<seg id="31">These copied everything that was typed into the machines and then transmitted the data in bursts to KGB engineers in vans nearby.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bursts were too short to be detected by the Us counter surveillance equipment and were set n the same frequency band as the Soviet television stations.</seg>
<seg id="33">For eight years the Soviet spy agency was able to steal American secrets from inside the heart of the US embassy.</seg>
<seg id="34">The bugs were only discovered in 1984 by an operation conducted by the National Security Agency when it sent a team of experts to scour the embassy for bugs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Over 100 days every piece of electronic equipment, communications device, printers and computers were replaced while the old equipment was taken back to the US to be X-rayed.</seg>
<seg id="36">Some of the bugs operated on batteries and others used mains electricity.</seg>
<seg id="37">The bugs were also remote controlled so they could be turned off when inspection teams were in the area.</seg>
<seg id="38">An NSA report that was later released concluded that the Soviets had been able to read every single document written on these typewriters.</seg>
<seg id="39">They never discovered how the bugs were installed, but suspected they were installed by the KGB when the typewriters were passing through Soviet customs.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Bundesnachrichtendienst Trojan horse affair</seg>
<seg id="41">Germany may have been the victim off NSA eavesdropping, but its own Federal Intelligence Service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst, has also engaged in such activities.</seg>
<seg id="42">In 2008 it was found to have illicitly monitored the entire computer network at the Afghan Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="43">Using software known as a Trojan horse, the German spy agency were able to get hold of the login details for the personal Yahoo email account of Amin Farhang, the Afghani Commerce Minister.</seg>
<seg id="44">Over several months during 2006 German spies were able to access his emails and those of a journalist at the newspaper Der Speigel.</seg>
<seg id="45">It later emerged that the agency had been able to access the entire computer network at the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 a hacking group also announced it had discovered another Trojan horse that was being used to monitor Skype conversations.</seg>
<seg id="47">The MI6 Spy rock</seg>
<seg id="48">In a modern version of the dead letter drop, British spies working out of the embassy in Russia used a transmitter concealed in an artificial rock to pass classified data.</seg>
<seg id="49">The rock was planted near a tree on a street on the outskirts of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="50">Information was transferred wirelessly to a memory device inside the fake rock by Russian assets using palm-sized devices as they walked past.</seg>
<seg id="51">Later British diplomats from the embassy would collect the information by again walking past with a wireless device or even taking away the rock.</seg>
<seg id="52">Russia exposed the plot and broadcast images of British diplomats repeatedly walking past the rock and picking it up on television.</seg>
<seg id="53">The FSB, the Russian intelligence service, also released close up photographs and x-ray images of a hollowed out rock filled with circuitry.</seg>
<seg id="54">They published photographs of four alleged British agents and a Russian accused of sending information to the rock.</seg>
<seg id="55">The plot seemed to be far fetched enough to be worth of a James Bond film and Q. Britain initially laughed it off and denied the accusations.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff, later admitted that the episode was in fact true.</seg>
<seg id="57">Acoustic Kitty</seg>
<seg id="58">Acoustic Kitty was a top secret 1960s CIA project attempting to use cats in spy missions, intended to spy on the Kremlin and Soviet embassies.</seg>
<seg id="59">In an hour-long procedure, a veterinary surgeon transformed the furry feline into an elite spy, implanting a microphone in her ear canal and a small radio transmitter at the base of her skull.</seg>
<seg id="60">The first Acoustic Kitty mission was to eavesdrop on two men in a park outside the Soviet compound on Wisconsin Avenue in Washington, D.C.</seg>
<seg id="61">It cost nearly $20 million in surgical and training expenses, however the feline was hit and killed by a taxi almost immediately after being let out on her first job.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dynamo eliminate Impact from MLS playoffs</seg>
<seg id="2">A grinding end to the regular season resulted in an undisciplined playoff exit for the Montreal Impact.</seg>
<seg id="3">First-half goals by Will Bruin and Oscar Boniek Garcia sucked the life out of the Impact as the Houston Dynamo bounced them from Major League Soccer's post-season with a 3-0 victory on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Montreal was clearly frustrated, losing its composure and earning three ejections over the course of the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The match was not so bad at the beginning, but they went up by two, and that made it very difficult for us," said Impact head coach Marco Schallibaum.</seg>
<seg id="6">We thought that if we could make it 2-1 in the second half, we'd have a chance, but then we got the red card.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bruin scored a second goal in the 72nd minute for a 3-0 Dynamo lead after Impact defender Nelson Rivas was ejected from the match following his second yellow card two minutes prior.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the final minute of the match two Montreal players - forward Marco Di Vaio and defender Andres Romero - were handed red cards following a skirmish in the near corner near the Impact's goal.</seg>
<seg id="9">Di Vaio, Romero and Rivas will miss Montreal's first regular season game in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Sorry for my reaction in the game tonight," said Romero in a tweet after the game.</seg>
<seg id="11">I felt great impotence and no I couldn't control.</seg>
<seg id="12">Excuse me!</seg>
<seg id="13">The Impact qualified for the MLS playoffs in just their second season in the league, but they had a share of the Eastern Conference lead as late as Sept.</seg>
<seg id="14">8 before falling to fifth after a loss on the final day of the regular season.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Dynamo finished two points ahead of Montreal in the standings to earn home field for the knockout round.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It has been a long season, and of course we are tired," said Schallibaum.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that is no excuse for what happened.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some members of Montreal's lineup are seeing the late-season collapse as an opportunity for growth.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We can learn from Houston; they are a good team and played a very good match tonight," said Impact defender Hassoun Camara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yes, it's an experience, and maybe a hard lesson for us to learn tonight, but we have to look toward the future and find a way to come back.</seg>
<seg id="21">Montreal's Justin Mapp had a chance to even the score in the 18th minute, but his shot just missed the right post after Bobby Boswell turned the ball over in the far corner.</seg>
<seg id="22">Di Vaio led the Impact with five shots, just two of which were on target.</seg>
<seg id="23">Houston goalkeeper Tally Hall recorded his fourth post-season shutout and said he is looking forward to the rest of the playoffs.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Sometimes it's fun being a goalkeeper and watching the team in front of you put on a performance (like that)," said Hall.</seg>
<seg id="25">It makes soccer fun, especially when you look around and everyone is playing their best soccer of the year.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 16th minute, Bruin received a back-heeled pass from Ricardo Clark, found some space just inside the box and ripped home his fifth career playoff goal.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bruin scored four goals as Houston reached the MLS Cup final a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Dynamo extended their lead in the 27th minute as Boniek Garcia converted a penalty kick after Montreal's Hernan Bernardello tripped him in the box.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since Aug.</seg>
<seg id="30">24, following a 5-0 win over Houston in Montreal, the Impact has won just two of 11 games and have been shutout seven times.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We just have not had the right disposition in the second half of the season," added Schallibaum.</seg>
<seg id="32">There was a lot to handle mentally.</seg>
<seg id="33">We need to analyze what happened, what we have gone through and just try to be better next year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Houston advances to play the No.</seg>
<seg id="35">1-seeded New York Red Bulls (17-9-8) in a two-game, aggregate score series.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first match is in Houston on Sunday, and the second will be at Red Bull Arena in New Jersey on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Red Bulls won the 2013 Supporters Shield with the best record in the MLS.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The one thing about this group, the attention to detail once the playoffs starts, it grows minute by minute and they prepare themselves to give themselves the best chance possible," said Houston head coach Dominic Kinnear.

<seg id="1">New Zealand Postal Service to Cut up to 2,000 Jobs</seg>
<seg id="2">New Zealand's postal service announced Friday it plans to cut up to 2,000 jobs as it transitions to delivering the mail just three days a week to most customers.</seg>
<seg id="3">The job cuts amount to about one-fifth of the service's workforce and will be implemented over three years.</seg>
<seg id="4">As part of the cutbacks, the familiar sight of postal workers cycling their routes will disappear.</seg>
<seg id="5">Workers will use a combination of motorized vehicles and walking as they deliver more parcels and far fewer letters.</seg>
<seg id="6">New Zealand Post made the announcement after the government last week agreed to allow it to reduce its six-day delivery service from mid-2015 in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rural residents, who make up about 12 percent of customers, will get their mail delivered five days a week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The service said mail volume is dropping at more than 7 percent each year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The rate is accelerating as customers increasingly turn to the Internet to communicate and pay their bills.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many countries are grappling with a decline in mail volumes, although few have proposed such steep delivery cuts as New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="11">New Zealanders are well aware that our traditional letter mail business is in irreversible decline.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Letter volumes have fallen 30 percent since 2006, and we are facing further significant decline within the next five years," said New Zealand Post Chairman Michael Cullen in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">The financial position of the traditional business has deteriorated to a point where it would be irresponsible not to take action.</seg>

<seg id="1">Outlander filming sparks Glasgow film studio fears</seg>
<seg id="2">BACKERS of multi-million pound plans for a huge film studio complex on Glasgow's waterfront have expressed fears about the project being relegated by the US sci-fi series that is being shot in a former warehouse in central Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Producers based at Scotland's major production base in Govan, who have been pursuing a dedicated studio for nearly two years, are concerned that they may risk losing out in favour of the former Isola factory where time-travel fantasy Outlander is being shot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around £640,000 of financial support for the new base at Wardpark Studios, next to the M90 at Cumbernauld, has been offered by the Scottish Government and arts agency Creative Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its owner, who has declared he wants it to become a permanent base for major productions, may also be able to utilise a £2 million loan fund which the government recently set aside to boost film and TV infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="6">However Gillian Berrie, one of Scotland's leading film producers, who is based at Film City Glasgow, said: "Cumbernauld is fine for TV and it's great that Outlander is there, but we must not forget the down-time when its in post-production, the sets will be gathering dust and therefore the space won't be available.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's not clear how many series they're planning but potentially the site could be tied up for years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also, without a guaranteed continuous income stream, this facility is vulnerable should there be gaps in productions using the space.</seg>
<seg id="9">Who will meet this shortfall?</seg>
<seg id="10">Film City Glasgow, on the other hand, is already a thriving production hub, and prior to any of the recent developments around the high end TV tax incentive, has for the past 18 months has led the national discussion on the requirement for improved screen infrastructure and studios in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="11">Govan has Film City Glasgow, the major broadcasters, new hotels, post-production facilities, the impending £40m Fastlink transport system, and most importantly, land, existing buildings and opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alongside a very proactive and well-funded screen agency, let's not forget that Northern Ireland has invested nearly £10 million in the Paint Hall and Titanic Studios, and plan to spend more.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the level we want to operate at, not more temporary development of old sheds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Film City Glasgow, which won a pledge of £1 million last year for a new studio near its existing base in the old Govan Town Hall, has now been told other locations for studios must be explored to ensure such a scheme is "commercially viable and sustainable."</seg>
<seg id="15">However the centre, which is home to around 25 permanent tenants from the screen and creative industries, has dramatically increased its plans for Scotland's first proper film studio, which are now six times bigger than originally envisaged and would offer 100,000 sq ft of studio space.</seg>
<seg id="16">In contrast, Wardpark Studios has 25,000 sq ft of studio space, across two sound stages, but these will be used to make Outlander for the foreseeable future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Terry Thomson, the owner of the complex, which was lying empty for around eight years until Sony started making Outlander, said he has struck a deal to ensure all facilities installed for the programme remain on site.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tiernan Kelly, general manager of Film City Glasgow, added: "Our proposal has resilience and sustainability at its core, and the opportunity to build a centre of excellence for both the screen and creative industries for years to come."</seg>
<seg id="19">We will continue to be deeply rooted into and for the indigenous community, but also now open and ready for international film and television production.</seg>
<seg id="20">Days after it was confirmed that a 16-part first series of Outlander was about to begin filming in Scotland, in a deal expected to be worth at least £20 million for the economy, First Minister Alex Salmond revealed that public money would be found to maximise the "economic and creative benefits of the production and creating a lasting studio legacy that would enable further large-scale productions to be filmed in Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="21">Earlier this month Scottish culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said the £2 million loan fund would help the country meet the growing demand from film and television companies looking to film in its "unique scenery and heritage locations."</seg>
<seg id="22">Scottish Enterprise is due to report back at the end of this year on its options appraisal, which is expected to provide detailed analysis of both the Cumbernauld and Govan options, as well as several other mooted sites.</seg>
<seg id="23">A film studio delivery group, created by the Scottish Government, will then make recommendations to ministers on the project.</seg>

<seg id="1">One fifth of shopping centres face low visitor numbers</seg>
<seg id="2">This is according to data from real estate consultancy firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the Bohnice area of Prague, the Krakov Shopping Centre is opening to the public; it will be Prague’s 19th shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Czech Republic now has a total of 90 large shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unsatisfactory performance concerns about 20 per cent of medium-sized and large centres.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main problems are inadequately large centres for the location and poor layouts, meaning too many floors or complicated and confusing organisation of passages, or dead spots in the centres," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, according to Sylvie Samadi, the head of the retail property department at Jones Lang LaSalle, about one fifth of shopping centres are struggling with low visitor numbers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main reasons include poor accessibility, the low income category of local inhabitants, or an over saturated local market.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.</seg>
<seg id="10">Customers today are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.</seg>
<seg id="11">New shopping centres must try harder to "attract" their customers to new brands on the market, leisure, services and marketing events," added Samadi.</seg>
<seg id="12">The occupancy of shopping centres is stable in general, according to Soták, and in some centres it is even rising, because landlords were willing to reduce rental prices during the crisis and let out some units.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It’s true though that recently they have opened some projects which are not fully occupied and the average occupancy level is lower (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, or Šantovka in Olomouc)," added Soták.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shopping centres opened in the last two years are gaining market ground very slowly, according to Sylvie Samadi.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, there is place on the market for new projects.</seg>
<seg id="16">The number of places suitable for building a successful project is very limited.</seg>
<seg id="17">For instance, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project which could serve residents of Prague 6.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is definitely a room on the market to build smaller, local projects, so-called "convenience centres", focused on shopping and services for everyday needs for people living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.</seg>
<seg id="19">Soták also says there is room for more shopping centres in the domestic market.</seg>
<seg id="20">And that is for both small "service" centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansions in regional cities.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Towns and cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno and Plzeň have room for further growth," added Soták.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Prague, he sees a space for a planned shopping centre at Vítězné Náměstí, and Na Příkopě Street and Wenceslas Square also have clear potential.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The expansions of retail parks are developing intensively, allowing traders to cover and expand to smaller and smaller towns for reasonable rent and operating costs; there is also room in some locations for smaller local or neighbourhood shopping centres, or their reconstruction, such as, for instance, the reconstruction of the Prior shopping centres, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from the company DTZ.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the Czech Republic there are currently 90 modern shopping centres with a total of over 2.2 million square metres of gross leasable area.</seg>
<seg id="25">A quarter of all these shopping centres are in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among the 20 biggest shopping centres by number of tenants, there are nine in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Czech Republic is below the EU average for the number of shopping parks; in comparison with values in Britain and France, the Czech Republic is lagging behind by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Imax to develop luxury home cinemas for China's wealthy</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 14:42</seg>
<seg id="3">Imax, the cinema technology company specialising in immersive 3D screenings, is to offer home cinemas for China's wealthy elite in a joint venture with Shenzhen's TCL Multimedia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Each luxury theatre will cost at least $250,000 (£157,000), Reuters reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">"China now is our second largest market in the world, and our fastest growing market," Imax chief executive Richard Gelfond said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company is also targeting Russia, Hong Kong and the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="7">China's burgeoning wealthy class is hungry for luxury goods of all kinds, with TCL estimating that the home theatre market will grow 20% a year over the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three-D films are also growing in popularity, with more than 80% of audiences for the recent blockbuster film Gravity opting for the 3D format thanks to the film's ground-breaking special effects.</seg>
<seg id="9">Luxury, immersive home cinemas are now possible - albeit only for the rich - thanks to advancements in 3D and large-screen technology.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shooting a film with dedicated Imax cameras used to cost more than £6m before the company developed a way of converting standard films to Imax format using algorithms for less than £1m.</seg>
<seg id="11">Producers started making films specifically for 3D, with James Cameron's Avatar in 2009 proving to be the first mainstream 3D box office success, taking about $250m in Imax theatres.</seg>
<seg id="12">Imax already earns 16% of its revenue in China, and now has 131 screens installed there.</seg>
<seg id="13">In July, it announced an agreement with China's Dalian Wanda Group Corp to build up to 120 new cinemas in the country, building on its 2011 deal with the group.</seg>

<seg id="4">Former Devco Holdings director Lee Geoffrey Devereux had earlier admitted his part in the scam that involved more than half a dozen people connected to the local council.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 33-year-old pleaded guilty to one charge of aiding a public officer and acting corruptly.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also admitted to four counts of giving false testimony before the Corruption and Crime Commission during a series of private and public hearings in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Devereux is the seventh person to be convicted of serious offences linked to the multi-million-dollar procurement scandal at the City of Stirling.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was initially charged with submitting false invoices totalling almost $80,000 for work he said he completed on the Dianella Library roof in a scheme concocted by the council's former building co-ordinator who committed suicide days before he was due to give evidence at the hearings.</seg>
<seg id="9">The man, whose name was suppressed, was said to be the central figure behind the alleged kickbacks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Devereux was later charged with lying to the CCC on four occasions.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the sentencing hearing today it was revealed payment of the false invoices were approved by the building co-ordinator and the proceeds shared by the two men.</seg>
<seg id="12">This included purchasing a $54,934 tractor for joint use on their separate rural properties.</seg>
<seg id="13">In handing down her sentence District Court judge Annette Schoombee said the offences were very serious and "strike at the heart" of clean and efficient local government.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said the initial offending was made worse by Mr Devereux lying to the CCC and emphasised the maximum penalty for doing so was five years jail or a $100,000 fine or both.</seg>
<seg id="15">And while she took into account his genuine remorse, personal circumstances, early guilty plea and possible rehabilitation, she said a general deterrent was necessary to ensure people gave honest evidence to the CCC.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is integral to its operations that persons before it speak the truth," she said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Devereux has since repaid more than $68,000 to the council.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Devereux was sentenced to 12 months jail for corruption and six-months jail concurrent for each of four false testimony offences, with one to commence three months before the end of the head sentence.</seg>
<seg id="19">Five other private contractors have already been convicted and sentenced to 12 to 18 months jail for corruption in relation to work for the City of Stirling.</seg>
<seg id="20">Three of those were jailed immediately and two had their sentences suspended.</seg>
<seg id="21">As well, a lawyer who told his client to destroy evidence and lied to the CCC was fined $10,000 and given a suspended jail term.</seg>

<seg id="1">prison: Review warns of promised jobs doubt</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 07:10</seg>
<seg id="3">Wrexham's super-prison may not deliver the promised jobs and could damage the area's economy, it has been claimed.</seg>
<seg id="4">A review by independent think tank the Institute of Welsh Affairs says locals will have to compete for jobs with people from a much wider area.</seg>
<seg id="5">It says claims of economic benefits from a £23m prison employing up to 1,000 are "at best, misleading."</seg>
<seg id="6">The UK government chose Wrexham Industrial Estate as the location for a jail for 2,000 inmates.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ministry of Justice has dismissed the claims.</seg>
<seg id="8">Plans have been submitted to Wrexham council and, if approved, the prison will be built near homes in Pentre Maelor, and will open by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="9">Existing prisons</seg>
<seg id="10">We refute these claims and remain in no doubt that the new prison in Wrexham will be a huge boost for the local economy</seg>
<seg id="11">End Quote Ministry of Justice</seg>
<seg id="12">It has been claimed the project could create up to 1,000 jobs and bring £23m a year to the north Wales economy.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, Robert Jones, a PhD student at the Wales Governance Centre, a research unit at Cardiff University, challenges the claims.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is researching imprisonment and devolution in Wales, and has written a review which was published by the IWA as part of its research project into devolution of policing and justice to Wales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Jones claims research from the United States "will do little to spark optimism amongst people across north Wales."</seg>
<seg id="16">He says research in America suggests prison jobs "do not go to people already living in the community."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Jones continues: "Rather, higher paid managerial positions and senior prison staff are often employed from outside the local areas" adding that "in such cases, staff are likely to be recruited from existing prison establishments."</seg>
<seg id="18">Lower house prices</seg>
<seg id="19">He also cites research that claims people working in prisons regularly travel large distances and "in most cases nearly double the average commuter range."</seg>
<seg id="20">He claims Wrexham's proximity to motorway networks "is likely to ensure that staff are drawn from across a widespread area to the detriment of 'local' people in search of employment opportunities at the prison."</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr Jones's paper also cites a previous study of small American towns with prisons, which showed they had more unemployment and lower house prices than similar towns with no prisons.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says: "In view of such findings, the UK government's efforts to promote the Wrexham super-prison under a veil of economic advantages and increased employment is, at best, misleading."</seg>
<seg id="23">In a statement the Ministry of Justice said: "We refute these claims and remain in no doubt that the new prison in Wrexham will be a huge boost for the local economy.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is set to create up to 1,000 jobs and boost the regional economy by around £23m a year, providing millions of pounds worth of construction opportunities and great possibilities for local businesses.</seg>
<seg id="25">Across the country we are replacing older, inefficient accommodation with newer buildings that are cheaper to run.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will also hold prisoners close to their homes, which we know helps prevent reoffending.</seg>

<seg id="1">High home ownership linked to high unemployment: study</seg>
<seg id="2">LONDON (Reuters) - High levels of home ownership are strongly linked to subsequent rises in unemployment because labor mobility becomes reduced, according to new research.</seg>
<seg id="3">Using data going back to 1950 across all U.S. states except Alaska and Hawaii, Warwick University economics professor Andrew Oswald finds that the lag from ownership levels to unemployment rates can take up to five years to show up.</seg>
<seg id="4">But he said the linkage, established using data on millions of randomly sampled Americans, was extraordinarily robust.</seg>
<seg id="5">Doubling home ownership in a state can lead to more than a doubling of the jobless rate.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have become convinced that by boosting home ownership we have ruined our labor market," Oswald said.</seg>
<seg id="7">He conducted his research with David Blanchflower, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, who used to be a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee.</seg>
<seg id="8">Oswald said the research may go some way to explaining why Spain, with a home ownership rate of 80 percent, has unemployment above 25 percent, whereas Switzerland, with a 30 percent ownership rate, has a jobless rate of just 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Germany, another nation of renters rather than home owners, also has relatively low unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="10">Studies carried out independently by a Finnish researcher produced similar findings for the Nordic nation, Oswald said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Home ownership unwittingly impairs the labor market by deterring people from moving in search of work, a process that is time-consuming and expensive; long commuting times might also discourage a householder from taking a particular job, his research suggests.</seg>
<seg id="12">Another theory is that home owners are opposed to new businesses opening up in their neighborhoods - a phenomenon known in Britain as NIMBY, or Not In My Back Yard.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This suggests that, without politicians being aware of it, high home ownership may slowly erode a country's industrial base," Oswald wrote in a paper for Warwick University and Chatham House, a London think tank.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said his statistical correlations should be deeply worrying for politicians in those countries that have promoted home ownership through tax breaks and subsidized mortgages.</seg>
<seg id="15">Britain is due to expand one such home-loan scheme, called Help to Buy, at the start of next year.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Britain we have incredibly cheap mortgages and we're giving help-to-buy inducements on top of that in a world where house prices are already rising far above the rate of inflation that the Bank of England says it wants.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's unbelievably illogical," Oswald told Reuters.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA man Edward Snowden meets German MP</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 09:21</seg>
<seg id="3">A German Green politician says the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has told him in Moscow that he is willing to speak to German investigators about the US spy agency's activities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Hans-Christian Stroebele said the offer was contained in a letter to the German government which Mr Snowden gave him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Stroebele tweeted a photograph of himself with Mr Snowden, who has temporary asylum in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is not clear whether Mr Snowden would get legal protection in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone was bugged by US spies for years overshadowed last week's EU summit and she remarked with irritation that spying on friends is "really not on."</seg>
<seg id="8">New job</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Stroebele, a German MP in the Bundestag, said Mr Snowden would be prepared to come to Germany to testify to an investigation into the National Security Agency for which he once worked.</seg>
<seg id="10">The fugitive has a visa allowing him to live in Russia until next June.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some in Germany are raising the possibility of Berlin then granting him asylum.</seg>
<seg id="12">That would raise all sorts of issues, the BBC's Stephen Evans reports from Berlin - including whether Germany could or would refuse to extradite him to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Snowden will start work this month for a major private website in Russia, his lawyer has said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Snowden, 30, fled to Russia in June after leaking details of far-reaching US telephone espionage.</seg>
<seg id="15">The lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, would not disclose which site has employed Mr Snowden, citing security concerns.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Mr Snowden had a very public job offer earlier this year from the head of VKontakte, a popular social networking site seen as a rival to Facebook.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amanda Knox case: new DNA test casts doubt over murder weapon</seg>
<seg id="2">At the original trial of Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito in Perugia in 2009, forensic experts said that a DNA trace on the blade of the knife belonged to Miss Kercher and that another trace on the handle was that of Miss Knox.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutors used the evidence to claim that the American had used the kitchen knife to murder her British house-mate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defence lawyers argued that the quantities of DNA were too small to be tested and that the results may have been skewed by cross-contamination during what they said was a bungled police investigation.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Miss Knox and her ex-boyfriend were convicted of murder and sexual assault and sentenced to 26 years and 25 years in jail respectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">That was overturned at an appeals trial in Perugia in 2011, after the DNA analysis was ruled inconclusive and inadmissible.</seg>
<seg id="7">Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito were cleared and released from prison, but in March this year the Supreme Court in Rome questioned their acquittals and ordered a second appeals trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">The latest results, ordered by the judge in the appeals court in Florence, come from a new test carried out on a tiny trace of DNA on the blade by Italian forensic police.</seg>
<seg id="9">The result "pushes even further away the possibility that this was the murder weapon," said Luciano Ghirga, Miss Knox's lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The results, which were deposited in court on Thursday, demonstrated that "the forensic experts appointed by the Perugia appeals court, who at the time of their work didn't have instrumentation available to carry out a thorough examination on such a low quantity of DNA, carried out their work well," said Mr Ghirga."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Giulia Bongiorno, Mr Sollecito's lawyer, said: "This test excludes categorically that the knife was the murder weapon."</seg>
<seg id="12">But lawyers for the Kercher family said they continued to have faith in the original, contested tests, which appeared to show that Miss Kercher's DNA was on the blade.</seg>
<seg id="13">The third person accused of murdering the Leeds University student, Rudy Guede, was to give his first public interview about the crime on Italian television on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="14">Guede, who was born in Ivory Coast but adopted by an Italian family in Perugia, is serving a 16-year prison sentence after being convicted in a separate, fast-track trial.</seg>
<seg id="15">Miss Knox and her former lover continue to proclaim their innocence, and the American has repeatedly said that she believes the crime was carried out by Guede alone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why Joe Jonas Waited to Address Drug Rumors</seg>
<seg id="2">When the Jonas Brothers canceled their tour earlier this month, a rep for the band said it was because of a "creative rift."</seg>
<seg id="3">But gossip sites had a different take: Joe Jonas, 24, was on drugs.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Usually right away, I'll kill a rumor," Jonas, 24, told ABC News.</seg>
<seg id="5">But because we were kind of figuring out what was going on with us as brothers first, we kept kind of mum about the whole drug thing.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, this week, the band announced that they were calling it quits, and the middle brother officially cleared up the rumors once and for all.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Never had a problem with drugs and never done drugs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Happy and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Jonas Brothers Are 'Family First'</seg>
<seg id="10">Though Jonas said "it was kind of humorous" for a while, once it was falsely reported that he was doing heroin and that his girlfriend, Blanda Eggenschwiler, was giving him drugs, he knew he had to say something.</seg>
<seg id="11">"When it affects the people around you and they're pointing at family members [saying], 'How can they be dealing with this for so long?' and my girl, that's the stuff that gets to you," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luckily now, being able to just shut the door to it is nice.</seg>
<seg id="13">Joe Jonas Asks Fans for Patience</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's all false, every piece of it," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="15">Random people [were] coming up to me on the street, hugging me, being like, 'Are you OK?'</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm like, 'Do you know something I don't?!'</seg>
<seg id="17">Throughout it all, Jonas said that his brothers Kevin, 25, and Nick, 21, were supportive.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We're always protective of each other," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think the craziest thing is getting texts from friends and stuff because I was so quiet about it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now, he's looking forward to the next chapter, which will include more music and hopefully some acting, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I've done it before and there were so many cooks in the kitchen and I really want to make this project my own," he said, adding that he hopes to do something that combines his love of hip-hop, pop and alternative music."We're all really excited for each other and to have an opportunity and time to do something that I haven't been able to do in a long time."</seg>

<seg id="2">31 (UPI) -- Small- and medium-sized defense contractors in Virginia are getting state assistance in exporting products and services abroad.</seg>
<seg id="3">The assistance program, called Going Global, is intended to mitigate the impact of the U.S. government's budget sequestration on Virginia's economy by strengthening international sales for hundreds of companies based in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="4">"For small to medium-sized defense contractors, going global can be a daunting task," said Martin Briley, president and chief executive officer of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, the state authority spearheading the program.</seg>
<seg id="5">Virginia's defense companies can rely on the Going Global initiative to provide the time, resources and deep expertise necessary to gain a stronger foothold in international markets.</seg>
<seg id="6">The program offers assistance in market research, export compliance, digital marketing and with international certification and global trade missions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The program, which started a month ago, already has nearly 80 defense-related companies on its roll of participants.</seg>
<seg id="8">Going Global is modeled after Virginia's award-winning International Trade program, which has been known to increase participants' international sales by an average of 54 percent.</seg>

<seg id="2">The end of September marks the beginning of haunted house season</seg>
<seg id="3">Nightmares Fear Factory at Niagara Falls is a year-round haunted facility</seg>
<seg id="4">Pictures of scared visitors from Nightmares go up on the Web</seg>
<seg id="5">Editor's note: Each week in "Apparently This Matters," CNN's Jarrett Bellini applies his warped sensibilities to trending topics in social media and random items of interest on the Web.</seg>
<seg id="6">(CNN) -- It's been quite a while since I last soiled my pants.</seg>
<seg id="7">Easily a week or two.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe three.</seg>
<seg id="9">But temptation is everywhere, and the other day, as I was driving down the highway, I noticed a big sign for a haunted house.</seg>
<seg id="10">And I thought, "Welp, better stay away from that."</seg>
<seg id="11">You know.</seg>
<seg id="12">To keep the streak going.</seg>
<seg id="13">But as I passed this haunted house, I also sort of did a double take, for it occurred to me that it was still only September.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Apparently This Matters" Is Jarrett Bellini's weekly (and somewhat random) look at social-media trends.</seg>
<seg id="15">Granted, it's the end of September, but seeing this caused a slight shock to my system, reminding me that, yes, fall is officially upon us and October is stealthily hiding right around the corner, chain-smoking clove cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="16">October's such a hipster.</seg>
<seg id="17">When I finally got home later in the afternoon, I sat down, like I often do, at my computer to scour the Web for things people are talking about online.</seg>
<seg id="18">And that's when I surfed upon several mentions of some other haunted house -- a rather famous year-round facility at Niagara Falls called Nightmares Fear Factory.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all you nature lovers, it's just down the street from Planet Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="20">Seriously, if you've never been to Niagara Falls, understand that the town, which rests right along the Canadian side of the river, is one of the tackiest places you'll ever visit, and the entire area exists solely to vacuum-suck money out of your wallet as soon as you're done taking romantic selfies in front of Big Splashy.</seg>
<seg id="21">I love you, Megan.</seg>
<seg id="22">Let's get an overpriced cheeseburger.</seg>
<seg id="23">And a commemorative paperweight?</seg>
<seg id="24">Anything for you, babe.</seg>
<seg id="25">So there's this big haunted house right on Victoria Avenue, and, according to their website, the location was once the Cataract Coffin Factory where, many years ago, they claim the proprietor, Abraham Mortimer, was killed when a stack of solid oak coffins collapsed and crushed him to death.</seg>
<seg id="26">Naturally, his ghost still wanders the halls and haunts anyone who passes through his "beloved and now abandoned factory."</seg>
<seg id="27">As opposed to just chilling out in heaven with Jimi Hendrix.</seg>
<seg id="28">I'm not saying the legend isn't true.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it seems like a rather poor use of time in the afterlife.</seg>
<seg id="30">Naw, Jimi, you go on without me.</seg>
<seg id="31">I'm just gonna float around my old factory and be bitter.</seg>
<seg id="32">But what really makes this haunted house famous, especially this time of year, isn't the legend.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's the photos.</seg>
<seg id="34">As visitors wander the haunted halls in pitch darkness, huddled together following a trail of red lights, they reach a point where they are confronted by a car full of ghosts.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lights suddenly shine and secret cameras snap their terrified reactions.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nightmares Fear Factory is just blocks away from the big splashy of Niagara Falls.</seg>
<seg id="37">The images are amazing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Picture your grandparents watching Miley Cyrus at the VMAs.</seg>
<seg id="39">With their pastor.</seg>
<seg id="40">Those are the faces.</seg>
<seg id="41">As a bonus, some of the images are then fed to a photo stream on flickr so the rest of us can laugh at people clinging to each other in sheer terror.</seg>
<seg id="42">And if that wasn't hilarious enough, Nightmares Fear Factory has another way of humiliating patrons.</seg>
<seg id="43">If someone happens to get too scared during the 10-15 minute walk through of the house, all they have to do is scream "Nightmares" and something will take them out.</seg>
<seg id="44">Something.</seg>
<seg id="45">That's their word.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not mine.</seg>
<seg id="47">So, it might be a zombie.</seg>
<seg id="48">Or it might be a ghost.</seg>
<seg id="49">But it could also be, I suppose, a taco shell.</seg>
<seg id="50">Just something.</seg>
<seg id="51">Once you're removed, you are unceremoniously added to what they call the Chicken Count, which, at the time of this being published, stands at 124,212 people.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, as we say goodbye to September, it's time to say hello to Nightmares Fear Factory and all the other seasonal haunted houses that come to us in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">None of which I'll be visiting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Controversy over Venice theme park plan</seg>
<seg id="2">But critics say that Venice has already become enough of a de facto cultural theme park as it is, with locals moving away in droves, greengrocers and bakeries being pushed out by trinket shops and tourism dominating the city's economy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The environmental rehabilitation of San Biagio should go ahead, but it must be done with respect for this city.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Venice is not a theme park, and everyone must take account of that," Giorgio Orsoni, the mayor of Venice, said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I've been informed of the project and it does raise some concerns, above all because of the plan to build the large Ferris wheel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Venice, which has a population of around 60,000, is swamped by the same number of tourists every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">That adds up to a total of 22 million visitors a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">This week a former mayor of the city revived the idea, first mooted three decades ago, of limiting the number of visitors able to enter the city with some sort of ticket system.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I started to look at the possibility when I was mayor, but it would be much easier now, with more modern technology, to introduce a system to control visitor numbers," Paolo Costa, who is now the president of Venice's port authority, told La Repubblica newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="10">The idea came to me again during a visit to China when I looked around and thought, if only a fraction of this great mass of humanity jumps on a plane to Venice, what will happen then?</seg>
<seg id="11">But Angela Vettese, an official in charge of tourism, said limiting numbers would be "anti-democratic" and suggested instead efforts to direct tourists away from saturated sites such as the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square to lesser known corners of the lagoon city.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If we introduced entrance tickets, it would only enforce the impression that Venice is a theme park," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Concern over the strangulation of Venice by mass tourism, including the thousands of visitors who are disgorged each week from cruise ships, led the World Monuments Fund to include Venice on its most recent list of at-risk heritage sites.</seg>
<seg id="14">The city was threatened by "large-scale cruise-ship tourism," which had increased in scale by 400 per cent just in the last five years, said Bonnie Burnham, president of the organisation, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="15">Florence has a similar problem to Venice - 16 million tourists descend on the Tuscan city each year but they congregate in two or three hugely popular spots, such as the Ponte Vecchio, the Uffizi Gallery and the Duomo, or cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="16">A modern-day Medici prince, a descendant of the famous Florentine family, said mass tourism is such a threat to the city that it should be put on a Unesco list of endangered World Heritage sites.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The economy of the city is gravely suffering because the itineraries created by international tour operators are conditioning visitors to spend an average of two nights and just one full day of sightseeing in the city centre, usually in a very restricted area," said Prince Ottaviano de" Medici in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="18">This means that while a handful of streets are literally invaded by millions of tourists, the rest of the city centre of Florence remains virtually deserted and the majority of museums almost totally unvisited.</seg>
<seg id="19">The prince, the representative of the Medici family, said while the city centre was thriving on the back of tourism, other parts of Florence were in serious economic decline.</seg>
<seg id="20">That has caused dramatic population decline - in the 20 years between 1981 and 2001, a fifth of Florentines left the city, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">The normal daily life of the city was also being damaged by "semi-permanent camps of gypsies in the city centre, (groups of) drunken people, the invasion of fast-food restaurants and small shops managed by multi-ethnic migrants."</seg>
<seg id="22">Prince de" Medici has set up a campaign, the Save Florence Project, and sent a petition to Unesco representatives in Italy calling for urgent action to safeguard the centuries-old character of the city centre.</seg>

<seg id="4">EMIRATES will begin flying from Adelaide to Dubai daily today, following strong demand from travellers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Middle Eastern airline started flying from Adelaide four times a week in November, announcing it would increase flights to daily services soon after.</seg>
<seg id="6">The introduction of the carrier to South Australia gives residents access to one-stop flights to 33 destinations in Europe and more than 125 worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="7">Emirates Vice President Australasia Barry Brown said economy class had been full on most flights since the service began and between 85 and 90 per cent full in the busy months of December and January.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Interest is particularly high as we enter a new era for Emirates with the Qantas partnership proposal, pending government and regulatory approvals," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Premier Jay Weatherill said the daily flights were a boost for business and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="10">The flights will depart Adelaide at 10.35pm daily and takes 13 hours and 10 minutes, arriving in Dubai at 5.15am.</seg>
<seg id="11">The extra flights mean more than 1000 passengers can fly a week.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arrest of Bárta linked to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leaked wiretappings?</seg>
<seg id="2">Head of Public affairs Vít Bárta was arrested by police on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The head of the analytics and informatics division of the anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek was also arrested with him.</seg>
<seg id="4">The arrest is linked to the wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).</seg>
<seg id="5">The information about the wiretapping, which was brought by the server Novinky.cz, was confirmed to the Czech News Agency by a reliable source.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tapped phone calls of Janoušek and Bém, published last March by the newspaper Mladá Fronta Dnes and in which both men call each other "Pampered boy" and "Hummingbird", demonstrate Janoušek’s influence on the city’s actions under Bém’s leadership.</seg>
<seg id="7">The paper then said that the Security Information Service (BIS) obtained them in 2007, from which two years later they were leaked to the ABL Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was owned by Bárta at the time.</seg>
<seg id="9">The server Novinky.cz pointed out that the arrested investigator Petržílek used to work for BIS before starting work for the anti-corruption police.</seg>
<seg id="10">Petržílek moved to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretappings, at the same time as they were published.</seg>
<seg id="11">"With regard to the law on protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything or say anything," said prosecutor Michal Muravský from the Prague Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hallmark has been accused of caving to political correctness after changing the lyrics of classic Christmas carol "Deck the Halls" from "gay apparel" to "fun apperal."</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Hallmark Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="4">FOR greeting card giant Hallmark, this isn't just another tacky holiday jumper.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Kansas City, Missouri-based company has been defending itself this week after it began selling an ornamental, miniaturised version of the ugly holiday jumper.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ornament, which sells for $US12.95 ($13.65), is emblazoned with the phrase: "Don we now our FUN apparel!"</seg>
<seg id="7">Critics took to Twitter and Hallmark's Facebook page, accusing the company of making a political statement by using the word "fun" to replace "gay" in the lyric from the Deck the Halls Christmas carol.</seg>
<seg id="8">Angry Facebook commenters said they would never again buy Hallmark merchandise and that the change amounted to the company rewriting holiday classics in the name of political correctness.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hallmark released a statement saying the multiple meanings attached to the word "gay" meant the sweater's lyrics would be "open to misinterpretation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Hallmark created this year's Holiday Sweater ornament in the spirit of fun.</seg>
<seg id="11">"When the lyrics to Deck the Halls were translated from Gaelic and published in English back in the 1800s, the word "gay" meant festive or merry," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Today it has multiple meanings, which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation," the statement read.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The trend of wearing festively decorated Christmas sweaters to parties is all about fun, and this ornament is intended to play into that, so the planning team decided to say what we meant: "fun.""</seg>
<seg id="14">That's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gerald Rogers regrets that his marriage ended 16 years after his wedding day.</seg>
<seg id="3">NEVER blame her.</seg>
<seg id="4">Allow her just to be.</seg>
<seg id="5">Never get lazy in love.</seg>
<seg id="6">If father of four Gerald Rogers had taken his own advice, he might not be going through the grief of divorce.</seg>
<seg id="7">But after his marriage of 16 years ended, Rogers wrote on Facebook the 20 things he would do differently if he had his time over again with his now ex-wife.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, I'm not a relationship expert," Rogers begins.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there's something about my divorce being finalised this week that gives me perspective of things I wish I would have done different ...</seg>
<seg id="10">After losing a woman that I loved, and a marriage of almost 16 years, here's the advice I wish I would have had.</seg>
<seg id="11">The response was overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="12">Divorced father of four, Gerald Rogers, is frank about his marriage failures.</seg>
<seg id="13">Posted in late July, Rogers' frank and self-effacing list of marriage dos and don'ts has been shared and reshared by more than 350,000 people around the world, with more than 10,000 likes and hundreds of positive comments.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rogers, a motivational speaker in the US, has described the response as "super humbling."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I feel incredibly grateful for all those who have listened and chosen to work a little harder on their relationships," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">I just hope all of us can be a little wiser as we learn how to love a little better.</seg>
<seg id="17">Here are three of his tips for making a marriage go the distance:</seg>
<seg id="18">You will constantly change.</seg>
<seg id="19">You're not the same people you were when you got married, and in five years you will not be the same person you are today.</seg>
<seg id="20">Change will come, and in that you have to rechoose each other everyday.</seg>
<seg id="21">SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO STAY WITH YOU, and if you don't take care of her heart, she may give that heart to someone else or seal you out completely, and you may never be able to get it back.</seg>
<seg id="22">Always fight to win her love just as you did when you were courting her.</seg>
<seg id="23">Focus only on what you love.</seg>
<seg id="24">What you focus on will expand.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you focus on what bugs you, all you will see is reasons to be bugged.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you focus on what you love, you can't help but be consumed by love.</seg>
<seg id="27">Focus to the point where you can no longer see anything but love, and you know without a doubt that you are the luckiest man on earth to be have this woman as your wife.</seg>
<seg id="28">IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO CHANGE OR FIX HER ... your job is to love her as she is with no expectation of her ever changing.</seg>
<seg id="29">And if she changes, love what she becomes, whether it's what you wanted or not.</seg>

<seg id="1">Government spying?</seg>
<seg id="2">Fear for yourself</seg>
<seg id="3">Big Brother has never had it so good.</seg>
<seg id="4">Technology.</seg>
<seg id="5">The amount of private information you share on your smartphone, and the ease with which spies can now access it, make the Stasi look like a medieval relic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unfortunately, it's not just spies who are tracking your every move.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also phone-hacking British journalists and data-devouring, for-profit U.S. Internet companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The essential good that's under threat from all these technology-empowered agents can also be spelled out in one word: privacy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Privacy is dead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Get over it," a Silicon Valley boss once reportedly remarked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of us don't accept that.</seg>
<seg id="12">We believe that preserving individual privacy is essential not just to human dignity but to freedom and security.</seg>
<seg id="13">The difficulty is that privacy is at once essential to and in tension with both freedom and security.</seg>
<seg id="14">A cabinet minister who keeps his mistress in satin sheets at the taxpayer's expense cannot justly object when the press exposes him.</seg>
<seg id="15">The citizen's freedom to scrutinize public figures trumps the minister's claim to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where and how do we draw the line between genuine public interest and what merely interests the public?</seg>
<seg id="17">Equally, if we are to be protected from terrorists on our daily commute to work, some potentially dangerous people must have their phones bugged and e-mails read.</seg>
<seg id="18">But who, how many and with what controls?</seg>
<seg id="19">The essence of what the reporting of Edward Snowden's leaks has revealed is that those checks and balances were not working properly in the United States and Britain.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. National Security Agency and Britain's Government Communications Headquarters were simply hoovering up too much data on too many private individuals in too many countries, using the leeway provided by outdated, overbroad laws and inadequate parliamentary or congressional oversight.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fact that President Barack Obama's administration and the U.S. Congress reportedly now intend to tighten things up, and Britain is edging in that direction, demonstrates that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="22">Would they be springing into action if not for the whistleblower and a free press?</seg>
<seg id="23">Recently, the debate has gone off at a tangent about supposedly friendly governments spying on each other.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's a different question.</seg>
<seg id="25">If I am the government of country X, of course I want my own secrets to be entirely secure while I can covertly access those of all other governments.</seg>
<seg id="26">In practice, everyone tries it on.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is a case to be made that if the world's defence ministries were to all spy the Kevlar underpants off each other, the world might actually be a safer place.</seg>
<seg id="28">But that is not what this debate should be about.</seg>
<seg id="29">The vital issue here is the privacy of innocent individual citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">A free press has struck a blow for our privacy when legal and parliamentary controls had fallen short.</seg>
<seg id="31">But spies are not the only people to use contemporary communications technology to violate the privacy of individuals without good cause.</seg>
<seg id="32">The British satirical magazine Private Eye captures this brilliantly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Under the headline Merkel Fury At Obama Phone Hacking, it shows a photo of the German chancellor grimly clasping her cellphone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Her superimposed speech bubble says: "Who do you think you are?"</seg>
<seg id="35">Rupert Murdoch?</seg>
<seg id="36">Even as British Prime Minister David Cameron and columnists in Murdoch-owned British papers denounce the Guardian for endangering national security, former Murdoch tabloid editor Rebekah Brooks goes on trial.</seg>
<seg id="37">The charges originate in journalists hacking into the phones of private individuals.</seg>
<seg id="38">This was done in the interests not of national security but of national titillation - commercial gain.</seg>
<seg id="39">So if a free press is needed to check the surveillance excesses of the state, most of the British public also wants to see curbs on the surveillance excesses of a free press.</seg>
<seg id="40">But they don't want those powers in the hands of politicians - with good reason, witness a recent attempt by the chairman of Britain's Conservative Party to whip the British Broadcasting Corp. into line.</seg>
<seg id="41">Yet on Wednesday, we saw a cumbersome and antiquated attempt to underpin enhanced self-regulation of the British press through a Royal Charter passed in Privy Council.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Privy Council is, in practice, a few senior ministers from the governing parties, standing (not sitting) in the presence of Her Majesty, who simply says, "Approved."</seg>
<seg id="43">And that's it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Still, all it does is to establish a mechanism for officially recognizing a press self-regulation body that many leading newspapers (including the Murdoch group) are saying they won't submit for recognition.</seg>
<seg id="45">What's more, the very idea of regulating "the press" in a national framework is fast becoming anachronistic.</seg>
<seg id="46">Where does "the press" end, and Twitter or Facebook begin?</seg>
<seg id="47">Meanwhile, data is spilling not just across all platforms but also across national frontiers.</seg>
<seg id="48">So the EU aims to enforce stronger protection for the privacy of Europeans, against U.S. giants, through a new directive.</seg>
<seg id="49">But brings the danger of fragmenting the Internet into sovereign patches, which authoritarian regimes would welcome.</seg>
<seg id="50">Privacy for some could then be enhanced at the cost of freedom of expression for all.</seg>
<seg id="51">What's the answer?</seg>
<seg id="52">There is no easy one, but let's at least keep our eyes on the right target, which is not states spying on states.</seg>
<seg id="53">It's this massive erosion of privacy - your privacy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sugar intake not directly related to liver disease</seg>
<seg id="2">1, 2013 - Despite current beliefs, sugar intake is not directly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, according to a new study in Gastroenterology, the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rather, high-calorie diets promote the progression of this serious form of liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">Researchers conducted a double-blind study of healthy, but centrally overweight men to compare the effects of high intakes of two types of sugar, glucose and fructose, in two conditions -- weight-maintaining (moderate-calorie diet) and weight-gaining (high-calorie diet).</seg>
<seg id="5">In the weight-maintaining period, men on neither diet developed any significant changes to the liver.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, in the weight-gaining period, both diets produced equivalent features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, including steatosis (fatty liver) and elevated serum transaminase and triglycerides.</seg>
<seg id="7">These findings indicate that fructose and glucose have comparable effects on one's liver, and calorie intake is the factor responsible for the progression of liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Based on the results of our study, recommending a low-fructose or low-glycemic diet to prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is unjustified," said Professor Ian A. Macdonald, study author and faculty of medicine and health sciences, University of Nottingham, UK.</seg>
<seg id="9">The best advice to give a patient is to maintain a healthy lifestyle with diet and exercise.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our study serves as a warning that even short changes in lifestyle can have profound impacts on your liver.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the period of increased calorie intake, all study participants experienced significant increases in body weight, waist circumference and total body fat, as expected.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, satiety was unaltered in spite of weight gain during the high-calorie diet; this reinforces the notion of "hidden calories" in drinks since participants consumed a portion of their calories in liquid form.</seg>
<seg id="13">Fructose is a simple sugar commonly found in fruits and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="14">Glucose, also known as grape or blood sugar, is present in all major carbohydrates, such as starch and table sugar.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most prevalent liver problem in the U.S. and most Western countries, is the buildup of extra fat in liver cells that is not caused by alcohol.</seg>

<seg id="1">What the Chefs Daniel Patterson and Gabrielle Hamilton Talk About at Dinner: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">On a recent wet evening, Daniel Patterson, the chef of the two-Michelin-star San Francisco restaurant Coi, showed up at the 92nd Street Y to be interviewed by his old friend Gabrielle Hamilton, the chef of the cozy, rib-sticking East Village restaurant Prune.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patterson was there to discuss his new book, "Coi: Stories and Recipes," an ode to the restaurant, to Northern California, and to the eleven-course tasting menu.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love the way they flow, the elegance of form, the element of surprise," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Within haute cuisine, they allow for the highest level of expression.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I'm done with tasting menus," said Hamilton, a few minutes in.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That's like saying, "You can write a perfectly good short story, why would you ever write a novel?," " Patterson pounced.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We're arguing!" crowed Hamilton, then gestured to the event organizers.</seg>
<seg id="9">I told them there would be arguing.</seg>
<seg id="10">The two made an unlikely pair.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamilton, forty-seven, is known for her memoir, "Blood, Bones & Butter," a rollicking, intensely honest story that includes her early-career drug use, her lesbianism, her troubled marriage to an Italian doctor who needed a green card, and, on the plus side, the opening of her now-beloved restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="12">Patterson, forty-five, known for his perfectly executed dishes, which are often plated with tweezers, was fresh off a plane on one leg of a many-legged book tour.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trim, ascetic, and measured in both movement and judgment, he seemed both there and not there - as if he were sitting just six inches to the left of himself and observing his own being.</seg>
<seg id="14">Patterson has written a new kind of cookbook.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its three hundred and three pages follow a loose format - one page with a story and a through-written recipe with no measurements and, on the facing page, a striking photo of the dish.</seg>
<seg id="16">The writing, like his food, is precise, beautiful, and a bit meditative.</seg>
<seg id="17">Take his mini-treatise on seasoning:</seg>
<seg id="18">When you're in the kitchen tasting, think about the aftertaste.</seg>
<seg id="19">If it seems to fade, to just drop away on the finish, that usually means that there's not enough salt ....</seg>
<seg id="20">If the salt is a tiny bit high, a few drops of lemon juice can bring it down.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the acidity is high, it could need a little more sweetness.</seg>
<seg id="22">A few grains of salt here or a drop of vinegar there, those are the kinds of little adjustments that make good food great.</seg>
<seg id="23">Six months of culinary school distilled into one lovely paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="24">While Hamilton's cooking is also precise, to say that Patterson's restaurant is just as approachable as hers is like saying that his lichen-crusted beef - step one: scrape lichen off of trees in a forest - would make a perfect weeknight dinner.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Hamilton writes in her book, of the beginning days of Prune, "There would be no foam and no "conceptual" or "intellectual" food; just the salty, sweet, starchy, brothy, crispy things that one craves when one is actually hungry."</seg>
<seg id="26">Patterson calls it squab; she calls it pigeon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patterson not only runs four establishments in the Bay Area but also frequently travels the world to speak at food symposiums and meet up with an unofficial culinary boys" club that includes Ferran Adrià, David Chang, and Rene Redzepi.</seg>
<seg id="28">He told the room of about fifty attendees that, by necessity, he'd written the book in six months and edited it in three.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Once, on a ten-hour flight from San Francisco to Monaco, I wrote fifteen thousand words," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">At least two audience members scribbled down long division on the back of a flyer that had been placed on each seat.</seg>
<seg id="31">That translated to approximately six double-spaced pages an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">There was a long beat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Were you taking performance-enhancing drugs?</seg>
<seg id="34">Hamilton asked.</seg>
<seg id="35">A few attendees giggled.</seg>
<seg id="36">Patterson smiled thinly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the course of the hour-long talk, the two discussed the writing process, their trouble finding good line cooks, and the restaurateur Joe Bastianich, who claimed to have invented the everything bagel in his memoir, "Restaurant Man."</seg>
<seg id="38">"I fucking love that!" said Hamilton.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'm claiming eggs at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="40">I did that.</seg>
<seg id="41">"What are you going to "Joe Bastinaich"?"</seg>
<seg id="42">I'm making it a verb.</seg>
<seg id="43">I'm thinking brain mayo.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Brainaise," Patterson offered, quietly.</seg>
<seg id="45">He dodged the question until finally he asked, "Can I claim having a two-Michelin-star restaurant next to a strip club?"</seg>
<seg id="46">Coi is located in a seedy part of the North Beach neighborhood, just up the street from City Lights Books.</seg>
<seg id="47">Hamilton approved.</seg>
<seg id="48">A half hour later, the two chefs crammed into a tiny table at Sushi of Gari, on Seventy-eighth street.</seg>
<seg id="49">The waiter offered an omakase menu, a tasting menu of sorts.</seg>
<seg id="50">Unsurprisingly, Patterson voted yes and, surprisingly, so did Hamilton.</seg>
<seg id="51">The first plate included a few pieces of intensely cold, crunchy celery.</seg>
<seg id="52">Hamilton asked the waiter how it was made, and retrieved a pen and a pink notebook from her bag.</seg>
<seg id="53">"It's pickled celery," the waiter said, unhelpfully.</seg>
<seg id="54">Patterson stepped in: "It's rice-wine vinegar and salt."</seg>
<seg id="55">I think it's a pour-over, because I could feel just a little softening.</seg>
<seg id="56">Hamilton nodded and scribbled something in her notebook.</seg>
<seg id="57">The subject turned to the international culinary symposiums that Patterson attends, which often tackle lofty topics, like authenticity and the food system.</seg>
<seg id="58">"I don't like talking about food beyond "I'm hungry and I want something delicious to eat," " said Hamilton, popping a piece of salmon sushi into her mouth.</seg>
<seg id="59">To the delight of both chefs, the waiter, with gravitas, had described it as "salmon with sautéed tomato and a little onion saying "hello" from the side."</seg>
<seg id="60">That's such a cop out!</seg>
<seg id="61">Patterson retorted.</seg>
<seg id="62">He noted the ideas, collaboration, and deep friendships that came out of the symposiums, and out of the culinary retreats, called Cook it Raw, that the boys" club takes to remote places, like Lapland, where they cook together, bond, and share ideas.</seg>
<seg id="63">I so want to get an invite!</seg>
<seg id="64">Hamilton said.</seg>
<seg id="65">"One dish I made was out over this open fire, and I wanted to work with beets," Patterson recalled, picking up a piece of ebi sushi with his hands.</seg>
<seg id="66">He cooked the beets slowly for six hours, moving them around the fire every twenty minutes or so, giving the root a super-sweet, juicy, quality.</seg>
<seg id="67">"So I made this sauce with beet juice and thickened it with reindeer blood," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="68">"Because it's the same color, right, of course," Hamilton interjected, laughing.</seg>
<seg id="69">As the final dish came out, the topic returned to the tasting menu.</seg>
<seg id="70">"It's just that I don't want to go to an hors-d'oeuvres party for four hours," said Hamilton.</seg>
<seg id="71">But certain content only comes in certain formats!</seg>
<seg id="72">As they waited for the check, Hamilton picked up the book, which she'd brought after the talk, and started flipping through.</seg>
<seg id="73">It's just so beautiful, though.</seg>
<seg id="74">It really made me want to come to Coi.</seg>
<seg id="75">Wait, she was anti-tasting menu but had not yet tasted Patterson's raison d"être?</seg>
<seg id="76">"I know, I know," she said, taking in an overhead shot of chilled, spiced ratatouille soup that looked like a painting, three swirls of color - beige, red, and yellow - zipping around a mound of perfectly cubed vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="77">"O.K. Yours is the only tasting menu I will eat," she relented.</seg>
<seg id="78">Patterson smiled.</seg>
<seg id="79">Then they paid the check and headed out onto the wet streets, in search of Negronis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digitarium</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance it is clear that the hall of the large planetarium has changed in the last six months.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a new stage, visitors can sink into the new, comfortable seats and above their heads a projection area 17 metres in diameter has been added in the shape of a dome by the American company Spitz.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the middle  of the hall is the most important part, the new projector from Japan.</seg>
<seg id="5">For perfect image, further smaller projectors are scattered about the hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.</seg>
<seg id="7">"There are twenty-one computers which generate image," said the director of the Brno Observatory, Jiří Dušek.</seg>
<seg id="8">The computers ensure the image from several projectors does not overlap but gives a coherent impression.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The computers are thirty to forty times more powerful than the classic PCs," said Tomáš Hladík, the observatory technician.</seg>
<seg id="10">The digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and three-dimensional model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="11">Viewers therefore feel to be right in the middle of space or a human brain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The nearest similar facility is in Warsaw and Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="13">The observatory management plans to screen programmes it has bought and  also its own work.</seg>
<seg id="14">From Saturday, there are two shows on the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first is called Astronaut and is aimed at adults.</seg>
<seg id="16">People will learn about training of cosmonauts, fly to space, spin on a centrifuge, and then see graphic examples of the challenging conditions that astronauts face in space.</seg>
<seg id="17">The second programme is for children and is called Kaluoka’hina – The Enchanted Reef.</seg>
<seg id="18">It tells the story of a reef whose brightly coloured inhabitants lived a quiet life until a nearby volcano exploded.</seg>
<seg id="19">The whole digitarium cost around fifty million crowns, which was mostly paid for by the Ministry of Education.</seg>
<seg id="20">Smaller amounts were contributed by the City of Brno and the observatory from their budget.</seg>
<seg id="21">The projection area cost ten million crowns and the projector twelve million.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rest was swallowed up by the audio visual equipment and the computers," explains Dušek.</seg>
<seg id="23">The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the whole building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the director Dušek, 25,000 to 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Astronaut Scott Carpenter, fourth American in space, dies at 88</seg>
<seg id="2">By Keith Coffman</seg>
<seg id="3">DENVER (Reuters) - Astronaut Scott Carpenter, who in 1962 became the fourth American in space and the second to orbit the Earth, died on Thursday in Colorado at age 88 of complications from a stroke, his wife Patty Carpenter said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Carpenter, who lost radio contact with NASA controllers during his pioneering space flight and was found in the ocean 250 miles from the targeted splashdown site, went on to explore the ocean floor in later years.</seg>
<seg id="5">His wife said he died in a Denver hospice.</seg>
<seg id="6">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration chose Carpenter and six other pilots to be astronauts in 1959 for the Mercury space program as the United States entered its space race with the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="7">The only surviving member of that Mercury 7 team is John Glenn, 92, now a retired U.S. Senator from Ohio.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1962, Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth, and Carpenter was his backup on that mission.</seg>
<seg id="9">Later that year, Carpenter made his only spaceflight, taking the Aurora 7 spacecraft on three laps around Earth on May 24, a few weeks after his 37th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The flight of less than five hours made him the second American to orbit Earth, and the experience stayed with him until the end of his life.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I still remember what a thrill it was being up there - I liked the feeling of weightlessness, and the view I had of Earth," Carpenter told the University of Colorado's alumni magazine last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The other Mercury astronauts had piloted fighter jets during the Korean War, but Carpenter mostly flew surveillance in multi-engine propeller planes.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Scott was the only one with a touch of the poet about him in the sense that the idea of going into space stirred his imagination," Tom Wolfe wrote in "The Right Stuff," his best-selling book about the first astronauts.</seg>
<seg id="14">A former gymnast known among colleagues for his fitness, Carpenter trained as Glenn's backup for NASA's first orbital flight.</seg>
<seg id="15">When Glenn blasted off on the Friendship 7 mission on February 20, 1962, Carpenter sent him off with a simple yet poignant radio transmission: "Godspeed, John Glenn."</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite his fame as an astronaut, Carpenter spent considerably more time on the ocean floor than he did in outer space.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 1965, the astronaut became an aquanaut as part of the Navy's SEALAB II project, spending 30 days living and working at a depth of 204 feet off the California coast.</seg>
<seg id="18">Born in Boulder, Colorado, he split his time between Vail, Colorado, and West Palm Beach, Florida, Patty Carpenter said.</seg>
<seg id="19">His given name was Malcolm Scott Carpenter but he used Scott as a first name.</seg>
<seg id="20">Carpenter's space flight ran into problems upon re-entry to Earth's atmosphere, raising questions about whether he would make it back alive.</seg>
<seg id="21">His spacecraft had used too much fuel after he forgot to shut off one of the fuel systems.</seg>
<seg id="22">After Carpenter fired the retrorockets to power his return, NASA controllers lost radio contact and feared a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Aerial search teams eventually spotted Carpenter and the bobbing Mercury capsule - doing fine despite having ended up about 250 miles off the splashdown target in the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="24">When President John F. Kennedy called to congratulate him, Carpenter offered his "apologies for not having aimed a little better on re-entry."</seg>
<seg id="25">Suzanne Schirra, daughter of fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, who died in 2007, paid tribute on Thursday to the qualities shared by Carpenter and his colleagues on the program.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I've never met anyone who came close to having the strength of character, devotion to country, zest for adventure or joy for life than those seven men," she said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Carpenter became the first American to eat solid food in space, a breakthrough since scientists were not sure how the digestive process would work in zero gravity.</seg>
<seg id="28">He dined on chocolate, figs, dates and cereal that had been compressed into cubes.</seg>
<seg id="29">He told mission control it tasted fine but left crumbs floating throughout his space capsule.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since so little was known about spaceflight at the time, Carpenter's mission included relatively simple jobs such as releasing signal balloons, photographing clouds and observing flares fired from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="31">He discovered that what Glenn had described as looking like "fireflies" around the capsule actually were illuminated ice particles formed by water vapor being vented into space.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The most important driver in everything we did then was curiosity," Carpenter told the Orange County Register in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's revelatory.</seg>
<seg id="34">Addictive.</seg>
<seg id="35">Beautiful beyond description.</seg>
<seg id="36">To have been in space is very satisfying of one's curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's instructive.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's marvelous.</seg>
<seg id="39">The sea also piqued Carpenter's curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="40">He was an experienced diver and during his time in SEALAB, part of the Navy's underwater habitat program, he helped test tools, salvage methods and use of a dolphin to transport supplies from the surface to the lab.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The sea is a more hostile environment than space," Carpenter told Time magazine after his SEALAB experience.</seg>
<seg id="42">Carpenter badly injured his left arm in a 1964 motorcycle accident, leaving the limb with limited range, which ruled him out of future spaceflights.</seg>
<seg id="43">He returned to NASA two years after his SEALAB mission and helped design the Apollo program's lunar module that landed on the moon in 1969.</seg>
<seg id="44">He retired from NASA in 1967 and left the Navy in 1969.</seg>
<seg id="45">Carpenter's love of the ocean led to work with renowned French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, whom Carpenter considered a hero.</seg>
<seg id="46">He also wrote two novels described as "underwater techno-thrillers."</seg>
<seg id="47">Carpenter was married four times and had seven children, according to "For Spacious Skies," the autobiography he wrote with his daughter, Kris Stoever.</seg>

<seg id="1">China plea paper 'to be overhauled'</seg>
<seg id="2">A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the New Express is to undergo "full rectification," the regulator said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "rectification" order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.</seg>
<seg id="7">A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="8">"New Express's editorial management was disordered," the regulator said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license."</seg>
<seg id="10">It had also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.</seg>
<seg id="12">After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.</seg>
<seg id="15">I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've realised my wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">US drone strike believed to have killed the leader of the Pakistan Taliban</seg>
<seg id="2">Pakistan Taliban commander Hakimullah Mehsud is believed to have been killed by US missiles.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud has died after a US drone strike in the country's north-western tribal region, military officials and members of his militia say.</seg>
<seg id="4">A drone fired four missiles at a compound in the Dande Darpa Khel area of the restive North Waziristan tribal district, near the Afghan border, two military officials said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two of Mehsud's associates were also killed in the attack, the second of its kind in as many days.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I can confirm he is dead," said a member of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, the group Mehsud has been leading since September 2009.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hakimullah's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, founder of the TTP, was also killed in a drone strike in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="8">The attack occurred a day before Pakistan's government and the Pakistani Taliban were about to open peace talks.</seg>
<seg id="9">More than 40,000 people have died in Pakistan since the conflict started.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hakimullah Mehsud was widely reported to have been killed in 2010, but later resurfaced.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tribal areas where the drone attacks occur are dangerous to visit, making it difficult for journalists to independently confirm information.</seg>
<seg id="12">A senior US intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US received confirmation on Friday morning that he had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two Pakistani intelligence officials in North Waziristan also confirmed his death as did two TTP commanders who said they had seen the remnants of the militant commander's mangled body.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nick Riewoldt outstanding in St Kilda's surprise win against Carlton</seg>
<seg id="2">Saints coach Scott Watters delights in a win over Carlton, particularly the way his side weathered the Blue's late charge.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nick Riewoldt celebrates a goal.</seg>
<seg id="4">NICK Riewoldt could do no more.</seg>
<seg id="5">As usual, he had nothing left by the final siren.</seg>
<seg id="6">Riewoldt set the standard for St Kilda's commitment and showed how to sustain it, well, for most of the night under Etihad Stadium's closed roof.</seg>
<seg id="7">The captain's influence was far greater than his three goals in a balanced forward line that looked far more potent for three quarters than Carlton's top-heavy and cumbersome set-up at the other end.</seg>
<seg id="8">VIDEO: See Nathan Wright suffer a jaw injury in the video player above.</seg>
<seg id="9">Weeks for Betts?</seg>
<seg id="10">Not only did Riewoldt worry alternating Carlton opponents Michael Jamison and Lachie Henderson, he created so many ground level opportunities for those smaller goalkickers who fed off his hard work.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I was rapt with the effort, just really happy for the players," St Kilda coach Scott Watters said after the nine-points win."</seg>
<seg id="12">""The last two weeks the effort has been very, very good and to get reward for that effort will be a real catalyst for this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">"A lot of our leaders have been leading strongly and for the younger players to have this experience will be invaluable.""</seg>
<seg id="14">Riewoldt's control inside the Saints' forward 50 was one of several telling individual triumphs in coach Scott Watters' pre-game planning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Arryn Siposs goal, Picture: Ludbey Wayne Source:</seg>
<seg id="16">Like the disciplined defensive run-with role by Jarryn Geary that nullified Blues captain Marc Murphy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experienced midfielder Nick Dal Santo rediscovered form by tracking side by side with Blues ace Chris Judd, one of the best in the business for hunting the footy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Dal Santo more than held his own in those duels, as did most of the Saints to control the contest for three quarters and then withstand the expected Blues final quarter challenge.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ruckman Ben McEvoy eventually was more effective than the three talls Carlton threw at him - an obviously restricted Matthew Kreuzer, Robbie Warnock and Shaun Hampson.</seg>
<seg id="20">"On the last quarter surge by Carlton, Watters said: "It's certainly tough being a coach.</seg>
<seg id="21">Three or four centre clearances put us under pressure and the scoreboard pressure builds.</seg>
<seg id="22">When you're trying to get that win, you can get tight.</seg>
<seg id="23">I thought Ben McEvoy's efforts were outstanding and Sam Fisher in those last five minutes.</seg>
<seg id="24">""You know class players like Murphy and Judd are seasoned campaigners and they're going to lift.</seg>
<seg id="25">But our young players can go home knowing they faced that pressure from those players and they stood up.</seg>
<seg id="26">Riewoldt's workrate was astonishing with his relentless gut-running to present a target on the wing if necessary.He had six marks on the lead by the quarter-time siren.</seg>
<seg id="27">The next best was one from a handful of players from both teams.</seg>
<seg id="28">The athletic Saints leader posed enormous problems for Carlton defenders with surprising speed for a 193 cms forward.</seg>
<seg id="29">Carlton v St Kilda, Etihad Stadium,Melbourne.Nick Riewoldt, Picture: Ludbey Wayne Source:</seg>
<seg id="30">And he was just as dangerous, particularly one-out with either Jamison or Henderson under the high balls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Riewoldt must have sensed he could have an enormous influence when Jamison was forced to the bench for treatment on the suspect right shoulder after only nine minutes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Henderson just couldn't stay with Riewoldt on those long, sustained leads before he was despatched forward to create goals in the Blues' second half reshuffle.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the Saints' spearhead dragged his small forwards into the contest in that dominant first half.</seg>
<seg id="34">How Carlton yearned for such a flexible and productive figurehead inside the forward 50 arc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Eventually, it found one with Henderson, if just too late.</seg>
<seg id="36">Jarrad Waite, the obvious choice for the job, could at least breathe a little easier in the grandstand seat where he was consigned to serve that costly one-game suspension.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ghettos will probably get police specialists, intended to ease tensions</seg>
<seg id="2">Ghettos in the Czech Republic may get police specialists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">They would spend up to half of their time on the beat there.</seg>
<seg id="4">They would supervise order and solve problems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they would contribute to reducing tensions between people from impoverished areas and residents in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of the Interior is counting on this in its proposal to reduce security risks.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Minister it is especially "the speedy provision of social housing" that would help to improve the situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government has discussed the document.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to analysis, there were around 300 impoverished homes and neighbourhoods in the Czech Republic a couple of years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around 80,000 people lived in them, mainly Roma.</seg>
<seg id="11">Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families relied on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.</seg>
<seg id="12">Loan sharks ran rampant.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to experts, the number of problem localities has increased by a hundred.</seg>
<seg id="14">Relations between their residents and the others are deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="15">In some locations, anti-Roma marches have taken place.</seg>
<seg id="16">Extremists were joined by local people.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Ministry of the Interior, it is difficult for police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.</seg>
<seg id="18">A basic condition is apparently the "strict application of an equal approach in law enforcement."</seg>
<seg id="19">However, without detailed knowledge of the place and the people, this is reportedly not possible to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="20">The specialists would patrol in the ghetto, where they would spend up to half of their time on the beat and the rest of time they would served in their areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">In a problem area they would supervise the order.</seg>
<seg id="22">They would also know the local people, so they could better deal with problems and offences.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Thanks to the establishment of trust, the specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of unlawful behaviour," said the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="24">Specialists in ghettos would receive extra pay, from 500 to 1000 crowns a month.</seg>
<seg id="25">Introducing special police officers in problem areas is to be covered by the Norway Grants.</seg>
<seg id="26">The budget is about EUR 600,000 (now about 15.5 million crowns).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Czech Republic pays 15 per cent of the sum, and the grants 85 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="28">Preparations have begun this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="29">The project should last until 2016.</seg>
<seg id="30">The authors have been inspired by their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="31">This mechanism has already been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded areas is much higher than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There are so-called Roma settlements here," said the report’s authors.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not yet clear how many specialists there are to be in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="34">Analysis will give the answer and define the places where special police officers would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="35">It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to provide each year for these officers once the project has ended.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the project proposal, the police officers selected will first complete a training course in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Each year some fifty officers should complete this training course.</seg>
<seg id="38">The most suitable candidates will come from those.</seg>
<seg id="39">A special training course for police officers who will work in the ghettos should also be established.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to the authors, it is above all the social housing that would help to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="41">It would reportedly motivate and lead to integration.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to the Interior Ministry’s ideas, there would be three standard categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">The minimum standard would be met by hostels with precisely stipulated rules, such as the number of people per room.</seg>
<seg id="44">The medium standard would be the smaller flats.</seg>
<seg id="45">The higher standard would be the social flats, which would be comparable with regular accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="46">Tenants would have to fulfil an integration plan, which would be prepared by social workers  together with. tenants</seg>
<seg id="47">They would have to observe the accommodation regulations, look after their health, send their children to schools, continue retraining and actively look for work.</seg>
<seg id="48">If they try to integrate, they would progress to a higher standard of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to the Ministry of Interior, the tiered accommodation system should function, for at least 30y ears, until another generation grows up "in a pro-integration motivated environment."</seg>
<seg id="50">The social housing model is being prepared by departments for local development and labour.</seg>
<seg id="51">They have until the end of the year to make their proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Martin Luther and the Viral Superstars</seg>
<seg id="2">Before PSY blew up YouTube, before @Horse_ebooks became a Twitter superstar, even before the world discovered LOLcats, there was the apostle Paul -- early Christian missionary, eventual saint and, it turns out, a pioneer of viral media.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, we think of social media as a uniquely modern, uniquely digital phenomenon, one that only took off in the last decade -- really in just the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="4">In fact, today's bloggers and tweeters are heirs to a surprisingly deep and rich tradition that began with the Romans 2,000 years ago, helped cause the split within the Catholic Church, aided the U.S. fight for independence, and prepared the way for the French Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="5">Put down the iPad, my children, and gather round.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here are five historical pioneers of social media -- figures who went viral long before the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Apostle Paul</seg>
<seg id="8">Paul of Tarsus was the most adroit user of the Roman social-media system, harnessing it to amass followers and bind together the scattered communities of the early Christian church, and promote his ideas on how the church should develop.</seg>
<seg id="9">Written on papyrus rolls in the 1st century AD, his open letters -- or epistles, as we now know them in their New Testament form -- were addressed to specific churches (the Book of Romans is a letter to the church in Rome, for example, and Corinthians is a letter to the church in Corinth) but were clearly intended for wider distribution, like a Tumblr post sent out into the world to be blogged and reblogged.</seg>
<seg id="10">Initially, church leaders would read them out to the members of their congregation.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Paul also expected recipient churches to copy and share his letters with other churches nearby.</seg>
<seg id="12">As he wrote in his letter to the Colossians: "After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea."</seg>
<seg id="13">Copies of the letters rippled across Paul's network of churches, so that they each ended up with a complete collection.</seg>
<seg id="14">Readings from Paul's letters became a part of Christian worship, and they eventually came to be seen as scripture by the early church, whose leaders incorporated them into the New Testament.</seg>
<seg id="15">In its early years, Christianity consisted of rival movements whose members disagreed over the meaning of Christ's teachings and his intended audience for them.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paul used social media to ensure that his view prevailed, cementing the establishment of the Christian church as a religion open to all, not just to Jews.</seg>
<seg id="17">Such is his influence that his letters are still read out in churches all over the world today -- a striking testament to the power of social distribution.</seg>
<seg id="18">Credit: Universal History Archive/Getty Images</seg>
<seg id="19">Martin Luther</seg>
<seg id="20">Social media helped Paul build a church; in the hands of Martin Luther, an obscure theologian in the German town of Wittenberg, it helped to split Western Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Luther hadn't expected his "95 Theses" -- a handwritten list of theological challenges to the Catholic doctrine of indulgences, which he proposed as topics of debate in 1517 -- to spread as quickly as it did.</seg>
<seg id="22">Manuscript copies of his pioneering listicle passed from hand to hand at first, but then printers got hold of it, accelerating its spread and making it the talk of Germany within two weeks, and of Western Europe in four.</seg>
<seg id="23">Luther realized he could use this new technology, invented a few decades earlier by Johannes Gutenberg, to his further advantage.</seg>
<seg id="24">He followed up with a series of pamphlets written in vernacular German, giving the text of each to a printer in his home town and waiting for it to ripple to the next town, and the next, through repeated reprinting (akin, you could say, to retweeting).</seg>
<seg id="25">Millions of copies of his pamphlets spread like wildfire throughout Europe between 1517 and 1527 as readers shared and recommended them to their friends, who then sought out their own copies.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thanks to the "marvellous, new and subtle art, the art of printing," one of Luther's contemporaries later noted, "each man became eager for knowledge, not without feeling a sense of amazement at his former blindness."</seg>
<seg id="27">This posed a dilemma for the Catholic Church, which was initially reluctant to respond with pamphlets of its own, because doing so would be an admission that theological matters were open to debate.</seg>
<seg id="28">The extraordinary popularity of Luther's pamphlets signaled to him, and to his readers, the breadth of support for his views -- just as social media revealed the extent of anti-government feeling in Egypt and Tunisia, a phenomenon that modern media scholars call "synchronization of opinion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Luther's message went viral, and the result was the Reformation.</seg>

<seg id="31">John Harington</seg>
<seg id="32">Today, using Twitter, Facebook, and blogs to improve your "personal brand" is social media 101.</seg>
<seg id="33">But it was Elizabethan courtier John Harington who, in the 16th century, pioneered the use of social media for self-promotion (though today he is better known as the inventor of the flushing toilet).</seg>
<seg id="34">The son of a poet and an attendant to Elizabeth I, he was one of the childless queen's 102 godchildren.</seg>
<seg id="35">He first appeared at court at age 21 and quickly made a name for himself with his snarky epigrams.</seg>
<seg id="36">Satirical and daring in their humor, the chief purpose of these short, snappy messages (today, they'd fit neatly into a tweet) was to advertise the dazzling intellect of their author and advance his career.</seg>
<seg id="37">He became known as the queen's "saucy godson" for quips like this one: "Treason doth never prosper: what's the reason?"</seg>
<seg id="38">Why, if it prosper, none dare call it treason.</seg>
<seg id="39">He even dared to criticize the queen's father, Henry VIII, for his unfortunate habit of having his wives beheaded.</seg>
<seg id="40">In one of his epigrams, a noblewoman receives an invitation to marry the king, but declines:</seg>
<seg id="41">..."I greatly thank the king your master, And would (such love in me his fame hath bred) My body venture so: but not my head."</seg>
<seg id="42">His quips were eagerly whispered from one courtier to another and circulated in written form within the court and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="43">Harington himself gave manuscripts of his collected epigrams to close friends and family members.</seg>
<seg id="44">He liked to play the part of the wise fool, jesting on the sidelines of Elizabeth's court and wrapping up his moral and political barbs in apparently harmless witticisms -- their true meaning only apparent once the laughter had subsided.</seg>
<seg id="45">For Harington and his contemporaries, writing poetry was a way to establish a reputation and win a place at court.</seg>
<seg id="46">Poetry in the Elizabethan court could be used to ask for advancement or, in the event of falling from favor, to apologize for misdeeds.</seg>
<seg id="47">Harington's poetry convinced the queen of his cleverness, and she eventually gave him official duties to perform as a courtier, tutor and military observer.</seg>
<seg id="48">After a checkered career in which he often got into trouble for overstepping the mark, he eventually ended up with a knighthood.</seg>

<seg id="50">Thomas Paine</seg>
<seg id="51">During the 18th century, the American colonies established an increasingly efficient media-sharing system.</seg>
<seg id="52">Local newspapers, with a circulation of a few hundred at best, did not rely on journalists for stories, but instead reprinted letters, speeches, and pamphlets supplied by their readers, and thus provided a shared, social platform through which people could share and discuss their views with others.</seg>
<seg id="53">Think of it as Gawker or SBNation.</seg>
<seg id="54">As the reliability and frequency of the postal service improved, it allowed free exchange by post of newspapers both within and between colonies.</seg>
<seg id="55">This allowed noteworthy letters and pamphlets to reach a wide audience as they were printed in one newspaper and then copied and reprinted by others.</seg>
<seg id="56">As tensions grew with the government in London, several authors wrote letters or pamphlets that lit up this colonial media network, including John Dickinson's anonymous "Letters from a Farmer" and John Adams's writings under the pen name "Novanglus."</seg>
<seg id="57">But most successful of all at exploiting this network was Thomas Paine, a recent immigrant to the colonies who articulated the case for independence more clearly and forcefully than anyone had done before.</seg>
<seg id="58">His pamphlet, "Common Sense," quickly rippled through the colonies, shared at first among the political elite, who excitedly recommended it to each other, and then widely reprinted and excerpted in local papers.</seg>
<seg id="59">It was unquestionably the most popular and influential pamphlet of the American Revolution, eventually selling more than 250,000 copies and making Paine the world's bestselling author.</seg>
<seg id="60">In another example of synchronization of opinion, its popularity revealed to the colonists the breadth of support for independence.</seg>
<seg id="61">Many years later, John Adams wrote disapprovingly to Thomas Jefferson that "history is to ascribe the American Revolution to Thomas Paine."</seg>
<seg id="62">That is an exaggeration, but not much of one.</seg>

<seg id="64">Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux</seg>
<seg id="65">One of the jobs of the count of Maurepas, a senior official in charge of the Paris police in the 1740s, was to monitor closely what was being said about King Louis XV in satirical rhymes, called libelles, which circulated in salons, cafes, markets, and taverns.</seg>
<seg id="66">As they passed from person to person, whether orally or written on small scraps of paper, these ditties would be modified and reworked, with new verses added or names changed.</seg>
<seg id="67">Such poems could easily be updated in response to the news, a process of collective authorship that assimilated and encapsulated public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="68">Maurepas collected these poems through a network of informers, so that he could monitor public opinion on the king's behalf, tracking which courtiers were being satirized and collecting the latest rumors about the royal family.</seg>
<seg id="69">As with modern Internet censorship in China, the authorities would intervene if someone went too far.</seg>
<seg id="70">On occasion, Maurepas and other courtiers would also write rhymes of their own to try to influence public opinion, letting them circulate at court and then filter out via salons and cafes to society at large.</seg>
<seg id="71">One such rhyme led to Maurepas's dismissal in 1749, when it became apparent that he was the author.</seg>
<seg id="72">It insulted the king's mistress, who was unpopular among his faction at court.</seg>
<seg id="73">Perhaps not unlike a certain former White House staffer, Maurepas had sought to exploit the media system to his own advantage, but instead brought about his own downfall.</seg>
<seg id="74">The power of the rhymes, however, remained intact: The relentless criticism of the libelles steadily corroded respect for the monarchy, undermined the king's authority, and paved the way for the French Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="75">And then came the Dark Ages.</seg>
<seg id="76">Starting in the mid-19th century, everything changed.</seg>
<seg id="77">The advent of the steam-powered printing press, followed in the 20th century by radio and television, made possible what we now call mass media (and what conventional wisdom thinks of as traditional media).</seg>
<seg id="78">These new technologies of mass dissemination could supply information directly to large numbers of people with unprecedented speed and efficiency, but their high cost meant that control of the flow of information became concentrated into the hands of a select few.</seg>
<seg id="79">The delivery of information became a one-way, centralized broadcast, overshadowing the tradition of two-way, conversational and social distribution that had come before.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is only in recent years that the Internet has made it possible to reach a large audience at low cost, allowing social distribution to re-emerge from the shadow of mass media.</seg>
<seg id="81">The rebirth of social media in the Internet age is thus both a profound shift -- and a return, in many respects, to the way things used to be.</seg>

<seg id="1">States' insurance exchange websites cost taxpayers $1B; contractors often paid to do same job in different states</seg>
<seg id="2">(CBS News) HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website, isn't the only website with issues following the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are also problems in the states that set up their own websites using taxpayer dollars.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sources tell CBS News that the 15 states that have set up their own insurance exchanges used more than $1 billion to pay for their own Obamacare websites.</seg>
<seg id="5">That huge price tag, CBS News' Jan Crawford reported on "CBS This Morning," is being paid for by the federal government -- courtesy of taxpayers -- and some of these websites have also struggled to get off the ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Special section: Health care in America</seg>
<seg id="7">With HealthCare.gov unusable for most, administration officials have pointed to efforts in the states and called it a success.</seg>
<seg id="8">Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said, "They are eager to enroll folks and that that is going smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="9">But people in some of those states may disagree with how smoothly it's going.</seg>
<seg id="10">One thing's for sure: the federal tax dollars are pouring in.</seg>
<seg id="11">A CBS News analysis shows that the 15 states that opted to set up their own exchanges are spending more than $1.1 billion to launch and implement their own websites, often paying the same government contractors to do the same job in different states.</seg>
<seg id="12">California has dedicated $359 million, while New York is spending $161 million.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Kentucky it's $100 million, and in Oregon the price tag is $50 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">The president has pointed to Oregon, which has enrolled 56,000 people in Medicaid - to argue things are working.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That's 56,000 more Americans who now have health care," the president has said.</seg>
<seg id="16">That doesn't depend on a website.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it's a good thing, because Oregon's website doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="18">The new Medicaid enrollments came through the mail.</seg>
<seg id="19">The state website has yet to enroll a single person.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clay Johnson, a former member of President Obama's technology team, said, "What we've done is we've created systems that enable this level of waste."</seg>
<seg id="21">Johnson blames federal rules that favor large government contractors who win out over and over, such as CGI that won bids in five different states to help develop their websites.</seg>
<seg id="22">CGI is the same company now under fire for its role as lead contractor for the federal website.</seg>
<seg id="23">Johnson said, "If CGI Federal had contracts with five different states, something tells me that they got paid five times for some of the same code."</seg>
<seg id="24">CGI has had better luck in some of the states, such as Kentucky, and other states say their websites are now well under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"But," Crawford said on "CTM," "it goes back to the money, and why are taxpayers are forking over more than a billion dollars on 15 different state websites that will end up looking pretty much the same."</seg>

<seg id="1">Martin Doktor on the problems with the Olympic Games in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is challenging</seg>
<seg id="2">The corners of his mouth indicate a small smile and then he just takes a deep breath: "It’s challenging."</seg>
<seg id="3">Cooperation with the organising team for the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complicated according to Martin Doktor.</seg>
<seg id="4">We can forget about how it was in the last Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Nothing works the same way," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.</seg>
<seg id="6">What exactly is happening?</seg>
<seg id="7">A lot of things work more slowly and not so precisely.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is kind of confusing.</seg>
<seg id="9">In terms of invoices, they are relatively quick, in terms of supplying information on essential things, they are not so good.</seg>
<seg id="10">For instance, we’ve spent three months trying to get them to tell us how they will officially identify the separate villages, so we can do all sorts of things in accordance with that.</seg>
<seg id="11">We’re still waiting and they keep saying that they’ll let us know.</seg>
<seg id="12">In many ways, they are always communicating.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is the Olympic village built at least?</seg>
<seg id="14">But it’s no longer a catastrophic situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">A month ago we were walking around empty rooms.</seg>
<seg id="16">The houses are standing fortunately.</seg>
<seg id="17">What does it mean, they are empty?</seg>
<seg id="18">Are the floors done, for example?</seg>
<seg id="19">Just the basic concrete floors, at least that is what it was like a month ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">But they still have time.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even though there is a danger that when we turn up on 26 January as the vanguard, we will still be able to smell the glue.</seg>
<seg id="22">And if they don’t manage it, what will there be?</seg>
<seg id="23">Do you think President Putin would bring in the army?</seg>
<seg id="24">That's exactly what will probably happen.</seg>
<seg id="25">As long as the Olympic villages are not Potemkin villages.</seg>
<seg id="26">It’s more likely that they won’t be able to fix the roads, for example, they won’t get the details finished.</seg>
<seg id="27">Maybe the roads will be in such a state that we’ll have to take our wellies from the London games.</seg>
<seg id="28">But I believe they’ll get it together somehow.</seg>
<seg id="29">How many Czech athletes could be going to Sochi?</seg>
<seg id="30">At the moment there are about 78 of them, although depending on nomination criteria, that number varies.</seg>
<seg id="31">Say, the figure skaters will probably go in the trio they ended up in.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is no doubt about the skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it is still in development stages.</seg>
<seg id="33">Have you got another trip to Sochi planned?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, as long as nothing happens, I won’t be flying out until 26 January.</seg>
<seg id="35">We know what the houses in the Olympic village will look like.</seg>
<seg id="36">We’ve even measured certain things ourselves, so we don’t just put our faith in the sketches.</seg>
<seg id="37">We are also planning a whole range of other things, including transport.</seg>
<seg id="38">And what is the head of the mission doing 100 days before the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="39">I’m preparing for the annual assessment of individual Olympic sports plus I’m working on my normal agenda in the sense of communicating with the organising committee in Sochi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israel vows to deny Hezbollah as details of Syria raid emerge</seg>
<seg id="2">JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said it would not allow advanced weapons to fall into the hands of Hezbollah, after a raid on Syria that opposition sources said had hit an air force garrison believed to be holding Russian-made missiles destined for the militant group.</seg>
<seg id="3">Israel has a clear policy on Syria and will continue to enforce it, officials said on Friday, after U.S. sources said Israel had launched a new attack on its warring neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="4">Israel declined to comment on leaks to U.S. media that its planes had hit a Syrian base near the port of Latakia, targeting missiles that it thought were destined for its Lebanese enemy, Hezbollah.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We have said many times that we will not allow the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah," said Home Front Defence Minister Gilad Erdan, a member of the inner security cabinet which met hours before the alleged Israeli attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We are sticking to this policy and I say so without denying or confirming this report," he told Israel Radio.</seg>
<seg id="7">Israel is believed to have attacked targets in Syria on at least four occasions this year, the last time in July, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying he would not let sophisticated anti-aircraft, anti-ship and long-range missiles move from the hands of Syria to its Hezbollah ally.</seg>
<seg id="8">A Latakia activist told Reuters that an explosion had rocked a garrison area that houses an air force brigade loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad near Snobar Jableh village mid-afternoon on October 30.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ambulance sirens were heard rushing to the scene, however, the activist, who calls himself Khaled, said there was a "total media blackout" about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights quoted sources as saying there were four or five explosions at the base, but only limited damage reported.</seg>
<seg id="11">Al-Arabiya news network said SAM 8 anti-aircraft missiles were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Former Syrian intelligence agent Afaq Ahmad, a defector now in exile in France, told Reuters on Thursday that contacts of his inside Syria, including in Latakia province, told him Russian-made ballistic missiles had been kept at the site that was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="13">Assad's forces, backed by Hezbollah and Iran, are battling rebels in a civil war that has killed well over 100,000.</seg>
<seg id="14">Khaled said Assad loyalists were frustrated about Israel's apparent impunity, recalling that the Syrian president had previously indicated Syria would respond to further attacks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yet Israel keeps hitting us and there's no retaliation.</seg>
<seg id="16">"So even the staunchest loyalists are getting very upset," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Israel deliberately remains silent over its actions in Syria to keep a lid on tensions and try to avoid pushing Assad into a corner where he would feel compelled to respond.</seg>
<seg id="18">Locals said they did not hear warplanes at the time of the blasts and there was initial confusion about who was behind the attack.</seg>
<seg id="19">One source, who declined to be named, said the limited damage on the ground suggested pin-point missile strikes.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign diplomat said that in the past the Israelis had succeeded in creating such confusion by using stand-off ordnance -- missiles or gliding bombs that can be released many miles from the target.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was clear irritation in Israel about the U.S. leaks, which analysts said might signal irritation in Washington over Israeli action at a time when Syria had bowed to international pressure and was dismantling its large chemical weapons arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Washington is selling our secrets on the cheap," said top-selling Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth.</seg>
<seg id="23">Israel has grown increasingly frustrated by U.S. policy in the Middle East, worried that President Barack Obama had been too soft on Assad and anxious over his rapprochement with Iran.</seg>
<seg id="24">Uzi Rabi, director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University, said Israel had to make many calculations before approving attacks on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="25">Israel is sending a message to Assad, saying 'don't play games with us'.</seg>
<seg id="26">"But Israel must also realize that the situation is becoming much more delicate than ever before because this is going against the U.S. diplomatic agenda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rabi said the "working assumption" in Israel was that Assad was so focused on battling rebels that he could not afford to retaliate.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, he expected that Syria would seek international support to prevent Israeli air strikes.</seg>
<seg id="29">A senior Israeli official, while declining to confirm any Israeli attack, did not expect Syria to respond.</seg>
<seg id="30">Assad is disarming (his chemical weapons) out of his own interests.</seg>
<seg id="31">"He knows how to make the necessary distinctions," said the official, who declined to be named.</seg>
<seg id="32">Technically at war with Syria, Israel spent decades in a stable standoff with Damascus while the Assad family ruled unchallenged.</seg>
<seg id="33">It has been reluctant to intervene openly in the 33-month Islamist-dominated insurgency rocking Syria, however is determined not to see Hezbollah profit from the unrest.</seg>
<seg id="34">Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill in a 34-day war six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="35">Israel has warned that any future conflict will be much more brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schwarzenberg: Within two years we will have an early election here</seg>
<seg id="2">Chairman of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.</seg>
<seg id="3">A week after the last election in an interview for Aktuálně.cz he said that there is no other way and each government formed as a result of voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible patchwork.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It can’t last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he predicts the lifetime of the starting electoral period will be two years.</seg>
<seg id="5">He disagrees with the objection that next time voters will make a completely different choice: "I think it will be a slightly more balanced decision."</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, the TOP 09 chairman will not admit that his party could lose more votes in another election than this year (compared with 2010 when they lost about 300,000 votes).</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were to become clear within two months that there will be an early election, it will strengthen Andrej Babiš’s ANO 2011.</seg>
<seg id="8">Otherwise, Schwarzenberg thinks Babiš will lose.</seg>
<seg id="9">Schwarzenberg gives his own commentary on the turbulent situation in ČSSD, where the chairman, Bohuslav Sobotka, declared after the secret meeting of the part of the party leadership at Lany, that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the Social Democrats:</seg>
<seg id="10">"The leading officials of the Democratic party are like little boys going after the head of state, to allow them make a change in the party."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I thought Mr Hašek was smarter and more intelligent."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Because I have never seen anything done so impatiently and stupidly like that," added the TOP 09 chairman.</seg>
<seg id="13">And referring to President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the fight for the presidency), he said: "The role of head of state is clear: He wants to usurp the party."</seg>
<seg id="14">TOP 09 has already submitted the first laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?</seg>
<seg id="16">TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the Chamber, including Farský’s register of contracts, which was discussed by parliamentary committees prior to the election but with the early election it ended up under the table.</seg>
<seg id="17">The TOP 09 chairman in the interview for Aktuálně.cz says that this speed is because "these laws are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to beat similar attempts by other parties.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, the electoral leader of ANO, Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election battle that with the idea to introduce a register of contracts it was "stealing" the ANO programme.</seg>
<seg id="20">TOP 09 is now using its advantage – it just dusted off the bill it had that was already heading for the second parliamentary reading.</seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="bd3fbd6cf00da50898b94cb0607f6e3e" genre="news" origlang="xx">
<seg id="1">This is not the way, Mr Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="2">We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the way.</seg>
<seg id="3">We need to develop the kind of pressure so that Martin Hašek is stripped of all his political posts and leaves the parliamentary mandate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so negligible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Martin Hašek is shielded by the promise he made, but everyone and especially a politician must be aware of the consequences of that promise and consider deeply what can be promised.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš also has the tangible property, but the question here is whether he is a politician).</seg>
<seg id="7">However good is the programme promoted by a liar, it is not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="8">In politics you do not apologise, in politics you step down.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Hašek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent declarations confirm this for me, that is if you weren’t lying – you can see here how complicated it is with lying), then leave the politics yourself, like a man.</seg>
<seg id="10">People will then accept your apology as the expression of a man who made a mistake and is taking responsibility for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Otherwise you will be viewed as a spineless wimp whose words and actions cannot be trusted.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either you want to be a proud albeit flawed man, or a coward for the rest of your life</seg>
<seg id="13">Perhaps it seems unfair that I am only addressing you, but you are a leader after all and they are just misguided sheep.</seg>
<seg id="14">And the leader you are and have always wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="15">I understand that you are now trying to climb down, regain your strength, sit out the shame and then attack again, but that is the way partisans or con men behave.</seg>
<seg id="16">You, I repeat, are a leader in your own eyes, the alpha male, so behave like that.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accept responsibility and leave politics.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the menu: Huevos rancheros; elderflower tonic; TOG santoku knives; Rene Redzepi</seg>
<seg id="2">This week I've been eating... Huevos rancheros</seg>
<seg id="3">I knew I'd like the tortilla-wrapped rancher's eggs that Anna Barnett was serving at her three-day pop-up at Jones & Sons in east London before I'd even pushed open the big glass doors.</seg>
<seg id="4">Why?</seg>
<seg id="5">Because having read the recipe for them on her blog (getinmygob.co.uk), I was fully apprised of the fact that they were composed largely of Gruyère cheese, butter and egg, which is about as happy a triumvirate of ingredients as you are likely to come across on a parky night.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were lots of other things to coo over on the "Latin-inspired" menu - almond alfajores and ceviche proved big hits, too - but it was these golden volcanoes of molten cheese and egg yolk which took the day.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rich without being cloying and served with a zingy salad, they were a fine demonstration of the beauty of simple cooking.</seg>
<seg id="8">I left warm, satisfied and wishing Barnett's pop-up would never pop down.</seg>
<seg id="9">Gin scrummy</seg>
<seg id="10">Fever-Tree continued its shake-up of the mixer market with a tasting at west London's Chelsea Physic Garden.</seg>
<seg id="11">It claimed to have amassed the largest display of gins in history - 160-odd in total - and would have scored a Guinness world record had the thirsty adjudicator not fallen asleep in the rhododendrons (not really, there was no adjudicator).</seg>
<seg id="12">I sipped Nolet's Dry Gin and a suitably floral Fever-Tree elderflower tonic barely an ice cube's throw from Britain's first cinchona, or "fever" tree, the bark of which provided the quinine that kept malaria at bay back in the days of the British Empire.</seg>
<seg id="13">That's 600 years of history in one drink.</seg>
<seg id="14">Don't mind if I do.</seg>
<seg id="15">Book this</seg>
<seg id="16">Libraries may be closing down all over the shop, but at a central London hotel one is being opened up to the public.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington will be hosting hosting book clubs throughout November in its well-stocked reading room.</seg>
<seg id="18">A roster of authors has been invited to come and read from their books, and to ease the evening on its way, there'll also be cocktails and sweet and savoury canapés inspired by the writer's novels. £35, ampersandhotel.com</seg>
<seg id="19">Blade stunner</seg>
<seg id="20">I try not to.</seg>
<seg id="21">Really I do.</seg>
<seg id="22">But every time I use a TOG santoku knife I feel a tiny bit like a samurai.</seg>
<seg id="23">Not only would the all-purpose knife probably cut Buddha, so phenomenally sharp is its blade, the range also happens to be made in Seki City, home of the Japanese samurai sword.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is an exquisite thing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well balanced - an essential when you are buying a posh knife - with a maple-wood handle and a blade made from 21 layers of steel and copper (the latter metal is added not for strength, but because of its antimicrobial properties).</seg>

<seg id="27">Sneak a peek</seg>
<seg id="28">Rene Redzepi, the king of Nordic cuisine, has a new book out - and it's rather special.</seg>
<seg id="29">Although Rene Redzepi: A Work in Progress has a fair few recipes from the restaurant (crispy reindeer moss, anyone?) it's not your common-or-garden cookbook - rather a compendium, of notes and snapshots from day-to-day life at one of the world's best restaurants. £39.95, phaidon.com</seg>

<seg id="1">Halloween 2013: By the Numbers</seg>
<seg id="2">When I was little, Halloween was magical.</seg>
<seg id="3">My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nowadays, I've become more of a scrooge.</seg>
<seg id="5">I haven't signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won't this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">But stats show that I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
<seg id="8">One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends.</seg>
<seg id="9">Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
<seg id="12">As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
<seg id="14">I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.</seg>
<seg id="15">We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="17">That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="23">The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's a mystery I have yet to solve.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.</seg>
<seg id="27">They have the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like "nice face."</seg>
<seg id="29">Finally, let's talk pumpkins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lucky for us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="33">The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kenya's military says its air force has attacked a militant training camp in Somalia in retaliation for last month's al-Shabab assault on Nairobi's Westgate Mall.</seg>
<seg id="3">Col. Cyrus Oguna said Thursday the militants who carried out the Westgate attack received training at the camp, which he said was 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Binswor, Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Oguna said the military won't know how many of the 300 militants in the camp were killed or wounded until an assessment Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said four military trucks were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Oguna said "many more" such attacks will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="7">The four-day siege of Westgate Mall began Sept.</seg>

<seg id="1">tech incubators boost baby care</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 10:40</seg>
<seg id="3">New hi-tech incubators will drastically improve baby care, the Wales Air Ambulance charity says.</seg>
<seg id="4">The charity has installed the Babypod incubators in its three aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="5">The service said the carbon-fibre pods will make a vital difference in treating infants up to nine months old.</seg>
<seg id="6">The portable incubator kits, which cost £16,000 each, will mean babies can be given more advanced treatment while being flown to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Babypods will undoubtedly support families up and down the country, and this is thanks to the generosity of the people of Wales</seg>
<seg id="8">End Quote Angela Hughes Wales Air Ambulance chief executive</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the first time the devices have been used in Wales, allowing paramedic aircrews to transport young children in a much safer environment.</seg>
<seg id="10">"These 'flying incubators' will completely change the way babies receive urgent medical care," said clinical and operations manager Jason Williams.</seg>
<seg id="11">Previously, infants would be carried in the arms of a parent or paramedic, but the Babypods provide a safer, warmer and calmer environment for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="12">Our highly skilled crews can also provide more advanced treatment in-flight, such as managing a difficult airway.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here for everyone</seg>
<seg id="14">The pioneering incubators are lightweight and non-metallic, which means they can be used directly in X-ray and MRI scanners as soon as a young patient arrives at hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The pods are lined with shock-absorbing foam to reduce vibrations from the helicopters.</seg>
<seg id="16">They also have vacuum mattresses which can help immobilise infants while in the air.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We're here for everyone in Wales, and that includes running the national children's air ambulance for the country," added the operations manager.</seg>
<seg id="18">Children often need very specialist care and we can get them to the treatment they need, whether it's Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff or Great Ormond Street in London.</seg>
<seg id="19">The new pods have been installed on aircraft at its three bases in Wales, at Swansea, Caernarfon and in Welshpool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The money to buy the incubators has come from donations.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Babypods will undoubtedly support families up and down the country, and this is thanks to the generosity of the people of Wales," said the charity's chief executive, Angela Hughes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Everyone's dirty little secrets exposed in high-tech neighbourhood watch</seg>
<seg id="2">Somewhere between the cyber espionage that outed the US as Big Brother Inc and the phone-hacking scandal that sank Rupert Murdoch's British form of journalism, the real news of the world may be Spies 'R' Us.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is now enough equipment available via the internet to turn Australians into our own James and Ja'mie Bonds.</seg>
<seg id="4">The US/Murdoch shenanigans - plus the report that Australian embassies are being used to intercept Asian phone calls and data as part of a US-global spying network - came courtesy of high-end, high-tech gear operated by highly experienced pros.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Australians can buy lots of devices - mobile phone monitors, listening bugs, night-vision cameras, vehicle tracking equipment, thermal imaging cameras, video cameras hidden in pens, flash light/stun guns and a hundred other pieces of equipment - that are relatively cheap and light years removed from the invisible ink and shortwave radio of the spy craft of yesteryear.</seg>
<seg id="6">Private detectives say the rise of the spy gear trade came out of the spouse-busting business.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It was helpful in divorce cases but quickly became evident how useful this sort of equipment is in various situations," one former NSW police officer said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The whole business got a huge kick along after 9/11 when heightened fears made everybody just a little bit scared of things they never once feared.</seg>
<seg id="9">The US is taking flak now because of reports its National Security Agency monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a fine irony.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms Merkel once recalled her parents were nervous whenever she talked for too long on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hang up!</seg>
<seg id="13">The Stasi is listening and it's all being recorded," her mother said, according to one biography.</seg>
<seg id="14">Coincidentally, as the Merkel revelations raged, Russia was forced to deny Italian reports it had equipped USB flash drives and cables to charge the mobile phones given to foreign delegates to the G20 meeting at St Petersburg in September with technology to retrieve data from computers and telephones.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, whistleblower Thomas Drake, a former senior executive at the NSA, told the ABC this week it was alarming that a nation would spy on those it considered an ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Spying on others is considered the world's second oldest profession and so the idea that nation states would engage in spying on others is no surprise, not at all," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">I think what's particularly pernicious here is the fact we're actually listening on the personal communications of the highest levels of governments in countries that are supposed to be our allies and are actually partnered with us in ensuring that we deal and defend against threats to international order and stability.</seg>
<seg id="18">Since humans started building empires and information considered secret or confidential was obtained without permission, people have been calling military intelligence an oxymoron.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it took the British to turn spying into high romance.</seg>
<seg id="20">At empire high noon, the 1903 novel The Riddle of the Sands: A Record of Secret Service by Erskine Childers established the spy thriller.</seg>
<seg id="21">Half a century later, as the sun set on empire, John Le Carre's George Smiley and Ian Fleming's James Bond kept the Union Jack fluttering.</seg>
<seg id="22">But Smiley's pragmatic calculations and Bond's louche bedroom antics have been replaced in real life by high-tech cloak and dagger and, as WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden prove, the rise of Everyman espionage.</seg>

<seg id="1">Waterhouse has her best chance yet in race she has never won</seg>
<seg id="2">For most of this year, it has been Gai Waterhouse versus the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Her campaign to stop the world from again snatching the Melbourne Cup is about to start.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's an international field again, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="5">Waterhouse says cheerily.</seg>
<seg id="6">As it has been the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will be hard to win it, because they're a lovely group of horses and all with terrific credentials.</seg>
<seg id="8">But I like the look of my horses.</seg>
<seg id="9">First time for everything: Gai Waterhouse is ready to win her first Melbourne Cup on Tuesday with race favourite Fiorente.</seg>
<seg id="10">Waterhouse could have as many as three starters in the Cup by the end of Derby Day, the start of the carnival at Flemington.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Cup favourite Fiorente, which finished second to Green Moon last year, and her French import Tres Blue won't be running on Saturday, having already qualified for the 24-horse field.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Julienas and Vaquera will contest the Lexus early in the day, potentially providing her with another runner for a race she has never won.</seg>
<seg id="13">Waterhouse's assault comes after months of controversy, in which she has brawled with John Singleton and officialdom in the wake of the More Joyous saga.</seg>
<seg id="14">Race ready: Fiorente continues his preparation for the Melbourne Cup at Altona Beach.</seg>
<seg id="15">This year represents her best chance of finally securing the famous two-mile race, although she also represents Australia's best chance of stopping a field again loaded with international stayers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Unlike previous years, that cannot be left to Bart Cummings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mystery surrounds whether the ailing trainer will be at the track for Derby Day, although the man himself insists he will attend on Tuesday if his eight-year-old warhorse Precedence sneaks into the Cup field.</seg>
<seg id="18">Currently 29th in the order of entry, the 85-year-old needs a healthy dose of luck if he is to vie for his 13th Cup victory.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this stage, Waterhouse will be content with just one.</seg>

<seg id="1">GCSE reforms: pupils to be graded from one to nine</seg>
<seg id="2">This includes:</seg>
<seg id="3">A cut in the amount of coursework and ensuring that any remaining tasks are marked by external examiners rather than teachers to avoid over-generous grading;</seg>
<seg id="4">A greater focus on end-of-course tests - scraping bite-sized modular exams;</seg>
<seg id="5">A single assessment window in May and June to stop exams being sat through the year;</seg>
<seg id="6">The end of "tiered" papers - easy and hard exams for pupils of differing ability levels - in most subjects other than maths.</seg>
<seg id="7">The changes will be applied to new GCSEs in English literature, English language and maths being introduced from September 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">They will be applied to other core subjects a year later.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ofqual also confirmed that it would consult on the range of subjects that will carry the GCSE title in the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">The move is likely to fuel speculation that some "soft" subjects such as media studies, PE and drama will no longer be branded as GCSEs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Glenys Stacey, the chief regulator said: "The evidence is clear: GCSEs need to change if they are to remain respected qualifications and support a world class education system."</seg>
<seg id="12">In recent years we have been taking action to improve the current GCSEs.</seg>
<seg id="13">But further changes are needed if GCSEs are to be more engaging and worthwhile to teach and study.</seg>
<seg id="14">GCSEs were introduced by the Conservatives in the late 80s to replace O-levels.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pupils were originally graded on a seven-point scale from A to G.</seg>
<seg id="16">An A* grade was added in 1994 - creating an eight-point structure - amid fears that exams failed to properly mark out the very brightest pupils.</seg>
<seg id="17">Today, Ofqual confirmed that it would ditch the system altogether in favour of one based on numbers for the new GCSE qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a key change, pupils will be graded on a nine-point scale, with nine being the highest grade.</seg>
<seg id="19">This will allow examiners to add more numbers in the future if further discrimination is needed.</seg>
<seg id="20">The nine point system will "provide more differentiation between students achieving the middle and higher grades," Ofqual said.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will also enable employers to differentiate between GCSEs sat in England and different GCSEs taken by pupils in Wales and Northern Ireland, which are not adopting the changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ms Stacey added: "For many people, the move away from traditional grades, A, B,C and so on, may be hard to understand."</seg>
<seg id="23">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="24">The new qualifications will be significantly different and we need to signal this clearly.</seg>
<seg id="25">It will be fairer to all students that users of the qualification will be able to see immediately whether they did the new or a previous version of the GCSE.</seg>
<seg id="26">The new scale will also allow better discrimination between the higher performing students.</seg>

<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">"He should be put in front of the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and "died" three times while on life support.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.</seg>
<seg id="18">To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it's not much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He didn't give himself up," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek may yet appeal his sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Distant planets, black and white films, or a little bit of fantasising about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter should toss around carelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the concept of his quartet, which will round off this year’s Strings of Autumn festival in the great hall at Prague’s Lucerna, everything actually is connected with everything.</seg>
<seg id="3">The momentary feelings of the musicians are the score for jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter’s quartet.</seg>
<seg id="4">Under his instructions, his colleagues, who are two generations younger, should play what they are currently experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="5">They approach the music as an entirely improvised intimate affair and have to think not of the harmony or rhythm but in cinematic images.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, the recent octogenarian Shorter – an exceptional composer and winner of nine Grammys, who used to play with Miles Davis and is now probably the greatest jazz saxophonist alive – does not like to explain this principle.</seg>
<seg id="7">He doesn’t talk much about music, despite his outlook on life being so closely linked to it.</seg>
<seg id="8">In my 80s, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let the life surprise you.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Too many people plan everything and then they are disappointed when things turn out differently," says Shorter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Child prostitution case sparks law debate</seg>
<seg id="2">TASMANIA'S attorney-general is pushing for tougher child sex offence laws following the case of a 12-year-old girl who was prostituted by her mother and her mother's partner.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Tasmanian Law Reform Institute has released an issues paper, which was commissioned by the state government after it was revealed that around 100 men had paid for sex with the girl in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="4">Attorney-General Brian Wightman responded by saying those accused of sex with an underage person should not be able to argue they didn't know that person's age.</seg>
<seg id="5">"My personal view is that in light of this case and the arguments raised in the issues paper, we should move to introduce a no-defence age in Tasmania so that defendants would not be able to use the excuse that they did not realise the person was underage, when they are below a specified age, as a defence," Mr Wightman said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The paper also considers whether the onus should be on the accused to prove an age mistake or on the prosecution to disprove it.</seg>
<seg id="7">"These are serious matters that go to the very essence of our criminal law and the need to balance the protection of society against the rights of an accused to a fair trial," Mr Wightman said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Tasmanian opposition said the government needed to act immediately.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Every day we delay we are effectively putting children in this state at risk," a statement said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tasmania is clearly out of step with the rest of the country as it is the only Australian jurisdiction that does not have a no-defence age for child sex offences.</seg>
<seg id="11">Former state politician Terry Martin was the only person convicted of having sex with the girl.</seg>
<seg id="12">He received a 10-month suspended jail sentence in November.</seg>
<seg id="13">The girl's mother, who can't be named, and her partner Gary John Devine are serving jail sentences.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hearts star Hamill stunned by Stevenson's recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">JAMIE Hamill has revealed his amazement at his close friend and neighbour Ryan Stevenson's Edinburgh derby-winning heroics for Hearts, having been convinced he would miss Wednesday night's League Cup quarter-final through injury.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Ayrshire-based duo travel together to training at Riccarton every day and Hamill revealed the extent of Stevenson's discomfort after suffering knee damage in last Saturday's league defeat against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I thought he was going to be out for another two of three months," said Hamill.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I got the call to pick him up as usual for training on Monday morning and he came out of his house with a knee brace on.</seg>
<seg id="6">I always look after him, though.</seg>
<seg id="7">I open car doors for him.</seg>
<seg id="8">He had an ice bucket for his knee in the car and he was not going to give it up.</seg>
<seg id="9">Stevo does like a bit of drama, to be fair, that's his middle name!</seg>
<seg id="10">But, seriously, when I spoke to him, I could tell how determined he was to feature in the derby.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Tuesday in training, he managed to get himself out onto the grass and did a bit and there was positive thinking.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even so, for him to go out play the way he did at Easter Road and score that winning goal was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="13">Having missed out through injury on Hearts" last two domestic cup finals, the 2012 Scottish Cup triumph over Hibs and last season's League Cup loss to St Mirren, Hamill is hoping for better fortune this time around as he bids to help Gary Locke's side to reach another showpiece occasion.</seg>
<seg id="14">"If we get to the final again, I'll hide in a cupboard wrapped in cotton wool until the day of the game," he smiled.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's difficult to watch a final from the sidelines, although I still managed to enjoy the after party when the boys beat Hibs 5-1.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, in the dressing room afterwards, it's hard to feel a part of it if you haven't played in the game.</seg>
<seg id="17">We've still got a tough semi-final to try to get through against Inverness, but I hope luck changes for me if we get there.</seg>
<seg id="18">The boys are happy with the draw.</seg>
<seg id="19">We beat Inverness on penalties in the semi-final at Easter Road last season and had a feeling we would be paired with them again.</seg>
<seg id="20">I hope the game is at Easter Road again, it's a good place for us to play and we would take a huge support with us again.</seg>

<seg id="1">We continue with I know what you did.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reporter: Almost four years to the day after levi karlsen was crushed to death under a truck, that insurance policy taken out just 17 days before, and his father, the executor -- karl karlsen now sitting inside this interrogation room.</seg>
<seg id="3">Across from investigators.</seg>
<seg id="4">What killed him?</seg>
<seg id="5">The truck.</seg>
<seg id="6">How'd the truck kill him?</seg>
<seg id="7">It landed on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">And I had nothing to do with the truck landing on him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Absolutely nothing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Reporter: So you haul him in and begin asking questions.</seg>
<seg id="11">How many different stories did he have?</seg>
<seg id="12">Three.</seg>
<seg id="13">Reporter: Version one?</seg>
<seg id="14">Karlsen says he and his wife come home from a funeral and a dinner afterward to find levi dead under the truck.</seg>
<seg id="15">But soon version two.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was now saying that he and his wife were preparing to leave for that funeral when he discovered his son in the garage, pinned under the truck.</seg>
<seg id="17">The truck had already been fallen over.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I found him dead.</seg>
<seg id="19">So this was around noon, you found, around noon or just before noon you found him?</seg>
<seg id="20">You went out there and the truck was rolled over on him?</seg>
<seg id="21">And I panicked.</seg>
<seg id="22">So you panicked in what regard?</seg>
<seg id="23">Just --i left him.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now you saw him did you run over and call medical help, call 911, did you get help?</seg>
<seg id="25">No, I didn't do anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">I froze.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now was there a phone in the garage?</seg>
<seg id="28">Or a cell phone or did you run back to the house and call 911?</seg>
<seg id="29">No,i went to the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="30">Reporter: So he saw his son dead and trapped under the truck and still left for the funeral?</seg>
<seg id="31">Reporter: He says that father didn't return until four hours later.</seg>
<seg id="32">During the interrogation, karl karlsen asks repeatedly for his pain medication during the interview, medication he says might have altered his behavior the day levi died.</seg>
<seg id="33">Like I say if it was due to medicine, I don't know, I won't play that card or whatever.</seg>
<seg id="34">And then, several hours into the interrogation, karl karlsen appears to be on the verge of yet a third version of his story.</seg>
<seg id="35">I could never hurt him, i couldn't.</seg>
<seg id="36">You're that close.</seg>
<seg id="37">Man, you're close.</seg>
<seg id="38">Let it out, let it out.</seg>
<seg id="39">Let it out.</seg>
<seg id="40">Couldn't do it.</seg>
<seg id="41">I'll walk with you.</seg>
<seg id="42">Was it just a split second thing?</seg>
<seg id="43">I couldn't hurt him.</seg>
<seg id="44">I opened the truck door.</seg>
<seg id="45">And when I did it -- truck.</seg>
<seg id="46">We've gone from he was dead when you walked in there, to it fell when you opened the door.</seg>
<seg id="47">I know.</seg>
<seg id="48">So take the final step.</seg>
<seg id="49">There is no more.</seg>
<seg id="50">I stepped in the truck and the thing fell.</seg>
<seg id="51">And I was just scared , I don't know why.</seg>
<seg id="52">Reporter: His son trapped by the truck and yet they still leave the house?</seg>
<seg id="53">Reporter: Does that make any sense?</seg>
<seg id="54">I can't imagine walking away and leaving your child dying on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="55">Reporter: They were going to a funeral.</seg>
<seg id="56">Reporter: And yet many would argue he had just created one right here in his own garage.</seg>
<seg id="57">It's fair to say that.</seg>
<seg id="58">Reporter: Karl karlsen continues to insist he's innocent, opening up to the "syracuse post standard" about his son from inside the county jail where that father is sitting tonight.</seg>
<seg id="59">Well, levi, I mean when he was younger, we had problems with him, um, um, school was hard for him.</seg>
<seg id="60">Um, losing his first mother was really traumatic, would be for anybody.</seg>
<seg id="61">Reporter: He talks about levi as a young father, that he took his son back in after levi's divorce.</seg>
<seg id="62">My wife and I took him back in and he -- I decided to stick my neck out for him and told him what his responsibilities would be.</seg>
<seg id="63">He became responsible, he had manners, he grew up.</seg>
<seg id="64">And he realized that mom and dad weren't out to make his life miserable.</seg>
<seg id="65">He got life back into him.</seg>
<seg id="66">Reporter: As that father now awaits trial in the coming ys -- his daughter, levi's sister erin and her aunt, collette say they're relieved their long-held suspicions will now play out in court.</seg>
<seg id="67">They're hopeful investigators in california will charge karl karlsen in the death of his first wife, too.</seg>
<seg id="68">I believe karl killed my sister.</seg>
<seg id="69">And because calaveras county didn't do their job, they enabled him to kill again.</seg>
<seg id="70">And he killed my nephew.</seg>
<seg id="71">And it's all linked to money.</seg>
<seg id="72">Reporter: Jurors will not hear about the death of his first wife.</seg>
<seg id="73">The judge ruling it's off limits.</seg>
<seg id="74">Prosecutors must stick to what happened to levi.</seg>
<seg id="75">His sister erin wants answers for both loved ones.</seg>
<seg id="76">I want to hear it from him.</seg>
<seg id="77">I want to hear those words come out of his mouth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australia's destiny will be shaped by its people: Rupert Murdoch delivers lecture to the Lowy Institute</seg>
<seg id="2">One of the ambitions of the Lowy Institute is to amplify Australian voices on the world stage, and no Australian businessman has had more success on that world stage than Rupert Murdoch.</seg>
<seg id="3">THE 21st century is Australia's for the taking.</seg>
<seg id="4">Australians are a naturally competitive people.</seg>
<seg id="5">Maybe it's because of where Australia sits geographically.</seg>
<seg id="6">Whatever the reason, Australians are curious about the world - and the great Australian diaspora proves we have never been shy about taking it on.</seg>
<seg id="7">That is a testament to our competitive streak.</seg>
<seg id="8">You see it in our sport and hear it in our everyday language: "Have a go, mate."</seg>
<seg id="9">Don't look for entitlements, have a go!</seg>
<seg id="10">This should be the spirit of the 21st-century global economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">And Australia is well suited by character and culture to be a great success in it.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Australia is on the cusp of becoming something rare and valuable in this new world: an egalitarian meritocracy, with more than a touch of libertarianism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But we can't wait for later.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the past few years, we have all seen how advances in communications and travel have eliminated the tyranny of distance.</seg>
<seg id="15">The same might be said for size.</seg>
<seg id="16">Think about Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="17">These are all small places, and hardly blessed with natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet they have carved out a competitive position in the world because of their free, open and dynamic economies.</seg>
<seg id="19">Australia can and should do better than all of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">Three factors will make the global Australian even more competitive in the world ahead.</seg>
<seg id="21">First, Australian values.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some people say we need to abandon Australian values.</seg>
<seg id="23">The truth is if we want to lead rather than follow, we need to promote Australia's values and strengthen the institutions that sustain them.</seg>
<seg id="24">Second, immigration.</seg>
<seg id="25">Having a diverse immigrant population is a precious resource as we engage the world.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rupert Murdoch delivers the 2013 Lowy Lecture at the Sydney Town Hall / Picture: James Croucher Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="27">Finally, disruption.</seg>
<seg id="28">One of the few certainties we can have is that the 21st century will be a century of disruption.</seg>
<seg id="29">Australia must be the economy that thrives on disruption.</seg>
<seg id="30">Primarily we will do this through the key drivers of prosperity: trade, technology, and free markets.</seg>
<seg id="31">If we do these things, I promise you this: Australia will do more than prosper.</seg>
<seg id="32">Australia will lead.</seg>
<seg id="33">Australia had a long history before it became a British colony.</seg>
<seg id="34">But that colonisation resulted in class pretensions that have lasted a long time.</seg>
<seg id="35">These pretensions include not only the stuffy, narrow-minded elitism that still exists in some small quarters of society, but more recently, the faux class war that has been stirred by contemporary politicians grasping for an election theme.</seg>
<seg id="36">Thankfully, Australia has emerged from its inauspicious colonial beginnings to become a proud nation - a nation that overcame those primeval prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a perfect example: Many of you will remember when a Catholic was rare in a Liberal Cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those days are now behind us.</seg>
<seg id="39">And Prime Minister Tony Abbott is part of the proof.</seg>
<seg id="40">The heart of Australia today is our belief in a fair shake for all - no man or woman is above any other.</seg>
<seg id="41">We applaud achievement and innovation.</seg>
<seg id="42">We want people to strive, to make the most of their talent and not to be content with their lot.</seg>
<seg id="43">That is the essence of an egalitarian meritocracy.</seg>
<seg id="44">That's an appealing message, and a competitive edge in a competitive world.</seg>
<seg id="45">If we wish to continue to punch above our weight, we must cultivate the values and institutions that sustain this ethos; our churches and our social organisations.</seg>
<seg id="46">The values that define Australia depend on more than good government and strong allies.</seg>
<seg id="47">They depend on sound and vigorous institutions - especially private institutions.</seg>
<seg id="48">You can't have the rule of law if the courts aren't free and independent - or if you have lawyers running amok as they do in the American system.</seg>
<seg id="49">We cannot allow the rule of law to become the rule of lawyers!</seg>
<seg id="50">You can't have a free democracy if you don't have a free media that can provide vital and independent information to the people.</seg>
<seg id="51">You can't have a competitive, egalitarian meritocracy if only some of your citizens have the opportunity for a good education.</seg>
<seg id="52">In a world as competitive as ours, the child who does not get a decent education is condemned to the fringes of society.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the decades since World War Two, Australia has gone through many changes.</seg>
<seg id="54">But for all this progress, there is still a strand among some who seem to value every culture except our own.</seg>
<seg id="55">These people are gravely confused about what real multiculturalism is.</seg>
<seg id="56">Multiculturalism is not relativism, and tolerance is not indifference.</seg>
<seg id="57">Australia has clear values and strong institutions.</seg>
<seg id="58">One key value is an openness to all comers - provided they are willing to abide by our way of life.</seg>
<seg id="59">The result is a great model for the world - a prosperous, multicultural society of people living together in peace and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="60">The nations that lead this century will be the ones most successful at attracting and keeping talent.</seg>
<seg id="61">We need to get the brightest of them here.</seg>
<seg id="62">That is how we will strengthen our human capital.</seg>
<seg id="63">Australia is on its way to becoming what may be the world's most diverse nation.</seg>
<seg id="64">This is an incredible competitive advantage.</seg>
<seg id="65">Which brings me to my last point: Australia must be the world's disruptive economy.</seg>
<seg id="66">The economist Schumpeter once described the process of "creative destruction" as essential to capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="67">The current fashionable word to capture that sense of creative chaos is "disruption."</seg>
<seg id="68">I guess some would say that I have been a disruptive influence at times.</seg>
<seg id="69">I will take that as a compliment, even if it wasn't intended that way.</seg>
<seg id="70">When I think of the newspaper industry today, and the transition that has taken place from Gutenberg to Google, I know the status quo is being disrupted yet again.</seg>
<seg id="71">Perhaps the most revolutionary disruption in the last decade has been the stunning growth of mobile communications.</seg>
<seg id="72">For a company like News Corp, that disruption has actually been a shot of adrenalin.</seg>
<seg id="73">Now, each and everyone of us can have our news and information when and where we want it.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is a huge leap for an industry that once had to rely on trucks and news agents alone to deliver news.</seg>
<seg id="75">The same opportunity for global growth is there for Australia, if we can make ourselves more nimble.</seg>
<seg id="76">While the lack of a huge domestic market presents challenges, it also means we have fewer huge industries demanding the government protections common in large industrial nations - and fatal for any society that hopes to advance in a disruptive world.</seg>
<seg id="77">And it means we are always forced to think outside the box.</seg>
<seg id="78">The disruptive forces in the world economy today are as relentless as they are remorseless.</seg>
<seg id="79">But once we embrace that reality, we can make sure they are rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is the Australian people who will, collectively, define this nation's destiny.</seg>
<seg id="81">We must be leaders, not followers.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must be egalitarian, not elitist.</seg>
<seg id="83">We must be victors, not victims.</seg>
<seg id="84">It won't be easy.</seg>
<seg id="85">But the Australia that I know and love has never shied from a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="86">This is an edited version of the speech given Thursday night to the Lowy Institute by Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp.</seg>

<seg id="1">So I wouldn't choke myself with hate</seg>
<seg id="2">Author Václav Kahuda has returned to writing after twelve years.</seg>
<seg id="3">After many years in which he read, lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) has published a new novel entitled Wind, Dark, Presence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The number of pages, comparable with that of his best known work, Thicket (Petrov, 2001), indicates it will not be a slender volume.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kahuda was interviewed by another significant Czech writer today – Emil Hakl – for Salon.</seg>
<seg id="6">What moved you to write a novel after twelve years of silence?</seg>
<seg id="7">I did it so I wouldn't choke myself with hate.</seg>
<seg id="8">To keep seeing new clones of people’s foolish triviality all around me, young organisms affected by blind, selfish endeavour.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not to say anything about us older people, faces ruined by helpless lust, the racketeering souls of racketeers, the ideologists with reversed polarity, who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a young whore.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the start of new millennium, I bought myself a small digital camera and filmed my God-fearing friends, freaks and hidden groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">I got over that.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sometimes I feel my brain is on fire from life on this planet.</seg>
<seg id="13">I’m happiest taking walks and in the evening reading books by lamplight.</seg>
<seg id="14">You talk about a feeling of frustration, of hate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Was there some sort of turning point in your past that affected you, or are you just getting old like the rest of us?</seg>
<seg id="16">That turning point occurred a long time ago, when I was around ten years old.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was no name for it at the time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hm, and then I lived.</seg>
<seg id="19">But somewhere inside there is still a surprised, quiet boy.</seg>
<seg id="20">I see another orphaned bastard, each in his tornado of anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="21">Writing books saved me.</seg>
<seg id="22">I’m taking part in this huge, thousand years lasting movement of the system of life on this planet – in the birth of an unfathomable future.</seg>
<seg id="23">The vast, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir of our present.</seg>
<seg id="24">We are the players of a sad and beautiful game, where through trial and error, more and more generations of beings are created, which in billions of interactions per second creates a sort of superhuman, artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="25">Twelve years is quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">Do you see your writing as an ongoing process or have you started right from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="27">The monologue, or rather the dialogue between the right and left halves of the brain sometimes rises to the surface and forms a book.</seg>
<seg id="28">Just as the periods of peace are interwoven with quietly sleeping metastases of wars which may wake up one day, my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.</seg>
<seg id="29">I felt a wordless avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I don’t do anything, one day it will silently bury me.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and it puts them in layers stored in the dark "below the surface of consciousness".</seg>
<seg id="31">The neocortex, the grey cerebral cortex, questions older evolutionary formations, it goes towards ancient growth rings of the cerebral tree.</seg>
<seg id="32">It talks to hairy beasts, questions snakes, looks for answers in the flight of birds, lifts its gaze to the clouds in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="33">Yes, moral law in me and the starry sky above me.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the end the brain questions the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">You express the ego metaphorically relatively often – could you define it biologically?</seg>
<seg id="36">The brain keeps, in its billions of connections and electrochemical links, all the memories and experiences the person concerned has gone through.</seg>
<seg id="37">This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, the registers of memory, uses the brain in its distinguishing, cognitive process, being exposed to a constantly changing present, in a continuous effort trying to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometimes faults occur due to an overload.</seg>
<seg id="39">By analogy – like your computer "crashing", from a program for a speech emulator and translator of foreign languages, you would first get entangled in the operating environment, Windows, for example, and after several unsuccessful restarts, you would end up with a dark green blinking Bios screen, in the base system which controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard between the processor and operating memory, etc.</seg>
<seg id="40">For those who still haven’t worked out what this is about – I’m talking about a psychospiritual crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">You often mention it – why is it this type of regression that interests you periodically?</seg>
<seg id="42">Because it is a pitfall.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the still functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behaviour, there appears a gap.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is good to quote Nietzsche here: "When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."</seg>
<seg id="45">A pure feeling – that a man is lost if all hope disappears, he psychically "dies" and a new quality sets in.</seg>
<seg id="46">And why does it interest me personally?</seg>
<seg id="47">I’ll answer with a parable.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man once fell into a pool and was drowning; days, months and years went by, he was still drowning and at the same time ha was reading, and those books taught him to swim – and therefore live.</seg>
<seg id="49">He became a "diver".</seg>
<seg id="50">Perhaps one sentence written by me will help someone, just as Hrabal’s texts once helped me.</seg>
<seg id="51">To what extent do you think of the reader, of a specific person who will read your text?</seg>
<seg id="52">The one about whom you cannot say anything meaningful, some call it psyche, others super-ego,  but in my opinion it was best characterised by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:</seg>
<seg id="53">"I is someone else – this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."</seg>
<seg id="54">From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo’s submarine, ran around the dark alleys of the shadowlands.</seg>
<seg id="55">Still, in the end, behind all this ramifying by authors and their message, it says: "Bright suns of other worlds by Karel Hynek Mácha".</seg>
<seg id="56">And when the book out is?</seg>
<seg id="57">Do you care about the reader’s opinion?</seg>
<seg id="58">The reflections that reach you through the people who read the book?</seg>
<seg id="59">Of course I care about the opinion of people who take 300 crowns and are willing to read 500 pages of text.</seg>
<seg id="60">And then, maybe years later, they contact me randomly on the street and thank me that I helped them with my book in some difficult life decision they had to make.</seg>
<seg id="61">Books are in fact "lives" or, put it better. "worlds".</seg>
<seg id="62">They are coded in symbols of letters, they carry the experience, the history of regions of that or another language.</seg>
<seg id="63">At any time we can bring them to life, when we let their sentences flow into the brain.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is actually, in its way, something forbidden, divine – to wake up more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is a fact whose DNA is stored in lines – according to old demonology books we commit witchcraft.</seg>
<seg id="66">After publishing the book – as tends to happen – a string of readings will await you.</seg>
<seg id="67">I remember you once liked reading.</seg>
<seg id="68">Are you going to throw yourself into it again with joy, or do you feel differently after many years?</seg>
<seg id="69">Now I just prefer talking.</seg>
<seg id="70">And what have I discovered doing this?</seg>
<seg id="71">There are good, intelligent people living everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="72">Their basic characteristic – they are discreet, they don’t draw too much attention to themselves, they are friendly, you don’t feel alone with them.</seg>
<seg id="73">I’ll give an example – in the town of Červený Kostelec there once lived (and I hope he still lives) a curly-haired bookseller (aptly named Červenka), a cheerful companion and a real ladies’ man.</seg>
<seg id="74">One time, when boozing, he presented to me the individual parts from a range of readers of my book Thicket.</seg>
<seg id="75">I looked them in the eyes and then I was shown a tattered, worn copy of my book.</seg>
<seg id="76">Embarrassed, I put the just-read sausage of a book down and wept briefly with masculine tears.</seg>
<seg id="77">We all stood there silently, swaying and weeping, drunk with emotion.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then this young, blond, mixed race guy couldn’t take it any longer and, with a roar, jumped out of the window head first into a snow drift.</seg>
<seg id="79">It was on the ground floor.</seg>
<seg id="80">We ran out into the night landscape and, overcome with the happy madness of the sensitive people, with the aching soul of journeymen and the nostalgia for remote patriots, we howled and brayed like werewolves until morning.</seg>
<seg id="81">Each of your books is formally and in content different to the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="82">Does that also apply to the text of Wind, Dark, Presence?</seg>
<seg id="83">It is a story.</seg>
<seg id="84">It is a fairy tale about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.</seg>
<seg id="85">In his novel Dry Valley, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian fable in the mouth of a folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the Bujan island.</seg>
<seg id="86">There lies a female dog, on her lies a grey casket.</seg>
<seg id="87">Horror, terror, mystery.</seg>
<seg id="88">It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">Perhaps we were all once, long ago, devils in hell and drew lots for the role that we would play on this Earth.</seg>
<seg id="90">Do you plan to keep writing or are you going to wait again for a free influx of inspiration?</seg>
<seg id="91">Answers are eternal – Otokar Březina.</seg>
<seg id="92">Writing is a wondrous form of dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="93">Something huge and nameless, similar to the movement of continents on a planet, influences our desire from such a depth and in such breadth that it goes entirely beyond our horizon – and so as an absolute matter of course, we act precisely in line with our preprogrammed task.</seg>
<seg id="94">We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.</seg>
<seg id="95">We are biological machines.</seg>
<seg id="96">We want to mate, we die in the defence of and conquering new personal territories.</seg>
<seg id="97">Sometimes there is a fault and we radiate compassion.</seg>
<seg id="98">Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.</seg>
<seg id="99">That is the answer to your question – a biological robot is already full of various faults, it stands on the shores of the ocean of unconscious and catches inflows of balmy wind in torn sails made from a dirty handkerchief.</seg>
<seg id="100">I have to write to become a human.</seg>

<seg id="1">iPad Air on sale today</seg>
<seg id="2">Apple fans in London had already been queuing for more than 24 hours when the Covent Garden store opened its doors at 8am to allow them to spend upwards of £399 on the new iPad Air.</seg>
<seg id="3">The thinner, lighter, more powerful iPad Air features a more advanced processor that the company hopes will unleash a new wave of applications, while the iPad Mini, announced at the same time but not yet on sale, will also be upgraded to use a "retina display" that has been popular in iPhone and Apple laptops.</seg>
<seg id="4">The similar specifications for the two new models mean that analysts expect iPad buyers to be more evenly split between Mini and full-size models.</seg>
<seg id="5">They will also be watching closely to see whether the iPad Air is sufficiently different from previous models to encourage users to upgrade.</seg>
<seg id="6">Starting at £399, the new iPad Air reaffirms Apple's ambition to capture the top end of an expanding market, rather than stoop to challenge the growing number of manufacturers, including Tesco and Argos, now producing cheaper tablets for as little as £99.</seg>
<seg id="7">The new device has also reportedly led to a 585 per cent increase in table trade-ins, research shows.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nearly one in six people (15 per cent) of the 1,000 consumers surveyed by sellmymobile.com are planning on trading in their current tablet in the next three months.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of these, 78 per cent plan to purchase a new tablet using the money from their existing device and 38 per cent will be getting the new iPad Air when it is released on 1 November.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Google Nexus 7 (11 per cent) and iPad Mini 2 (9 per cent) were the second and third most desired tablets that people plan to upgrade to.</seg>

<seg id="1">Airline axes Adelaide call centre</seg>
<seg id="2">A Malaysia Airlines jet docks at Tullamarine.</seg>
<seg id="3">MALAYSIA Airlines will close its Adelaide call centre before the end of this month, axing 32 jobs.</seg>
<seg id="4">The centre that once handled all Australian and New Zealand calls for the airline.</seg>
<seg id="5">The centre employed more than 60 people at its height but an employee, who did not wish to be named, said staff numbers had dropped since a State Government subsidy ended two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Since then, every time someone has left, they have never been replaced," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">We have about 10 contractors but three months ago they were marched out the door.</seg>
<seg id="8">""We have been told the calls will be cut off (here) on July 27 and everything will just be transferred to Malaysia.""</seg>
<seg id="9">The Malaysia Airlines website lists a Malaysian phone number in Kuala Lumpur for all ticketing, baggage and general inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="10">"A senior staff member in Adelaide would not talk about the closure but would only say it was "a head office process.""</seg>
<seg id="11">Senior regional vice president Ignatius Ong visited the Adelaide office last Thursday but refused to be interviewed and did not respond to questions emailed to his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The questions asked how much the airline hopes to save and whether the end of a State Government grant was a key factor in closing its Adelaide office.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Former Liberal Premier John Olsen proudly announced the opening of the call centre in August 2000 - one of three Malaysian Airline call centres around the world - saying SA had outbid three other states to attract the centre providing "a range of employee incentives" to clinch the deal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Support for the centre continued two years later when incoming Premier Mike Rann said he "would like to see the Adelaide call centre eventually provide reservations and other customer service functions to other countries in North Asia, and North and South America.""</seg>
<seg id="15">A State Government spokesman said there was no need for the Government to reconsider its approach because the airline had fulfilled its part of the deal.</seg>
<seg id="16">""Malaysian Airlines did receive government assistance to help the company set up a call centre in SA and the terms of the initial agreement have been fulfilled and Malaysian Airlines has made it's own business decision.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time, Malaysian Airlines showed its faith in the South Australian tourism market in March this year by increasing the number of weekly direct flights to Adelaide from four to six.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry says US spying has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedented admission</seg>
<seg id="2">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has "reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."</seg>
<seg id="6">He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="8">And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: "We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."</seg>
<seg id="12">There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said the itinerary is still being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some "tough love" will also be dispensed.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying," Murphy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Updated nomenclature for genetic sequences to solve taxonomic determination issues</seg>
<seg id="2">1, 2013 - An improved and expanded nomenclature for genetic sequences is introduced that corresponds with a ranking of the reliability of the taxonomic identification of the source specimens.</seg>
<seg id="3">This nomenclature is an advancement of the "Genetypes" naming system, which some have been reluctant to adopt because of the use of the "type" suffix in the terminology.</seg>
<seg id="4">The study was published in the open access journal Zookeys.</seg>
<seg id="5">The use of genetic sequences has been increasing with each passing year but unfortunately, the separation between voucher specimens and genetic sequences is similarly growing.</seg>
<seg id="6">With increasing frequency, the link between the genetic sequences being used in analyses and the organisms from which they came is not being reported.</seg>
<seg id="7">The taxonomic determination remains solely the responsibility of the submitter of the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="8">Erroneous identifications are difficult to discover, and the perpetuation of the error in subsequent uses of the sequence data is nearly impossible to stop.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the new nomenclature, genetic sequences are labeled "genseq," followed by a reliability ranking (e.g., 1 if the sequence is from a primary type), followed by the name of the genes from which the sequences were derived (e.g., genseq-1 16S, COI).</seg>
<seg id="10">The numbered suffix provides an indication of the likely reliability of taxonomic identification of the voucher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Included in this ranking system, in descending order of taxonomic reliability, are the following: sequences from primary types -- "genseq-1," secondary types -- "genseq-2," collection-vouchered topotypes -- "genseq-3," collection-vouchered non-types -- "genseq-4," and non-types that lack specimen vouchers but have photo vouchers -- "genseq-5."</seg>
<seg id="12">To demonstrate use of the new nomenclature, the authors of the study review recently published news species descriptions in the ichthyological literature that include DNA data and apply the GenSeq nomenclature to sequences referenced in those publications.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Use of the new nomenclature and ranking system will improve integration of molecular phylogenetics and biological taxonomy and enhance the ability of researchers to assess the reliability of sequence data,"explains one of the authors Dr. Prosanta Chakrabarty, Museum of Natural Science, Louisiana State University.</seg>
<seg id="14">We further encourage authors to update sequence information on databases such as GenBank whenever nomenclatural changes are made.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ostrava’s Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD)</seg>
<seg id="2">Before the election, a long-smouldering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava branch of ČSSD was fully ignited.</seg>
<seg id="3">It all culminated when Ostrava mayor Petr Kajnar took court action due to the undemocratic assembly of lists of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="4">Players in the affair still did not want to say much on the matter, so as not to harm the party even more prior to the election.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, however, the votes have already been counted.</seg>
<seg id="6">The leadership of Ostrava’s ČSSD therefore urged the mayor of Ostrava on Monday evening to stand down from the party, and they will probably push so that he will lose his post.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Petr Kajnar wants to fight on.</seg>
<seg id="8">In an exclusive interview for Deník, he has described what the disputes are about and who is on whose side.</seg>
<seg id="9">How do you feel about the outcome of the election?</seg>
<seg id="10">The ČSSD was certainly expecting a much better result.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was it harmed here by the inner-party disputes being discussed in the media prior to the election?</seg>
<seg id="12">I can imagine that social democracy party could have had a better outcome in the election.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on the other hand, it reflects the state the ČSSD is now in.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a party which has its internal issues, it is sick inside and people can see that things are not all right.</seg>
<seg id="15">They made that clear in the election.</seg>
<seg id="16">What are these internal illnesses in the ČSSD?</seg>
<seg id="17">The ODS has already been going through a decline for some time, in my view, and similar things are now happening unfortunately in social democracy party.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fact is that lobbyists, influential people, who previously expected to find their prebends with the ODS, have shifted to people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is then related to the police searching through the offices of the Ostrava municipal authority and collecting computers.</seg>
<seg id="20">It shows that the ČSSD is not just made up of people who want good for all the others, but that many of them think primarily of their own good.</seg>
<seg id="21">The ČSSD is split into two irreconcilable camps in Prague too, as can also be seen in the current power struggle between Hašek’s and Sobotka’s supporters.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that has been in preparation for a long time too.</seg>
<seg id="23">What happened before the election in Ostrava was just a precursor to what is now happening in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hašek’s wing gradually occupied the positions so that after the election it could provoke a situation which would weaken Sobotka’s wing.</seg>
<seg id="25">In politics, you are in a situation where you sometimes have to accept compromises.</seg>
<seg id="26">But everyone has their own internal limit beyond which it is not possible to make compromises, and that is also my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">Originally I did not want to run for the chamber, but when I saw all that was going on in the party, I made an agreement with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try and get on the regional list of candidates, so that as the mayor of Ostrava I could actually strengthen Sobotka’s wing.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, Hašek’s wing put a stop to that.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, and not on the side of Michal Hašek?</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that Slávek Sobotka is the person who always talks first of all about the ČSSD programme and to a certain extent  also about the visions concerning the party and this country.</seg>
<seg id="31">I admit that I haven’t heard anything of the sort from the other side.</seg>
<seg id="32">Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.</seg>
<seg id="33">I don’t understand how can the presidium, which is a lower authority than the central executive committee, start with just removing the party chairman.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is a power struggle regardless of anything and it is against the party statutes.</seg>
<seg id="35">In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has displayed in Prague has ended his political career.</seg>
<seg id="36">How do you view the fact that the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you for the list of candidates?</seg>
<seg id="37">Political parties are based on competition, who takes what place from their members.</seg>
<seg id="38">The competition should mainly be based on programme visions and the capabilities of the people to fulfil those visions.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, there are people who also enter this competition who do not have much in the way of ability or vision, but the political party is  for them a lift towards the money they would not get elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="40">The problem is, when these people start to get to the fore thanks to their breaking the rules unscrupulously, they breach the party statutes.</seg>
<seg id="41">With their practices, they turn political parties into the mafias and in my opinion they are therefore also breaking the Czech laws.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is more important to me to point out this problem than to take into consideration whether or not Kajnar has some sort of political future.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is important for the parties to start respecting the statutes.</seg>
<seg id="44">Is that why you filed a petition to the court then before the election for an injunction against the form of the list of the ČSSD candidates in the Moravian Silesian Region?</seg>
<seg id="45">The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is strengthening its power by shutting down organisations that do not satisfy it, purposefully founding new organisations, and gradually getting rid of inconvenient party members.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, the fact is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the representatives club, but he brought an action against it and they then instead cancelled their resolution about his exclusion.</seg>
<seg id="47">This shows that demanding adherence to party statutes through the courts may be the last option, but when the other methods and inspection authorities inside the ČSSD have stopped working, it is the only option.</seg>
<seg id="48">The leadership of the Ostrava’s ČSSD headed by Adam Rykala is attempting to remove you from the post of mayor.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is an open secret that Poruba’s mayor, Lumír Palyza, is itching for this post.</seg>
<seg id="50">It’s true, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to remove me.</seg>
<seg id="51">They are promising posts to the people, gaining the votes and for these votes they are strengthening their power in the party.</seg>
<seg id="52">When I go back to the past, then everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava, for example, and the purchase of the Bazaly Stadium, it was just an excuse for them to attack me.</seg>
<seg id="53">It was artfully staged so they could label me as someone who puts money where it doesn’t belong.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the same time, the city bought the property which has a high strategic value for them.</seg>
<seg id="55">So how do you envisage what will happen next in your remaining in the post of the mayor?</seg>
<seg id="56">The district committee already called upon me and some other people on Monday to consider whether to remain in the ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="57">But I think it is like a thief shouting: Catch the thief!</seg>
<seg id="58">When we look at the results of my work in the last eleven years, I don’t see anyone in the  Ostrava’s Social Democratic Party who would initiate and enforce, sometimes even against party members, the creation of so many developments, such as industrial zones or expanding the science and technology park.</seg>
<seg id="59">Despite everything, I am becoming inconvenient.</seg>
<seg id="60">I don’t read it differently than I’m in the way of others fighting their way to the posts they long for.</seg>
<seg id="61">Will you continue to fight against these attempts?</seg>
<seg id="62">Because if this republic is meant to work well, the political parties must also work well.</seg>
<seg id="63">I can hardly believe that any party can effectively manage a country when it cannot even manage itself.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I’m not considering leaving the ČSSD now, because I think that I am not the one causing this party’s cancer, it’s the people who are trying to drive me out.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moray Firth fishing communities exhibition opens</seg>
<seg id="2">A NEW exhibition of photographs, celebrating the lives of the men and women who work in the fishing communities of the Moray Firth, opened today at the gallery at Duff House in Banff.</seg>
<seg id="3">"At Sea," featuring the photographs of Edinburgh photographer Paul Duke, will run at the gallery until 5 January.</seg>
<seg id="4">A spokesman for Historic Scotland said: "Between 2009 and 2012, Duke amassed around 100 portraits, all of which were shot on location using a portable studio set-up in harbours, shipyards, factories and sheds."</seg>
<seg id="5">"The images also feature in an accompanying book, At Sea, which includes an afterword by the late painter John Bellany - who himself drew inspiration from coastal communities - in which he describes Duke's photographs as "noble portraits of noble individuals.""</seg>
<seg id="6">Sector "key to North east economy"</seg>
<seg id="7">The exhibition was opened by Stewart Stevenson, the SNP MSP for Banff and Buchan.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said: "Paul Duke's work documents the fishing industry - a sector that has long been key to the North east's thriving economy."</seg>
<seg id="9">I was pleased to welcome Paul to Parliament in May when he displayed his work there, and I am delighted that he has taken the opportunity to showcase his work in the area that it is focussed on.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lorna Ewan, Head of Visitor Experience, Content and Learning at Historic Scotland said: "Duff House is a spectacular location and will provide the perfect backdrop for this fascinating exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="11">Paul Duke's work explores an industry which plays a significant role in the identity of the North East, and visitors to Duff House will be given a unique opportunity to find out more about the people behind that industry through his beautiful portraits.</seg>
<seg id="12">Duke gained a Master of Arts degree from the Royal College of Art in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="13">After living and working in Emilia Romagna in Italy, he returned to the UK where he has been lecturing in photography.</seg>
<seg id="14">His work is held in both private and public collections, including the National Portrait Gallery in London and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.</seg>

<seg id="1">Flaxseed may reduce blood pressure, early findings show</seg>
<seg id="2">NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Eating a bit of flaxseed each day might help lower high blood pressure, a new study suggests.</seg>
<seg id="3">Researchers said it's too early to swap out blood pressure medication for the fiber-filled seeds just yet.</seg>
<seg id="4">But if future studies confirm the new results, flax might be a cheap way to treat high blood pressure, they added.</seg>
<seg id="5">Flaxseed is well known as a plant source of omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and lignans, a type of antioxidants.</seg>
<seg id="6">But so far, its effect on high blood pressure, or hypertension, has been better studied among animals than humans.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is the first demonstration of the cardiovascular effects of dietary flaxseed in a hypertensive population," Grant Pierce told Reuters Health in an email.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pierce is the senior author on the study and executive director of research at St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="9">One in three American adults has high blood pressure, considered 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and over, according to the National Institutes of Health.</seg>
<seg id="10">Having high blood pressure increases a person's risk of heart disease and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">The condition costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year, Pierce said.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is the number one reason for a person to visit a physician in the U.S. today," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Understanding how to reduce blood pressure has become, therefore, a critical challenge.</seg>
<seg id="14">His team's results were published in the journal Hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="15">The trial included 110 people who had been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease, in which plaque builds up in arteries in the leg.</seg>
<seg id="16">Patients with the condition often have high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="17">The participants were randomly assigned to either a flaxseed or comparison group.</seg>
<seg id="18">People in the flaxseed group ate a variety of foods like bagels, muffins and pasta that contained 30 grams - about one ounce - of milled flaxseed every day for six months.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those in the comparison group were given foods that tasted similar, but didn't contain any flaxseed.</seg>
<seg id="20">The researchers had participants increase their dose of flaxseed gradually so they could become accustomed to the fiber load.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, one in five participants dropped out of each group during the trial.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some of that could have been due to stomach pain from the extra fiber, Pierce said.</seg>
<seg id="23">People who had an initial systolic blood pressure - the top number in a blood pressure reading - of at least 140 mm Hg saw that figure drop by 15 mm Hg, on average, after six months of taking flaxseed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Their diastolic blood pressure - the bottom number - also fell by 7 mm Hg.</seg>
<seg id="25">Blood pressure did not change among people with hypertension in the comparison group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"These decreases in (blood pressure) are amongst the most potent dietary interventions observed and comparable to current medications," Pierce said.</seg>
<seg id="27">There was no flaxseed-related benefit for people with normal blood pressure, however.</seg>
<seg id="28">Flaxseed costs about 25 to 50 cents per ounce.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new study was partially funded by the Flax Council of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="30">It wasn't originally designed to study blood pressure, which means the results have to be interpreted with more caution.</seg>
<seg id="31">"The study results are indeed surprising - it is actually hard to imagine such huge reductions in blood pressure with flax seed mixed in food stuffs," Dr. William B. White told Reuters Health in an email.</seg>
<seg id="32">White, from the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington, is also the president of the American Society of Hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was not involved in the new study.</seg>
<seg id="34">He also expressed some concern that measuring blood pressure changes was not the initial reason for doing the study.</seg>
<seg id="35">And he said the way blood pressure was measured - during a single office visit - isn't as accurate as checking it at multiple points throughout the day.</seg>
<seg id="36">The results are preliminary - there is not enough information to justify people taking flax seed for the control of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="37">"A larger, more controlled trial with out-of-office blood pressure would be needed," White said.</seg>
<seg id="38">According to Pierce, a new study is underway.</seg>

<seg id="1">Key outs don't worry West Coast Eagles</seg>
<seg id="2">Daniel Kerr will miss West Coast's clash with Brisbane.</seg>
<seg id="3">WEST Coast are adamant their midfield will not be exposed despite the omission of Daniel Kerr and Chris Masten from the side to take on Brisbane on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The loss of Kerr (knee) will leave a massive gap in their midfield but assistant coach Scott Burns denied the severity of his injury and said it was a precautionary move.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's only a little bit sore but it's a six-day break and he didn't quite come up but he'll be right Friday night next week," Burns said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Eagles were forced to include two players on the comeback from injury and a debutant, but are confident that they are match-ready.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They've done the minutes to get in and play or else we wouldn't be risking it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">" (Matt) Priddis, Scotty Selwood, (Luke) Shuey and (Andrew) Gaff, they're rock hard fit ... and Coxy (is) obviously in the ruck so the other boys add a little bit of freshness," the former Collingwood enforcer said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Eagles and Lions sit together on eight premiership points and will both be looking to turn their respective seasons around.</seg>
<seg id="10">Burns was wary of the Lions' on-ballers and predicted a "tough" matchup at the venue where they were beaten by two points in round 10 last year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Their midfield's quite strong and they've got a lot of players that can go through there, so playing them up here at the Gabba where they'll be pretty keen to turn things around," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Eagles will blood young midfielder Mark Hutchings, who they snapped up at pick 60 in the draft after he was cut from the St.Kilda rookie list in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 21-year-old returned to the WAFL for two years and finally earned his chance after producing an impressive 33-possession game last week.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's been great for him to get in (because) he's worked really hard to get his opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He is a strong-bodied midfielder and I think he'll deal pretty well at this level," Burns said.</seg>

<seg id="1">U.S. Navy cancels notice on possible F/A-18 fighter jet order</seg>
<seg id="2">By Andrea Shalal-Esa</seg>
<seg id="3">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Thursday canceled a notice about a possible order of up to 36 more Boeing Co (BA.N) F/A-18 fighter jets or EA-18G electronic warfare planes after the posting on a federal procurement website sparked confusion this week.</seg>
<seg id="4">The pre-solicitation notice, which first became public this week, had triggered renewed questions about the Navy's commitment to the $392 billion radar-evading F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).</seg>
<seg id="5">Boeing has sought for years to sell the Navy more of its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets for use on aircraft carriers, as a hedge in case the more capable carrier variant of the F-35 fighter jet runs into further delays or technical challenges.</seg>
<seg id="6">Navy officials this week said they had no plans to buy more Super Hornets or EA-18G Growlers in fiscal 2015 despite the notice on a federal procurement website.</seg>
<seg id="7">They said the notice was meant to ensure the "proper acquisition process" was in place if more U.S. or foreign orders materialized.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the posting caught Pentagon officials by surprise, since the current Navy budget calls for F/A-18 funding to end in fiscal 2014, with production of the planes to end in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear why Naval Air Systems Command, or Navair, decided to cancel the notice, which was first posted October 17.</seg>
<seg id="10">The procurement website was updated on Thursday to say the notice had been canceled, but no explanation was provided.</seg>
<seg id="11">Officials with Navair, which oversees aviation programs such as the F/A-18, could not be reached for comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">One U.S. official said the episode underscored the Navy's tepid commitment to the single-engine F-35 and the continuing attachment of many naval aviators to the Super Hornet, which has two engines.</seg>
<seg id="13">"There is a desire at pretty significant levels in the Navy to keep the Super Hornet line alive," said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lockheed is developing three models of the new warplane for the U.S. military and eight partner countries: Britain, Canada, Turkey, Italy, Norway, Australia, Denmark and the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="15">Israel and Japan have also placed orders.</seg>
<seg id="16">The U.S. Marine Corps will be first service to start using the new radar-evading warplanes from mid-2015.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Air Force will follow a year later.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Navy will be the last U.S. military service to start using its F-35 variant in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="19">Unlike the other services, the Navy's current fleet of fighter jets is relatively young, bolstered by repeated increases in F/A-18 and EA-18G procurement in recent years, including many planes added to the Navy budget by lawmakers.</seg>
<seg id="20">That fact has prompted debate about postponing the Navy's purchases of F-35s, but F-35 program officials and senior Pentagon leaders say that would drive up the cost of the remaining planes to be bought by the Air Force, Marine Corps and U.S. allies.</seg>
<seg id="21">Boeing officials had no comment on the Navy's latest move.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Chicago-based company is keen to sell the Navy and U.S. allies more F/A-18s to extend the life of its production line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is pitching the Navy a range of upgrades for the Super Hornet, including an improved engine and fuel tanks that are hard to detect by enemy radar.</seg>
<seg id="24">Boeing had hoped to land a big contract for F/A-18 fighters from Brazil, which would have extended the production line, but that order faltered after reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had spied on Brazil's president.</seg>
<seg id="25">Boeing's F/A-18 is also short-listed in Malaysia's competition to replace 18 Russian-made MIG-29s, but Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told Reuters on Thursday that the country's decision could be delayed by budget pressures.</seg>
<seg id="26">U.S. defense officials say declining military budgets will force tough choices about weapons programs in coming years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Boeing argues that this country should have more than one fighter manufacturer, but the truth of the matter is we can't afford to have two fighter lines," said one U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly.</seg>
<seg id="28">Boeing's F-15 fighter jet is now slated to end production in 2018 after completion of a large Saudi Arabian order.</seg>
<seg id="29">Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall told Reuters in September that he did not expect the U.S. Navy to significantly change its plans to buy F-35 fighter jets despite mounting budget pressures.</seg>
<seg id="30">He said the Navy needed the added capabilities that the F-35 offered since other countries were developing their own radar-evading fighter planes, advanced electronic warfare capabilities and other advanced weapons.</seg>
<seg id="31">The F/A-18 is a great airplane, but it's a fourth generation fighter.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The F-15 is a great airplane, the F-16 is a good airplane, but they're fourth generational fighters, and you get a quantum improvement in capability out of the F-35," Kendall said.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">But mice who had not been given the vaccine "chilled out," say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.</seg>

<seg id="2">The organiser of the Olomouc Christmas markets and ice skating, Pavel Spálený, said that the planned work on the ice rink began on 26 October and from Wednesday ice making machine has been operating.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ice layer is already seven centimetres thick and by Friday morning the surface will be ready for the first visitors.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ice rink has an area of 375 square metres, the platform has taken up 358 square metres.</seg>
<seg id="5">Skaters and passers-by will also have two stalls with punch at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have extended the floor area, increased the space in front of the stalls and almost all of the platform area is covered so the skaters can change their shoes in comfort," said Spálený.</seg>
<seg id="7">The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the coming Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance to the town hall on the square Horní Náměstí, due to the repairs on the square Dolní Náměstí.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dolní Náměstí repairs were completed in late summer, so the ice rink could return to its original location.</seg>
<seg id="10">People could first skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ice rink then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Premarket: Euro on the ropes after dive in inflation</seg>
<seg id="2">The euro tumbled to a two-week low on Friday after a plunge in euro zone inflation left markets suddenly eyeing the outside chance of a cut in interest rates by the European Central Bank next week.</seg>
<seg id="3">European shares saw a subdued end to what looked to be a fourth week of gains, but the combination of Thursday's surprise dive in inflation to just 0.7 per cent and a revitalized dollar kept it on the ropes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After its biggest fall in six months in the previous session, the euro fell to $1.3530, on course for a fall over the course of the week of two per cent.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is clear that there has been a major sentiment change on the euro," said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo bank in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ECB's single mandate has always been on inflation so this gives Draghi and co further reason to do something at next week's meeting.</seg>
<seg id="7">We see considerable further downside.</seg>
<seg id="8">The likes of euro/dollar back into the old range, down towards $1.30.</seg>
<seg id="9">The move was amplified as dollar continued to kick away from a recent nine-month low, boosted by upbeat U.S. data overnight.</seg>
<seg id="10">Stock markets across the continent lost between 0.2 and 0.5 per cent, , pegged back by signs of third quarter weakness at some major European firms.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, the return of bets on an ECB rate cut saw euro zone government bonds extend this week's rise.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reassuring signals on China's factory activity offered support to Asian markets, though Tokyo's Nikkei finished at a one-week low as the yen strengthened against the euro.</seg>
<seg id="13">Markets" focus remains heavily on U.S. monetary policy and how soon the Federal Reserve will begin tapering back its $85-billion a month support programme, having delayed a move in September.</seg>
<seg id="14">U.S. S&P E-mini futures edged up about 0.1 per cent, after the S&P 500 Index closed down about 0.4 per cent on Thursday but still gained 4.5 per cent for the month.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ISM survey of manufacturing for October will give investors the latest temperature reading on the state of the U.S. economy after some upbeat PMI data on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If the ISM report is better than expected, it could add to revived tapering expectations, and U.S. yields and the dollar could go up and stocks could go down," said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Not all players are convinced that this week's U.S. newsflow heralds a shift in monetary policy expectations, given the disruption caused by last month's Federal shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The existence of noise in the October data will likely make it difficult for the Fed to gather enough evidence to start tapering in December," strategists at Barclays wrote.</seg>
<seg id="19">In commodities trading, gold steadied but at $1,326.01 an ounce was still close to its lowest in nearly two weeks, hurt by sharp losses in the previous session from month-end profit-taking, the strong U.S. economic data and the higher dollar.</seg>
<seg id="20">Copper got a lift from the China data, rising to $7,281 a tonne and back toward a one-week peak of $7,300 hit on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">Brent crude added 0.3 per cent to $109.19 a barrel as U.S. crude edged up 0.1 per cent to $96.44.</seg>

<seg id="2">Flight operator BMI Regional is stopping several Scottish routes as it closes its Edinburgh base.</seg>
<seg id="3">It confirmed it would stop flying between Edinburgh and Manchester, Copenhagen and Brussels, while it will also cease routes between Manchester and Antwerp and Birmingham and Billund.</seg>
<seg id="4">The firm said it expected "no net job losses" as a result of the move, but confirmed it had opened consultation with around 80 workers at its Edinburgh, Birmingham and Manchester crew bases.</seg>
<seg id="5">It stated it would offer those employees a chance to relocate, while it would continue to employ around 400 workers across its operations.</seg>
<seg id="6">The move came around a year after it sold by British Airways owner International Airlines Group last October.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman from BMI Regional said: "Following a comprehensive review of our network, bmi regional has announced the closure of five routes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The routes affected are Manchester to Edinburgh and Antwerp, Birmingham to Billund and from Edinburgh to Copenhagen and Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="9">BMI Regional is to focus on routes elsewhere in Scotland and in other parts of the UK and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="10">The airline announced a new route from Newcastle to Brussels last week, and commenced services between Aberdeen and Oslo on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, our crew bases in Birmingham, Edinburgh and Manchester will close.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have started consultations with affected employees, including the opportunity to move to one of our other crew bases.</seg>
<seg id="13">We expect no net job losses as a result of the move.</seg>
<seg id="14">The base closures leave Aberdeen and Bristol as the main hubs of the flight operator.</seg>
<seg id="15">It confirmed the affected routes would cease to operate later this year.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company spokesman added: "We would like to reassure all customers booked to fly with us on the affected routes that services will operate up to the termination date (November 29 for Manchester, December 31 for Billund and January 5 for Edinburgh to Copenhagen and Brussels).</seg>
<seg id="17">We will be in contact with passengers booked beyond these dates to offer alternative arrangements or refund.</seg>

<seg id="6">WILL Chris Brown ever be able to get his career back on track?</seg>
<seg id="7">The 24-year-old singer once again hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons this week when he checked into rehab for anger management issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">It follows his October 28 arrest for allegedly physically and verbally assaulting a man in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's just the latest in a long string of incidents that have left Brown's reputation in free-fall, which began when he assaulted Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammy's leaving her bloodied and bruised.</seg>
<seg id="10">So how can a celebrity with such an appalling public persona convince the world to give him another go?</seg>
<seg id="11">Celebrity publicist Max Markson says a simple five-point plan could be the answer to all of Chris Brown's PR problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here's what he would advise the Forever singer to do:</seg>
<seg id="13">A tell all interview with Oprah Winfrey: "He needs to come clean and say sorry, just like Lance Armstrong did."</seg>
<seg id="14">Establish a charity: "He needs to prove his remorse through charity work, but he needs to be passionate about it, there's no point doing it otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="15">Organise a charity concert: "He needs to put the hard word on his friends and do an enormous concert for his charity which he should broadcast live around the world to raise a lot of cash."</seg>
<seg id="16">Announce a world tour: "His music is where the strength of his credibility is from."</seg>
<seg id="17">He needs to get back to music and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Write his autobiography: "He should start writing a book to release by next Christmas."</seg>
<seg id="19">He should include what life lessons he's learnt over the past few years.</seg>

<seg id="1">My life in food: Cédric Grolet, pastry chef</seg>
<seg id="2">Grolet is one of the finest pastry chefs in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="3">He took up the wooden spoon at 12, working in the kitchens of his grandparents' hotel in Andrézieux-Bouthéon in the Loire.</seg>
<seg id="4">At 13, he became a kitchen apprentice.</seg>
<seg id="5">By 14, he had specialised in patisserie.</seg>
<seg id="6">After collecting a clutch of awards - including the National Trophy for Sugar Art - he went to work at Fauchon, training its chefs around the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since 2011, he has headed up the pastry kitchens at Le Meurice in Paris, working under Alain Ducasse.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is famed for reinventing classic French desserts.</seg>
<seg id="9">What are your most and least- used pieces of kitchen kit?</seg>
<seg id="10">My most trusted ally in the kitchen is, in fact, my pen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because I write down the things which inspire me.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, of course, I use it to draw my desserts as I develop them.</seg>
<seg id="13">I know refined sugar isn't kit, but that is the thing I least use in my kitchen, something that surprises some people.</seg>
<seg id="14">I always try to create light pastries - you don't want them to be too sweet or it masks the other flavours.</seg>
<seg id="15">If you had only £10 to spend on food, where would you spend it and on what?</seg>
<seg id="16">When I go to my family home near Montélimar in southeastern France, I go on walks down the winding country lanes nearby.</seg>
<seg id="17">Often the local producers have set up stalls at the side of the road.</seg>
<seg id="18">You get all sorts of beautiful fruit and veg there.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's cheap, delicious and fresh - so that's where I'd spend my money.</seg>
<seg id="20">What do you eat for comfort?</seg>
<seg id="21">Desserts - I am, after all, a pastry chef.</seg>
<seg id="22">If you could only eat either bread or potatoes for the rest of your life, which would you choose?</seg>
<seg id="23">I would choose bread.</seg>
<seg id="24">You get such incredible varieties, both sweet and savoury.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can even make amazing and delicious desserts with it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I mean, is there anything better than good French toast?</seg>
<seg id="27">What's your desert island recipe?</seg>
<seg id="28">I would go for something fresh and light.</seg>
<seg id="29">Maybe a coconut granita with fresh vanilla pods picked from one of the trees on my island.</seg>
<seg id="30">I'd accompany it with slices of freshly-picked pineapple.</seg>
<seg id="31">It would be the best thing for a hot day on a sandy beach - just the thought of it makes me drift into a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="32">What's your favourite restaurant?</seg>
<seg id="33">I love L'auberge des Quatre Vents at La Côte Saint-André, close to Lyon in France.</seg>
<seg id="34">The view from the dining room is breathtaking and the dishes are simple yet very fine.</seg>
<seg id="35">What's your favourite cookbook?</seg>
<seg id="36">I would say Fauchon by Christophe Adam.</seg>
<seg id="37">I was lucky enough to work with him and I learnt a lot.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is a beautiful book - the desserts are so well illustrated, the pictures perfectly styled.</seg>
<seg id="39">I admire very much books where the pictures give you a mad desire to actually taste the food.</seg>
<seg id="40">Who taught you to cook?</seg>
<seg id="41">So many people have taught me so much.</seg>
<seg id="42">I would say Christophe Adam taught me to about the creative process; Benoit Couvrant taught me the importance of being organised; and Camille Lesecq (ex-pastry chef at Le Meurice) taught me how to work with flavour properly.</seg>
<seg id="43">Then, of course, there is Alain Ducasse.</seg>
<seg id="44">You sort of evolve in his presence.</seg>
<seg id="45">Seeing his style - focused on fresh produce and original flavours - has broadened my own knowledge.</seg>

<seg id="2">Geelong forward Daniel Menzel has vowed to fight back after a fourth knee reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="4">FORMER Collingwood forward Lee Walker, who endured four knee reconstructions in a luckless AFL career, has urged Geelong's Daniel Menzel to keep chasing his dreams.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Walker insisted Menzel should also start planning for life outside of the game - just in case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I feel shattered for him because of how much work goes into coming back from one reco, let alone three," Walker said.</seg>
<seg id="7">My advice to Daniel is to give it one more crack as well as seriously preparing himself for life after football, in case it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has a big challenge ahead of him and can certainly come back if he does everything the rehab process requires.</seg>
<seg id="9">Menzel, 21, suffered his fourth serious knee injury in his VFL comeback game 11 days ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last night he tweeted he "will never give up as it means everything to me."</seg>
<seg id="11">Menzel, who has played 21 games for the Cats, is yet to decide whether he will have a traditional reconstruction or LARS surgery.</seg>
<seg id="12">Walker's career was cut short by injuries to both knees, and he had four reconstructions and six arthroscopes.</seg>
<seg id="13">He played 16 games with Collingwood in five interrupted seasons - and none from an earlier two-year stint with West Coast.</seg>
<seg id="14">At one stage, the tendons of a young man killed in a motorcycle accident were transplanted into his knee.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I really felt for the kid (Menzel) when he went down, but that is the pressure of the game," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Walker does not regret making repeated attempts to overcome his issues.</seg>
<seg id="17">Importantly, he wants Menzel to know he has no long-term ramifications.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There isn't a day that goes by that I think what could have been, but life is good when you look at the big picture," Walker said.</seg>
<seg id="19">I am with the Fire and Rescue (in Perth), so I have to be physically ready for anything.</seg>
<seg id="20">I still surf and run and mountain bike nearly every day.</seg>
<seg id="21">Walker, 40, said he was prepared to speak with Menzel if the young Cat needed a chat or advice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Of course I would, but I think the club would have him covered for support," Walker said.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are all in the game because of our love of it, so I'd be happy to have a coffee to talk him through how I dealt with it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt swears in first freely elected president</seg>
<seg id="2">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre," his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.</seg>
<seg id="14">Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was greeted with chants of, "The army and the people are one hand," from the hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture room.</seg>
<seg id="16">Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="1">We have studied 11,000 ADS!</seg>
<seg id="2">We know where they want you to work!</seg>
<seg id="3">In November last year, analysis captured over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 4,300 were published in newspapers and 6,800 (62 per cent) were on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="4">The internet is thus becoming one of the most important media for publishing job offers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Back in 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, it had a share of 26 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last two surveys (2007 and 2010), it stabilised at around 60 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The advertising of job offers in itself according to the analysis reflects the current situation on the labour market to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="8">An example might be the simple comparison of the number of ads published in a period of economic prosperity and in a period of economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">For instance, in 2007, in the same period monitored, almost 25,900 ads were published; in 2012, it was less than half.</seg>
<seg id="10">Job offers on the internet are aimed at a narrower, notably more qualified group of professions.</seg>
<seg id="11">In comparison, job offers in the newspapers cover a broader spectrum of jobs, including blue collar ones, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.</seg>
<seg id="12">The level of representation for selected professional groups is varied in both media.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the internet, the leading positions were taken by ads looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.</seg>
<seg id="14">The positions of programmers and managers of small businesses only appeared on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="15">In newspapers, the share of these professional jobs was significantly lower; in contrast high representation includes service and blue collar jobs in particular.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among the most frequently mentioned requirements the employers expressed via their ads is, of course, education.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other areas covered included knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.</seg>
<seg id="18">In newspapers, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was given in three per cent of ads, on the internet it was 37 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only in two per cent of ads did employers request an active knowledge of two foreign languages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Demands for "computer literacy" appeared in 40 per cent of ads (in the newspapers in 11 per cent, on the internet in 57 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Experience in the industry was required in 54 per cent of ads.</seg>
<seg id="22">Requirements for experience are largely linked to the qualified professions.</seg>
<seg id="23">They refer particularly to production managers and other executives.</seg>
<seg id="24">In blue-collar professions, it refers in particular to mechanics and repair jobs or manufacturers and processors of food products and people who repair electronics, added the author of the study Jiří Tillner.</seg>
<seg id="25">In half of their ads, employers also list requirements for qualities and skills of potential applicants.</seg>
<seg id="26">Communication skills have long appeared in first place as the most commonly required skills in ads.</seg>
<seg id="27">Employers also require flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.</seg>

<seg id="1">State wants Army Corps to restore damaged L.A. River habitat</seg>
<seg id="2">A state regulatory agency on Thursday gave the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 60 days to submit a plan for restoring 49 acres of wildlife habitat that it plowed under at two locations along the Los Angeles River without proper authorization.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board ordered the corps to mitigate the unauthorized dredge and fill operations at the Verdugo Wash in Glendale and Sepulveda Basin in the San Fernando Valley in a manner that will support the water quality, vegetation and wildlife that existed before they were graded.</seg>
<seg id="4">"If satisfactory resolution of this matter is not forthcoming," the agency warned in a letter signed by Sam Unger, executive officer of the board, "the water board intends to sue the Army Corps in the United States District Court."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Our action today will prevent unauthorized projects that result in habitat destruction from happening in the future," Maria Mehranian, chair of the board, said in a statement, "and supports the Los Angeles River revitalization efforts by the water board, city of Los Angeles and other stakeholders."</seg>
<seg id="6">Although the corps is not subject to state environmental laws, the board has the authority to implement and enforce federal Clean Water Act protections.</seg>
<seg id="7">Section 401 of the act requires the corps to seek and obtain state water quality certification for dredged disposal into waters of the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="8">In an interview, Jay Field, a spokesman for the corps, said, "We will be carefully reviewing the letter and working to resolve the concerns addressed in it."</seg>
<seg id="9">On Dec.</seg>
<seg id="10">10, 2012, Army Corps bulldozers, mowers and mulching machines stripped nearly all the greenery from a 43-acre swath of Los Angeles River flood plain just west of the 405 Freeway and south of Burbank Boulevard, wiping out habitat for mammals, reptiles and hundreds of species of birds.</seg>
<seg id="11">The agency declared at the time that its "vegetation management plan" for the area did not require an environmental impact report because it would not significantly disturb wildlife and habitat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The area, which includes the Haskell Creek, Encino Creek and Pot Hole Pond tributaries, existed as a wildlife preserve adjacent to the Sepulveda Dam for more than three decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2010, it was reclassified as a corps "vegetation management area" with a new five-year mission of replacing trees and shrubs with native grasses as part of an effort to improve access for corps staffers, increase public safety and discourage crime.</seg>
<seg id="14">Environmental groups led by the San Fernando Valley Audubon Society believed the agency would avoid removal of native willow and cotton groves, elderberries, coyote brush and mule fat.</seg>
<seg id="15">Much of that vegetation was planted decades ago under a corps program to create the wildlife preserve.</seg>
<seg id="16">Removal of the vegetation, the board said, impaired aquatic habitat by increasing direct sunlight exposure and water temperature in stretches that were home to bass, carp, sunfish, catfish and fathead minnows.</seg>
<seg id="17">Separately, the corps removed 6.5 acres of vegetation and sediment from the Verdugo Wash between Oct.</seg>
<seg id="18">24, 2011 and Nov.</seg>
<seg id="19">7, 2011, without seeking certification from the board, which did not learn of the project until after it was completed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Historic and aerial photos showed that the corps "undertook few, if any, precautionary measures to prevent the discharges of oil and grease from its heavy machinery into the confluence of the wash and Los Angeles River," the board said, or to prevent removed sediment and debris from clogging the Los Angeles River channel.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kris Ohlenkamp, conservation chairman of the San Fernando Valley Audubon Society, supported the board's action.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It's absolutely the right thing to do - and what we've been asking for all along," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's nice to have the state on our side.</seg>

<seg id="3">Amid suspicions over the influx of international money into Britain and particularly the South East of England, it is also worth remembering the vital role played by foreign businessmen and capital in the companies and projects the UK continues to benefit from.</seg>
<seg id="4">The City of London, that bastion of traditional British wealth and influence, is largely the creation of foreigners and immigrants who made their home in this country over the last centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1">State Library moves to throw open reading room, but not to weddings</seg>
<seg id="2">The grand, high-domed Mitchell Reading Room at the State Library of NSW will be opened to the general public, and scholars relegated to a renamed Scholars Room, under reforms that combine public relations and cost-cutting.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite anxious whispers from traditionalist staff and users, state librarian Alex Byrne said the changes were part of "a big process of renewal" that began soon after the library's centenary in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We have a lack of public space if we compare ourself to the State Library of Victoria and the NSW Art Gallery," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">We're aiming to open up the stack areas and a number of heritage areas that have been locked up behind the scenes and used for storage and staff.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Mitchell Reading Room has for 30 years served a mixed crowd of scholars, general readers and wide-eyed tourists.</seg>
<seg id="7">Next month, it will be refurbished to its 1942 layout with original tables and chairs to seat 220 people (an increase of 50) working with their own reading material and laptops - a vision, to some, of schoolchildren run amok.</seg>
<seg id="8">Books, card catalogues and librarians from the Mitchell will move to the library's newer Macquarie Wing.</seg>
<seg id="9">This would end the frustration of an arbitrary division between the collections, Mr Byrne said, and was in response to public demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">The original 1910 reading room will be restored from office space into the Scholars Room, a tranquil space that forms an "academic hub" with the Friends Room and a new Fellows Room.</seg>
<seg id="11">The changes enable the library to continue cutting costs to meet the impact of digitisation.</seg>
<seg id="12">After voluntary redundancies reduced staff numbers from 400 to 360 last year, more are under way, with a target of 312 over four years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We are reviewing all our operations," Mr Byrne said.</seg>
<seg id="14">We can't afford to run so many service points.</seg>
<seg id="15">We also need to find other sources of funds.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, he dismissed "scuttlebutt" that the Mitchell Reading Room would become a public function room.</seg>
<seg id="17">While other rooms are available for lectures and weddings, the reading room is used only for library events such as the Premier's literary and history awards.</seg>

<seg id="12">In addition, it is alleged that the satellite images also showed a battery of SA-3 missiles including the command centre with radar to track missiles and their targets.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Israeli news reports, the missiles seen have a range of 35 kilometres and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.</seg>

<seg id="7">"I'm confident our independence has not been lost, not has our objectivity been compromised," Dr Levy told the committee.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he believed the CMC had the right to either agree or disagree with government policy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hold onto your hat!</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Jackson Flindell Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="4">The Abyss roller-coaster was unleashed on Halloween night.</seg>
<seg id="5">BOASTING a G-force thrust greater than a space shuttle launch and reaching speeds of up to 85km/h, you could be forgiven for being a little nervous about riding on the Abyss at Adventure World.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Perth theme park officially launched its spooky ride on Halloween night, giving competition winners and the media the first chance to ride the thriller.</seg>
<seg id="7">The two-minute adrenalin-pumping journey begins in darkness with several speedy turns and rolls that will give you a head rush.</seg>
<seg id="8">Next comes the slow, perpendicular lift, full of trepidation for the inevitable plunge back down to Earth.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Abyss is a custom Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter with 630 metres of track.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ride's vertical lift hill takes riders to a height of 30 metres before dropping 30.5 metres in a 100°, beyond-vertical drop.</seg>
<seg id="11">That massive 30m drop is both exhilarating and a little nauseating, and is the sixth steepest roller-coaster drop in the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">What follows is a series of disorientating and stomach-churning loops before the ride ends.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Abyss has the broadest range of G-forces and speed of any theme park ride in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="14">It includes -1 to 4.5 G-forces, which is close to those achieved by Formula 1 cars at corners or pilots catapulted off a Navy aircraft carrier.</seg>
<seg id="15">You'll need a strong stomach for this adventure ride.</seg>
<seg id="16">As I disembarked from the ride, my legs were shaking and my heart was still pounding for a couple of minutes after the experience.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was just as thrilling the second time around as the Abyss took riders on a journey including four inversions, a rollover loop, cobra roll and incline loop.</seg>
<seg id="18">The $12 million Abyss has been billed as Australia's most thrilling roller-coaster and is the single largest investment at Adventure World since it launched in 1982.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Abyss cost a whopping $12 million to build.</seg>
<seg id="20">Adventure World chief executive Mark Shaw said the Abyss would firmly place WA on the world theme park stage.</seg>
<seg id="21">The 630m-long ride was custom built in Germany with the theme pieces built at a facility in the Philippines that specialises in fit-outs for theme parks around the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">The impressive landscape features 30 three-metre tall ancient druid "Guardians" throughout the mysterious terrain and an arch at the entrance.</seg>
<seg id="23">Massive upturned trees with exposed roots also help create a spooky atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Abyss has been billed as Australia's most thrilling roller-coaster.</seg>
<seg id="25">Winners from an online game competition experienced the ride first and many were screaming with every twist and commenting afterwards that it was the best ride in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">Local MP - and self-confessed roller-coaster thrill seeker - Joe Francis described the Abyss as an "amazing piece of mechanical engineering."</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Shaw told those gathered to try the Abyss they should feel apprehensive before going on the ride.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's smooth, fast, it's even better in the dark," he quipped.</seg>
<seg id="29">While I have enjoyed other rides in the world more, the Abyss is certainly the best thrillseeking ride in Australia and is sure to attract tourists seeking an adrenalin rush.</seg>

<seg id="1">Senators Ask: What's the Strategy for Syria?</seg>
<seg id="2">At a Senate Foreign Relations hearing today, senators seemed to be losing patience with the administration's stance on Syria, with both Republicans and Democrats saying that despite the administration officials" claims that Assad must go and the bloodshed must end, there didn't seem to be a strategy in place to make that happen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The senators acknowledged that the progress made in destroying chemical weapons had been positive.</seg>
<seg id="4">But they pointed out that the chemical weapons deal still didn't answer the big questions surrounding the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I want to support any and every diplomatic effort that is taking place," said Sen. Bob Corker, R- Tenn., the ranking Republican member on the committee.</seg>
<seg id="6">But I think we ought to realize there is no strategy right now for the opposition - none.</seg>
<seg id="7">The U.S. envoy for Syria, Ambassador Robert Ford, acknowledged that the opposition remained fractured, and that in some areas it was now fighting a war on two fronts, against the regime and against al Qaeda and extremist elements of the opposition who also want control.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Corker defended the administration's policy, saying that despite the troubling situation on the ground, focusing on a political solution is the only way to achieve long-term peace.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We don't see a way for this to be solved militarily," said Ford.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a civil war where communities think it's existential, that if they surrender they will be murdered, we have to build a political set of agreements between communities.</seg>
<seg id="11">Otherwise, the fighting goes on indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ford said the United States has provided support for the moderate armed rebels, including a delivery of trucks to the army, something that Gen. Salim Idris had asked for.</seg>
<seg id="13">We do provide support to help them against the regime.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We provide a lot of support," said Ford.</seg>
<seg id="15">You may discount what we do, but it matters to Salim Idris.</seg>
<seg id="16">Every time I talk to him, he thanks us for what we do.</seg>
<seg id="17">Would they like more?</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course they would.</seg>
<seg id="19">They'd like more from a lot of countries.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.Y., lamented the fact that the Senate passed a law in May authorizing the United States to provide more support, including military, to the rebels but that the administration hadn't acted on it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I wish that the authorization that this committee passed back in May would have been used because at that time the dynamics were different, and I think we could have far better affected the efforts toward the negotiations that we still aspire to," said Menendez.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the administration chose not to use that at the time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., delivered a blistering criticism of America's Syria policy, calling it "a shameful chapter in American history."</seg>
<seg id="24">McCain said he understood why Saudi Arabia had been publicly feuding with the United States over what it views as America's negligence.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The reason the Saudis have divorced themselves from the United States of America is because of what you just articulated to Sen. Corker - trucks," he said to the U.S. envoy to Syria Ambassador Robert Ford.</seg>
<seg id="26">That's a great thing, trucks, as shiploads of weapons come in to the Russian port, as plane load after plane load lands and provides weapons - all kinds of lethal weapons.</seg>
<seg id="27">"And we're proud of the fact that we gave them trucks," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 14:15</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's media has expressed outrage after parliament approved a bill imposing regulation on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a late-night sitting on Thursday, MPs voted to set up a communications tribunal with the power to impose fines for breaching a code of conduct.</seg>
<seg id="5">Media houses could face fines of $234,000 (£146,000), and individual journalists up to $12,000 (£7,000).</seg>
<seg id="6">The bill still needs to be approved by President Uhuru Kenyatta before becoming law.</seg>
<seg id="7">It comes a week after Kenya's top security chiefs warned journalists over their coverage of September's attack on the Westgate shopping centre by Islamist militants in which 67 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="8">CCTV footage was leaked to the local media which appeared to show soldiers taking items from a supermarket; the army said the soldiers were only taking water during the siege.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two soldiers have since been sacked and jailed for looting but the army chief denied there had been "widespread looting" and said there had been an attempt by the media to paint the soldiers as "unprofessional."</seg>
<seg id="10">Democracy under attack</seg>
<seg id="11">The bill was debated for 30 minutes and voted on by 60 MPs in the 349-seat chamber, the BBC's Odhiambo Joseph reports from the capital, Nairobi.</seg>
<seg id="12">The media in Kenya is seen as a leader in Africa but to create an authority that is government controlled... is an attempt to muzzle the media</seg>
<seg id="13">End Quote Kiprono Kittony Media Owners Association</seg>
<seg id="14">The code of conduct is yet to be drafted - this will be done by the new tribunal, our reporter says.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will have the power to seize property from media houses and journalists for the payment of fines.</seg>
<seg id="16">The bill also stipulates that 45% of content on TV and radio - including advertising - must be locally produced.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been several other attempts by lawmakers to introduce new media regulation in Kenya; two years ago it caused such an uproar that in the end ex-President Mwai Kibaki refused to sign a bill into law.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Kenyan media is currently regulated by the Media Council of Kenya, an independent body which has a complaints department that would be taken over by the new government-controlled communications tribunal.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper said the bill puts "Kenya among the likes of Zimbabwe, Cuba, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran and Kuwait where media freedom is curtailed."</seg>
<seg id="20">A headline in the Standard newspaper read: "Democracy under attack."</seg>
<seg id="21">Kiprono Kittony, the chairman of Kenya's Media Owners Association, said MPs were taking the country back to "the dark ages of media control," the Standard reports.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The media in Kenya is seen as a leader in Africa but to create an authority that is government controlled to determine all matters of content and to impose draconian fines... with a possibility of deregistration for life is an attempt to muzzle the media," the paper quoted him as saying.</seg>
<seg id="23">The managing director of the Capital Group, which owns the respected radio station Capital FM, said the new tribunal would "always be biased because it's an extension of the government," the AFP news agency reports.</seg>
<seg id="24">The restrictions on content could also affect Kenya's place in the global economy, Cyrus Kamau said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," the agency quoted him as saying.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cellular tail length tells human disease tale</seg>
<seg id="2">31, 2013 - Simon Fraser University molecular biologist Lynne Quarmby's adventures in pond scum have led her and four student researchers to discover a mutation that can make cilia, the microscopic antennae on our cells, grow too long.</seg>
<seg id="3">When the antennae aren't the right size, the signals captured by them get misinterpreted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The result can be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a newly published paper in the science journal Current Biology, the researchers discovered that the regulatory gene CNK2 is present in cilia and controls the length of these hair-like projections.</seg>
<seg id="6">This discovery is important because cilia, or flagella, dangle from all of our cells.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their ability to propel some cells, such as sperm, and allow molecular communication in others, for example cellular responses to hormones, determines how we develop from embryos and how our bodies function in adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="8">When cilia are too short or too long they cause various human hereditary diseases and deformities, such as too many fingers or toes, blindness and Polycystic Kidney Disease, which affects one in 600 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">Quarmby and her doctoral student Laura Hilton -- senior and lead authors, respectively, on this paper -- are among the few scientists globally who study cilia-disassembly as opposed to -assembly.</seg>
<seg id="10">A crucial part of all cells' lifecycle is their cilia's disassembly before cell division and assembly after it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The gene LF4 is a known assembly regulator, and, prior to this study, scientists thought that assembly speed controlled cilia's ultimate length or shrinkage.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Quarmby and Hilton have discovered that disassembly speed is also important, and that the regulatory gene CNK2 plays a key role in controlling it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Similar to how a balance between water pressure and gravity determines the height of a fountain's stream, a balance of assembly and disassembly speed determines cilia's length.</seg>
<seg id="14">When growing and shrinking happen simultaneously cilia length remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pond scum's algae make good lab models for analyzing this because they reproduce quickly, and they have cellular structure and cilia that closely parallel ours.</seg>
<seg id="16">Quarmby and Hilton have been mucking about with pond scum for years and recently started studying algae cilia with defective CNK2 and LF4 genes.</seg>
<seg id="17">After discovering that cilia with either defective gene are abnormally long, they created an algae cell with four cilia, instead of the normal two, with two of the four engineered to glow green.</seg>
<seg id="18">Along with two SFU undergrad students and a University of Toronto undergrad, Quarmby and Hilton watched as the fluorescent green tag began to appear at the tip of the untagged pair of cilia.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We were able to deduce how the mutations affected the cilia's assembly and disassembly by measuring how much and how quickly green fluorescence appeared at the tip of the untagged cilia," explains Quarmby.</seg>
<seg id="20">We knew that we had something important when we saw that cells bearing mutations in both CNK2 and LF4 had the most extraordinarily long cilia.</seg>
<seg id="21">They were unlike anything anyone had ever seen before.</seg>
<seg id="22">My student Laura ran this experiment and oversaw our undergrad researchers.</seg>
<seg id="23">It gave us unique insights into the potentially key role disassembling cilia have in deciding the tails' length.</seg>
<seg id="24">Further investigation will help us understand how ciliary malfunction causes a progression of diseases.</seg>

<seg id="1">US Official Makes "Shocking" Admission About Navy Yard Shooting</seg>
<seg id="2">The government contractor responsible for checking Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis" background before he could gain security clearance several years ago did not attempt to obtain a police report that would have shown he had "anger management problems," a top U.S. official acknowledged Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police report detailed an incident in Seattle, in which Alexis used a pistol to shoot out his neighbor's tires during what he told police was a blackout fueled by anger.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a Senate committee hearing looking at government clearances and the Navy Yard shooting Sept.</seg>
<seg id="5">16, Office of Personnel Management Acting Director Elaine Kaplan testified that when the government contractor, USIS, conducted Alexis" background investigation in 2007 as part of his application to join the U.S. Navy, they consulted an FBI database and found that Alexis had been arrested three years earlier.</seg>
<seg id="6">Based on past experience with Seattle law enforcement, USIS assumed that they would not be able to obtain the full police report, instead turning to a Washington state database offering only generic information, Kaplan told lawmakers.</seg>
<seg id="7">Republicans and Democrats both called that move "shocking."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., a former prosecutor, said the background investigator should have pursued the full police report because "getting a police report would have flagged a very different set of conduct."</seg>
<seg id="9">The government seems to believe, "Well, if a police department won't give us a report, we've checked the box," suggested Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, taking direct aim at Kaplan, the OPM official.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Now, I get it that we can't go out and do one-on-one on every application for clearance," McCaskill said.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the notion that you're calling what you're doing quality control, Ms. Kaplan, is probably, I think, offensive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Though many are questioning USIS's decision not to obtain the police report, Kaplan insisted USIS followed protocol.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Yes, we all missed something, to be sure, but we did what was required," Kaplan testified.</seg>
<seg id="14">We conducted the investigation that was required by the investigative standards. ... Should we be required to get police reports, for example?</seg>
<seg id="15">Should we be required to get mental health information even from someone who has a secret as opposed to a top secret clearance?</seg>
<seg id="16">All these things need to be looked at.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it was not, in our view, a case of malfeasance ... We believe the contractor did what they were supposed to do.</seg>
<seg id="18">USIS conducted the background investigation on Alexis for the Office of Personnel Management, a common practice.</seg>
<seg id="19">The background check turned up the 2004 gun incident in Seattle, but instead of referencing any shots fired a car's tires, the OPM summary only mentioned that Alexis "retaliated by deflating the male person's tires."</seg>
<seg id="20">In conducting its background check on Alexis, USIS never attempted to obtain the police report, according to Kaplan.</seg>
<seg id="21">She said USIS assumed it was a lost cause because Seattle police routinely referred them to a state database, which contains only limited information about a case.</seg>
<seg id="22">That database indicated charges had been dropped.</seg>
<seg id="23">The revelation that USIS failed to pursue Alexis" police record came on the heels of a Justice Department announcement that USIS - the same firm that vetted National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden - allegedly failed to perform mandated quality control reviews and is being sued under the False Claims Act.</seg>
<seg id="24">The suit, originally filed in 2011, was unsealed Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="25">Following the allegations, USIS appointed a new CEO and developed an internal audit committee, Kaplan said.</seg>
<seg id="26">OPM has also ramped up its own quality control efforts, increasing the frequency of on-site inspections and case audits.</seg>
<seg id="27">USIS continues to perform about 45 percent of OPM's background investigation, Kaplan told senators.</seg>
<seg id="28">"A lot of changes have been made at USIS," Kaplan said.</seg>
<seg id="29">That has given us some level of comfort and confidence that we can rely on these products.</seg>
<seg id="30">Rely but verify.</seg>
<seg id="31">Several senators present at the hearing expressed concern not only about OPM's use of subcontractors like USIS, but their reliance on self-reporting - especially because Aaron Alexis lied about previous arrests when he applied for clearance.</seg>
<seg id="32">When asked by a background investigator about the 2004 incident, Alexis said the person whose tires he had deflated had not pressed charges.</seg>
<seg id="33">He also told the investigator he would do things differently in the future and avoid confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="34">"There need to be serious consequences for lying," McCaskill said.</seg>
<seg id="35">This process has become a pro forma process.</seg>
<seg id="36">During his years in the Navy from 2007 to 2010, Alexis had a number of run-ins with leadership, including after an arrest for disorderly conduct in Dekalb County, Ga.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was also arrested in September 2010 in Fort Worth, Tex., after discharging his weapon in his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="38">Three months later, Alexis requested an early separation from the Navy, which was granted within days.</seg>
<seg id="39">He ultimately started working as a private contractor, and by September of this year he was assigned to update computer systems inside the Navy Yard.</seg>
<seg id="40">That gave him access to the building, where he gunned down 12 people during a vicious rampage.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in "airplane" mode.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
<seg id="15">For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes," the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.</seg>
<seg id="19">The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing.</seg>

<seg id="1">England's touring Ashes squad more a United Nations than United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="2">Kevin Pietersen is one of England's foreign legion that is set to take on Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">THEY claim to be proud Poms, but Alastair Cook's all-conquering Ashes champions are more United Nations than United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="4">With the first Test against Australia just 19 days away, almost a third of England's 17-man squad renounced homeland ties to become Ashes tourists.</seg>
<seg id="5">The squad hails from all points of the compass, with connections spanning three continents and four countries across 18,700km.</seg>
<seg id="6">England has previously benefited from naturalised Britons such as Robin Smith, Devon Malcolm and Graeme Hick.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the latest influx of expatriates has sparked a backlash from the British public who argue homegrown talent is losing out to the foreign legion.</seg>
<seg id="8">Batting superstar Kevin Pietersen left South Africa to chase better opportunities in England, while classy No.3 Johnathan Trott has represented the Proteas at under-15s and under-19s level.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the three new caps in this English squad are expats.</seg>
<seg id="10">All-rounder Ben Stokes is a Kiwi from Christchurch, towering quick Boyd Rankin played for Ireland at the 2011 World Cup, while rookie batsman Gary Ballance hails from Zimbabwe.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even their coach, Gary Flower, has an eclectic mix, born in Cape Town in South Africa before representing Zimbabwe in Test cricket.</seg>
<seg id="12">England's Ashes squad resembles a United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="13">English cricket fans have expressed disappointment at the growing number of expats, venting their frustration at the Poms' selection methodology with online rants in the lead-up to the Gabba Test.</seg>
<seg id="14">"There's something charmless about this current England set-up, I'll be supporting the Aussies," said one supporter on the UK Daily Mail website.</seg>
<seg id="15">Another wrote: "This is becoming an all-too-familiar trend for the England team."</seg>
<seg id="16">I wouldn't mind but it often seems that better homegrown players get overlooked because of the selectors' obsession (with expats).</seg>
<seg id="17">Ballance, 23, represented Zimbabwe as a 16-year-old at an under-19s World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="18">He moved to England to advance his career as a professional cricketer with Yorkshire in 2008 and dismissed suggestions he is a traitor.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mitchell Johnson has been released from the one-day tour of India to play in WA's Sheffield Shield clash.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I've played for Yorkshire for four or five years and I don't think you get more English than that," Ballance said before his arrival in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="21">I feel 100 per cent English.</seg>
<seg id="22">I came over at a young age and ever since it's been my ambition to play for England.</seg>
<seg id="23">Stokes left New Zealand at age 12 with his family and his father, Gerard, is a former Kiwis prop.</seg>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, Rankin's father, Bob, admits his son's decision to defect to England caused a political storm with Ireland's Cricket Board.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a sore point," Rankin told a UK publication.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ireland were aware for the previous four or five years that England had been sniffing around Boyd - picking him in A and underage teams.</seg>
<seg id="27">""They (Cricket Ireland) approached us as a family and mentioned this.</seg>
<seg id="28">We were very proud that Boyd played for Ireland and we are very proud Irish people.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the money offered from the English and Wales Cricket Board was totally different class from what the Irish cricket people can offer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">US commandos in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="4">TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Israelis have shown exactly how bombing Syria should look.</seg>
<seg id="6">Without unnecessary hype, threats and a million declarations, they sent planes, they hit the target and came back.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without being lulled into a false sense of security by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="8">They refuse to confirm the whole event and are no longer commenting on it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exact opposite of the confused and grandiose Obama’s Syrian policy unsupported by actions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the most satisfactory thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Don’t be fooled by media claims that a "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hezbollah" were bombed.</seg>
<seg id="12">I recently wrote here that while US aid to secular rebels in the country has remained on just a rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply weapons to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it was a fresh supply of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that became the target of the Israeli air strike.</seg>
<seg id="14">A clear message.</seg>
<seg id="15">And note that Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although it should have been the opposite according to popular internet theories.</seg>
<seg id="16">The US government has honoured two members of special units, probably Delta Force.</seg>
<seg id="17">No one suspected until now that they distinguished themselves during the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.</seg>
<seg id="18">The heroic death of two former SEALs, who defended the CIA site in the city, is known, in my opinion they were members of the secret CIA commando, which is made up of former soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="19">There has long been speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in another CIA residence elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now it is clearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In any case, information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine gun nests (it was in one of them that both members of SEALs were killed after being hit by a mine-thrower) is quite surprising.</seg>
<seg id="22">But even more surprising is the information about the two as yet unknown heroes.</seg>
<seg id="23">They were part of the US task force in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report on the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene, and together with five private contractors, they blasted their way into the CIA site in Benghazi.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obama’s administration is compromised by the fact that during this attack the task force was not officially deployed as a whole and that they simply hesitated over what to do.</seg>
<seg id="25">The task force commander therefore apparently releases these volunteers without orders.</seg>
<seg id="26">In any case, the fact that the US task force, CIA agents and private contractors are active not just once but permanently is quite interesting information.</seg>
<seg id="27">And due to the fact that until recently officially nothing of the sort was admitted and even now they only talk about some sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is good, however, that the USA, even though half-heartedly, is trying to combat terrorism in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="29">Although for resolving the nationwide situation, it would need far more help.</seg>
<seg id="30">The last place for a secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the Iranian coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was not long ago that the media all but extolled the Iranian air force for chasing US drones.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, little is known about how the Americans effectively protect their drones.</seg>
<seg id="33">Of course, if by chance they succeed in finding their drone in the air space, nothing can be done about it.</seg>
<seg id="34">If, however, the Iranians discover a drone in international space, the situation is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft followed an American drone in the international space above the ocean, when perhaps the first serious deployment of the US super fighter F-22 Raptor in history took place.</seg>
<seg id="36">It flew beneath the Phantom to check optically for weapons, without the Phantom registering it on the radar or he just noticed it and then when it suddenly it appeared close by and called on the Iranian pilot to go home, he obeyed without complaint.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is no wonder when the Phantom is a US-made aircraft which does however remember the Vietnam war.</seg>
<seg id="38">It cannot be compared with the Raptor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Karel Drábek: Uhlířský Vrch – One of our youngest volcanoes.</seg>
<seg id="2">Uhlířský Vrch is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together with several others, it is a proof of volcanic activity in the Nízký Jeseník hills in the recent period (from a geological perspective).</seg>
<seg id="4">The last eruptions here were still taking place at the beginning of the Quaternary period.</seg>
<seg id="5">When viewed from a greater distance, the whitewashed Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Succour, built between 1755 and 1765, is prominent on the peak.</seg>
<seg id="6">It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inn, which stood next to the church, was not preserved.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after the completion of the church, an avenue with four rows of lime trees was planted, about 1 km long.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Way of the Cross on Uhlířský Vrch is already the third version – the original stood here after 1916, the second version from 2001 only lasted until 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are fifteen stations with wooden sculptures made by local wood carver František Nedomlel.</seg>
<seg id="11">He used various types of wood from the Nízký Jeseník area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Similarly, the pedestals made from rock from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">At each station there is also the name of the sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="14">Uhlířský Vrch is the remainder of a young volcano.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although data from radiometric measurements of the age somewhat differ, the last eruption here took place about 1.5 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is therefore younger than Velký Roudný (3.3 million years old) and older than Venušina sopka or Venus Volcano (0.8 million years old).</seg>
<seg id="17">The volcano came into existence after an explosion.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the explosion, it spat out large amounts of volcanic ash together with rock fragments from the bedrock, which were burnt to get their reddish-brown colour.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of this stage, lava flowed out on the surface – now it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 metres thick.</seg>
<seg id="20">A second eruption spewed out red, brown-red and in places almost black tuffs.</seg>
<seg id="21">The layer is up to 50 metres thick and the part of it is accessible in the face of a quarry.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tuffs contain prominent volcanic bombs up to 1 metre in size. The second eruption also ended with an outflow of lava.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, forming a layer of slaggy basalt which is now up to 50 m thick.</seg>
<seg id="24">Volcanoes where layers of volcanic ash alternate with flows of lava are the most common type of volcano.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since they are actually composed of layers, they given the name of stratovolcanoes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The original volcanic cone was subjected to gradual erosion.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, it was not threatened until the mining of rock started at a quarry on the south side.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most intensive mining took place there from 1953 to 1962.</seg>
<seg id="29">Tuffs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.</seg>
<seg id="30">Under pressure from specialists and the public, it was possible to stop the mining and thus preserve this unique place.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, the problem is the porosity and the low coherence of the rocks, which quickly weather, break apart and fall down the slope.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means the quarry is quickly disappearing.</seg>
<seg id="33">To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-orientated slope is an ideal location for some rare species of plants and animals.</seg>
<seg id="34">Rectifying it is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to make a choice and maintain the characteristic geological profile.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is nothing new, similar profiles are being maintained at several important sites.</seg>
<seg id="36">You can get to Uhlířský Vrch following the green tourist trail from Bruntál, or from Slezský Kočov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Drivers can use the free car park at the beginning of the avenue with lime trees, where also a short pedestrian path begins.</seg>

<seg id="8">A thief attacked a hospice for babies in an attempt to steal memorabilia donated by Gary Barlow after the Take That star tweeted about his visit, owners believe.</seg>
<seg id="9">The singer dropped into the hospice a fortnight ago with a BBC camera crew to film scenes for this year's Children In Need appeal.</seg>
<seg id="10">He donated dozens of signed pictures, records and books for the charity to auction to raise enough funds to open 24 hours a day.</seg>

<seg id="14">Although the raider, believed to be aged between 17 and 19, left empty-handed, owners believe the high-profile coverage of Mr Barlow's visit may have led to the 'abhorrent' attack.</seg>

<seg id="1">Conservative Groups Driving GOP Agenda</seg>
<seg id="2">Virtually unknown outside Washington, a coalition of hardline conservative groups is fighting to seize control of the Republican agenda.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tea party allies like the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and Heritage Action for America showed their might by insisting that the GOP embrace the government shutdown that hurt the nation's economy and the party's reputation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now emboldened, these groups are warning that their aggressive agenda-pushing tactics aren't over - and they're threatening retribution against Republicans who stand in their way.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They refuse to learn," Chris Chocola, a former Indiana congressman who leads the Club for Growth, says of lawmakers who buck the will of right-leaning groups.</seg>
<seg id="6">He predicts that his group will support primary challengers to more than a dozen Republican incumbents seeking re-election next fall.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mainstream GOP groups - such as Karl Rove's American Crossroads or the party's formal campaign committees - question their more conservative counterparts' role, fed up by their outsized influence in shaping the party's current agenda.</seg>
<seg id="8">For decades, interest groups like the National Rifle Association have shaped debates on single issues.</seg>
<seg id="9">But Republicans suggest that not since the Christian Coalition of the 1990s have outside forces played such a sweeping, integral role in guiding Republican priorities as the tea party-led fiscal conservatives have in the ongoing budget debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You have a small group in Congress that has become the surrender caucus," argues Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.</seg>
<seg id="11">They've surrendered their voting card to the wishes of these outside groups.</seg>
<seg id="12">Such divisions on display between the Republican Party's pragmatic and ideological wings - and their affiliated outside groups - carry huge risk for the GOP heading into the 2014 midterm congressional elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">Republicans will seek to win power in the Senate and preserve their narrow House majority next fall.</seg>
<seg id="14">But primaries that leave eventual nominees battered and broke for the general election could hamper that goal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, tea party-aligned groups already are spending millions of dollars calling on compromise-minded Republican lawmakers from New Hampshire to Idaho to embrace more aggressive tactics against President Barack Obama's agenda.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is their message as Congress wrestles with health care implementation, considers immigration reform and gets ready for new rounds of debt talks: Republicans who work with the Democratic president do so at their peril.</seg>
<seg id="17">It appears that no Republican is too large for these groups.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Senate Conservatives Fund - founded by tea party hero and former South Carolina Sen.

<seg id="1">North midfielder Ben Cunnington makes the most of Jack Ziebell's absence</seg>
<seg id="2">North Melbourne's Ben Cunnington evades Brisbane midfielder Brent Moloney.</seg>
<seg id="3">JACK Ziebell's four-match ban for front-on contact was one of the most controversial moments of 2012, but it may have had a silver lining for North Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Ziebell sat out the lengthy ban for the high bump on Carlton's Aaron Joseph, Ben Cunnington was able to finally establish himself in the midfield.</seg>
<seg id="5">After a spluttering start to his career, the No.5 2009 draft pick became a driving force in the Roos' push into last year's finals, and has continued on this season.</seg>
<seg id="6">"You don't always wish on someone to get reported, especially one of our better midfielders, but it gave me another opportunity to come back into the senior team," Cunnington said.</seg>
<seg id="7">You only get so many chances and this time was a really good opportunity for me to step up with one of our main guys down in the midfield.</seg>
<seg id="8">""It gave me the chance to get a few clearances and try and play my footy rather than worrying too much about the outcomes and whether I'm buggering up or what not.</seg>
<seg id="9">I just tried to come in and play football without worrying about too much else.</seg>
<seg id="10">""We got a couple of games together.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was still good to be part of that midfield with him in it.""</seg>
<seg id="12">The inside midfielder said it was not the external expectations of being a high draft pick that weighed heavily on him early in his career.</seg>
<seg id="13">""I've always got high expectations of myself to perform well and help the team out as much as possible so I was a bit disappointed with not having much impact in the game," the 21-year-old said."</seg>
<seg id="14">""But the coaches and players had great faith in me.</seg>
<seg id="15">I kept getting games, kept working on the areas I needed to improve and finally started to come around a little bit and feel more comfortable and more at home.</seg>
<seg id="16">The form has been solid for the Roos, but the win-loss ratio reads 1-4 with a lot of ground to make up.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Cunnington said North Melbourne was far from a spent force in 2013 starting with undefeated Port Adelaide in Hobart on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Looking at those four losses they are all against good teams," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">We did have our opportunities to win most of those games, but at the end of the day we are 1-4 and that's reality.</seg>
<seg id="20">""We've got to do a few things turn that around, but we're still confident we can and we are definitely still looking at playing in September.</seg>
<seg id="21">Our hopes are still alive for sure.</seg>

<seg id="1">American Davis Cup Team Warms to Clay Courts</seg>
<seg id="2">PARIS - To beat back the British, the United States Davis Cup team is prepared to get dirty.</seg>
<seg id="3">John Isner, the highest-ranked American man at No.</seg>
<seg id="4">16, said team members and their captain, Jim Courier, had been discussing hosting their February Davis Cup match against Britain on clay, a surface that American players in recent generations had considered Kryptonite.</seg>
<seg id="5">The United States has not hosted a Davis Cup series on clay since 1992, a streak of 28 home series played on hardcourts, grass or carpet.</seg>
<seg id="6">"There's a bit of a chain email going on between captain Courier, myself, Sam and the Bryan brothers," said Isner, referring to Sam Querrey, Mike Bryan and Bob Bryan.</seg>
<seg id="7">We've brought that up.</seg>
<seg id="8">I, for one, would actually like that.</seg>
<seg id="9">Recent top American men, including Pete Sampras, Andy Roddick, James Blake and Mardy Fish, have been at their least comfortable on clay, which has made it a natural choice for European and South American countries that host the American squad.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the 6-foot-10-inch Isner, who prefers slower, higher-bouncing surfaces, said the current American lineup, which features four players taller than 6-3, was suited for clay-court play.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We're not a typical tennis team," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">We look more like a basketball team.</seg>
<seg id="13">Isner won his first clay-court title last April in Houston; he had reached the final of two other clay-court events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Querrey has also won a title on clay, beating Isner in a final in Belgrade in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Bryans have played some of their best tennis on clay, winning 21 titles on the surface, including the French Open twice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Clay is also by far the weakest surface for the British team.</seg>
<seg id="17">Andy Murray has made it to 42 singles finals in his career, but none on clay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Other probable singles players for Britain like Daniel Evans and James Ward play on the surface sparingly.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You've sort of got to take Murray out of the equation," said Isner, who lost, 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-2, to Novak Djokovic in the third round of the Paris Masters on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">You know he's going to be tough on any surface.</seg>
<seg id="21">And then you sort of go from there.</seg>
<seg id="22">Isner led the Americans to the Davis Cup semifinals through heroics on foreign soil in 2012, beating Roger Federer on indoor clay in Switzerland and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on outdoor clay in France.</seg>
<seg id="23">Isner added that he and the Bryans also prefer to play outdoors, but choices for hosting an outdoor event in February would be limited.</seg>
<seg id="24">Isner mentioned the tennis-rich regions of Florida, Southern California and Arizona.</seg>
<seg id="25">Another option would be Hawaii, which would be a geographically convenient place for players to travel to after the Australian Open, which immediately precedes the first round of Davis Cup.</seg>
<seg id="26">Tim Curry, director of communications for the United States Tennis Association, said that the host city for the event, which will be held Jan.</seg>
<seg id="27">31 through Feb.</seg>
<seg id="28">2, would be announced Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="5">CARLTON coach Mick Malthouse has adopted a glass half-full approach to Carlton's agonising nine-point loss to St Kilda.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Blues were woeful in the first half at Etihad Stadium and despite being down two men and 33 points at the last change, went within a whisker of toppling the Saints.</seg>
<seg id="7">VIDEO: See Carlton's injury crisis unfold in the player above</seg>
<seg id="8">David Ellard (calf) and Chris Yarran (hamstring) went down to game-ending injuries inside the first 10 minutes, while Michael Jamison was forced to play more than three quarters with a badly damaged shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="9">But so poor were the Blues before a lack of manpower could be a factor, it appeared the injuries masked the real story.</seg>
<seg id="10">Umpire Ray Chamberlain talks with Leigh Montagna after Eddie Betts cleaned up Nathan Wright during the 3rd quarter of the St Kilda vs Carlton match at the Etihad Stadium, Melbourne.</seg>
<seg id="11">Carlton had 83 less disposals but 20 fewer tackles and were obliterated in handball receives and uncontested ball, highlighting a lack of run.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, Malthouse saw it differently.</seg>
<seg id="13">I don't think it helps when you lose two players in the first 10 minutes of the game.</seg>
<seg id="14">It cuts your rotations for a start," Malthouse said.</seg>
<seg id="15">If you lose certain players, and both of them were medium players that go through the middle, then it throws you about a bit.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought the boys fought it out fantastically.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's easy to turn your toes up.</seg>
<seg id="18">Carlton struggled to find a commanding presence in the forward line until Lachie Henderson (three goals) caught fire in the final term.</seg>
<seg id="19">With Matthew Kreuzer, Robbie Warnock and Shaun Hampson all forced to stay on the ground at the same time, Malthouse said it took time for the Blues to find the right structure after the injury onslaught.</seg>
<seg id="20">"You've got to re-jig it and we were left with talls and when you've got to keep rotating talls and find spots for them... it doesn't allow you to have the fexlibility when you lose two medium players," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Malthouse said Henderson "played well back and he certainly played well forward."</seg>
<seg id="22">The veteran coach, who had a look of anger in the rooms after the final siren, appeared to lash suspended forward Jarrad Waite as they briefly crossed paths.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Losing players through suspension is almost a waste," Malthouse said later.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's like getting a parking fine.</seg>
<seg id="25">All you do is pay your money out and you think 'What am I getting back for it?</seg>
<seg id="26">Satisfaction of seeing some bloke in a grey hat being happy with himself.</seg>
<seg id="27">And I'm not a bloke with a grey hat I can tell you.</seg>
<seg id="28">No, I don't particularly like losing players through suspension.</seg>
<seg id="29">Malthouse would not discuss the availability of Ellard and Yarran, but both will almost certainly miss this week.</seg>
<seg id="30">Jamison would also appear to be in serious doubt.</seg>
<seg id="31">Malthouse would not comment on Eddie Betts' high hit on Nathan Wright, which will surely attract the attention of the match review panel.</seg>

<seg id="1">HIV vaccine possible after scientific breakthrough, study claims</seg>
<seg id="2">None of the HIV vaccines tested so far has come close to providing adequate protection thanks to the challenges posed by the envelope protein, known as Env.</seg>
<seg id="3">Env's structure is so complex and delicate, scientists have found it difficult to get the protein in a form that is suitable for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to understand it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Andrew Ward, of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), explained: "It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it's on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable."</seg>
<seg id="5">In the study, researchers created a version of the Env three-component structure that has the stability and other properties needed for atomic-resolution imaging, but that retains virtually all the structures found on Env.</seg>
<seg id="6">Using cutting-edge imaging methods, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography the researchers were able to look at the new Env.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was the first ever study of Env, and both methods resolved the structure to a finer level of detail than has been reported before.</seg>
<seg id="8">The study for Science Express revealed how Env assembles and undergoes shape changes during infection, and showed how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses - such as flu and Ebola.</seg>
<seg id="9">Professor Ian Wilson, of TSRI, said: "Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits; but we've needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor John Moore, of Cornell University who helped with the study, said: "Now we all need to harness this new knowledge to design and test next-generation trimers and see if we can induce the broadly active neutralising antibodies an effective vaccine is going to need."</seg>

<seg id="2">The number of people affected increases every year in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, tests in 2002 confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121 and in 2010 there were already 180.</seg>

<seg id="1">As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough.</seg>
<seg id="2">But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="5">Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great double act."</seg>
<seg id="10">They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.</seg>
<seg id="12">Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="13">The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mrs Howells said: "The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping."</seg>
<seg id="15">He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after.</seg>
<seg id="17">The way he has started he'll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I'm sure he'll do well.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony."</seg>
<seg id="19">They are a great team together.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring.</seg>
<seg id="21">They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm sure Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says</seg>
<seg id="2">Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country's north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.</seg>
<seg id="21">A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."</seg>
<seg id="22">It added that, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."</seg>
<seg id="23">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I salute the fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," the watchdog's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="31">The cause of the blast was not known, he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">St Kilda president Peter Summers has denied a personality clash led to the sacking of the AFL club's head coach Scott Watters on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Summers said the club has "had a tough few years" and the decision to sack Watters was not an easy decision but the result of a considered process.</seg>
<seg id="4">Summers said the rationale for the sacking would remain confidential between the Board and Watters.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he rejected any suggestion a personality clash between the club's head of football Chris Pelchen and Watters was behind the axing, saying it was "not a factor."</seg>
<seg id="6">There is speculation that former Port Adelaide premiership coach Mark Williams, head of development at Richmond, is a strong contender to replace Watters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Summers said the club had a list of potential new head coaches to sift through but insisted none had yet been approached.</seg>
<seg id="8">Watters inherited an ageing list from Ross Lyon, who made a shock move to Fremantle after the 2011 season.</seg>
<seg id="9">Watters guided the Saints to ninth in his first season last year.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this year, they came 16th with just five wins.</seg>
<seg id="11">They have since lost star player Nick Dal Santo, who switched to North Melbourne as a free agent.</seg>
<seg id="12">That came a year after they lost another star Brendon Goddard to Essendon as a free agent.</seg>
<seg id="13">Watters had been contracted for next year, but had been keen to have his term extended beyond that period.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sacking continues a period of upheaval at the Saints.</seg>
<seg id="15">Chief executive Michael Nettlefold recently announced he was quitting, although he will stay until the club can find a replacement.</seg>
<seg id="16">Summers was recently voted in to replace former president Greg Westaway.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Saints also lost football manager Greg Hutchison, while it was announced on Thursday that assistant coach Dean Laidley had switched to Carlton.</seg>
<seg id="18">St Kilda have also traded away their talented young No.1 ruckman Ben McEvoy to Hawthorn to bolster their draft position as they rebuild their playing list.</seg>

<seg id="7">Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like sci-fi films which I consider modern, dreamlike fairy tales.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gravity is no exception, although it gives appearance as a "physically realistic" performance.</seg>
<seg id="9">It isn’t, but that doesn’t mean it was bad.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really enjoyed it.</seg>
<seg id="11">You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock’s hair, which somehow doesn’t float in zero gravity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station move in significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some viewers are reproaching the film for the unrealistic effect and the behaviour of fire in general in zero gravity.</seg>
<seg id="14">They also say the space suits would not withstand such blows.</seg>
<seg id="15">The heroes of Gravity often collide with various objects and the clothes withstand everything without much problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">The storyline was not spared criticism either.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to some discussions, such an extensive tragedy in Earth’s orbit is unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="18">They also wonder why the doctor was sent to space to fix the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="19">People in forums also argue about the ropes’ "unrealistic" behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="20">They apparently look as if they were designed for bungee jumping.</seg>
<seg id="21">Marcel Grün (director of the Prague Observatory and Planetarium): I have only seen it so far on a wide screen, but I can definitely say I was enchanted.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am glad it wasn’t a documentary but science fiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">And in that kind of story, the author is entitled (almost obliged) not to stick firmly to reality.</seg>
<seg id="24">"More than the inconsistencies you mentioned, what concerned me was how the space station was shown three times with a deteriorating level of technology (the last time the Chinese one)."</seg>
<seg id="25">"After all, it will be the Chinese one only at the end of the decade and it will probably look better than it is in the film."</seg>
<seg id="26">Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic):  In computer-generated scenes the authors have very successfully tried not to break physical laws, and so the natural-science orientated viewer can appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and crashes, the moment of  movement ,to use terminology of physics, is quite correctly preserved, the view of Earth from space is also very realistic including the thin atmospheric shell and the aurora flickering in the polar regions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Inconsistencies will definitely be found on closer examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, for example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit in some scenes appears in reverse than how it should be in reality (from west to east).</seg>
<seg id="29">Jiří Štěpán (employee at the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): The filmmakers adapted some things to their needs, but I saw no major or shocking violations against logic or natural laws in the film and in comparison with other films with a similar focus, it is clear that the filmmakers did their best to make the events seem credible.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of the moments that do not make sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope has a different orbit than the ISS.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a result, they have a significantly different relative speed and the rescue operation could not actually have gone the way it was shown in the film.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also, in the moment of separating Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the whole ISS rotated, so it is not actually clear what the origin of the strength acting on Kowalski was, which forced both actors to let go at the moment when they were not moving against each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another independence scare story.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, a non-story, then.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the "independence means passport controls" canard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.</seg>
<seg id="31">Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where does this leave Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 13:13</seg>
<seg id="3">The Guinness Book of Records has been asked to authenticate the record</seg>
<seg id="4">A former bank manager has claimed to have broken the blind water speed world record by travelling at more than 93mph.</seg>
<seg id="5">If confirmed, it would mean Mike Newman holds the blind land and water speed records simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 52-year-old, from Manchester, sped across Torquay harbour in a Formula 1 powerboat.</seg>
<seg id="7">He broke the blind land speed record in September by driving at an average speed of 186mph in a Porsche.</seg>
<seg id="8">The previous blind water speed record stood at 91mph, set by former soldier Mark Threadgold in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Newman steered the £300,000 boat, called Silverline, while international powerboat racer Drew Langdon manned the throttle and directed him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Unbelievable experience</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Newman, who was born blind, said: "I'm so pleased that we have managed to stick to our guns, despite all the dreadful weather."</seg>
<seg id="12">""Silverline has been prepared now for quite a long time, we've been talking about it for many, many months, and today it has all come together.</seg>
<seg id="13">With Drew's help and courage, we've been very successful and I've experienced an unbelievable experience.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Newman made two runs in opposite directions, going at an average speed in excess of 93.5 mph.</seg>
<seg id="15">Data on the record will be sent to the Guinness Book of Records to authenticate.</seg>
<seg id="16">He hopes the event will raise awareness of his Speed of Sight charity, which encourages disabled people to get involved in motor sport.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Newman now hopes to fly a jet at supersonic speeds.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are a lot of dream stealers out there.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You have to hang on to your dreams and keep going until you get them," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry admits: Spying has gone too far!</seg>
<seg id="2">The United States have sometimes gone "too far", admitted John Kerry, chief of American diplomacy, according to the AFP agency, in a video conference between Washington and London.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gathering information, however, according to the minister, has served to prevent terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">The "first admission from Washington" according to AFP was made in the middle of intense controversy on both sides of the Atlantic due to the scandalous revelations about mass data monitoring by America’s National Security Agency (NSA), with US allies also becoming a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In some cases, I acknowledge, as has the President (Barack Obama), that some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to make sure that that doesn’t happen in the future," said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the interview, however, he mostly defended current practice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Data gathering is in his opinion necessary in the fight against terrorism and preventing attacks such as the attacks on 11 September 2001 in the USA, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We have prevented aeroplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans," emphasised Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, he again admitted that data gathering "in some cases have gone too far."</seg>
<seg id="10">The scandal around US intelligence, which allegedly monitored hundreds of millions of telephone calls, broke out in Europe this month.</seg>
<seg id="11">Amongst other things, it showed that the Americans even monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="12">European leaders did not hide their indignation and some of them called on the European Union to try and reach an agreement with the United States which would prohibit or significantly restrict the monitoring.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for a way of life", author says.</seg>
<seg id="2">Tales of Thor could show "brute strength is no match for subtle trickery," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saying many of the myths would be "far too wild, far too scandalous and in some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore already has a part in education," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added authors and teachers being "overtly didactic" is a "total switch-off" for children, with messages being "subliminated" in enjoyable stories.</seg>
<seg id="7">Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as writing the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight."</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending, but that there is an innate sense of good and evil.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kim Kardashian shows off her massive engagement ring after accepting rapper boyfriend Kanye West's surprise marriage proposal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Picture: Instagram/Jonathan Cheban Source: Instagram</seg>
<seg id="4">KIM Kardashian and Kanye West sued a co-founder of YouTube claiming he violated a confidentiality agreement by posting a video of the couple's marriage proposal to his new video-sharing website.</seg>
<seg id="5">The couple's lawsuit states Chad Hurley wasn't invited to the elaborate October 21 proposal at San Francisco's AT&T Park, but was allowed to stay because he signed an agreement not to post any video or images from the event.</seg>
<seg id="6">West allowed other cameras to film the event for possible broadcast on E!</seg>
<seg id="7">Entertainment Television, home to his fiancee's show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, according to the suit.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hurley posted a fuzzy two-and-a-half minute long video on his new website MixBit, that showed rapper West proposing to Kardashian while an orchestra played.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video also showed the ensuing celebration with Kardashian's family and invited guests toasting the newly-engaged couple.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kardashian and West are seeking unspecified damages from Hurley and his company, Avos Systems.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Exclusive rights, such as those sold by plaintiffs to publication of video of the event, are particularly valuable," the lawsuit states.</seg>
<seg id="12">If people violate these rights ... they are of substantially diminished value.</seg>
<seg id="13">A message sent through MixBit seeking comment from Hurley was not immediately returned.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rapper Kanye West speaks during the 17th Annual Hollywood Film Awards Gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, just hours before his surprise, over-the-top proposal to Kim Kardashian.</seg>
<seg id="15">West proposed to Kardashian on her 33rd birthday; the couple's first child North West was born in June.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawsuit was first reported by celebrity website TMZ.</seg>
<seg id="17">The lawsuit comes as West postponed the rest of his Yeezus tour after a 60-foot (18-metre) LED screen used during his shows was damaged.</seg>
<seg id="18">A representative for the rapper says a truck that carried the screen was in an accident on Wednesday that "damaged the gear beyond repair."</seg>
<seg id="19">The truck was on its way to Vancouver.</seg>
<seg id="20">The rep said in a statement that it would be "impossible" to put on a show until the screen is repaired.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yesterday's show in Vancouver and next week's shows in Denver and Minneapolis were postponed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The West rep planned to provide an update later on any new dates.</seg>
<seg id="23">West's tour kicked off this month in Seattle.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Observer Effect ...</seg>
<seg id="3">Ellen Fanning / Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="4">ELLEN Fanning's problematic interview with Dan Aykroyd may be her last as host of The Observer Effect with SBS yesterday confirming the program is "under review."</seg>
<seg id="5">Two weeks after Fanning's interview with Aykroyd prompted the Hollywood star to frustratedly denounce the well-regarded interviewer on the streets of Artarmon as a "f***ing hosebag," television sources yesterday confirmed the program, which has struggled to find an audience during its first season out, will likely not be on air in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="6">This comes on the back of grocery store Coles' admitting it "may" have consulted the program's producers after Coles CEO Ian McLeod was grilled by Fanning earlier in the series over the supermarket's decision to drop the price of milk in supermarkets to $1 a litre.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was yesterday suggested that Coles passed on their displeasure to The Observer Effect co-production partner Shine, which receives lucrative sponsorship from the company on another of its shows, Masterchef.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shine had nothing to say on the subject yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dan Aykroyd erupted after he was interviewed by Ellen Fanning on "The Observer Effect."</seg>
<seg id="10">Picture: SBS Source: Supplied</seg>
<seg id="11">Dan Aykroyd had Ellen Fanning in stitches during the interview.</seg>
<seg id="12">There have been whispers in the industry in recent weeks that The Observer Effect - which largely was designed to fill the void left by Andrew Denton's Enough Rope - failed from the outset to establish the right tone with studio guests.</seg>
<seg id="13">Insiders said this was largely because Fanning, a one-time ABC radio reporter and presenter who sealed her reputation for asking tough questions while working for the Nine Network's 60 Minutes and A Current Affair - and later as host of Nightline and the acclaimed Sunday program - was regarded by producers as being "too serious" for the program.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The program's producers were after a lighter touch - something more akin to what Andrew Denton, a former comedy writer, achieved on Enough Rope," said one insider.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dan Aykroyd wasn't smiling after he locked horns with Ellen Fanning.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dan Aykroyd was in town to promote his vodka brand Crystal Head Vodka.</seg>
<seg id="17">Picture: Jake Nowakowski Source: News Limited</seg>
<seg id="18">Ellen couldn't help asking the tough questions of people who were expecting a softer treatment - they hadn't come in to receive a grilling about policy, strategic failures and corporate slip-ups.</seg>
<seg id="19">A fine political reporter, Fanning is said to have fallen out of favour with producers wanting something "light and bright" where Fanning wanted political guests.</seg>
<seg id="20">Producers at Shine recently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yesterday a SBS spokesman said: "As previously stated The Observer Effect has only recently aired the season finale, it is under review and we are still working through the full slate of 2014 shows."</seg>
<seg id="22">Coles has no impact or influence on our programming decisions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Aykroyd waxes lyrical about the 'legendary' properties of his vodka brand, Crystal Head.</seg>

<seg id="2">Breaking News SportNationalSportCricket</seg>
<seg id="3">November 1, 2013 - 3:42PM</seg>
<seg id="4">Queenslander Peter Forrest beat illness and South Australia's bowlers to score a gallant century on day three of the Sheffield Shield match in Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="5">In reply to SA's 387 all out, the Bulls were 4-315 at tea on Friday's third day with Forrest unbeaten on 104 and Chris Hartley not out 46.</seg>
<seg id="6">Redbacks captain Johan Botha has taken all four wickets to fall.</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Queensland's grinding pursuit of innings points - they have batted 117 overs so far - Forrest reached his ton with a six, then a four, from the legspin of Adam Zampa.</seg>
<seg id="8">Forrest battled stomach illness which has affected four of his teammates, and frequently was on his haunches between deliveries and at breaks in overs.</seg>
<seg id="9">But his concentration didn't waver despite suffering an illness which caused his captain James Hopes to be a late withdrawal and also hampered Hartley, Greg Moller and Ben Cutting.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Bulls have lost just one wicket on Friday, when Botha ended the painstaking innings of opener Nathan Reardon (67 from 203 balls).</seg>
<seg id="11">Reardon became Botha's fourth victim when he prodded forward defensively to an offspinner before lunch and was smartly caught by Tom Cooper moving low at short point.</seg>
<seg id="12">Forrest and Hartley batted through the middle session, with Forrest receiving a let-off with his score on 72 when Michael Klinger at slip turfed a low chance from Zampa's bowling.</seg>

<seg id="1">Been and Gone: Smokey and the Bandit director and the world's tallest dog</seg>
<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 00:25 By Nick Serpell Obituary Editor, BBC News</seg>
<seg id="3">Our regular column covering the deaths of significant - but lesser-reported - people in the past month.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his career as a stuntman, Hal Needham broke his back twice, punctured a lung, damaged his hearing and lost a number of teeth.</seg>
<seg id="5">A former paratrooper, he appeared in many films including Chinatown, How the West Was Won, Blazing Saddles and Little Big Man as well as countless TV westerns.</seg>
<seg id="6">He often worked as a stunt double for the actor Burt Reynolds and the two became close friends.</seg>
<seg id="7">When Needham wrote a screenplay about a trucker's attempt to smuggle beer into Georgia entitled Smokey and the Bandit, Reynolds agreed to star in the film and persuaded Needham to direct.</seg>
<seg id="8">The duo worked together on subsequent films, Hooper, The Cannonball Run, and Stroker Ace.</seg>
<seg id="9">Needham put much of his money into a 1979 attempt to break the sound barrier in a car dubbed Budweiser Rocket.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, claims the car had been successful were dismissed, as no independent verification had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="11">The doner kebab has long been the food of choice for many a late-night reveller and Kadir Nurman was a pioneer in popularising the dish.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea of grilling huge lumps of meat on a rotating skewer was not new but Nurman had the idea of selling the sliced meat and salad sandwiched between flatbread so that it could be eaten on the move.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Turkish immigrant to Germany, his stall became a popular place for Berliners intent on finding something to offset the effects of large quantities of beer.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many other people have been credited with the idea, but Nurman's achievements were recognised by the Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">The dish is popular throughout Europe with UK consumers preferring it to be topped with a hot chilli sauce.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nurman was somewhat disparaging about modern versions, claiming they had too many ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="17">Comedienne Marcia Wallace provided the voice of Edna Krabappel, the jaded teacher in the cartoon series, The Simpsons.</seg>
<seg id="18">The character's continuing, and often fruitless, search for a romantic relationship was a recurring theme.</seg>
<seg id="19">Wallace joined the programme in 1990 and such was her impact that she won an Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over performance two years later.</seg>
<seg id="20">She cut her teeth on the stage and TV before landing the role of Carol Kester, the acerbic receptionist in the Bob Newhart Show, which gained huge audiences on US television.</seg>
<seg id="21">She followed that up with three decades of appearances on game shows as well as guest parts in a number of series including Taxi, The Brady Bunch and Magnum PI.</seg>
<seg id="22">She never lost touch with the theatre and appeared in a string of performances including The Odd Couple, Steel Magnolias and the Vagina Monologues.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the world of the future wars will no longer exist but there will be Rollerball.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such was the vision of novelist William Harrison in his short story Roller Ball Murder.</seg>
<seg id="25">It describes a time when giant corporations run a world where individual achievement is stifled.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are no conflicts and all team games have been replaced by a bloody sport called Rollerball, where the aim is to kill your opponents.</seg>
<seg id="27">A film adaptation was released in 1975, directed by Norman Jewison, with Harrison writing the screenplay.</seg>
<seg id="28">Another of his books, Burton and Speake, based on the search for the source of the Nile, was also filmed as Mountains of the Moon.</seg>
<seg id="29">Harrison was a great believer in encouraging young writers and founded a creative writing course at the University of Arkansas where he moved in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="30">He won a number of awards for his writing including a Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in Fiction.</seg>
<seg id="31">Jillian Lane used a team of "spirit guides" to bolster her claim to be Hollywood's number one celebrity psychic.</seg>
<seg id="32">She became known for her friendship with Michael Jackson, who reportedly invited her to Los Angeles after ringing her premium rate psychic line for advice.</seg>
<seg id="33">Over the ensuing years, until Jackson's death in 2009, Lane met regularly with the star, usually slipping into his mansion in the small hours to avoid the press pack parked outside.</seg>
<seg id="34">She also described how she and Jackson would drive around Beverly Hills in the middle of the night while he poured out all his problems to her.</seg>

<seg id="37">In the world of dogs they didn't come any bigger than Giant George, a Great Dane from Arkansas who was officially the world's tallest dog.</seg>
<seg id="38">Standing 43" (110cm) from paw to shoulder, his record height was officially certified by Guinness World Records after a representative was sent to George's home with a tape measure in 2010."</seg>
<seg id="39">He became something of a canine celebrity, with his own website and a legion of fans.</seg>
<seg id="40">Flown to appear on Oprah Winfrey's show, George was given three seats on the plane so he could sprawl at full length.</seg>
<seg id="41">He needed his celebrity earnings to pay the bill for his dog food, 110lbs of which he consumed every month.</seg>

<seg id="1">Leaving formula</seg>
<seg id="2">"I definitely cannot switch off the tap in terms of racing" â€¦ Mark Webber.</seg>
<seg id="3">Photo: Neale Haynes</seg>
<seg id="4">In a world dominated by ego - where an elite group of men are compensated for risking their lives every second weekend by the trappings of wealth, glamour and fame - the down-to-earth Mark Webber doesn't fit the stereotype of a formula one playboy.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he certainly looks like one; his sunken cheeks further pronouncing his chiselled jaw-line, his trademark dark stubble contrasting against his gleaming white smile, his lean marathon-runner frame.</seg>
<seg id="6">During a recent visit to Sydney from his UK base in Buckinghamshire, he meets me wearing a light grey shirt, rolled-up sleeves, sneakers and casual- fit jeans.</seg>
<seg id="7">"G'day, mate," he says with the twang of an outback publican, despite having lived in Europe since leaving his home town of Queanbeyan at 18 to chase a boyhood dream of racing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Webber initially struggled to climb out of the junior ranks, battling against a lack of support from corporate Australia and a tide of wealthy European kids whose parents could buy their way into the best teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">But his self-belief - and the faith of his manager and partner Ann Neal - remained, and Webber eventually fought his way into formula one.</seg>
<seg id="10">There, for the past 11 years, he has become one of Australia's most successful grand prix drivers (behind only former world champions Sir Jack Brabham and Alan Jones) with nine victories, 39 podiums and 12 pole positions from a total of 214 grand prix starts.</seg>
<seg id="11">After November 24, however, Webber will no longer be a formula one driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Brazilian Grand Prix will be his final race at the pinnacle of motorsport.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unlike some of his past rivals - including the seven-time world champion, Michael Schumacher, whose three-year return to racing tarnished his legendary status - Webber is retiring on his own terms with the knowledge that his motivation has peaked, his youthful fearlessness has waned and, since the introduction a few years ago of tyres designed to wear out quickly, the challenge and exhilaration of driving a grand prix car has been eroded.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I have never struggled with motivation and I couldn't comprehend how other athletes were saying they had to keep their motivation to remain on the highest stage," he says.</seg>
<seg id="15">I thought, 'What the hell, how could you lose your motivation?'</seg>
<seg id="16">But then you start to think, 'Well I've done this a long time and I'm going through the drill of it all again; the never-ending travel and watching my weight for 11 months of the year.'</seg>
<seg id="17">It gets harder and harder.</seg>
<seg id="18">No one else can do the training but me.</seg>
<seg id="19">No one else has to refuse that dessert but me.</seg>
<seg id="20">That has been endless, and it gets to you after a while.</seg>
<seg id="21">Outside observers of the sport may speculate that Webber's fractious relationship with his German team mate - three-time world champion Sebastian Vettel - played a part in his decision to walk away.</seg>
<seg id="22">The pair have clashed on and off the track for the past six years, starting and finishing with Vettel stealing almost certain victories from the Australian; the first when the German crashed into Webber while driving behind a safety car in torrential rain during the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and the latter during this year's Malaysian Grand Prix, when Vettel disobeyed team instructions and overtook Webber to win the race.</seg>
<seg id="23">But although he admits Vettel will likely never make his Christmas card list, you get the sense that he enjoyed being challenged - mentally, physically and emotionally - by the German, and leaves formula one a stronger and faster driver than he would have been otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I think I will be remembered as someone who was pretty hard yet fair on the circuit and made his presence felt," he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">You could call me a 'nearly man', as I could have certainly got a bit more out of my career.</seg>
<seg id="26">But I think most people will look at me as a pretty fair competitor - that's how I want to be remembered.</seg>
<seg id="27">He has relished the camaraderie with his team mates who have stood by him through his racing career.</seg>
<seg id="28">We've had some good fights - off and on the track ...</seg>
<seg id="29">It's been a journey from boys to men; I will miss some of that.</seg>
<seg id="30">But nothing is forever, so you have to move on to the next chapter.</seg>
<seg id="31">Having not been forced into retirement, either through lack of results or injury, Webber is still a highly regarded property.</seg>
<seg id="32">He was courted to join Fernando Alonso at Ferrari for this season, but "we couldn't agree on the terms," and was likely to be offered another contract with Red Bull for next season.</seg>
<seg id="33">That was before he handed in his resignation on the eve of this year's British Grand Prix at the Silverstone circuit, giving his team boss just five minutes notice that he had signed a deal to lead Porsche's return to the famous Le Mans 24-hour sports car race from next year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Both were brave and bullish moves; the former an obvious retaliation for being treated with such disrespect at the same venue two years earlier, when he won the first of his two British GPs despite Vettel receiving preferential treatment; the latter sees Webber return to the famous French racetrack that almost claimed his life in 1999 when his Mercedes sports car flipped into the air, on two separate occasions, at more than 350km/h.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The sports cars at the time were super dangerous, as there were a lot of cars flipping, but I can't wrap myself in cotton wool," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">I definitely cannot switch off the tap in terms of the whole racing aspect and getting my feet out of bed with that competitive urge ...</seg>
<seg id="37">I know it will have to end one day, but there's still plenty left in me.</seg>
<seg id="38">He's looking forward to spending more time with family in Australia, to "give a bit back, because it's been pretty selfish over the past 15 years - it's been all about me - and I can switch it off a little now."</seg>
<seg id="39">Not completely ... but just a little bit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Film review: Milius (15) - Reviews - Films - The Independent</seg>
<seg id="2">There is a fascinating paradox in the story of John Milius, the bombastic Hollywood screenwriter and director.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was punished for success - something which rarely happens in Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="4">His 1984 hit Red Dawn was considered so offensively jingoistic that his career all but stalled in its wake.</seg>
<seg id="5">But this documentary makes a case for Milius' key role in the Easy Riders, Raging Bulls generation.</seg>
<seg id="6">He wrote Apocalypse Now and Dirty Harry's famous "Make my day" line, and, bizarrely, helped originate UFC cage fighting.</seg>
<seg id="7">The film goes easy on his nutty political views and machismo.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is also a nagging feeling that Milius (who suffered a debilitating stroke just before work on the doc began) has achieved only a fraction of what he should have.</seg>

<seg id="2">A painting that British street artist Banksy originally bought for $50 (£31) in a New York charity shop has now been sold, after he made his own marks on it, for $615,000 (£383,400) in an online auction after 138 bids.</seg>
<seg id="3">The profits will go to homeless charity Housing Works in the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">Banksy first revealed the piece, which he called The Banality of The Banality of Evil, on Tuesday in the Housing Works store on New York's 23rd Street where he originally bought it before adding a Nazi officer sitting on a bench facing the bucolic landscape scene.</seg>
<seg id="5">The painting was anonymously donated to the charity shop, and staff received a phone call shortly after that explainting its authenticity.</seg>
<seg id="6">Part of Banksy's month-long residency in New York, where the artist unveiled a new piece everyday, The Banality of The Banality of Evil was explained on his website as "a thrift store painting vandalised then re-donated to the thrift store."</seg>
<seg id="7">He announced he would auction it the next day, and the sale closed on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="8">Housing Works officials are yet to verify the final bid, but have said that "100 per cent of the proceeds from the auction will go towards lifesaving services for people living with and effected by HIV/AIDS, including housing, medical care, job training, legal services, and case management."</seg>

<seg id="2">1 November 2013 Last updated at 16:59</seg>
<seg id="3">A drone strike targeting a vehicle used by Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud has killed five people, intelligence sources say.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four missiles were fired on the vehicle in the Dande Darpa Khel area of North Waziristan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two of Mehsud's bodyguards were reportedly among the dead.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mehsud has a $5m FBI bounty on his head and is thought to be responsible for the deaths of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pakistan's PM Nawaz Sharif has urged US President Obama to halt drone strikes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The attack comes on the same day that the Pakistani government announced it was about to send a delegation to North Waziristan to try to get peace negotiations with the Taliban under way.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Sharif had pledged to talk with the Taliban to try to end its campaign of violence, which has left thousands dead in bombings and shootings across the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The attacks by unmanned US aircraft have been a critical source of tension in the relationship between the countries and came up amid wide-ranging talks between Mr Sharif and Mr Obama in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are also deeply unpopular with the Pakistani public, and Pakistan has consistently stated that they violate its sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last week an American newspaper said it had obtained secret US documents revealing that senior Pakistani government officials have for years known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes.</seg>

<seg id="1">NYC Museum With Historic Past Gets Major Makeover</seg>
<seg id="2">The Queens Museum of Art for decades had to work within the confines of a building that originally was constructed as a pavilion for the 1939 World's Fair.</seg>
<seg id="3">But no longer.</seg>
<seg id="4">A nearly 3-year, $68 million expansion and renovation project has created a light-filled, airy and spacious environment that doubles its size.</seg>
<seg id="5">The transformed museum has been rebranded the Queens Museum to reflect its mission of producing world-class exhibitions of contemporary art as well as programming and installations that examine important issues through objects of art.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was designed by Grimshaw Architects, a British-based firm selected through the city's Design Excellence Program.</seg>
<seg id="7">It opens to the public on Nov.</seg>
<seg id="8">Visitors enter a 48-foot-tall atrium dominated by a monumental chandelier-like canopy of glass panels programmable with LED lighting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This expansive space features changing and commissioned works of art and is ringed by six galleries.</seg>
<seg id="10">One holds the museum's crown jewel: a Robert Moses-commissioned 9,335-square-foot panorama of New York City, the world's largest full-scale architectural model.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nine artist studios, educational classrooms, a gift shop and cafeteria also have been added.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 105,000-square-foot museum, founded in 1972, sits in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, steps from the National Tennis Center.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has two glass-facade entrances.</seg>
<seg id="14">One faces the park and the 1964 World's Fair Unisphere.</seg>
<seg id="15">The other fronts the Grand Central Parkway in plain view of thousands of motorists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The city-owned building now has room for another spectacular model - a 500-square-foot, 27-piece relief map of the New York City watershed, produced for the 1939 World's Fair and shown only one other time, in 1948 for the city's Golden Anniversary Exposition.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the 1940s, the building served as host to the U.N. General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The People's United Nations," an inaugural performance piece by Pedro Reyes, pays homage to that.</seg>
<seg id="19">The building will convene mock assemblies with visitors acting as U.N. delegates, solving world problems using alternative resolution techniques drawn from theater, marriage counseling and psychology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other inaugural exhibitions include "Andy Warhol's 13 Most Wanted Men and the 1964 World's Fair."</seg>
<seg id="21">Visitors can also take in the museum's celebrated Tiffany glass (Tiffany Studios were located in Corona, Queens) and massive World's Fair memorabilia collections.</seg>
<seg id="22">The expansion became possible when an ice-skating rink that occupied the southern half of the building relocated elsewhere in the park.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We were bursting at the seams," said Tom Finkelpearl, the museum's executive director.</seg>
<seg id="24">This gave us the opportunity to have a space that reflects our mission.</seg>
<seg id="25">We say our one-word mission statement is 'openness.'</seg>
<seg id="26">We now have a beautiful, wide-open, spacious central space to open up to the public.</seg>
<seg id="27">He said officials at the museum, which is funded by the borough, city and state, hopes to double the number of visitors in the first year to 200,000.</seg>
<seg id="28">By 2015, a new 5,500-square-foot Queens Library branch will be part of the museum, allowing the curators and librarians to continue their collaboration on education programming and books that reflect the museum's exhibitions.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)</seg>
<seg id="2">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win," Glading said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.</seg>
<seg id="26">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
<seg id="38">But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.</seg>
<seg id="41">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>
